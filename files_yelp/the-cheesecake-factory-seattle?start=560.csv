Drew G.,"Seattle, WA",31,93,34,2.0,9/18/2008,"Agreeing with some and disagreeing with some is how i view this place. The service is super slow and food takes forever to get there. the food is really good though, but would be better with sweet potato fries. MMM... sweet potato fries...."
Johnny D.,"Spring Valley, NV",1,22,,4.0,7/13/2011,"Food is so-so..actually I can't remember. But the waitress was very kute and kind. So is this review biased...well... I have never been to Hooters, but if you have - try to rate the restaurant once, then again without the girls - and compare your results."
Janell W.,"Sacramento, CA",89,90,34,3.0,1/12/2011,the service was okay... and nothing to write home about. I did like the atmosphere...
Jennilee B.,"Seattle, WA",162,191,5,5.0,2/21/2008,"It's 9pm and when my girlfriends and I are upset, annoyed, and itching to get ""it"" out of our system, we head here. Apparently I was all of the above, plus I was hungry- still. We just came from Palace Kitchen, skipped dessert there, and decided that TCF was the surefire, no disappointment place to go.  No disappointments here- even after we stayed til 11pm talking our heads off. Our server was so nice and super sweet- and I am going to stress and put a major emphasis on SO NICE/SUPER SWEET. She refilled our coffees even before it got to the halfway point including the cream. (I had about 10 cups) And when I was gabbing away and barely touched my cheesecake/brownie/german chocolate cake with whipped cream confection she asked me ""Do you like it or I can get you something else?""  [Other servers take super offense if you don't eat the food as if they made it themselves!] Anyhow, I don't know if I'd order the ""cavity on the plate cake"" again though (on the menu its called Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake). I should've ordered my regular Fresh Banana Creme Cheesecake- If you like Banana Creme Pie, you're going to love it- bananas, cheesecake, whipped cream YUM!"
Chani B.,"Seattle, WA",70,114,8,4.0,4/4/2007,"I know I know its a chain restaurant. Don't let the name fool you. Their menu could feed a small country. Kudos for the fried mac and cheese. I just need to know if we can knight the person who invented such pleasure? Can they be exempt from paying taxes or something,because this appetizer is sooooo good! I also like the orange chicken. Ok enough about me and my needs as a person. The low down This place is almost ALWAYS packed. Ive found that if you have a child in a stroller,people will let you sit down ( so cool). There's not that much seating,although you think there would b/c its across from the convention center,so all those folks will be there,too. The wait time seems the same no matter what day and time you go. They do not take reservations. Park at Pacific Place if you want a better rate as far as parking. Good luck finding street parking. The portion sizes are big ( umm is that why my butt is so big?) So bring a few friends and share. The cheesecake is good. My fav is the carrot cake,but Ive yet to have something I dislike here. The waitstaff is friendly and competent."
Brian M.,"Beaverton, OR",151,494,7,4.0,6/18/2008,Holy crap!  The lunch portions are so big...how can any normal human being eat a dinner portion. I had the pasta carbonara and it was excellent.  So nothing bad to say about this chain.
Gavin N.,"Bellevue, WA",461,642,382,2.0,5/21/2007,"This Cheesecake Factory has consistently better service than the Bellevue location. Food quality remains about the same, nothing to scream about, but you do get good quality food and large portions of it.  The atmosphere is elegant, relaxing, yet casual and fun at the same time. The only thing that typically sucks at any cheesecake factory is no reservations for any size party (read my review at Bellevue for a party of 25) and therefore frustrating long waits during peak dining times.   Anyway, of the 4-5 times I've been to this Cheesecake, the most recent was this weekend for my friend's 24th birthday. We had a group of 12 people (including my friend's father who flew in for the weekend all the way from Guam). Our total bill was a little over $200 on drinks and 1 cheesecake alone. Our servers/hosts/bartenders were very friendly/quick.  So why 2 stars?   Well at the start of the night the Busboy wasn't too friendly, we ignored it.  Later in the night he dropped a cheesecake that would've ended up in my friend's lap if she had not caught it, he threw her a towel w/no apologies or anything. As we left the establishment the same busboy through the window decided to give the finger to two girls (including my girlfriend) in our party and mouth the words ""F*ck you"" to our entire party.      What was a fun night for all of us quickly became very ugly. We spoke with the manager, who was very professional and understanding about the whole thing. The General Manager called us regarding the incident the next day (and claimed it was the busboy's last night), he asked what he could do to rectify the situation.  We asked not to be charged (we could've asked for a whole lot more), which he did (hence the two stars rather than one). The management did the best they could, but it will still be awhile before any of us can see ourselves back at Cheesecake Factory (at least in Seattle) after such an incident. ~G"
Me H.,"Seattle, WA",140,928,1020,3.0,2/22/2007,"I always get over whelmed when I come here.  And when I leave I always feel over stuffed.  The menu is HUGE and not in a good way, way too many items to pick from and the portions are bigger than the menu.  Even their lunch portions are HUGE.  And the wait, Holy Mother of Baby Jesus the wait is crazy, I was here this past Monday for lunch, arrived at 1:30 pm and still had a long wait, and I hate waiting especially when I'm hungry. Anyways the service was excellent, my diet coke never went empty which was good considering how salty my food was.  And one time I was here I got carded but my dining companion who was eleven years younger than me didn't get carded, the server said I looked young but he didn't.  For that comment alone I could give them five stars but I won't now if they offered half portions on all their food all the time I might consider."
Tony G.,"Seattle, WA",360,576,34,2.0,2/22/2007,"I had a below average plate of spaghetti here. I know I should of had a steak or burger or something else, but we were supposed to go to Bucca de Beppos but a friend decided she wanted to go here instead. Big mistake...though I think she was somewhat happy with her meal. I had the spaghetti bolognese, which is a meat sauce...that tasted like a big pile of nothing. Very bland. Not only that, they served penne instead of spaghetti noodles. I have nothing against against penne mind you, but with a meat sauce? Too much food. It is hard to believe that I can get so full from below average food, but somehow I managed. I guess it is the Italian in me. I finished a little more than half the plate and couldnt not finish the leftovers. I dont see myself going there again, but if I do I will try something else and modify this review.  Until then..... Rock!"
Amanda P.,"Seattle, WA",2,22,5,1.0,1/5/2008,"I wish I could give 0 stars! But alas 1 is what they get.  Last Sunday the fam and I went for brunch to use a gift card given to us for Christmas, and received the absolute worst service I've ever received at any restaurant before.  Brunch is not busy, so why such bad customer service? It's pretty bad when all the servers are standing in a circle in the middle of the restaurant making jokes. Others were in the corner gossiping loudly behind us or texting on their phones. Our server Lauren was pretty horrible, she didn't come to check on us once. I had to make eye contact with her to get her to come and give us our check. She received no tip, and we will not be going back again!"
John D.,"Palo Alto, CA",4,37,1,2.0,9/6/2010,"I've never understood the attraction of the Cheesecake Factory. The wait is far too long, the food is overpriced, and there's far too much of it. Perhaps it makes more sense out wherever it started."
Melissa H.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,230,11,3.0,11/21/2008,"Consistently good food, beautiful surroundings, huge selection, good hours.  This is your late night hangout so you don't have to hit up Denny's (well, unless it's 3am or something).  Great service. Greasy, overpriced, crowded, loud.  Not to mention this location has zero parking.  You have to teleport here."
Lis M.,"San Francisco, CA",15,115,6,2.0,1/6/2010,"I have nothing against chains that get it right, but the Cheesecake Factory is overhyped and underwhelming. I have eaten at the Cheesecake Factory twice now in two different cities and can not say I am impressed. Experience #1  I say overhyped, because the only other time I tried to eat at the Cheesecake Factory, was back seven or eight years ago when I lived in Sandy Eggo, and work told us they were treating us to Cheesecake Factory. And then....we arrived at the infamous Two Hour Lunch. And waited to be seated. And waited. And waited. And walked across the parking to the Costco, made a round of the free samples, came back, and waited some more. Woot. The boss had promised us and he'd obviously felt like we'd invested all that time in waiting, we might as well wait til we were seated. Which we were eventually, in the time that it takes solar systems to form and life to evolve and species to go extinct. I don't remember what I had except that it was boring and pasta-y and we'd taken so long getting to lunch that we didn't even have time for cheesecake.  Every time I'd go by a Cheesecake Factory, I'd always see a pile of people spilling out the doors, ALSO obviously waiting, and I'd want to yell at them, ""Flee, flee, while you still have years left in you!"" Experience #2 (Last night, Seattle) - My boyfriend and I are kicking around downtown Seattle, looking for a place to eat. We happen to walk by the Cheesecake Factory, and miracle of miracles, there's not a line. Holy shit. I tell The Boy that I still have yet to experience the cheesecake of the factory, and he says he once went years ago (and relates a similar story) and he hasn't had it either. So we relent, and see if they can seat us. And they totally can. (Cheesecake Factory Tip: Go on a Tuesday at 8.30 apparently.)  So we get seated, and the terminally perky waitress drops our menus down for us. I get a Flying Gorilla (a banana-chocolate drink, which is actually pretty good, and about the one part of the meal I enjoyed) and settle down to peruse the menu. My boyfriend makes the observation that the menu is HUGE, and he always gets nervous when he sees the menus of hugeness because half the time it means that all the appetisers and some of the other dishes are frozen in ginormous fridges in the back, because there's no way they can cook all of these on notice. This prognostication proves to be likely true, as my overly salty and processed Tex Mex egg rolls attest. It's hard to say about my mushroom soup, but it is very peppery to the point where the mushroom flavours are overwhelmed. I've even had awesome mushroom soup at a chain before and this wasn't it. The Boy gets some pasta dish which he describes as ""Very meh."" Oh, and I STILL don't know how the cheesecake was because we decided to cut our losses and pay the cheque instead of waiting for the dessert.  The service was okay, although the waitress seemed to have perfected the ""Wait til their mouths are full and then ask how it is"" technique. A tiny bit slow too. The food was a big meh, and at the prices, not so great.  The ambience feels kinda pretentious. And I can't believe that people wait in line to eat here. There's nothing I ate that wowed me enough to say, ""Well, I'd come back to get THAT."" It's like, you pay for the restaurant experience and end up with bar food--and if I wanted bar food, Six Arms is conveniently a few blocks up Pike. EDITED TO ADD: The Boy and I have since tried the Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake. We got a white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake to go, and brought it home. It was expensiveish but very delicious. Our guests also enjoyed it. So in that respect, I will say Cheesecake to Go: 4 stars.  (It still takes a while to wait for the cheesecake-to-go, and sometimes it is frozen rockhard, which means if you needed it for an event, you should plan a few hours for thawing.)   I remain staunch on the actual restaurant experience though. The non-cheesecake food is mediocre, and the restaurant is overhyped. That remains at a solid 2 stars."
Camille K.,"Alameda, CA",377,633,74,3.0,7/31/2008,"I threw all the money I saved by not having to cover my own air and hotel expenses into food, drinks and girlie things ALL for ME!  Hence, my visit to The Cheesecake Factory. I love the Mai Tai at The Cheesecake Factory (Sorry, William at Tango.  The Cheesecake Factory makes their Mai Tai a little sweeter and smoother.).  Desserts are delicious too!"
Darin P.,"Spokane, WA",34,51,1,4.0,4/26/2007,"While I can't say I've eaten everything on the menu, the items I have tried don't match the ""bland"" descriptions a few Yelpers use.  I find myself gravitating to the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and am always happy with my selection.  The Cajun Jambalaya is good (granted, I've had better elsewhere), and there are some good salad options.   This isn't the best food in town, but I like it for several reason.  1. I've found a menu item that I like that I can eat whenever I'm in a town with a CF.  2. I think the decor and ambiance is fun... though a bit noisy.  3. There is enough selection so that almost everyone can find something they like. I find it humorous that some complain about too large of portions.  A suggestion - 4 people, 2 or 3 entrees served family style, and a couple pieces of cheesecake for desert if you are so inclined.  Personally I've never been inclined to over-indulge on food I did't like, but I do usually eat my entire entree... but I blame myself, not the restaurant. The lines can be crazy, but I don't bother trying to go during the rush.  Lunch - 11:30.  Dinner - 4:30 or late and you are fine."
Courtney W.,"Annville, PA",317,160,43,4.0,12/13/2007,"One of the most magnificent  Cheesecake Factories I have ever been in, but then again, aren't they all like that? Great food, the service was so-so, but they were very busy. Loved the downtown Seattle location. And the good memories ..."
Shu Z.,"Seattle, WA",15,56,,3.0,5/7/2010,"I've been coming here for lunch quite a bit lately as its just across the street from where I work. The food is tasty enough, but they seem really unhealthy and are a little pricey too. Some of the staff here are really friendly, and service in general is good."
Joolie T.,"Brooklyn, NY",1067,1296,1004,5.0,6/4/2006,"ummmm YUM. hello? large selection of drinks, appetizers, sandwiches, salads, pastas, and the best.... CHEESECAKE!!! but people think it's just a cheesecake place, well.. you're wrong. this is a great place to bring all your friends for a hearty or festive meal. b/c there's something for everyone. i love the presentation of their meals. my fav. sandwich is their Shrimp Po-Boy. and their pasta... OMG so delicious. LOUISIANA CHICKEN PASTA!!!!! Parmesan Crusted Chicken Cutlets Served Over Pasta Tossed with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Style Sauce. holy moly. and the Thai lettuce wraps are cool to eat w/ friends. Orange Chicken is really good, too. it's not all greasy/oily. makes you feel like you're eating healthy. serious! it's braised, not deep fried like most orange chicken. it's an American twist on the chinese classic, but it's just right for my palette.  they generously top all their cheesecakes w/ mounds of whipped cream. and it's the good kind, not the Reddi Whip from Safeway, ya'll. unfortunately, you can feel yourself gaining weight as you take every bite of the dessert. haha. but it's soooooo good. try the White Chocolate Raspberry truffle, Banana, and Tiramisu cheesecake!"
Walla Walla M.,"Walla Walla, WA",0,5,,4.0,7/18/2013,Just what our family needed after an exhausting day site seeing in Seattle. We really enjoyed the food and the service was great. Perfect for my kids. All our meals were delish. My husband had some jambalaya dish that was to die for. Very good. We even visited the Cheesecake Factory a second time on our visit and once again had great food and service.
Katie S.,"Seattle, WA",204,94,1,3.0,4/9/2008,"Ive been here a handful of times over the years.  Each time I'm left pretty unimpressed with the food and prices.  I am however a sucker for their fried macaroni and cheese balls served with marinara sauce. But I am a cheese addict so thats explains that. Also their caramel cheesecake was to die for. Generally the servers are very nice and attentive. Those are all the compliments I can dig up for this place. The time I ordered a turkey burger the thing came dripping with grease for some reason and I got a huge stomach ache...wont be getting that again. Cons: The wait time can be a lot ridiculous and sometimes the bar is too crowded for everyone who's waiting. Advertisements in the menu just leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth and seems rather tacky to me. I'm paying money to eat here why are you shoving ADS in my face? Cant I sit down to dinner and relax and not be bombed by ads like I am most of the day? Clueless servers. The server had no clue what the prices on drinks were and had to ring over another server who was IFFY on the prices as well. Sad. Drink cost a TON here. $10 cosmo...yikes. Maybe ill grab drink else where. Bottom line, over priced for stuff thats not really worth it at all."
