Anita K.,"Toronto, Canada",70,385,280,2.0,10/2/2008,"Contrary to the name of the place - the cheesecake is really nothing to write home about.  I found that there really wasn't too much selection when it came to gluten free options on the menu - which was disappointing because I know so many people nowadays are finding out that they suffer from a gluten intolerance. Nonetheless they managed to whip something up in the kitchen that was ""gluten free"".... needless to say my friend was very sick that night, because there was some kind of contamination in the food!"
Manuela A.,"Seattle, WA",3,35,,5.0,4/21/2013,"this place is really fun to go too, i came here on my 21st birthday with my mom and sister and have a margarita :) the staff is always friendly and food is delicious, try one of their skinny salads, it's really yummy :)"
Kelsey F.,"Bothell, WA",95,228,,4.0,6/5/2008,"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, though I do like cheesecake... Okay - their cheesecake isn't bad.  Not at all. And their food, the one time I had a meal, wasn't bad either. The reason to go?  Their appetizers.  When I go these days, I don't order a meal, I order a few appetizers to split with my dining partner. In particular: -Ahi carpaccio - surprisingly cool and fresh tasting, and while people are wary of the raw in chain restaurants like this (understandably so), I've never gotten sick from this.  Never. (Did I just tempt the food-borne illness gods?  Damn.) -Fire-roasted fresh artichoke - the dining partner had never had fresh artichoke (horror!), so having something like this was the perfect introduction.  Artichokes, btw, are completely underrated. The third item we usually order rotates based on our mood.  If we've been drinking a bit, it's going to be fried.  (Wonder why fried food tastes so good post-alcohol.)  If we haven't, it'll be something light.  The thing is, I don't think people realize that there's really more to this place than meets the eye. So, 3.8 stars.  Might as well bump it on up, eh?"
Joyce D.,"Berkeley, CA",52,325,,3.0,10/18/2008,"Would be 4 stars if they didn't give us this mess up the seating So much to choose from... it took me a good half hour to choose from all the goodies. Decided to be adventurous with a Japanese eggplant, bleu cheese pizza with artichokes (i loooveee artichokes!). The boyfriend had steak with wasabi mashed potatoes.... mashed potatoes and wasabi? weird combo...just weird... blech. blech. BLECH. steak tasted like teriyaki and asparagus was fried perfectly. i guess they were trying some asian fusion with the wasabi/mashed potatoes, and trying to tempura-ify the asparagus (normally you don't get asparagus in your vegetable tempura at a japanese restaurant). they succeeded in some aspects, failed in others (i.e. mashed potatoes). blech. Drink menu is adorable!!! AND you can't taste any alcohol, just how I like it!! Although we had to wait 25 minutes, we were promptly seated after 25 and there was some sort of confusion but we ended up getting a great window seat with a good view of the downtown streets outside.  Bread was warm, soft, and tasty... hrmm just toasted perhaps? butter was soft but slightly cool and easily spreadable.  I love the people in Seattle, everyone is so nice! Even in downtown! The waiter was friendly and attentive, never had a problem about lack of water or ... anything... and asked us multiple times if everything was all right. The only qualm with him though was that when I couldn't finish my pizza, he smushed it into this tiny box and when I opened it later, it looked like someone had like, sat on it. Oh well... what can you do?"
Sasha R.,"Portland, OR",87,385,43,3.0,9/6/2008,"So... let me paint a little picture for you... 5 hours on a bus from Vancouver, BC, then seeing my lover off the to the train back to PDX, registering for a conference, and checking in to a hotel, all in a city I didn't really know. Enter the Cheesecake Factory, which I have never really been a big fan of,  HOWEVER it was directly between my hotel and the one my conference was at, so I figured what the heck. I was dining alone, so I got a seat at the bar and that's where the fun began.  I ordered a seared tuna salad, a glass of wine that my server recommended that was excellent and completely enjoyed being able to eat my meal all before most of the parties that I walked in with had been seated. I don't think I'll stop eating at the smaller, more funky places I tend to frequent, but I def. like having this one in my back pocket for just in case moments like this one."
Nori V.,"Seattle, WA",88,104,2,4.0,5/16/2007,"All I got to say about this HIGH priced and sinful restaurant is... THE ""FRIED MACARONI AND CHEESE"" BALLS ARE YUMMY!!!!!!"
Merri D.,"Bothell, WA",1,13,,5.0,3/29/2009,"My boyfriend and I went here for my birthday last night. We arrived at around 5:45ish and were told we would be seated in about 30 minutes. We watched the clock and were seated exactly half hour after we were told we would be. We ordered our drinks, I have my usual Tropical Smoothie and he had The Flying Gorilla. Both were very tasty, in fact boyfriend had a second one. We ordered the Ahi Tartare  for our appetizer and it was gone within 15 seconds of being on our table. It was so tasty and refreshing. I ordered the grilled pork chops with mash potatoes and he ordered the pasta jambalaya. He finished a little over half and I finished half of mine. Mind you I do this because I want leftovers when I go home and room for cheesecake. The menu is a bit over whelming for a first timer, but I suggest going to the website and looking at the menu on line to help decide if it takes you awhile normally to pick what you would want to order. My mashed potatoes were delicious! I normally just love creamy, but these had some chunks and were so good! My pork chop was cooked to perfection and I can't wait to eat it for lunch. My boyfriend enjoyed his meal as well. I always enjoy going to the cheesecake factory with him because of the large portions they give. He has a huge appetite and its always satisfied when we dine here. As for the cheesecake there was a little mix up because I had brought a card with me that offers a free slice with a certain amount you spend. I showed our server when we first sat and she said no problem, but my boyfriend read the small print a little further and they do not do the cards on Saturdays. I told our server when it was time to order our cheesecake and she apologized and talked to the manager and was able to get me a slice for free, which worked out nicely since my boyfriend didn't want one of his own. I let it slip that she could mention its my birthday if that would help getting me a free slice and she came back with my cheesecake with a damn candle it it and a couple of cute servers and sand to me. I loved it, but of course still acted like it was embarrassing ha ha. I would return again for a great meal because until I have a bad experience at this fine establishment I'm always going to come back for more. BY THE WAY THEY DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS SO STOP PICKING YES PEOPLE! lol"
Santiago C.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",38,77,57,2.0,3/20/2011,"Steak Dianne, nothing out of this world, Carpaccio, lousy, long wait for regular fare and not the fastest service, Chhesecake dessert was good but not special !"
Rhonda S.,"Seattle, WA",0,4,,4.0,5/27/2011,Good portions and food is above average. Cheesecake Factory is  touristy but that's not a problem for me because I think it is also fun for locals. Have been here many times and usually have a good time.
Jasmine M.,"Seattle, WA",242,393,123,4.0,5/18/2006,"Great location. Huge ass portions. Damn tasty adult libations. And the service has improved considerably over the years.  I use to cringe when someone suggested going there because when it first opened the service was horrible. The host staff would stand in their circlular pod and chat each up, while turning away from the door so as not to see incoming customers. Once seated it could take up to 10 minutes before someone came to the table.  But the last two times I've been there have been really a joy, and a surprise.  I'm in love with the Navajo sandwich. I mean HELLO! Grilled chicken, and avocado folded inside Indian frybread (something I haven't had since moving to Seattle over 9 years ago). Tried the Lemon Sunburst bevvie and it was so refresing and citrusy that we prompty bought a bottle of citrus Stoli to attempt duplication at home."
Brandon M.,"Bothell, WA",138,25,2,3.0,11/22/2010,"Went on a Saturday Night Entertaining some friends. Place was packed but was able to get a drink @ the bar...An hour wait for a table but it was Saturday Night downtown, so you kinda know what's up before you go in. Ran into my Brother in law and his girlfriend, Random...The food was OK, a lot of different options...They should stick to a certain type of food. too many options can be bad. The drinks are costly so be prepared...Big portions. NO parking which sucks but i know it's downtown so it goes without saying. Lots of different cheesecakes, you gotta get a slice. it goes without saying...Good place (Chain) to eat in DT seattle...Centrally located to the movies and the video game place..."
Michelle E.,"Issaquah, WA",60,50,26,4.0,11/9/2007,"I know it's a chain, I know the food is a bit overpriced and kind of meh, but this place rocks my world.  (I LOVE the huge menu.)  We get there right when they open on Sunday's at 11am and head straight to the bar.  Never a wait at all! And if you sit at the bar (on Sundays), Tyson is a rock star. Anyone reviewed the new Southcenter one yet?"
Jack K.,"Seattle, WA",0,16,,2.0,4/29/2009,"I can't make a reservation, I can't call ahead to put my name on the waiting list.  In other words ""We will make it as difficult as possible for you to be seated in a timely fashion."" Good thing is that there are plenty of places downtown I can go instead."
Franklin R.,"Seattle, WA",58,101,79,2.0,3/14/2008,"Ick.  Why do I do this to myself? Tacky grandiose faux decor. Zombie-like reception from a bluetooth-eared host at a desk. Spiral bound glossy menus with advertisements. Cocktail list with no prices. Server clueless about the cocktail prices. Over-the-top portions. Cheeseburger - dried out with no flavor and meat shaped to fit the French roll it's on. The Convention Center core of Seattle is in bad need of a pub to go to after a show at the Paramount or a movie.   However, Rufus Wainright  at the Paramount was fabulous."
Milaflor E.,"Seattle, WA",135,68,4,5.0,7/11/2006,"The boy & I  had our eyes on anything w/avocado so I had the Navajo sandwich (grilled chicken & avocado) and he had the Grilled Chicken Avocado club. Didn't get to taste his but he was very pleased w/it. Looked tasty. Mine was pretty good...I love fry bread and all the ingredients went so well w/it. We couldn't leave w/o trying out a cheesecake so we opted for one of their daily specials and supposedly our waiter's favorite. I wish I remembered the name because it was oh-so delicious! I do remember it being chocolaty and rich. Mmmmm...yummm. Great fun restaurant w/good tasty food and the service was excellent!  OH! and i forgot to mention that we ordered the fried macNcheese balls for an appetizer. Sounds weird, huh? So we  were a bit hesitant at first but our waiter assured us that they were delicious. And he was absolutely right! They're small breaded balls filled w/very creamy macNcheese. They were so tasty and rich, esp. w/the marinara sauce it comes with. You need to try 'em!"
Jerome B.,"Kent, WA",309,155,87,5.0,12/13/2007,"I don't care that the cheesecake factory is a franchise, their food and service at the downtown seatle location was perfect. I had my 20th birthday there, and I had invited about 45 people to come to dinner at the factory. I was really stressed about it, but the people at the cheesecake factory were really helpful in trying to make my night a great one. Although I told them about 45 people, only about 35 people managed to show up, so they were happily able to accomodate the number of people that I had. Their service was excellent.  THe food there was great too. I LOVE their pasta and cheesecake... yum! I would greatly recommend this place."
MamaRed P.,"Seattle, WA",167,161,286,3.0,7/9/2009,"the place- clean, high ceiling with warm dim lighting, tables can be put together to accommodate big party. can be very loud if you sit way back toward the kitchen.  the food- hit or miss. my favorite are, Thai lettuce wrap, avocado egg roll, corn fritter, and the pasta devinci. most of the high end menu items are not that tasty. the portions are huge.  the service- so so."
Jennifer R.,"Seattle, WA",41,52,9,3.0,3/10/2007,"Until last week, the last time we dined here was over 2 years ago.  It was a struggle getting into the main doors as the entrance/waiting area was swarming with little children, their parents, students, and business men and women.  Groups of people were scattered in the waiting area and spilling onto the sidewalks holding their vibrating-buzzer-thingies that told them their table was ready.   Honestly, it was a tad bit chaotic for me.  It was loud and teenagers were on their cell phones talking as if no one could hear their ""oh My Gawd ... like, nu uh ... you are like my most favorite best friend EVER..."" conversations.   After a 25+ minute wait, we were finally seated with our over-whelming sized menu.  I heard they changed the menu every 6-months to a year keeping the popular items and changing the not-so popular ones.  Thank goodness the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps were still around as that's what I wanted and indeed ordered.  Portions were large.  I was quite pleased with my dish.  The waitress constantly refilled our waters, which is always a plus.   My friends weren't too pleased with their pasta and chicken dishes.  Although monstrous in portions, flavors were mediocre for the price.   Oh, and did I mention that there was no toilet paper in the bathroom stalls.  So while I should have been enjoying the rest of my lunch conversation, I instead was concentrating on how to hold in all the water I had consumed.   My overall dining experience was so-so.  My dish was just as expected but everything else was not up to par."

Marcy A.,"Seattle, WA",0,12,,4.0,5/7/2011,"I have not tried anything I did not like yet. Their fish batter is really good. Its one of my favorites. I also really like their sourdough bread and their strawberry cheesecake.  The only bad thing about here is its a bit noisy, and theres no free parking."
