Jessie R.,"Banner Elk, NC",28,92,124,2.0,2/25/2017,"The lines are God awful on weekends. As in, you can't move, standing on top of each other busy. Impatient Tourists everywhere in here. I will say when I went on a weeknight it wasn't such a horrible, crazy busy experience, so go on a weeknight if for some reason, you love this place. The cheesecake is good, but the food is meh....like Applebee's quality. Had the chicken bellagio this time, burger last time. Maybe I'm picking the wrong things...I'm not sure what people's obsession with this mediocre food is."
Denise W.,"Vancouver, Canada",283,2529,14482,5.0,2/23/2016,I always love The Cheesecake Factory. Its one of the restaurants on my top favorite list. The atmosphere is so romantic in some ways (eventhough I usually come here with my sisters and parents). Ok maybe not the right terms but so Venetian style. Yes the Venetian style.  Service has always been awesome here. Love their bread its so yummy.  Their dishes are huge portion. Basically order 2 dish and you are good to go for 3 to 4 people. I always have left over to pack home. Pasta here are the best. Don't forget the Cheesecake option are huge. Lots of different flavor and also they have seasonal flavor.  This Cheesecake Factory is less busy compared to the Bellevue location.  It is very centrally located and very close to Washington State Conventional Center.  Definitely coming back
N B.,"Vancouver, Canada",2,49,19,3.0,5/7/2017,"We came here in August 2016 while we were in Seattle (so I may have trouble remembering some things). I ordered chicken and the grilled cheese sandwich, which I didn't end up finishing (haha) and the food that we didn't finish we gave to a homeless man outside. As for taste, I would say it's definitely up to par. But not amazingly mind blowing. The portions are really sizeable for the price (hence, the not eating everything :p) Service was pretty decent, waiter was friendly. Just wish he had stopped by more often. The restaurant itself is pretty nice, albeit a little dated. The bathrooms were my favourite space! It got quite loud when we were there, but that's not always an issue. All in all, a pretty nice place. Will likely return should we ever come back to Seattle."
Linda C.,"Vancouver, Canada",48,186,214,4.0,1/21/2016,"Calamari Appetizer (3/5) -Typical calamari. Edible. Forgetable.  Chicken Di Pana (3.5/5) - One of their specialties. I only had a bite but it wasn't something I could drive all the way to Seattle for to eat.  Fried Zucchini  (4/5) - I loved this small dish. Zucchini was fresh and it felt like an edible, tasty healthier option compared to other good on the menu.  Mushroom and Chicken Lettuce wrap (3.5/5) -  A bit on the salty side but it was a healthier option. After finishing the plate, I still had space for the cheesecake(s).  Red Velvet Cheesecake (5/5) - Eat this. You will die. It's amazing! Original Cheesecake (3.5/5) -  A bit too plain for my liking but its worth it to taste what a no nonsense cheesecake is like.  Mango Lime Cheesecake (4/5) - Tasted like a Chinese mango pudding and texture was like a pudding too. I like Chinese mango puddings.  Cookie Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake (3.5/5) - it's a bit too sweet and a bit harder than the other cheesecakes.  Tuxedo Cheesecake (4/5) - Presentation was amazing, but I wouldn't be able to eat a whole cake on its own because it's too rich and too chocolaty.  White Chocolate Macadamia Cheesecake (3/5) - Very sweet. Nuts were soggy. Cake was hard.  Your entrees are not your strongest suit, but Ahh, Cheesecake Factory, I love your cheesecakes alot!"
Sherill Y.,"Seattle, WA",119,315,7442,4.0,10/23/2015,"We stopped here for lunch when we we're in Downtown. It wasn't crowded at all so we were seated right away. Such a vast amount of choices it take half an hour to choose. Huge selection of cheesecake. Our nice server Brad had perfect timing whenever he came to our booth to take our order, bring us food, check on us, refill drinks, etc.  Our food came out hot and in record time.   I had the Grilled Rib-Eye Steak with fries ($26.95). It came out with perfect grillmarks. It was juicy, tender, and had great flavor. My husband had KOBE BURGER, $15 burger. Whatever right? It had Kobe in the name even though it most likely wasn't actual Kobe. The burger was pretty good tho' with sautéed mushrooms and onions. The girls had ""Kids Mini Corn Dogs"" with fries $5.95 and ""Kid's Spaghetti with Meatball"" $6.95. Both KIDS MEAL comes with milk or juice. We shared two slices of cheesecake: WHITE CHOCOLATE CARAMEL MACADAMIA NUT CHEESECAKE and FRESH BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE. GEORGIA PEACH: Good but not strong. Taste like a non alcoholic drink. The interior decor is amazing, the pillars, the ceilings and the floors gives it a very stunning upscale look. If you have a party with varied tastes, this place is for you. There is something for everyone! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others for a fun outing with friends or family... Good downtown location. Excellent dining experience. Pro: Large portion sizes. You're going to get full, which has always confused me a little since they are known for (and named after) their desserts, which you cannot eat if you are full. Con: The prices are high. You may receive a ten-pound entree, but you're paying for it.  The Cheesecake Factory is overall worth the trip."
Xiomara L.,"Seattle, WA",486,47,179,5.0,1/16/2017,"My waitress was super amazing and nice! For once I felt very comfortable and happy with my overall service. Best cheesecake I've ever been to. My refills were in point she never failed sad I didn't get her name. Food was amazing, it was not that packed so that was a plus. Great time here!"
Pearl W.,"Olympia, WA",159,434,64,4.0,2/11/2017,"Great server that was very attentive. I love the mac n cheese bites!! We were full after our meal, but made sure to take some cheesecake home."
SweetP G.,"Seattle, WA",16,170,9,5.0,2/11/2017,"A lot of chain restaurants get a bad rap, deservedly. Not so with The Cheesecake Factory, IMHO. I've been here a few times over the years and each has been great. Today's visit was no exception. Even without reservations on a busy Saturday, we were seated after a brief wait and had prompt service throughout. My only complaint about the food is there are too many choices... an epically long menu but every time I'm happy. And the desserts... I mean really, the desserts! Drool. It's wonderful to support independent spots but if with the right companions you're looking for something a bit more mainstream, you can't go wrong here."
Yogeshree T.,"Seattle, WA",77,98,36,4.0,1/30/2017,"This is like any other cheese cake factory. This is a huge restaurant with lots of tables but still you may have to wait to get a table on a busy evening. I have been here 7 to 8 times or maybe more, few times with my colleagues and few times with my fiancé. Their portions are always huge and the dishes are well prepared. I loved their complimentary bread basket. My favorite is shrimp scampi and their chocolate mousse cheesecake."
Ahmed A.,"Seattle, WA",0,7,,5.0,4/1/2017,My favorite restaurant in Seattle.  The food is really tasty and portions are good. Try the Falafel Salad and / or their soup of the day. You can't go wrong with that
Keilyn K.,"Spokane, WA",211,17,15,5.0,4/9/2017,"I went to The Cheesecake Factory for the first time today and I loved it. They have such a large menu with many food options to choose from. There were burgers, pasta, steak, seafood, sandwiches, drinks, and plenty of desserts (more specifically 2 pages of cheesecake!). I got the Mac & Cheese Burger which was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. The other two plates were a Kobe Burger and a Club Turkey Sandwich, which were also great. The service was amazing and I would definitely recommend TCF."
Divya V.,"Trillick, United Kingdom",0,5,,1.0,3/16/2017,"The cashew chicken was meant to be ""very spicy"" as per the menu and it turned out to be very sweet instead- which I am not very fond of.  It was ridiculous coz when I pointed this to my server, he offered me some chilli sauce to make the dish taste spicy instead of understanding my issue.  Money wasted.   Also, I hate their menus which is more of a booklet- super loooooong!"
Mia B.,"Bitter Lake, Seattle, WA",525,7,,1.0,9/27/2017,"I went here last night and had the worst dining experience EVER. This place was horrible from the moment we walked in. They were SO rude to us, for no reason. We asked for a table and they ignored us- so we asked to sit. The guy said ""sure sit, but you won't get any service"" what the heck?! We asked another waiter & sat down finally after being ignored & then I got a margarita. When it came it was in a tiny MARTINI glass....I asked for a margarita. It was awful and tasted like pure syrup. The service here was awful as well as the drink that I had sent back. If I could give this place zero stars I would. Horrible staff. Horrible service. Never going back to this place!"
Kasey K.,"Seattle, WA",47,47,13,4.0,7/26/2017,"Ok first let's just discuss how insanely large the menu is. It's like a novel. Pasta jambalaya is pretty bomb and that's coming from a true Cajun girl who was raised in the heart of Louisiana her whole life. The cheesecake is good enough to make you cry. Like oh Lord, that Oreo one will make you pass out with your taste buds exploding. There's usually a wait, only reason why it's not a 5 star review."
Krista H.,"Edmonds, WA",86,11,,5.0,8/16/2017,"My boyfriend and I ate here last night and it was incredible. We'd had bad luck at 2 other downtown restaurants, and we needed a win! The Cheesecake Factory delivered! First of all, I was really hungry... I'd forgotten all about their free, delicious bread...it hit the spot! For our meal we shared the avocado spring rolls, the kale salad, and the Thai chicken wraps. Everything tasted amazing!!!! Kudos to our great server Justin J who got everything to us right away...I always appreciate it when food that's supposed to be hot actually is. We had an amazing meal that made us both really happy."
Lora T.,"Seattle, WA",0,12,17,2.0,6/2/2017,"We go to and order from The Cheesecake Factory all the time. We have had probably 70% of the menu.  Delivery was 5 stars through DoorDash! However, for  $13 the Chicken Nachos were extremely disappointing. Every other time I have ordered, I've gotten lettuce, tomatoes, Pico, guacamole, sour cream, etc., and it's been huge! Well worth the $13...I guess that's only if you order while in the resturaunt. Bummer."
Anita V.,"Auburn, WA",60,29,52,4.0,1/22/2017,"I've been to this location twice and the service is consistent. The booths are super cozy to sit in and their music selection is always on point. We've never had to wait for a table (couples seating) so to me, that means the restaurant has a high capacity for seating. The food here is delicious. I almost always order a lunch sized plate of pasta or else I would never finish. Fettuccini Alfredo is my all time fav Italian dish and the noodles are always cooked perfectly and the sauce is satisfying. On this particular visit it was our anniversary and they wrote on our cheesecake plate (worth it). Had the best chocolate cheesecake I've ever had. It was their 30th Anniversary cheesecake with a layer of chocolate cake and a layer of cheesecake. It was complex and fancy. Loved the wafer outside and chocolate shavings. Officially one of my top 3 fav cheesecakes from the cheesecake now."
Chris O.,"Redmond, WA",34,13,5,1.0,1/12/2017,"Went here with my family. The hostess had to re-seat us three times because we had a baby with us and each table she sat us at created a ""fire hazard"".  The third table she brought us too we decided to just leave and not eat there. I'd give this place a few more months to get their staff trained properly before you try it."
Priscilla P.,"Silverdale, WA",0,2,1,1.0,7/22/2017,"Don't waste your time or money!  It's frustrating when you order an $18 dish and it's half full. I'll take my business to Tacoma or Southcenter where they actually fill my bowl with gumbo and not a bunch of grease/oil. The service was good with the exception of us having to box our own food, which is not normal at this restaurant. We will not visit this location anymore. I could have eaten gumbo out of a can and it would have tasted better. I don't even think I can feed it to my dogs due to the excess grease!"
Dennis D.,"Seattle, WA",347,168,574,4.0,9/16/2016,"Came here on a sponsored event, so it wasn't on my dime. Ordered the Miso salmon over brown rice with snow peas. Was very impressed. I was initially under the impression that it would be just a-ok like most watered down chain restaurants, but it was really tender and juicy... sometimes salmon has a tendency to be cooked dry, but I really did like the buttery flavor of this.. compliments to the cook on that. The location of this place is in a nicer part of downtown.. kind of on the edge of the financial area. The inside is really nice and has a nice atmosphere. Not bad, not bad."
