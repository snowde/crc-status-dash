Angie Q.,"San Francisco, CA",48,274,9,3.0,7/1/2008,"I love the prime location as well as the atmosphere and decor.  My first time here I ordered crab cakes (my favorite). The breading was hard and appeared to be over-cooked. The crab filling made it appear the restaurant was being stingy and didn't want to include too much crab, and instead piled on the extras. These were the worst crab cakes I've ever had!  Cheesecakes are okay... I do really like the regular one with strawberries on top.  My second time visiting, I ordered a salmon filet with asparagus and mashed potatoes. They were surprisingly good (I didn't have high expectations and my friend really wanted to go)."
Quinn R.,"Seattle, WA",155,240,6,2.0,7/14/2007,bleh... I dont like this place.   menu longer than most novels....dark atmosphere to prevent you from seeing the aweful looking dishes being delivered around you and tourist central in Seattle.   take me away from this factory.
Aaron E.,"Seattle, WA",334,473,6,3.0,4/15/2009,"I really think Cheesecake Factory has something on the menu for everyone (it is, after all, 2309289304 pages long). Sure, the food isn't great, but it's not necessarily bad, either. The wait can be long, but you can usually find an open spot at the bar, or the table right by the bar.  For a while two of my friends came here pretty frequently. We were in love with the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Navajo Sandwich. We would split the Egg Rolls, each order a sandwich, each have a coke and split a piece of cheesecake (the total, divided by 3 with a tip was $17 or so... very reasonable IMO). The Egg Rolls are some of the better Avocado Egg Rolls. They're tasty, fatty and delicious. The dipping sauce is sweet and the strands of fried air (white, tiny noodle looking things) that come in a mound as a garnish are tasty. Haha. Yes, we ate the fried air.  The Navajo Sandwich is what I order 99.5% of the time I come here. It's a generous piece of fry bread filled with grilled chicken, tomato, avocado, lettuce and a slather of a mayonnaise type sauce. Sure, I've had better sandwiches before, but it's always comforting and I know exactly what to expect. I've had other dishes like the pastas, burgers and fish and chips and have to say the only thing I really recommend would be the Fish and Chips... the batter they use fries quite nicely and they're crispy on the outside and hot on the inside. The fries are also winners.  But really, everyone comes here for the cheesecake, right? Right! They have every flavor possible and I think it'd be really hard for someone not to find something to their liking. Personally, I'm a big fan of their white chocolate, raspberry cheesecake which is tangy from the berries, sweet, but not too sweet and a light, fluffy texture.   If you're looking for convenience, decent service and lots of options, Cheesecake Factory is a place for you.  The portions are huge and are reasonably priced and if you leave hungry, well, there's something wrong with you!"
Richard C.,"Chicago, IL",53,77,19,2.0,6/23/2007,"Ugh, I know, Cheesecake Factory - but, it was our only big work get-together of the trip, and most people didn't want to stray far from the Convention Center or hotel, so we made reservations for 12 at the Factory. I really don't want to go in depth about this visit, because I really didn't enjoy it - in fact, half of our party didn't, the other half did - guess I'm being 0.5 points unfair in my score - I won't lose sleep over it! I really didn't know what I wanted to drink, so I randomly chose a mint julep - my experience at other Factory's has been good when it comes to their drinks - they are usually very consistent.  The julep arrived, and it was darn good - so good that other colleagues decided that's what they would have next round - and that's when things started to go downhill. The Factory describes their juleps as Makers Mark, fresh mint and a hint of peach brandy - spot on with that first one.  When the next round came in, it was basically straight bourbon with a mint leaf in the bottom which you couldn't taste.  After quick mixing, it was bourbon and mint, but didn't have that sweet kick of the peach brandy.  We told our server, and he took the drinks away, brought them back (yes, the same ones), with what tasted like 3 tablespoons of sugar added.  Again, we called him over, by which time my colleagues had given up on the idea of waiting until the barman repeated his good first drink, and ordered other things.  I kept going, and on the 3rd attempt, they got something close, although still a few miles away from what I was looking for. Then came the food.  One of our table had their food brought out, and the rest of us stared at him for the next 10 minutes.  Our waiter then realized that he was the only one eating, and went off to find out what happened to the rest of the food - it arrived shortly afterwards.  My medium-rare filet was cooked medium well, my colleagues medium petit filet was cooked medium rare, and another colleagues medium-well filet had been butterflied - I know a lot of places will do this when cooking filets above medium, but the waiter should also explain this. By this point, we were so tired and frustrated with the Factory, that we just had our badly cooked steaks and left. I don't suppose I can talk about the Factory without bitching about portion size.  Now, I'm not blaming their sizes on the obesity of America - I blame obese people for that - just because it's on a plate DOES NOT mean it should all be eaten.  That aside, do we really need that much on a plate?  I understand one side, where you can take 3/4 of your food home in a take-out box and feed the next small country you might be visiting, but this doesn't work with all food, and most people don't do that anyway.  As soon as I see so much on a plate, I start feeling full, it's like staring at Mount Everest and even though you know you're only going to base camp to have a whiskey, you just feel so daunted by what's towering above you. OK, bitch over - I've been to consistently good, 4-star Cheesecake Factory's - this was very poor in comparison."
Nancy H.,"Seattle, WA",83,248,163,4.0,6/21/2007,"Okay, it's a chain restaurant. Yet, at this particular location in Seattle, I found beats Bellevue's quality and consistency. I have never had  a bad meal here. When you like it big and dreamy, this is the place to go. Dreamy desserts and entree's and appetizers. I absolutely loved the deep fried mac n cheese, tamale cake, tex mex egg rolls, shrimp scampi, luau salad, and the cheesecakes are enormous servings of heaven. Basically, they have more of everything, and everything is more. Go here if you want to get nice and fat and feel good doing it. Good For: cheesecake, fried mac n cheese, chicken piccata, luau salad, corn cakes, chicken madeira, shrimp scampi, girls night out"
A B.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,68,7,2.0,8/29/2009,"Seriously, why would anyone eat someplace that features advertisements in it's menu? What's next, ads in the dessert. Skip the wait, food and 2500 calorie entrees and go to a local place."
Kal B.,"Burnaby, Canada",88,172,,5.0,1/12/2010,"were still full from lunch so just grabbed a couple of appies.. corn cakes which are to die for.. topped with salsa, guac and sour cream.. they are simply amazing.. we also had some crab wontons that are made with cream cheese mixed with the crab.  to top it off we had a limited edition cheesecake.. the turtle caramel cheesecake for dessert.. it was pretty amazing!  my sis went to bellevue 2 days later and said the waitress said they discontinued it.. let's say that she was pretty disappointed!  but perhaps it was only at that other location. expect a wait especially after 7 on a fri or sat.. but we got in around 6ish and only waited about 20."
Zarah M.,"Seattle, WA",50,174,145,5.0,9/22/2005,"Gorgeous restaurant, huge selection.  I enjoy their pizzas and cobb salads.  The cheesecakes - DIVINE.  I also like their apple dumpling with sides of vanilla icecream.  This place is beautiful and the servers very , very nice.  Large portions!  Photos soon!"
Brittany F.,"Seattle, WA",0,39,7,4.0,10/10/2010,I love this CF.  The one in Bellevue SUCKS!!  A little tip since it is always crowded.  Sit in the bar.  There are tables there not just stools and you don't have to wait you just walk right in a sit down.  I almost always sit at the bar.  The bartender Mary is fantastic.  She knows everybody.  When she sees me she almost automatically starts making my Mai Tai.  The menu is overwhelming but I have only had to return something twice.  Once for peas when i said no thank you and the other for a not warm pizza.  Other than that no complaints.
Klaus J.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,134,,5.0,7/8/2012,"Not as nice decoration as the Cheesecake Factory in Chicago, but still very nice experience to visit. Their portions are huge and very tasty. It was a busy Sunday when we went there for lunch, but service was still fast. Very good experience overall."
Joe B.,"Sacramento, CA",11,759,7,3.0,9/3/2007,"I am not one for chains, but we decided to check this place out..... It is located in the heart of downtown... Nice place...  very clean... crowded.. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table of two.. We didn't have a reservation.. As for the food, the portions are pretty big.. I had a Cesar salad, and the wife had a combo lunch with a sandwich and salad.. The service was solid... Overall it was pretty good.. We didn't try any of the specialty drinks because it was a little early in the afternoon.. We would go back.."
Jason T.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",2,75,10,5.0,3/28/2010,Seattle best value and all around place! All the portions are huge and the wide variety is overwhelming! The veggie casedillas are great and their pasta is good as well. My favorite drink there is the Georgia peach. It actually looks like  apeach! and tastes awesome!
J.Nichole S.,"Twickenham, United Kingdom",6,30,26,4.0,8/25/2007,"So, we all know the Cheese is about grandeur... National presence, giant entryways and dining rooms, ridiculous-huge menus, obscenely large portions {complete with six figure caloric values} -- But the biggest thing about The Seattle Cheesecake Factory is Jon.  Although he is slim and handsome, Jon is larger than life. An adorable, hilarious, super-helpful and effective bar tender, Jon MAKES what would otherwise be a corporate conglomerate of neatly tailored managers wandering the floor with secret-service style earpieces and brightly appointed sorority girls with perfect hair, teeth and skin. There is no happy hour, there is nothing on the menu under $8.95 and there is no parking-- But I gladly sip my Stella and eat my overpriced only moderately delicious appetizers at the Cheesecake bar on a regular basis.                                                                 *** Whatever you do Cheesecake Factory Seattle-- hang on to Jon!"
Amanda S.,"Seattle, WA",2,10,,2.0,4/13/2008,"This would be a grest place to take your parents when they visit, but other than that there is nothing original or impressive about this place - including the mediocre cheesecake. The menu has lots of variety, but so much that they aren't really that good a making any one thing specific thing, and it's all really generic."
Tod B.,"Tukwila, WA",45,79,16,3.0,4/20/2009,"I think that three stars about says it for The Cheesecake Factory. I think that they suffer from what I call ""The Claim Jumper Syndrome"" - portions that are too big and prices that are too high. The menu is very extensive so everyone should be able to find something. The food is good, but with so many great places to eat downtown I don't think that I would make it a regular haunt. There is usually a wait for a table when I have been in there. The place is very attractive, the staff very friendly, and of course, the cheesecakes are amazing. They could do with a kids dessert menu, please, because the adult sized ones are just too big for kids."
Casper C.,"Seattle, WA",5,13,,2.0,4/12/2010,"I'm Not very impressed with this Cheesecake factory... not the place itself, the employees.  I got a douche bag waiter who leaned against our table and took forever.  It was my friends birthday and Im all for paying for cheesecake if at least he would have brought his snotty crew would have come out and sung with me ( socially awkard) At least 4 of them stopped by the table to glare at us. Im embarressed to have brought her there, Think Ill take the trip to Bellvue next time.  oh and dont get avacado egg rolls unless you REALLLY like avacado.  Cheesecake was amazing still. I bought 2 so I could sing happy birthday to her. later. Ps. This isnt the first time Ive gone there and was seriously shunned."
Aaron B.,"Bothell, WA",410,264,200,3.0,11/19/2009,"Been to one, been to them all. Had the Weight Watchers light oriental chx salad yesterday. Decided on it after looking at how many calories are in the meal offerings at Cheesecake Factory. Word to the wise: if you eat here, don't look at the calorie menu. If you are watching your weight, CHOOSE wisely."
Jeniffer L.,"Seattle, WA",31,21,8,1.0,9/3/2008,Im sad to say that this highly talked about and over rated restaurant did not tickle my fancy.......The food was super tardy to get to our table and when it did finally get there it was cold and not even worth the wait. when i confronted the manager he assured me that it would be taken care of by complimenting our drinks.... LMFAO what a real douche he was and i will probably never eat there again......
Tony Y.,"Renton, WA",52,400,,3.0,1/18/2009,"I went here a couple times several years ago and had good experiences. We went here with a group of friends last night.  Of course it was very busy on a Saturdays night, with tons of people waiting in the lobby and outside but I was impressed on how fast they got us a table, the last coulpe times I went it was the same way. They tell us 35-50 minutes, and we get seated in 10 minutes. I hear stories that it can take an hour plus, I guess I was just lucky. The food is great, I always get the Lousiana chicken pasta, very tasty and filling, my lady got beef ribs. They were decent and way overpriced. We split a white chocolate cheesecake and it was pretty good. Service is prompt and friendly. We will probably be back sometime, but its kind of pricey for the type of food you get. Atmosphere is great though. Good for a group of friends or family."
Christopher H.,"Seattle, WA",385,454,165,3.0,8/4/2009,"I don't know what else I can add to 100+ reviews and the fact that the place is, after all, a Cheesecake Factory. Just like every other one in the world, they feature a huge menu of slightly above mediocre food served in gigantic portions. Their cheesecake is very good, but that of course assumes you still have room for dessert when you're done with dinner."
