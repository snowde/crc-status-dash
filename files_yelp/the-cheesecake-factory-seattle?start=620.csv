Dare O.,"Renton, WA",24,11,,4.0,12/3/2008,"The menu is varied but very hit & miss. When you do find what you love on the menu, the experience is golden."
Annie W.,"Honolulu, HI",83,107,102,2.0,9/24/2010,"Went there with 6 friends.  Being a group of 7, I did not understand why they sat us at a relatively small table. It wasn't too small but it was cramped. We didn't want to make a fuss about it so lunch goes on. We ordered our drinks while the tables beside us were empty, and sadly we didn't get our drinks until after the tables beside us got their drinks. The food was decent, good portions and decently priced, but the service was sub-par.  Our desserts were delayed as well (it was being baked).  Despite the terrible service and your run of the mill food, we did not bother to complain; we just wanted to pay and be on our way. The waitress gave us 1 bill so we asked her to separate the bill us. She came back with 7 bills each with an 18% tip on it. We asked her what that was for and she said that a party of 7 and up automatically has 18% tip on the bill. We were never aware of such rule and they hostess never mentioned anything of that sort. We asked the waitress to get her manager as this was not acceptable. I can take shitty service and mediocre food, but if I have to tip 18% of my bill for it, then thats a different story. After we complained to him about our experience, the manager waived the 18% tip off our bills and also 2 of the most expensive dishes too (thats why I did not give them a 1/5 star rating). O yes, and parking is hard to find and if you find a parking spot, its expensive."
Heather W.,"Richland, WA",51,353,76,1.0,6/22/2009,"Highly overrated, particularly the cheesecake.  The menu is ten thousand pages, and everything is at least a thousand calories (though they have a few salads on the lighter menu which aren't...too bad they taste terrible).  The tastiest thing on their menu IMHO is the ""side salad"".  How bizarre.  There are plenty other great restaurants in the area...I'll pass on this one."
Todd B.,"Seattle, WA",76,28,7,2.0,9/6/2009,"Used to be good and reliable. I mean it's a chain so you sort of know what you are getting when you go there.  This location seems to have lost it's will to live.  The servers are dull and don't seem to care about anything. They also look like they've been on the same shift for a week and in the same clothes!   The place smells a little bit as well and the interior is starting to look dated. The food used to be reliably ""OK"", but now it's just blah. Save your money on a better meal somewhere else, go for drinks (which are ok) or cheesecake."
Sam S.,"Portland, OR",24,48,21,1.0,7/6/2008,"I've been to other Cheesecake Factory locations before and always had a relatively good time despite almost ubiquitous long waits. This one took the metaphoric cake, in terms of awfulness, though. A friend from California flew up for a conference and to visit his sister, and she wanted to eat here (her brother was paying for her). We waited for a long time, stepping outside and shrugging at the vagrant with the cardboard sign that read, ""Honk if you masturbate."" When I didn't laugh, the young man hopped up and down like a monkey and asked me, Didn't I think it was funny? I told him, Yes, if I am still in the 5th grade. But I digress. We were finally seated after 45+ minutes, and the hostess said our waiter would be with us shortly. A waiter did show up, but he said, ""Hi, your waiter is on his dinner break. Can I get you something to drink?"" What? If he's on his break, why don't YOU be our waiter? I know every waiter has their own section of the restaurant, but why send us a person that won't stay with our table? It gets better. We never see that guy again. A different person, this time a woman, brings us our drinks after quite a while and we give her our order. Keep count here, this is important. So far I count two waiters. We're having fun talking, us three patrons, as we haven't seen each other for a while, but it is slowly dawning on us that we haven't seen anyone come to our table for quite a while. After another long wait, maybe half an hour, a man dressed like a manager-type walks up and says, ""I'm sorry, your food will be out in just a few minutes, we--"" and he gets cut off by yet another man (besides bussers and the hostess, this is the fourth person to visit our table) who brings us our food. My food was fine, but my friend's was lukewarm, and his sister's fries were mushy. The closest we can guess is that our food was ready, placed to the side, and forgotten for a while, then needed to be quickly reheated before they brought it out. Else why all the shenanigans about three different waiters and a manager coming out? Why wouldn't the manager know that the food was right behind him? I wish I could remember his exact words, because they were what made us think it was fishy in the first place. Maybe we were just unlucky. But maybe they should also not forget our food, and maybe we should have the same waiter for the whole dining experience. Those things might help."
Dena P.,"Seattle, WA",27,243,1,4.0,11/10/2009,"I love to hate the Cheesecake Factory. For one, it was very close to where I used to live so I went there quite often. Two, the portions are huge and I usually eat the leftovers for days. Three, the Bellini is delicious and I forget that I get a brain freeze every time I drink them! And Four, after you eat dinner there is no way you can fit a piece of cheesecake in your mouth. I really do like the food at the Cheesecake Factory. I think they should make smaller portions and have cheaper prices for those smaller portions. That would really make people who are watching what they eat happy! I do love their cheesecake. I love the decor; I always feel like I'm in Las Vegas in the Venetian hotel. Great place to go; Seattle and/or Bellevue."
Tiffany W.,"San Francisco, CA",554,266,129,4.0,6/25/2008,Just your standard Cheesecake Factory establishment. My only advice to this place is: GO EASY ON THE BUTTER. I'm always gulping down water by the end of my meal because the food is so freaking oily and salty!
Michael E.,"Seattle, WA",120,375,26,4.0,9/11/2008,"Really, I'm reviewing this?  Well I went there.  You know what's 4-stars (other than the cheesecake)?  The iced tea (have you had our iced tea before? They'll ask.  Yes, I've been going to TCF's since I was 12 I think."
Reena M.,"Greater Vancouver A, Canada",308,913,137,3.0,4/28/2009,"3 stars because the food sucks, despite the large menu. But the cheesecake is great, especially the Dulce de Leche one. I'll probably go next time just for the cheesecake."
Susie C.,"Port Orchard, WA",50,94,6,3.0,6/3/2009,"You know, I wasn't a big fan...it is way too over rated. The food was average, the service was average. The cheesecake was good, so maybe if I go there again Ill just get some dessert to go. I just think they over did it in that place."
Naoko S.,"Seattle, WA",36,123,8,2.0,8/20/2008,"this one,,, i don't like it. i feel like i'm in a big mall. the space had a potential to be gorgeous and it didn't happen, and the crime of this ""could have been,"" is huge. however, i gave this place two stars. i went there at the end of lunch so no wait - 1star cheaper - 1star there is no way i'd go there at night. not this one."
Tannya B.,"Seattle, WA",0,18,1,3.0,10/13/2009,"Okay it's a chain but I STILL haven't had any cheesecake better than the cheesecake factory dessert soooooooooooooo I would give it a 5 star for their dessert but a 3 on their service.  They are a bit slow, servers look stressed out, and last time I went there was something in my food. 97% of the time I go just to buy some cheesecake slices.  Lemon raspberry is my favorite!!!! I've tried at least half of them.  This is the less richest and it melts in your mouth."
Maribel C.,"Seattle, WA",4,10,,1.0,9/26/2006,"One of the worst restaurants I've ever been to.  The food is terribly disgusting.  The dishes are gargantous and the bill, not worth it.  Not even a cheesecake can save them."
Aaron M.,"Seattle, WA",206,541,10,2.0,2/22/2007,"I am not a huge fan of the Cheescake Factory.  It is like Claim Jumper, huge portions of average food.  The wait is always insane so one time when taking a relitive out for a birthday party I called ahead and made a reservation.  I showed up with everyone at the reservation time and over an hour and a half later we were seated.  In fact they seated people ahead of us who had no ""reservation.""  After all this and several complaints from me they didn't even comp anything.  Nothing.  It was awful all the guy wants is a ""nice"" dinner on his birthday with his family and he is shit on."
Bernadette E.,"Las Vegas, NV",172,330,36,4.0,4/26/2007,"hey kids!! a few things you may wanna know about this place: - if you get here after 11:30am on the weekend and after 6pm just about every night expect to wait... a LONG time - big parties=long wait - for having such a ""romantic"" type of atmosphere it can be AWFULLY loud in here!! - you gotta love menus with advertisements in them... NICE!!! then there's always this stuff: - the cheesecake is delightful!! - try the chicken and biscuits... i think that's what it's called :) - the inside decor is so fancy... love the marble!! - did i mention how delightful the cheesecake is?!?!? if you've never been give it a try... you might like it ;) toodles!!!"
C G.,"San Francisco, CA",59,290,,4.0,2/3/2009,The wait for the food was good. The waiter really nice and attentive. But the food was some what good except it was not hot enough. I would go there again in the future.
Rick L.,"Hoboken, NJ",48,438,,5.0,9/14/2005,"Ok, I know this is a chain - but trust me - this cheesecake factory is different! I've been to a few of these, all over the country but this one is the best by far that I've ever been to. The chefs are friendly, and the waitstaff is the best (I've even had a friend who worked here once) - and the burgers are too big to eat in one sitting. Don't forget to get a slice or two to take home to eat the next day, you'll regret it otherwise."
Yana K.,"Seattle, WA",18,43,2,5.0,4/25/2006,"I like coming here, the only thing is the wait  which can be a b**ch during the evening rush hour as well as on weekends.  However, everything is good that's on the menu and the staff is excellent, making sure that your dining experience is an A+.  I ate here both in the dining room as well as the bar, and I must say that their drinks are really strong and the bar tenders are quick as well as easy on the eyes.  Great place to hang out or bring your whole crew."
Ass Man Z.,"Seattle, WA",40,225,6,3.0,8/20/2006,"Big, silly, mediocre chain restaurant...so, why do I like it? I don't know...probably the same reason I found myself at a Chili's in Bellevue...it's just so ridiculous, it's actually kinda fun...like Old Country Buffet, or Chuck E. Cheese. Marilyn Manson ate here when he was in town a few years ago...and that just makes me laugh."
sheila g.,"Seattle, WA",12,35,,2.0,5/3/2011,A very busy place with a very long menu. We have had friendly pleasant wait-staff and surly couldn't care less ones. The food is ok and the portions adequate. Very noisy.
