Navtej Kohli K.,"Seattle, WA",1,19,,3.0,4/5/2007,"The food is good, but my waitress was possibly the most horrible girl on the face of the earth."
Sione P.,"Edmonds, WA",47,223,4,2.0,8/11/2008,"Cheesecake Factory.  Meh.  I don't understand the draw.  It's ALWAYS busy!  I'm not just talking about this location, either.  The one at Bellevue Square gets ridiculous!  Now, the menu at Cheesecake is very (and I mean VERY!!) extensive.  That being said, I don't think anything on the menu is excellent.  I've been here many times (never of my choosing, haha) and have ordered a lot of different things.  Nothing was bad, per se, but nothing has really wowed me.  Everything is pretty good, but I think they dabble too much to really have everything be spectacular.  And everything is pretty expensive for being what I would consider ""pretty good"".  Service is decent once you manage to get a table, but decent service and pretty good food just don't seem enough to me to justify the price you pay.  Especially not when Seattle is blessed with so many different dining options."
vanessa c.,"Tacoma, WA",0,19,,1.0,4/17/2009,"I HATE THIS PLACE! The first time was a novelty because of the HUGE menu but, why have 100+ things that you do mediocre when you can have a selective menu you do well? Kids Love this place and that is the only reason I have returned. Service is lacking and sometimes your server will switch in the middle of your dining and if it's before you get you food you are in for a very unpleasant experience! If you LOVE cheesecake, order some to go and get out while you can!"
Rozzie M.,"Seattle, WA",10,74,4,3.0,9/15/2008,"Four of us headed down for dinner at about 7:15ish on a Sunday evening.  We were told about 15-20 minute wait which seemed surprising with the amount of people standing around that it would not be longer.  About half an hour later, we are still standing around when 3 women approximately in their 50's walk in, put their name on the list, get a buzzer then sweet talk the hostess and boom, go sit at a table that was just vacated.  I have no idea what they said to the hostess, but that was not cool at all.  We were just about to say screw it after waiting so long and then seeing that, and about 4 minutes later we were seated.  Once we were seated, all was well.  Everyone was happy with the foods, drinks and apps.  The crab won tons were a hit at our table.  Nice server,  evil hostess."
Daisy R.,"Seattle, WA",7,9,,3.0,12/28/2007,"My only problem with the Cheesecake Factory is the service.  You just don't know what kind of  service gonna get-just make sure you double check with the waitstaff when you order your food/drinks...too many times they've gotten my order wrong or mixed up because they didn't write it down to begin with.  The food though is pretty good, especially the avocado eggroll appetizer and their chicken madeira! If the place is packed, try looking for a spot in the bar area-if you're lucky you don't have to wait so long."
Robyn H.,"Seattle, WA",59,613,139,4.0,10/31/2005,Kiss your diet goodbye and say hello to that extra 20 pounds!  This place will have you loosening your belt as you walk through the door.  Huge portions and make sure you take a friend to share dessert or else you may be waddling down Pike St  when you're done.
Peter P.,"Seattle, WA",90,34,1,2.0,4/22/2007,"I'm a huge fan of cheese cake not so much the cheese cake factory! I mean it's just like claim jumper and spaghetti factory. It's like this, after a hour your food arrives and what do you get? Huge portions of average food.. Just like red robin."
Lisa N.,"Seattle, WA",194,397,101,2.0,6/22/2009,"I've been here a few times, but my most recent visit was a little disappointing. We came in a large group (around 30 people!) with a reservation and they didn't seem all too ready for us. I understand that it's a pretty big party to accommodate, but they were a little unorganized about it. Our server completely skipped over two people on our end of the table when taking drink/appetizer orders (myself included!) and then almost skipped us again when taking orders later on-- we actually had to get his attention before he walked away! When he came by to refill water glasses, my neighbours on either side of me received water and I was ignored. Later, a raspberry lemonade was ordered and never delivered to our table. Also, we specifically asked for an entree to be split (which I KNOW that they do, as they've done it for me before) and it came to our table all together on one plate with no side plate to even divide it ourselves. Overall, not the best experience, but I suppose our large group was partially to blame."
Kristin S.,"Palo Alto, CA",86,334,,5.0,4/2/2006,The good kind of chain:) Don't skip the cheesecake! I love the portion size- yay America!
Kim S.,"Seattle, WA",1,95,,2.0,3/15/2010,OVERPRICED. Food was not worth it for a 45 minute wait and then receiving our food with ingredients we specifically asked to omit. The service was average. The only thing they have going for them is the cheesecake. The atmosphere is like you're in a Vegas hotel.
ira g.,"Renton, WA",30,98,67,5.0,11/27/2007,"I always loved their Shrimp Bistro Pasta and Chicken Madeira. In fact, i just had dinner there and it was a great dinner. Me and my family loved the atmosphere and service. This is a regular dining stop for us."
Ria D.,"Seattle, WA",24,13,,3.0,8/20/2008,Cheescake factory is always busy. Seems like you always have to wait to be seated unless you come at a lucky time. The food is alright but I like their cheesecake :)
Stacy O.,"Seattle, WA",2,38,,1.0,5/4/2008,"We were extremely disappointed with our Cheesecake factory visit today.  Yes the food was okay, but the service was horrible.  We hardly ever saw our waitress, and even the man who I think was the manager walked around looking bored and annoyed.  Big shocker that the rest of his staff did the same.  How about stopping at an occasional table and checking in on people Mr. Manager eh?  The final straw was the ladies room was completely out of toilet paper.  I mentioned this to a waitress and then walked back into the bathroom where I noticed the hostess in the bathroom.  I mentioned to her none of the stalls had tp and she said, ""I'd grab some more but I'm on break.""  Nice, real nice.  Turns out the tp was in a cabinet outside of the bathroom, would it have been so hard to walk 10 steps to grab a few rolls to put in there?  So not impressed.  Will not be returning."
Paulina C.,"San Francisco, CA",231,131,,3.0,11/15/2007,"i like cheesecake factory.    no i hate it.   i like it.    oh no, i hate it.    i can't make up my mind.  sometimes it's good and other times it's blehhhh..... i've had a few good parties here, but the last time i was here....i was too busy admiring the three girls who sat across from me to really pay attention to my meal...... miss vain constantly flipped her hair and kept checking herself out in the mirror.  after she was done making love to her mirror, she asked one of the other girls to take a picture of her, like FIVE times!  and then another THREE of her drink, and a few more shots with her holding her drink.  then she wanted to take a picture with the girl sitting next to her, okay TWO shots, then one with them both holding their drinks.  the third girl didn't have a drink so she felt left out and decided to order herself a drink.  then she handed her camera to one of the girls sitting across from her and asked her to take a picture of her and her drink.  okay she wasn't half as bad as the other two, but my god!  why the hell do you need ten million shots of yourself, you and your drinkie, at cheesecake factory?  oh and you thought it stopped there?  no, they took pictures each time the dishes came, and then one picture of all the dishes.  same goes for dessert!  HOLY MOTHER OF GOD!!!! it's a shame they are not celebrities, especially miss vain.  she would totally enjoy the attention of the paparazzi!  if i needed the money, i would've walked over.... ""you like me take picture for you?  velly cheap!  only 20 dollas, unlimited shots for 5 minutes""."
S C.,"Langley, Canada",8,231,,4.0,12/15/2008,"4 stars only for their Chinese chicken salad.  I don't remember liking anything else either stuff I've ordered or my friends have orderd (except for the cheese cakes, of course!!)  I'd go for early or really late lunch to avoid waiting- not worth more than 10-15 minute wait.  If I'm really really craving the salad, I might give them 20 minutes."
