Destiny O.,"Greater Duwamish, Seattle, WA",390,12,19,5.0,7/26/2017,"I really enjoy coming to the Cheesecake Factory. It can be very busy and loud sometime but the inside is beautiful and fancy with dim lighting and amazing detail . My favorite part about Cheesecake Factory is the menu! Biggest menu I've ever seen with a little bit of everything to suite the mood your in . I love the chicken maderia , catfish and their steak . Everything I have ate here is always delicious and they give you big portions. They also have tasty cocktails & mojitos . Good service . It is a little bit more pricier here but worth every dollar!"
Barbara F.,"Navarre, FL",84,58,58,3.0,12/4/2016,Great atmosphere.  Bland foods. Awesome cheesecakes. A little pricey.
Kim M.,"Portland, OR",63,42,12,4.0,7/30/2017,I always order the same thing - Chinese Chicken Salad - you can never go wrong with that - it was great!
Claudia P.,"Vancouver, Canada",37,5,6,5.0,7/17/2017,"Came here last night with the family for dinner after shopping. We had an early dinner at 4pm and were seated promptly with no wait. Our server (I think his name was Ken?) was friendly and took the time to introduce the menu to us and was super accommodating to our requests. I had the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic and the sauce was rich and pasta perfectly al dente. Some of my family ordered the steak medallions and the dish was delicious as well!  Drinks and dinner came quickly and Ken made several rounds to refill our drinks as well as get us more bread. While packing our leftovers he also offered to grab to-go cups for our drinks and packed us some extra bread for the trip home. Though we were too full to have cheesecake in the restaurant, we did order a few slices to go and enjoy back home. Living in Canada, the Cheesecake Factory is always a special treat and worth the trip down south, but tonight the outstanding service made the experience exceptional. Can't wait to come back next time!"
Juan Miguel J.,"Seattle, WA",54,1,,1.0,4/17/2017,Terrible branch. We were standing( we were told that we will be seared shortly)  in the front counter for minutes and non of the staff bothered on entertainig us alhough there are 4 people just standing around. Instead they entertained this one guy who i believe they know personally outside work and not us the guest.
Olivia H.,"Mount Vernon, WA",46,5,2,1.0,12/5/2017,"I gave Cheesecake a second chance after they cancelled a reservation for a party I was in without warning. The manager I later talked to about that issue was very helpful and even gave me a gift card in hopes I would give them another chance. I did and that was a mistake. Me and a friend of mine were sat next to some younger teens that while we were less than 2 feet away started mocking us for speaking in ASL (as I am trying to teach my friend) this after they had made a racist joke that we overheard. As far as the food went I was disappointed. I had ordered ""Evelyn's Favorite Pasta"" and when it came barely warm and rather than having Pine Nuts on it like the menu said it would, It had unsalted sunflower seeds. It seemed like a way for the restaurant to cheap out hoping no one would notice. So, overall the restaurant was overcrowded, the people there were rude and the food was decent at best. Really excited to not come back."
Cathy D.,"Seattle, WA",28,39,94,4.0,2/16/2016,"I have always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory Downtown Seattle and Bellevue location since my high school years. As we did not have one in my hometown, it lives fondly in a memory of a place of celebration and big city dreams. Now as a yuppie, I am venturing to their happy hour which is the focus of this review. I was unaware Cheesecake Factory had a Friday night happy hour until my friend recommended it as a place to avoid large crowds. I loved her description of the happy hour. ""It's not the cool place for happy hour so it's pretty low key but the food is delicious."" I honestly hate crowds and lines with a passion so.. Sounds perfect to me!  The HH bar location is first come, first serve. It was super empty when I got there around 4:30. By the time we left at 6:30, there were vultures waiting for our table. My friend didn't even finish putting on her coat to leave before someone tried to sit at our table! There is a mixture of young and older professionals/couples in the bar area... Therefore people don't care too much about rudeness and perception. I don't recommend a large after work group here unless you all show up at 4 PM sharp!  The happy hour menu is as diverse as you would expect from Cheesecake Factory. There are multiple delicious options for $5 with generous portions. The drinks were $6-7 and had a good balance of tasty and ""whoohoo I'm getting a buzz!"" I wish there was happy hour cheesecake! But alas, there isn't so I brought some home to-go . On a final note, the wait staff was surprisingly attentive despite how filled the bar area was. My water was consistently full and as soon as my alcoholic beverage was gone, I was given the option to order another. I will 100% be back to try more items on the menu with my yuppie posse.  TLDR: Americanized menu of $5 Noms. Not too busy before 6."
Robert C.,"Seattle, WA",22,10,8,5.0,1/6/2017,Great restaurant. Long line due to recent grand opening.  But the wait was worthwhile.
Yarina V.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",889,95,354,5.0,7/22/2017,"I just love this place. There isn't one near where I live, so every time I see one while traveling, it's a must stop. We got the classic cheesecake, which is hard to beat... I still don't know what's in it that makes it so good, but I do not rule out some sort of controlled substance. Then, to keep things interesting, I got the bacon cheesesticks (or something like that) and they were amazing like everything else here. They came with a cute marinara sauce and had like 900 calories but they were worth it. The Cheesecake Factory is the perfect place to eat something you know is going to be delicious at a way better price than an upscale restaurant. Not the trendiest or coolest, but consistent, reliable comfort food. I just didn't get anything else because I was really full and because i shouldn't have been there in the first place, and I wanted to come back the next day but my husband said no :( so we went to a Spanish place that wasn't nearly as good. I just wanted more cheesecake, more greasy appetizers and more sweet drinks and another 5,000 calorie visit, but I'll just have to wait until the next time I am lucky enough to visit another Happiness Factory."
Kayla M.,"Seattle, WA",52,26,30,5.0,5/11/2017,Customer service was phenomenal... which made up for our food being incredibly late! One of the many reasons we absolutely love coming here! We are always taken care of if something goes wrong... even if something doesn't!
Laurel J.,"Silverdale, WA",138,31,62,3.0,2/27/2016,"I've been here on multiple occasions for their decadent cheese cake & tasty food  I docked them: a star for not allowing reservations  a star for not showing the price of drinks credit/debit family friendly cheesecake - around $7 each (also have a chocolate gluten free option) good place for a casual date or semi formal date   efficient customer service- never had to wait too long, even at its busiest times. has a counter where you can pop in and buy a cheesecake, by itself, as takeout."
Katie H.,"Seattle, WA",330,147,29,4.0,12/31/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is easy- you will wait, but you will end up with decent food and great cheesecake.  End of story. While waiting for a table is akin to being herded like a cattle, once you get seated, the wait staff is really good.  The menu is huge, and it's pretty easy to find something you will like.  Do keep in mind that this is a ""little bit of everything"" restaurant, so you Thai food will not be as good as a local place down the street.  I've always had good luck with their American fare.   The 2 standout menu items for me- fried macaroni and cheese and the desserts.  I often times get the fried macaroni and cheese as an entree (even though it is listed as an appetizer), and I'm always glad that I did. The cheesecake menu is intensely long.  Fun fact, the Godiva cheesecake is gluten free.  I've also had their carrot cake and chocolate cake- each were fantastic."
John L.,"Santa Clara, CA",2,60,,5.0,6/16/2017,"My family have been to a number of these restaurants as I call them the Big Cheese as I left the ""cake"" out only because they so rich! Sorry about that, but the food is among the most rich, self indulging and tastiest chef designs for a splurge that adds five pounds on me just thinking of the Factory restaurants. Please keep me away! However, a special occasion will usually come up and these restaurants are impossible to resist! Help! Every dish is yummy, even the meatloaf is great! Am i alone on this? I really doubt that, and we can tell when and where the best cooking activities with the talk of town destinations on any special day. Enjoy!"
Markus M.,"Seattle, WA",9,5,,3.0,6/14/2017,"Pretty typical cheescake factory. This service here wasn't as good as the southcenter location. I only got one refill on my cola, and it was after having to flag the waiter down. The food was satisfying, and the atmosphere was not bad."
Heidi I.,"Everett, WA",6,3,,1.0,5/13/2017,"I am hugely disappointed in this restaurant for how they ruined prom night for my daughter and her friends! First of all they did not take reservations which seems ridiculous for such a busy establishment. The kids drove down from Everett to have a nice dinner with their dates and for their trouble,  8 kids in prom attire waited for 2 hours and left with no dinner before prom! There is no excuse for that!"
Victoria O.,"New York, NY",686,721,322,4.0,5/2/2015,"Facebook friends gave me all manner of s*** for eating at ""chain restaurants"" during my boyfriend's APA national conference. But we don't have a Cheesecake Factory in Santa Barbara (insufficient population density) and the Brentwood location closed ages ago. Sherman Oaks is okay but parking a hassle.  And I love the low-carb cheesecake. It's lighter than the regular and I can't tell that they use Splenda rather than sugar. Also it's fast and easy, both draws for a lunch between conference sessions.  They have a new under 600 calorie menu with many options, all of which look terrific. I had a vegetable salad with a terrific pomegranate dressing. It was fresh and excellent except for the beets, half of which were so undercooked I felt like I was biting into a carrot.  The service is always good and for a chain, I think CF is great, particularly with this new ""Skinnylicious"" menu.  It's not fine dining but it's more than adequate. I thought boyfriend's Chinese chicken salad one of the better ones I've had. The chicken was tender and the dressing a perfect blend of sweet and tangy."
Lynne H.,"San Diego, CA",0,27,1,5.0,2/4/2017,"I can't believe I'm doing this.  Yes, our food and service tonight were top-notch.  On par with fine French and Italian restaurants in all but atmosphere -- it does remind me of cruise ship decor -- not offensive, but a bit gaudily ho-hum? . Our wait on Sunday evening was predicted to be 30 minutes.  It was 35.  Fine.  The two of us were seated at a booth for 4.  Lovely for my back and for pushing all that winter clothing to one side. We were looking for simpler food, so we skipped the appetizers and deep-fried temptations.  I'm usually suspicious of ""light"" and ""skinny"" menus, but Cheesecake Factory has my respect on this. Amazing options and execution..   We chose the French country salad, with asparagus, beets, pecans, and goat cheese.  We shared this, and it was quite generous.  The asparagus was cut into bite-sized rounds and perfectly cooked with just a smidge of crunch.  The beets were sweet and there were plenty of them.   And the dressing was a very light, delicate vinaigrette, on par with the one we enjoyed at the French restaurant two nights ago.  By the way, our salad was the same price as that one, and about three times as large.  Size isn't the most important attribute of a portion, but really, greens aren't that expensive.  Sharing this gave us each a nice healthy serving, which we ooh-ed and ah-ed over while trying not to eat it too fast! On to our main course.  We shared the Tuscan chicken.  It came beautifully plated with nice  piles of sauteed (or roasted) cherry tomatoes surrounding three chicken breast filets, well sauced and tender.  More perfectly cooked asparagus spears.  The capers and artichoke hearts added to the depth of flavors.  There was a small pile of farro underneath.  Every last morsel was enjoyed. We did have two baskets of bread.  I went for the brown bread, having forgotten how yummy is, with its molasses sweetness.  I could overdo this easily.  (I have to admit, though, that the French restaurant served some grainy seeded bread I liked even more, but that's another review!) We didn't think we had room for dessert but succumbed to the Godiva chocolate cheesecake.  We ate half and took half home. The mounds of whipped cream didn't hurt. Our waiter, Taylor, completed this experience with his quiet but friendly expertise.  More bread appeared.  Bread was sent home with us, along with butter. (Thoughtful!  We are staying in a hotel.) The remainder of the cheesecake was packaged up.  I make cheesecake, but not quite as decadent as this, so it was a treat. The whole thing was a treat, actually, and we didn't go rolling out feeling like we had eaten to excess.  Our meals were rated at under 600 calories for the chicken and 400 for the salad!  (Don't ask me about the bread and butter, but at 500 for the whole dinner, I could afford some, eh?) Cheesecake Factory, you go to the top of the list!"
Rana N.,"Everett, WA",0,1,,4.0,11/14/2016,"I had the Hibachi Steak and the food was delicious.They put the steak in a middle of the plate and they put tempura asparagus, wasabi mashed potatoes, shiitake mushrooms, onions, and wasabi mashed potatoes around it. The steak was really tender and full-flavoured because the steak sauce makes the steak bring out the great tasty. So the steak by itself is delicious enough but  If you eat their steak with bread or rice, you will be astonished by the taste! Also, a side menu was abundant. However, I didn't like the asparagus because it was really bland. Unfortunately, the wasabi mashed potato was much too creamy. The steak is really amazing! When I remember the steak it always makes me mouth-water! I also ate the cheesecake. They have so many different kind of cheesecake.I had tried most of their cheesecake, but my favorite is a Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake because it  is the most creamy and smooth; moreover, Godiva Chocolate makes cheesecake more rich in taste. Therefore,  If you really like creamy texture, you should try the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  In Cheesecake Factory, they bring two different kind of bread at the beginning. Anyway, it was really good because it goes well  with any different kind of food. What's more,  my favorite drink is a mango smoothie. They put orange, strawberry, and pineapple on stick in the smoothie. The smoothie tasty was little bit acidic and fruity, so It goes well with the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.               In Seattle downtown the Cheesecake Factory, it is always full of people. Even though I was really hungry, I had to wait around 20-30 minute; moreover, it had taken so much time until the food came to me. So, if you are in a hurry to eat dinner, I recommend you should go on the restaurant in Bellevue Square. It  is much faster than their  Seattle downtown store. I think anywhere there is a Cheesecake Factory, it is good because their customer service is really good and we always can enjoy the delicious foods."
Thomas B.,"San Francisco, CA",2,60,6,2.0,9/19/2016,"After a second email, the corporate office finally contacted me.  The location manager never refunded the meal as promised, which is absolutely inappropriate...especially since it was actually given back to them.  The corporate office offered a gift card, though, which I appreciated despite the lengthy delay."
Tiffany M.,"Honolulu, HI",40,23,30,3.0,4/11/2017,Had a long wait for drinks I'd say about 10 minutes. The wings were not the best. There cheesecake however was very huge and yummy.
