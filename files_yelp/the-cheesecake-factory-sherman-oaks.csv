Kathy Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",719,123,662,4.0,12/27/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory location was my childhood favorite. The wait was 45-75 minutes, even back then, and we'd walk around Tower Records to kill time. Side note: RIP, Tower Records. In addition to a sourdough bread binge, I would order the chicken potstickers, children's pasta (bowties with just butter!) and the chocolate mousse cheesecake... every time. Don't fix what isn't broken, amIright? Well, years and years later, the Cheesecake Factory is still standing and still delivering delicious food. The wait is either terrible or nonexistent, and I haven't yet figured that part out. Sunday brunch isn't crowded, though, so there's that. Nowadays, I'm still binging on sourdough bread. I've since moved on to the Pasta Da Vinci -- hold the onions, swap out the chicken for extra mushrooms. I'll also order an appetizer of some sort -- perhaps the chicken potstickers, quesadilla, avocado egg rolls(!) or fried calamari.  They didn't have the ""small plates"" section way back when, and those are delicious... but quite small. Loaded baked potato tots, crispy crab bites, and ahi tartare are my picks. They are small, though, and not quite worthy of sharing. I always save room for dessert whenever possible, but I usually end up taking it home. The cheesecake varieties have boomed (as have the prices) and I've fallen in love with something new every so often. I recommend the dulce de leche caramel, the caramel pecan turtle, the salted caramel, the white chocolate raspberry truffle, or the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake... Notice a pattern? ;)  Note: The cheesecakes are VERY sweet and VERY rich. I can't take in that much sugar in one sitting, so I recommend sharing and taking the slice home. The restaurant validates, so don't forget to turn over your ticket to the server. They don't have machines lying around for you to do it yourself."
Melody K.,"Los Angeles, CA",621,265,78,1.0,1/5/2018,"RIP Cheesecake Factory :(  Came here for a quick bite. Ordered old classics, Buffalo Blast and Cesar Salad. Salad was drowning in dressing and the buffalo blast was so salty it turned bitter in the mouth. Sent the buffalo blast back incase just that round had been messed up, but no, the entire batch was ruined. Ordered a cheesecake with strawberries, and am I crazy or were their slices kinda generous before? I got a tiny slice like the kind you get from Vons. Shame shame shame. Â  The server was friendly but what's the point of friendly servers in a restaurant when the food is garbage?"
Ika I.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",28,141,411,4.0,12/14/2017,"Great service and generous portion! I came here for a holiday lunch with my coworkers and everyone had a great time there. The menu selection is huge and I personally think it will be less confusing if the menu is more condensed.  As for the food, you can choose anything from tacos, pasta, seafood and salad. They also have a huge selection of cheesecake. I ordered the grilled fish taco and it came with very generous portion of 4 tacos and side of rice. There is also unlimited bread served before your meal.  My entree was around $16 and other entrees were between $15-$25. The generous serving size allows one to pack the leftover for a second meal.  Our waiter was also very friendly and attentive and the ambiance felt classy and family friendly.  Overall, a decent restaurant that caters to everyone."
Jennifer S.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",304,78,24,3.0,1/6/2018,"The food and service is always wonderful, but the process of getting a table is a problem. My party and I check in and were told it would be 20 minutes. We took the pager and relaxed outside. 40 minutes later we went inside to see if there was an update and they said it would be a little longer. 5 minutes later the pager buzzed but we didn't get a table for another 10 minutes. And that whole front area is a zoo.  Anyways, tonight our waiter was fabulous. I have zero complaints about him. I ordered an item I had never had and it was really good. As always, I recommend coming during the week when they aren't as busy."
David B.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,17,18,5.0,1/5/2018,"I've been here multiple times and I have never had a bad experience. The only one thing that happened was a long wait, about two hours but it was on a special occasion which is expected. Either way, the food is always fresh and tasteful. A must for all the locals."
Daizah P.,"La Mirada, CA",223,6,3,3.0,11/28/2017,"Today is my 21st birthday, one of the most memorable ages of our lives. I come, greet the server, etc. My GF tells them it is my birthday after we order our drinks. He says, ""Oh Wow. Finally legal (very dry)."" Then he carries on. After that, I hear nothing from him, he zooms by us, my water was not refilled once by him.  So I try telling another nearby server about my birthday. She turns around and just says, ""Okay. Tell your server."" No appreciation of the customer. I do not like this. However, the food was delicious, as expected!  Poor, poor customer service."
Arielle P.,"Los Angeles, CA",538,150,339,4.0,11/8/2017,"From classic favorites like Pizza and burgers, to specialty meat dishes- and inspired from cultures all across the board, it's hard to go wrong.  Food: Definitely go with the Avocado Rolls and Fried Calamari for your starters, and they also serve up two types of bread + butter for the table. Their main courses are usually very good, my favorite dish is definitely the Da Vinci Pasta because the sauce is SO tasty- the chicken is usually a little dry though so I recommend subbing for shrimp. My most recent trip I ordered the steak tacos- I was with a large party and I know they like to bring out food all together- but my steak was cold, like just made It out of the fridge, cold. Their Chinese Chicken Salad is really good too, big portion, I would ask for half the dressing or dressing on the side.   Service: I do think that the servers here are above par of a normal restaurant, as you'd hope they be considering their locations are usually huge, to match their huge and probably very difficult to remember, menus. Our server took off my steak tacos and comp'd us a dessert for the inconvenience. *PRO TIP- they won't sing happy birthday and make a scene if the BIRTHDAY person doesn't agree to it...*"
Nicole C.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",3,11,16,5.0,12/29/2017,"My boyfriend & I have been coming to this establishment for years. We usually visit about once a week and sit in the bar, however tonight when we came in all the seats in the bar were full so we grabbed a booth in the restaurant. Antwyon was our server and his service was unbelievable! He was attentive, considerate, made us laugh, & went above & beyond with his customer service! We go out to eat for all of our meals on a daily basis & he provided better customer service then we have received at any other restaurant! This guy deserves a promotion! You guys have a true gem here in your company! Antwyon thank you very much! We will be requesting you from here on out!"
Laurie L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",68,183,222,3.0,11/11/2017,"The Shiela's chicken and avocado salad was a bit boring and lacking avocado, my dining companion's filet mignon (don't order this cut at a cheesecake factory) was all tendon and chewy these are the only two complaints of the evening.  The gumbo was excellent and so was the bacon bacon burger. The coffee and sexy cheesecakes delivered on all levels of sinful satisfaction!"
Melanie W.,"Studio City, CA",378,25,101,5.0,10/5/2017,For a big chain restaurant they still keep it classy and delicious. I love their menu because they have a great selection.  I've been here a couple of times and I'm always happy.  Last time we were there Antoine was our server and he was very friendly and attentive.  Good food & good service - you can't go wrong.
Caitlyn J.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,1.0,1/4/2018,"1 hour wait just to be seated. While the server was phenomenal, the food wasn't. We ordered clam chowder, calamari, Cajun pasta, & orange chicken. Both of us left with FOOD POISONING. I felt sick immediately after eating, while s/o got sick on the way back to hotel. Completely disappointing considering the money we spent and the rep that Cheesecake Factory has."
Julie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,12,1,1.0,11/13/2017,"THIS PLACE HAS RATS. IN THE DINING AREA. That is all you need to know.  There I was sitting in the bar when suddenly a GIANT rat crawled along the lighting in the ceiling. A guy next to me started recording and a busboy told him to post it and tag this place because he had been telling them about this problem for a long time but management does nothing.  It literally just hung out there in the ceiling lighting area just crawling around. What can you do? It disappeared for a while (probably to the kitchen for a snack) and the manager came by and gave us this whole story about ""construction"" above them creating this ""issue,"" suggesting that they aren't ground level, e.g., in the kitchen (getting a snack). He told us everything was on him today, so I ordered a third drink, knowing I wasn't going to be able to eat my food when it arrives. THEN THE GIANT RAT RETURNED...apparently it couldn't get enough of the dining area and it just hung out there, right above peoples heads and PLATES.  IT GETS BETTER...the manager then clears all customers from the bar area, gets on a ladder, and with a garbage bag in hand, in front of at least 100 diners, GRABS THE RAT WITH HIS HAND.  Literally the most appalling/heroic thing I've ever seen in the middle of Sunday lunch rush at a Cheesecake Factory. Corporate HQ please give that manager a big raise because he most definitely DOES NOT GET PAID ENOUGH FOR WHAT HE HAD TO DO and potentially getting black plague for what you probably pay him.  The end."
Melanie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",306,946,1535,4.0,4/28/2017,"Happy hour review. Happy hour is M-F 4-6PM They have select beer, wine, well drinks, and cocktails for $5.95. They also have a large number of appetizers for $5.95 as well. I was not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised that their happy hour drinks and food were much better than anticipated. The HH burger comes with 2 thin patties but very tasty. You can add a side of fries for $1.55. The nachos is a large portion of crispy chips with fairly flavorless cheese, but refreshing guacamole, sour cream, and tomatoes. Â  Bar service was attentive and friendly. The bar area has plenty of bar seating and multiple, surrounding tables.  parking - 2 hours free with validation in the Galleria garage"
Jennifer C. L.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",1360,441,429,5.0,3/26/2017,"This place is the beating heart of the Sherman Oaks Galleria. We were told on a Saturday night it would be an hour wait at 7pm. Â  We went around to the other restaurants in the galleria to see if we had a better chance at eating sooner. The earliest we were told by PF Changs was the same.  We struck a little bit of luck at Buffalo Wild Wings where it would only take 45 minutes. So we trekked it over that way. We were being seated when our buzzer went off for the Cheesecake Factory.  We got up and went over in a split second. Besides the wait...our dining experience was superb to say the least.  I loved their skinilicious menu that gave a variety of options from cocktails, appetizers, salads, to entrees.  I ordered their salmon dish on that menu and it was the perfect meal that I was craving for.  It was served with a perfection of green beans, carrots, and a side of tartar sauce.  The Cheesecake Factory definitely knows how to satiate your soul even on a skinilicious menu."
Becky B.,"Burbank, CA",7,105,354,3.0,11/26/2017,"We only came here because we had a gift card sitting around for about a year. We've been to this location before, and it's always good-tasting food, but trying to get healthy options can be super-loaded with sodium. Service was okay, there was a bit of mayhem at the front hostess station, and they didn't seem to have a handle on the waiting crowd. We ordered a lot of small plates and the spicy buffalo chicken sandwich. The stuffed mushrooms were okay. There was a beef broth style of sauce at the bottom of the pan, and it was mostly salt-based. The avocado egg rolls were very mediocre. I was hoping for a bit more seasoning or a textural difference inside, but it was pretty much just bland avocado. I did see small bits of red onion, but there was no taste evidence of it. The crunchy chicken samosas were probably the most unexpectedly tasty option out of all the small plates. The grilled cheese strips are not worth it. Save your money and make it at home. Literally, it's just a grilled cheese sandwich (no fancy cheese or anything) with bacon in it. The spicy buffalo chicken sandwich rocked! The buffalo sauce was a bit sporadic, but the piece of fried chicken was huge and gorgeously crispy. We were getting a bit full when we dove into the sandwich, so we opted to take off the bun, and honestly, it was better with the bun off! The bread added nothing to the sandwich. Overall, if you're in the area, and the other ""higher end"" eatery in the area (used to be one chain of Mexican cuisine, but as of last weekend, a new place was going in), this might be something for you. But of course, they're known for their cheesecakes."
Mark P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",32,7,1,5.0,12/15/2017,"always come here on my bday. delicious food, staff are very friendly, nice place to celebrate any occution, definitely will come back again"
Clint C.,"San Fernando, Los Angeles, CA",0,151,6,5.0,12/30/2017,Great food the prices are reasonable for this type of restaurant. The parking was easy to get into and out of. Â The service was good a little slow on the food but overall a good experience
Ashley V.,"Los Angeles, CA",107,13,,1.0,12/6/2017,"I've placed 4 take out orders over the last few months. Each one was incorrect. They make no effort to make amends. The food is fine. But not worth the headache. There are lots of other much better places. Go across the street to Public School. The food, drinks and service are all much better."
Alyssa T.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,19,25,4.0,12/2/2017,"My only ""complaint"" is for the hostess/hosts to be clear when they call that our table was ready. Apparently someone else was seated instead of my party (group of 5). But after the mix up, another table was ready for us so we only waited just a few more minutes.  I enjoy coming to cheesecake factory and I'm glad my party wasn't too hangry or the extra wait time would have made the experience unpleasant.  Good food and ambience for casual/semi-formal dining."
Shalom N.,"Los Angeles, CA",372,54,41,4.0,8/31/2017,"There's always a wait it's sometimes worth it if you enjoy their food. I got sat by the kitchen which kinda sucks nobody wants to sit where there's constantly people going in and out and it's loud. However, the service is generally attentive and polite good comes pretty quick, and is really delicious. I got steak Diane and I was pleased. Usually I get the appetizers too cause they have an array of goodies, just wasn't in the mood. Thanks cheesecake!"
Rip K.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,140,62,5.0,8/14/2017,Came here for breakfast with a couple of friends and it was delicious! I got the mushroom and bacon omelet with tomatoes on the side and a side order of avocados. It was a bit oily. Maybe from the mushrooms but it was delicious regardless. I believe there was spinach in it too. I didn't like our waitress. She wasn't friendly at all. When I was asking for stuff such as an order of coffee she made it seem like it was a hassle for her. Not very friendly at all.
Nikki K.,"Los Angeles, CA",995,100,225,5.0,1/30/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night during the dinner rush and we really wanted some cheesecake, so we decided to endure the 45 minute wait. Let me start off by saying that I commend the hostesses and hosts that handle the front line of the chaos of this restaurant. They were all extremely pleasant and had smiles on their faces, even when the mob of hungry angry customers asked when their tables would be ready every 10 minutes.  Since we had a lot of time to decide what we wanted to eat, we asked our waitress if we could order as soon as we were seated. The four cheese pasta and BBQ burger w sweet potato fries were delicious. My boyfriend and I agreed that the fries were the best that we ever had because they were cooked just right and tasted hot & fresh (I forgot to take pictures of our food because we were so hungry and dug in as soon as the food came haha). We also ordered the Hazlenut Crunch and Cherry cheesecakes to go and those were delicious (as always).  Our server, Elisabeth, was excellent! She was so sweet and very attentive. She always made sure our water glasses were full and asked if we were doing okay. The quality of the food and service was well worth the wait!"
Betty M.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,12,2,3.0,11/16/2017,Have tried to order Dinner to be delivered via Door Dash. Â 2nd time in 3 days my order was cancelled because the restaurant was closed when the drivers arrived. Â The delivery service wasn't notified the restaurant was closed. Signed into Yelp to find that this CF location had recent issues with a rat in the bar area. Oops! Hope their able to get it resolved soon!!
Bonnie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",112,516,615,3.0,3/29/2017,"Choices of dining are surprisingly limited in this area, especially if you're going to the Galleria to watch a movie! The calories on the enormous menu are pretty concerning, so I went with the Skinnylicious Lemon Garlic Shrimp - Sauteed shrimp, basil, tomato and lemon garlic sauce, served with asparagus and angel hair. It was the perfect amount of food, and I felt better about it too. My fiance had the factory grande burrito. Literally the most enormous burrito, with chicken, cheese, cilantro rice, onions and peppers, served with guac, sour cream, salsa, and black beans. I literally could have made it into 3 meals. Again, very tasty, but it was like 2200 calories."
Jasmine H.,"Los Angeles, CA",323,36,17,3.0,9/13/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is one of those restaurants that sounds good but once I'm there, I remember why I almost never go.  I was at Cheesecake for almost 2 hours and 75% of the time I was either waiting for a table or waiting for our food.  I got the four cheese pasta and it honestly tasted like there was only one cheese...the big dollop of ricotta on top of the plate. I also tried the guacamole and it tasted like it came out of a container. There were bits of overripe avocado that was brown and mushy, definitely offputting.  I would've given 2 stars if it wasn't for our waitress, Heather. As a family of 6, we're usually a handful but Heather was so attentive and so genuine!! Also today was my lucky day cause Kanye West came waltzing in while I was waiting to be seated :)"
Vanessa Donna M.,"Burbank, CA",360,173,382,4.0,12/29/2016,"This place always seems hectic once you walk-in the door. Everyone standing around right in front of the door really seems like your going to wait there for hours! My friend and I walked up to the hostess and put down my name for four. Wait time was 30-35 minutes. As we waited for our other two friends to arrive, they called us to be seated. Our waiter was...well he did attend to us pretty decent. Although he was not having it with my friends jokes, I guess because we know him we thought he was funny. Our waiter did not, he kinda snapped back at him with a smart ass answer, but I get it lol. Food? I ordered the spaghetti & meatballs ($16.50). Now usually when I go to Cheesecake Factory I only go for the Chicken Costoletta ($16.95), but since I wanted some pasta, I ordered the spaghetti. It had flavor, however the meatballs were pretty darn tough. Either the cooks over worked the meatballs OR they were frozen meatballs. Either way the meatballs were tough, not even a knife was able to cut through them. My friends ordered the Almond Crusted Salmon Salad (one gluten-free) and that damn salad was delicious! Not to mention the Pineapple Moscow Mule ($11) and the Godiva Flourless Cake...yum! Next time I go i'll make sure to avoid the spaghetti and meatballs and either stick to my Chicken Costoletta or that delicious salmon salad."
Nellie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,235,162,4.0,12/17/2017,"Typical Cheesecake Factory. I have been to maybe all locations in the Los Angeles area and I never had any issues at this location. Unlike other locations, this one has staff that is attentive and fast and I appreciate that. It is located at a mall and the parking structure is far away so that is the only problem I have. Red Velvet cheesecake is the best!"
Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,1.0,7/3/2017,"So we had a business meeting in the area and we chose Cheesecake Factory again due to my last visit in Brea. Â That was really good. Â However, if this was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory, it would be my last. I was thinking to myself, 'how can this be part of the same chain'? Â Everything was so different. Â The service was terrible, the food was bad, the overall experience was just plain dreadful. We arrived upon opening to avoid the crowds. Â Ordered the Fried Zucchini as an appetizer. Â I was telling everyone that these would be the best they ever had. Â This was based on my last visit in Brea. Â Boy, was I wrong and embarrassed! Â The Fried Zucchini was the blandest, plain undercooked Fried Zucchini I have ever had. Â I had egg on my face and my friends let me know it. Â Embarrassing to say the least. The salad as ordered came out just the opposite and had to be sent back twice! Â How difficult is it to order a salad and get it right the first time? We ordered our Entree's and again, such a letdown. Â The pasta was stone cold and the chicken was lukewarm at best. Â Again, I raved about the Pesto Pasta and had it substituted for the normal item, again, I should not have done it. Â It was just a terrible dish. In regard to service, our waiter came to us and said he was taking his lunch and the place just opened up. Â We were told another server would be helping him. Â Guess what, I had to go get more napkins, I had to go ask for more water, I had to go get more silverware, I had to get more condiments. Â This was the worst service I have ever experienced!! Â People just dumped us and forgot about us. How can two different establishments be so dramatically different? Â It is called 'a lack of QA' at the Sherman Oak's facility at all levels. Â I really was embarrassed and had to eat crow all day from my friends for a poor choice. Â I really would like to know how it was so bad and different."
C H.,"Gardena, CA",131,218,2,4.0,11/27/2017,Typical cheesecake factory..all the waitstaff are attentive and cheery... food fresh and quick.
Randy B.,"Westlake Village, CA",4983,2338,4473,4.0,4/29/2017,"Expectations always met: great drinks and great big portions. Â You can't beat it. Â You know what you're going to get. Â (PS. Â As Yelp'ers, we like a little mystery and tend to go to boutique places) * Bread & Butter: It's free! Â Amazing and usually warm, a dark bread (like squaw) and a baguette. Â More please!?! * Large menu / large food: Pages and pages of selections, and always leftovers. Â Each plate is 2-3 portions. Â My favs: Chinese Chicken Salad, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Famous Factory Meatloaf, Chicken and Biscuits, Orange Chicken, Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms, and Chicken . Â Ultimate favorite? Â Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. * Great appetizers: I nearly like the apps more than the food. Try the Parmesan-Garlic Cheese Bread, Avocado Eggrolls, Tex Mex Eggrolls, Ahi Carpaccio, and the Fried Calamari. * Cheesecake: galore! Â My favs are: Carrot Cake Cheesecake, White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake, Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake , Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake, Snickers Bar Chunks and Cheesecake, but my absolute fav, Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel Cheesecake. Â (note: I repeated the word ""Cheesecake"", because I can't get enough of it. Â Cheesecake!) =========================== What makes this location unique? =========================== * Valet parking: available. * Part of the Sherman Oaks Galleria. Â Convenient for before/after a movie at the Arclight. * Wonderful patio: A front and side patio. Â Front has sun with umbrella shades (over most) and heat lamps and the side totally in the shade. * The wait: Always, but a lot less at this location as compared to others. Â Sometimes, a little as 10 mins. * Service: always nice, always well-trained."
Lucy F.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,930,538,3.0,7/3/2017,"Its pretty much what you can expect from a cheesecake factory. Come by 5pm if you want to catch any kind of break on the wait. Outside seating is available and really nice on good weather days. The glass partitions help any wind on cooler days.  Menu is just like the rest, a million options making it so hard to select what to eat. Never had any real issues with the food. As always poritins are massive and that honey wheat bread is the absolute best."
Adriana B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,19,4.0,5/29/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is a great place to go with family or a group because it has a huge menu with a variety of foods and flavors. However, be prepared for a long wait because they are usually busy (the reason I rated it 4 stars and not 5).  When it comes to the food, you can never go wrong with their avocado eggrolls as an appetizer. Also, I recently tried their tuna tartare, which had great flavor for a small portion. For my entree I like to get the tuna tataki salad, which is light and healthy but also flavorful. If I'm really hungry, I sometimes go for the Hibachi steak with mashed potatoes, which is a huge portion, or other times I get the Jambalaya which is spicy and delicious.  Overall, I recommend the Cheesecake Factory because of their large variety of flavorful foods."
Ana F.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",52,48,72,1.0,12/6/2017,"Very disappointed at how Sherman Oaks handled my delivery order. My co-worker and I ordered separately online. Both our orders were cancelled with no explanation given. We both attempted to re-order. Doordash delivered her food. My new order did not even go through. So much for lunch plans. It sucks that I have to watch her eat her Cheesecake Factory order, and I have nothing."
Bobby C.,"Canoga Park, CA",403,129,392,5.0,3/22/2017,Monday my friends and I went to see beauty and the beast and we're hungry after. We decided to go to cheese cake factory. We had a party of 9 and they sat us quickly. It was towards the end of the night but we were seated in about 10min. Are waiter was a young gentleman. I wish I remember his name but he gave us excellent service. We got our water and breads immediately. Then we order avocado egg rolls to start. My favorite!! Then we all ordered. See pictures for entrees. I got the chicken bellagio. That was a nice healty tasty plate. Nice check and basil noodles. With an amazing Arugula salad topping. Needed a sauce on top because it was a bit dry. But still really good. Great meal and great service. I'm a happy diner. Thanks!
Cyndi R.,"Puyallup, WA",3,82,31,1.0,11/12/2017,"We had a very nice meal. The place was packed even at 2:00pm. The server was nice and as always the food didn't disappoint. Everyone was happy with their meal and conversation. Then we noticed a ladder in the middle of the bar and no one sitting there. There were also people standing their with their cell phones which was weird. We didn't know what was happening; and a guy climbed up the ladder and pulled a giant rat by the tail. I get it, you are a restaurant and can't control, but I just lost my appetite, and was glad I had already eaten. Not sure how else this could have been handled, I'm sure no one in the other part of the restaurant even knew until people started cheering, but ew"
James B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,4,,5.0,12/11/2017,Great service! Awesome food! Huge portions! What is not to love. The chicken madera is amazing! I always have leftovers to take home!
Lindsey S.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,62,35,1.0,3/9/2017,"I'm a fan of dining in at any other Cheesecake Factory, but unfortunately this Sherman Oaks location is absolutely horrible! For the 4th time in a short period they got my order wrong and then frantically tried to blame the delivery service. I made my custom instructions SO easy to follow & fool-proof each time, yet they still messed up the order. And the manager of this location tried to erroneously blame the delivery service when it was clearly his staff's fault. He kept saying it was an issue with DoorDash. No, it's an issue - consistently - ONLY with your restaurant. Will never order again from this ridiculous place and suggest you don't either."
Tat K.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,6,1,2.0,10/7/2017,"My review isn't about service, as it was great, and it's not about the food which was ok. It's about the cleanliness of the table and the utensils. I hope the branch managers see my photo."
Gina T.,"Santa Paula, CA",13,151,1128,4.0,2/21/2017,"Busy location like all other Cheesecake factories. We waited over an hour for first available during the dinner rush, No shocker here... So we pass the time by shopping across the way at Urban Home.  Dont forget to validate your ticket and pay prior to walking to your car."
Keesha F.,"Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA",647,425,2713,4.0,7/20/2016,"Hibiscus martini for the win!! I came her cuz my friend had a gift card.. Not a big lover of the food but the drinks are awesome! I ordered the well mannered dirty martini #extradirty and the hibiscus martini..  Well mannered was a lil too well mannered, when I say dirty thats what I mean! Not enough olive juice but the three blue cheese stuffed olives made up for the strong alcohol flavor.. Kinda rough but got the job done..   Hibiscus martini was absolutely delicious!! It's on the sweeter spectrum if you like that, but it was by far the Star of the night! We couldn't get seats, so we had drinks while waiting and by the time we were done, 45 min later- there still weren't any available so we grabbed a slice of cheesecake to go and headed over to Public School!"
