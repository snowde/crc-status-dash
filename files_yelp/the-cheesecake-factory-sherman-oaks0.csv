Cassandra Y.,"Burbank, CA",5000,1338,8950,5.0,7/26/2014,"They don't take reservation. Saturday 12 noon... not over crowded. Got seated immediately. The Service: Our server is SUPER attentive. Took great care of us. The food is served in less than 3 minutes!!! Unbelievable~  The Food: Their menu is so big... look like a ""book"". Now they  have separate menu called ""SkinnyLicious Menu""!! Super super  healthy.  Skinnylicious Fresh Vegetable Salad - tons of different kinds of vegetable. The dressing is so light but still very flavorful. As usually, the portion is huge! Sharing will be perfect.  The Parking: Parking structure (Sherman Oaks Galleria). With restaurant validation, 2 hours FREE then $1 per additional hour."
Jeni H.,"Calabasas, CA",816,322,532,5.0,8/12/2015,"I always love cheesecake factories.  Their menus are AWESOME, with so many options, even the pickiest eater can find something. That lactose intolerant, gluten sensitive, vegan Auntie that doesn't like cheese or pepper- even SHE can have a 4 course meal at the Cheesecake Factory! Their prices range from ridiculously cheap to ""not cheap but worth it"" so eating out doesn't have to break the bank. The atmosphere ranges well too; feel like having a drink with the girls? The loungey bar area is nice and the bartender still knows how to open a bottle of champagne or make a slippery nipple shot.  On the flip side, if you're looking for a restaurant that's baby friendly, they always seem to have a stroller friendly table in an area where other kids are louder than yours... so no one even notices when your kid starts singing Elmo songs. The food is great.  I think out of the last 100 times I've eaten here, only 1.5 times have I had to send my food back for a correction.   The cheesecake....oh the cheesecake.  So many to choose from!!! I am seriously infatuated with the Reese's cheesecake here, that their carrot cheesecake...and the red velvet...and the crazy chocolate cake....and the....list goes on.  So good! Most people don't even know they have happy hour at Cheesecake factory's- drinks and appetizers on special.  What a deal!"
Melissa S.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,148,132,2.0,10/19/2016,"went here last night & our server GABRIEL saved our experience from being horrific! the food was off last night ... we ordered avocado toast to start which was so salty we each took one bite & were almost sent into cardiac arrest! then our entrees came out cold!!!!! to our pleasant surprise the manager CAMERON was sent over without our asking for him & he did his best to improve our dining experience by offering the have the dishes remade. of course we did not have to pay for all of the entrees & appetizer but had to pay a portion of our bill - that coupled with the fact that we were able to try a piece of the PUMPKIN PECAN CHEESECAKE saved this review from a single star.  wonderful service, awful food!"
Gennifer B.,"Los Angeles, CA",272,86,45,5.0,5/25/2016,"ALWAYS!!!!!!! Suzanne served us tonight and she was on it!!!! Super friendly and attentive to us! Food was amazing as always...

Asher A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,85,1.0,9/18/2016,"They have very bad service with so rude manager named Serra we asked for a both for 4 people and we was waiting 30 minutes and until we finally got in they asked us to move to small table with 2 chairs and they moved us from are table to this small one we didn't wanted to move but then Serra showed up and said ""it's not a question you moving now or you will have to wait another 30 minutes outside"" that was so so rude  We definitely not recommend this place to nobody"
Fred M.,"Camarillo, CA",10,273,5,1.0,8/30/2015,"I am absolutely astounded by people lining up to wait for a cramped seat in the over crowded noisy Cheesecake Factory. The food is a 1 on a scale of 5 and the noise and atmosphere are a negative 5. The menu is 500 items too long and nothing is appealing. I read the menu 4 times last night and found nothing and I do that each time I've been to the Cheesecake Factory. Except for the burgers (why order a burger at Cheesecake Factory??) and the discontinued caramel chicken, I've never had a single dish that I would order again. If you like to wait to sit in cramped tables, eat really uninspired overpriced food then get in line to join the throngs of people who completely disagree with me."
Shawn A.,"San Diego, CA",12,6,1,4.0,2/27/2017,"I've only been to a Cheesecake Factory once many years ago, so this was a fresh experience for me. It was movie night with my girlfriend. We were dressed in unicorn onesies and just looking for a quick place to eat and drink while we waited to see a movie. The dining room was on a 20 minute wait but there was plenty of open seating at the bar. This was lucky for us as we met the best thing about the place, Erika from Colorado. I work hard n a bar so I notice the little things. She was mixing drinks for the entire dining room from cheese cake factory's infinitely cocktail menu, and she still had time to take care of the entire bar top while carrying on a casual cocktail conversation with us. I don't remember what I ate, or really how good it was, but I do remember how nice she was, even will a full restaurant to take care of."
Nair O.,"Glendale, CA",8,5,,2.0,3/15/2017,"I went with my niece to Cheesecake factory at the Americana, Glendale, CA, we both chose a salad that was to come with caramelized pecans. They left out the pecans.  When we complained, the waiter came with a homeopathic amount in a little plastic cup and said the kitchen would not give more.  I was disappointed. What is happening to Cheesecake Factory??"
Jamie G.,"Beverly Hills, CA",11,22,6,1.0,11/18/2016,"I usually eat at cheesecake a few times a week, Since I work across the street. Today will be the last time. I always order for pick up and the usual girl in the bakery is amazing. Today I get JP apparently he is the manager? Really this guy? Not that competent. I show to get my food the girls in the bakery are scratching there heads they do not know anything about my order..  they go to the manager who took my order... I then have to wait 10 minutes while the guy transfers my check to the bakery and then something was wrong with my food she had to get new fries... seriously get it together. I will be taking a break from the cheesecake."
Suzie B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,86,5,5.0,1/9/2017,"Fav Cheese Cake Factory, best turkey  clubs, marguerita pizza, zucchini sticks! Always hits the spot, my baby loves their spaghetti and meatballs! Sourdough warm bread is DELISH!!"
Bridget L.,"Clearwater, FL",442,43,19,1.0,11/19/2016,I called ahead for cheesecake and ice cream. I was told it would take 25 minutes. Then I was told it will actually be done sooner but she has to quote 25 minutes. I then ask how soon? She says 25 minutes. I say okay so if I come in 25 minutes I won't wait and my ice cream will not be melted? She says I'm quoting you. Then hung up. Needless to say I went next door to wholefoods for cheesecake and ice cream. Don't call ahead. The order takers are not trained. Horrible customer service.
Christina D.,"San Fernando, Los Angeles, CA",83,7,1,5.0,2/19/2017,"Just finished having dinner with family, my drinks, food, and service was exceptional. My servers name was Oscar very polite and attentive which I dearly I appreciated since I know great service is key to a restaurant as prestigious as cheesecake. Haven't been to this location in a while and it never seems to disappoint!"
Tim C.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,4.0,3/8/2017,We went there yesterday for desserts. This place is usually very busy but on a Tuesday it's pretty chill. We got seated right away and our waiter was very nice and friendly. I had the usual: Reese's pieces chocolate cheesecake! Loved it! it's truly a piece of art. Reese's crumbles on the side and a chocolate cheesecake filled with peanut butter. Delicious. You can't ask for anything better than that!!
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,3.0,6/18/2015,"The long wait is almost as famous as the cheesecake which I have to admit I have still yet to try. With the portions they serve, who has room for dessert? Best bet is to come at off times, we went right when they opened and that worked out well. Service is a hit or miss, this time our server was nice and the food came out quickly. The menu is way too much, but that also makes this a place you can take anyone to. Prices are a bit high, but given the portion size its justified. Wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but the food was fine all around."
Fang A.,"Burbank, CA",2,20,2,1.0,4/1/2016,"If I could give negative stars, I would. My friend and I were having a lovely lunch here and she pulled a worm out of her clam chowder. A WORM. They gave her a refund and $25 credit. Posting picture of said worm."
Brian S.,"Winnetka, CA",0,583,137,2.0,6/22/2015,"The family desired ""just regular American food"" for a Father's day celebration and since we were in Sherman Oaks The Cheesecake Factory was the place. The menu is so comprehensive that there is a large ranged of offerings - ""regular American"" as well as dishes inspired by Italy, Mexico, and Asia. Something for everyone! There are aspects of The Cheesecake Factory that seem to open them to ridicule often, and those are true at this outlet too: no reservations, long and uncomfortable wait, very odd ""secondary wait"" after the buzzer buzzes, and spotty service when first seated. Fortunately our wait was not long. Once getting past that we had a nice table on the front patio. Our waitress was sweet and efficient. The food was good... actually, very good... as always. But I almost didn't stay past the first two minutes at the table. My eating utensils, nicely wrapped in a cloth napkin, still had food from the previous user. So did the replacement set... and so did my bread dish. I as totally grossed out at that point. Then I started noticing the significant number of waiters/bus staff with out-of-control hair - both head hair and facial hair. Eeeewwww... and combined with dirty shirts on two of the gentlemen it made me wonder why the management would have them wearing white polo shirts, or didn't ask them to change into clean ones. This Cheesecake Factory seems to have some problems with sanitation... and, yes, I do believe that the water is so hot and the sanitizer is so effective that the utensils/dishes are sanitary.. but residual food on them is still disgusting. For me that transformed a nice family celebration into an hour of trying to repress retching while also trying to enjoy the otherwise decent food.  Had it not been for the sanitation issues, this would have been a 4-star review."
Danielle W.,"Plantation, FL",0,20,1,5.0,8/6/2017,Just like any other Cheesecake Factory in America. Good food. Big portions. Not bad prices. A good go-to chain restaurant!
Maria P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",37,49,55,3.0,10/22/2016,"The wait time is ok, the way they make you wait has 2 phases, phase one, is when you check in and they give you a buzzer and tell you the wait time, which was 15 mins for us. When the buzzer went off, they made us wait in the corner, again! For another 15-20 mins. Ridiculous! If they told us that the air time was 45 mins, we could have just left ! Never again would I believe their wait time ."
Jevonah K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",108,89,150,3.0,12/23/2016,"My boyfriend celebrated his birthday here tuesday evening. We were a group of 8 and got to cheesecake factory around 8pm. We waited for a table about an hour and got seated outside. It was a cold day but the heaters kept us comfortable. The lighting is terrible outside and we couldn't see out menus at all. We had to use our phones to see. Our server Danny was nice and friendly and greeted us right away. He told us there was no more wheat bread which was terrible news as I love that bread more than life. We all ordered drinks, appetizers and entrees pretty close to each other as it was late and we were hungry but Danny said he would put the appetizers in first so we would get it before our meals. I went to the restroom while waiting to eat. It was easy to find and not far but the water was way too hot! My hands turned red from it. I complained about it and was told that the water was approved by some company or something and that it couldn't be altered to a cooler temperature. I walked back to my table and noticed all the other tables had wheat bread and I was angry that we were told it was all gone. I found some ready to be served and grabbed it and took it to my table. When Danny later asked me about the bread asking where I got it I told him ""I found it."" He laughed it off but didn't offer me any explanation. Our food arrived shortly after and I complained that we hadn't gotten our appetizers yet and told Danny to just forget bringing it as we were already served our meals. He told us he was sorry and offered them on the house. We all ate quickly as they were closing around 11 and we were the last ones there.  Overall Danny was kind and friendly and apologetic and I don't blame him at all. I just wish it was a better evening for us. The food was fantastic and the meals were all enjoyed. I hope this location can fix their issues so it's a more pleasant experience for their customers and guests."
Erika M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,15,1,1.0,4/15/2016,"Awful don't come my pasta had no sauce, my BF plate was half tomatoes instead of pasta ridiculous for the price we paid! In addition the silverware was sticky and dirty! The bread as hard and we had to ask for more sauce because the pasta was stuck together due to how dry it was!!! Please don't waste ur hard earned money on this garbage!!"
