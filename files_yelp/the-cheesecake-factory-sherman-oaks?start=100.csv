Margo B.,"Kansas City, MO",24,19,,2.0,4/23/2017,"I hoped this day would never come but it has ..... the food Is so not the same . Ordered Jambalaya and it was horrible . I was so excited for that hot yummy spicy dish and it was bland and cold and noodles were soggy . I have been ordering this for more then 20 years and it's always Delish ! Same with the Chinese chicken salad . They used to chop the iceberg so thin , this time it was huge pcs .... toppings requested on the side never even made it in the bag . Basically paid 14 bucks for ice berg !!  Oh I hope they get back to cooking and preparing like they used to ..... they are one  restaurant that prides themselves on good food and excellent services.  What is happening . ? Willing to try it again hoping it was just one bad expensive dinner ."
Xavier V.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/16/2017,"Hands down the best happy hour in the valley! Reasonably priced, large portions, and a nice huge bar with friendly bartenders. A great place to go before or  after a movie."
Jhaei S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5,27,126,1.0,6/5/2016,"The review is specifically on take out orders.  This is my go to place whenever I am within the area, I called within an hour before closing time so that would give them time to prepare the food and saves me from the stress of thinking that they are gonna spit on my food. Why would they do that right? its cheesecake factory?!! Apparently that is not the case, you cant expect someone to be sympathetic towards another human being. We picked up the order and started eating, after dipping the cuban rolls on its sauce we found a rubber band bigger than the container!!! I never thought that a restaurant with this caliber would have a setback like this."
Megan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",137,5,1,1.0,5/13/2017,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!  I can't believe the amount of time they make you wait, and then on top of that we got no waiter for 20min, then they sit a family of four down, waiter comes with in second doesn't even take a chance too look over at us! Then they sit a couple down literally right next to us waiter turn her back to us and take their order after she just walks away, then we decided to leave cause we still got no service it's been 20min now!!! We walk out some guy goes oh have you guys been helped yet and I was like we been waiting no one has even attempted offer us water, and he goes oh ok! So rude! Very poor service there! Use to love coming to this location, but I guess we will stick to the topanga location! There pretty nice and sweet! Waiters are awesome! F this one!"
Charisma Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",187,41,45,4.0,9/4/2016,We haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in quite some time. Have to say we were very impressed with the Sherman Oaks location.  Customer service was fantastic. We didn't have to wait. I bunk our server was running late but the manager came to take care of us. No wait.  Loved that they had a great selection for kids menu. And loved their healthy menu options. Food was delicious. Drinks were great too. The hubby and I ordered the Long Island ice teas. Really yummy. Enjoyed our visit and will be back!
Joe M.,"Commerce, CA",1,26,10,5.0,5/19/2017,So happy they have new management and was told they got ride off alote of chefs . Definitely amazing now food has been fresh tasty staff super friendly. This is how I remember this place .
Deb S.,"Bakersfield, CA",13,11,11,4.0,5/8/2017,"First time at this location, quick seating, quick service. Celebrated a birthday and our waiter was great."
Liz B.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",56,113,7,1.0,6/24/2017,Have eaten from here a few times and each time I always regret it. The food is horrendous. Today was the last straw the chicken in the chicken club was undercooked!! I had eaten most of it before I realized it and now I'm fearing food poising. Whhhhyyyy do yourself a favor and stay away!!!
Ari M.,"Chatsworth, CA",117,9,1,5.0,5/20/2017,Love this place. Always fresh and tasty. Huge selection. Menu is so big you can have anything you desire. I'm here once a week and sure keep coming
Nic G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1156,89,60,1.0,12/31/2016,"The bartender is a complete jerk. Someone bumped into me and spilled their drink last night who was a ""REGULAR"" and drunk but the main bartender...  Short brown hair...  Took his side and blamed it on me. I've seen the guy make questionable calls in the past but this one was next level. Food came out extremely cold right before this. Not a fan unless they make some changes"
Martine K.,"Studio City, CA",44,19,,4.0,3/15/2017,"They are my happy place for post-long-run meals. I can always order something allergen-friendly, which matters greatly when you are living with auto-immune disease and the wrong food can ruin your week! The menu diversity is a bonus for groups, too. Server quality is hit and miss. Sometimes you get terrific service, sometimes you have to wait looong periods before servers remember you're there, BUT the consistency of the food quality (GO KITCHEN STAFF!!) makes it always worth the trip."
Roxy G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,13,2,1.0,1/23/2017,"No reservations! Not even for a party of 25 PEOPLE!  We all showed up on a Wednesday night, and we waited Two hours to sit. Never again."
Mish S.,"Long Beach, CA",380,500,678,1.0,2/5/2017,"The wait around 7:30 on the weekend is 1 hour long, no bar seating available and parking is $3 the moment you enter the sherman oaks galleria.... Staff is totally mismanaged, they are super slow at turning around tables so there is unnecessary waiting when there are tons of open tables. The guys at the register don't answer the phone so you have no idea the estimated wait time till you arrive and make the effort to go all the way there Totally not worth it and would never ever return"
Mark C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/5/2017,"Waited 30 min for a table, would have been skipped if I hadn't asked the hostess about our table. Placed our orders and then waited 30 minutes to find out what my girlfriend ordered is unavailable. They brought my food two minutes later and my girlfriend was too kind to complain but it was not acceptable. To call their food and service mediocre is extremely generous."
Stephanie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,1,1.0,11/19/2016,"Waited over an hour for my food to be ready, 20 mins was just waiting on order of sweet potato fries that they managed to burn. This place used to be good- but sadly it has been going down hill."
Andrew D.,"Los Angeles, CA",138,142,176,4.0,6/4/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory has it's ""ups and downs"". While the food itself is fantastic (I have yet to try anything here that I don't find absolutely delicious), the cheesecakes, shockingly, are just ""mediocre at its best"".        I have tried the ""Chocolate Mousse"", it was ""ok"". I have tried the ""Snicker Bar Cheesecake"", also just ""ok"". ""Hershey's"", just ok, you get the idea... The cheesecakes are just generic in taste. Maybe I am just a dessert snob, but something is definitely lacking in the flavor. Sometimes they're passable, and sometimes they altogether disappoint. From my experience, I deem the downfall to be the cheesecake base itself. I can never taste the cheesecake creaminess of these desserts, even though they are cheesecakes. The consistency is just lacking, unfortunately. Oh well, can't win them all.       I will give praise where it's deserved though; the Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake is a sweet lover's dream. From the chocolate truffle topping, to the caramel pecan coating, and the brownie crust, this one is meant for the books. Also, any of the other ""specialty desserts"" are pretty spot on. Linda's Fudge Cake, Chocolate Tower Cake, and any chocolate cake in general will put you in a gut busting, sugar coma for hours.     Now, for the food. I have ventured out from something as ""health oriented"" as ""The Glam Veggie Burger"" to the heartier entrees like, yes, you know it...the pastas! All great, especially the ones drowning in rich, cheeses sauces (to my recollection as it has been years since my last, cheese heavy pasta here). Recently, I tried the ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta"" and was blown away. The flavors, the variety of crisp veggies, the sauce itself, will have you wanting to finish the entire plate bite after bite, but you won't be able to. No need to mention this as it is ""The Cheesecake Factory"", but you definitely get your buck's worth in food. So much food! Leftovers!    Service is great considering how mainstream and packed this place gets on weekends and even some weeknights. So, all in all, I recommend The Cheesecake Factory for a nice meal out with friends whether you're looking to socialize, get your drink and greasy munch on, or even for something more formal like a birthday dinner or what not. My recommendation; come early or make reservations (assuming this is an option) if you want to avoid the daunt of waiting (another well known down side to this chain). You'll most likely have a pleasant time."
Elana R.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,21,15,1.0,11/1/2017,"The general manager here, Rebecca Perkins, is rude, condescending, and gives an attitude instead of being useful in anyway at all. We had complained to her that we had been sitting for 30 minutes waiting for our food without being checked on at all. When my mother explained this and asked her to fix it Rebecca said ""well I can't do 6 different things at once"" which was shocking considering we didn't ask for 6 things. She then continued to give us attitude and condescending comments. Overall very terrible service but what else would you expect from a terrible manager."
Joel T.,"Granada Hills, CA",155,12,1,2.0,12/17/2016,"How's the food?  I dunno. Listened to the hostess speak with the customer in front of me.  The person was very specific orders about where they wanted to sit, they were a party of six.  They were told 30 minutes.  I asked for a party of 3, first available -- I was willing to sit out at the patio, despite being a cold night.  So the hostess told me to check back in 5 minutes. I checked in 5 minutes later, then they told me to check in after 10 additional minutes.  I checked in 10 minutes later. They handed me a pager and told me 20-40 minutes from the time they handed me the pager.  I handed them back the pager and told them to be more upfront about the wait.  All I ask is that they be honest about their wait times.  I ended up eating at the Hana Grill cuz we had a movie to catch."
Carlos E.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,34,9,5.0,7/29/2017,"Awesome service followed by awesome food and again awesome service! Kids ordered the cheese pizza which was wow and mini corndogs which where awesome. Adults order pot pie, classic burger and crispy chicken something lol all great!"
Liana D.,"Los Angeles, CA",85,30,118,4.0,1/11/2017,"Who doesn't love the famous Cheesecake Factory.  Great place to have dinner with family and/or friends.  The outdoor patio seating is great when the weather permits. Inside is pretty loud and busy but usually the wait is much shorter inside than outside. The bread here is always fresh and warm. Ask for ranch and crushed red pepper. I add the crushed pepper to the ranch and dip my bread.  Trust me this will become and addiction. By far my favorite dish here is the miso salmon with brown rice, simply amazing!!!"
