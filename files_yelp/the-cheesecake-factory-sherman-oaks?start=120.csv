Anastasia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,15,5,1.0,11/19/2016,This is awful!!!i needed to wait my table 30min BUT lady in front desk SAID that I needed to wait couple minutes!!!!! I never went on this AWFUL place!!! Do not recommended anyone!!!
Lauren O.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",169,567,76,3.0,12/22/2016,"Come on people! Don't call something gumbo when it clearly isn't! I got the gumbo for lunch and what I received was sausage and shrimp in a broth with white rice. No okra, no roux, and hardly any holy trinity. It didn't even have any spice. Very bland. To be fair, I make my own gumbo and I think it's awesome so I may be a tough critic but I am not excusing this bland counterfeit Cajun dish. I swear, I've been to Cheesecake Factory numerous times and I've yet to find anything on their menu that knocks me out. Their entrees all are forgettable. I like their cheesecakes though. I had the hazelnut crunch cheesecake that had Nutella and whipped cream and it was so good. That was the salvation of this meal."
Cynthia D.,"Sylmar, CA",266,129,403,4.0,10/12/2016,"Last night, my boyfriend and I were originally going to go to El Torito Grill, but to our surprise, it was closed and gone forever (we were genuinely surprised :0). So, then we opted to come here because we were both very hungry. We waited possibly 10 minutes to be seated, which is really good for dinner time. When we sat down, our waiter promptly asked for our drink order and if we wanted any bread. Of course we said YES to bread, but we requested only the wheat bread which is our favorite. I also ordered the loaded tots as an appetizer and our entrees, which were the lemon herb chicken and the BBQ Ranch Chicken salad. The loaded tots came out first and it was something nice to munch one while waiting for our food. Unfortunately, we waited close to 40 minutes for our food and it wasn't even super busy or the weekend BUT when we finally did get our food the portion of my salad was HUGE and my boyfriend's chicken entree was very flavorful. So, yes I will be back BUT hopefully next time we don't have to wait that long for our food to come out."
Daizohn K.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,44,12,1.0,11/27/2016,It's my girlfriend's 21st birthday. We waited an hour to get seated after they told us it would be 20 minutes. Then an hour to receive our food. Only for it to come out WRONG!  Server kept apologizing for her mess ups but doesn't help the fact that nothing was going right. Good didn't even come out that great once it was finally corrected.  This place needs to get it together
Amy H.,"Harker Heights, TX",0,20,31,4.0,8/13/2017,Be prepared to wait 30-40 min on the weekend we went at 7 ! Food was awesome as always and cheesecake is a must!! The galleria shopping area is very nice to browse while you are waiting and movie theater was awesome right next door !
Liz G.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",0,46,28,2.0,8/4/2017,"2 stars for the amazing appetizer, it was chicken Mexican egg rolls, so good and flavorful. But my rib-eye, I ordered medium and verified with waitress that medium is pink. I got a well done steak (grey), and returned it immediately. I would like to also say, we visited on Thursday, not even a weekend, the place was crowded, you could see on the waitresses faces that they are exhausted already. I think Cheesecake Factory should open another branch in Encino. I will not come back again. I think the branch in Topanga mall is better, food is better and the place is less occupied. The guy that welcomed us, Malaki his name, was awesome! We love to come and have small talks with him, he is a sweet guy."
Bryan A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,29,253,5.0,11/11/2016,"I come here about once a month. Good location. Great staff. The dine in area is huge. Outside seating is available. The bar is spacious with Booth, tables and high chairs tables. The happy hour here is great 4pm-6pm. I usually get the Buffalo Blast and chicken sliders but just about everything here is delicious."
Rosa A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/29/2017,"Worst breakfast experience of my life!!!!!!  Usually enjoy dinner here.. but after my experience with Rebecca the manager on shift this morning, I will never ever be back! Had to change my order twice on request from my sever, on the 3rd attempt got my meal and had to send it back as it wasn't as I'd requested. Food was bland. Ate some of it as I'd waited almost 1.5hours for it! Left 70% on the plate. After everything they still charged me for it and refused to take it off the menu!!!!  So disappointed and upset !!!"
Cecilyn E.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,25,55,3.0,6/19/2016,"Update for 6/16/16 visit: I really like this place.  I often go here to celebrate birthdays in my family.  This time it was my mom's first visit and it was her birthday.  Our experience was ok not so great and it wasn't awful.  However, my to-go cakes (leftovers), weren't packed well.  They were just dumped upside down.  So when I got home, looking forward to eating it at midnight, I opened it and found it all unappetizing.  Such poor service...  Probably management can do something about this.  Thank goodness I didn't order additional cakes.... ****** Love this place and the food.  The cakes are to die for... Hehehehe..."
Ara G.,"Los Angeles, CA",180,45,18,2.0,6/19/2017,I wanted to give it 4.5 stars but....Since I moved to Sherman oaks me and the wife come to this cheese cake factory once or twice a month and sometimes we order to go..when we eat there service and food is good but...but...but when we order take out there is always something missing and that sucks cause you think your getting all you ordered and there is always something missing and nobody want to drive back for one thing...hope they fix that problem...plus when u call for take out you're on hold for about 5-10 min..
Samantha F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,83,2,1.0,10/30/2017,I don't know why take out from here takes soo long. Plus all the staff seem angry every time we come in  maybe they don't pay them enough
Sam G.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",9,17,,3.0,8/4/2017,So this is a very nice location for dinner but the good is what counts. Well it could have been better. The service was pretty good but the salmon was under cooked and the salads were soggy  and wet.  Wouldn't recommend it.
Fred B.,"Studio City, CA",1,3,,1.0,10/24/2017,"To the management: please don't make me wait 20 minutes for a table and then when you seat me, walk me by 3 sections of empty tables. It tells me you don't know how to manage your restaurant by having enough servers . And it's infuriating."
Theodore S.,"Los Angeles, CA",58,58,69,1.0,11/6/2016,What a horrible experience we had last night. It was a 2 hour wait yes i said 2 hour wait. And the Manger only wanted to give a free appetizer I had no problem dealing with it but the fact we had 4 Lil kids with us made it that bad. I literally seen people come eat and leave.
Linda F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,10/22/2017,"This used to be my favorite  Cheesecake Factory, but it has slid downhill.  I ordered a salad off the skinnylicious menu and added a chicken breast to my order.  The chicken breast had gristle around the outside edge and I had to spit it out at one point. It was a new low for this Sepulveda  restaurant."
Jerome R.,"Los Angeles, CA",324,52,29,4.0,2/17/2017,Haven't set foot in this place for dinner in years but hibachi steak was good. Light on the taste buds american cuisine with japanese eastern flavor. Only main concern is the washcloth used to wipe the tables are used to wipe other tables after dining and utensils are placed on the table & utensils  not on top of napkins.
Michele K.,"Northridge, CA",36,66,33,2.0,10/19/2016,"They were not having a very good day today, at least in the patio. There were four of us celebrating Bosses' Day, albeit two days late. First of all, the waiter didn't write down our orders, which resulted in a bacon-bacon ""cheeseless"" cheeseburger and a side of fries instead of the salad as ordered, I remember her specifically telling the waiter ""hold the American cheese."" But where's the cheddar?  The mushroom burger also arrived cheeseless. Again, she told the waiter, ""no fontina cheese, Swiss cheese only.""  Both burgers were reportedly cold and had to be sent back and fixed. Not surprising, the order took almost an hour. First two of us got our food, then Person 3 (bacon-bacon cheeseburger) and finally Person 4 (mushroom burger). Sorry, but should you not serve everyone at approximately the same time? Don't let people sit there and let their food get cold(er), politely waiting for the rest of the group to be served!  Maybe part of the problem was that we seemed to have about 4 servers.  My chopped salad from the Skinny-licious menu was nearly tasteless. I guess you can't have great taste with only 590 calories. In fairness, the beginning bread was delicious, the guest of honor's chicken piccata looked good, and my Coke Zero was perfect.  Rather than skimp too much on the tip, we decided I'd write the less-than stellar review on behalf of the group. Sorry, Cheesecake Factory, you're usually four stars at least."
Guylaine G.,"Los Angeles, CA",411,42,65,3.0,3/13/2017,"I would return for the cheesecake ... We've been there a few times and the food  was very good in June '16 then  a few months later all the dishes were disappointing. Watery tomato sauce, where was the cheese in Alfredo sauce? Maybe there was new cook staff ? I make better pasta at home !"
Ayden D.,"Northridge, CA",3,12,,3.0,12/21/2016,"Our server was great, no problems there.  However, the hosts sat us at a dirty table and reassured us they would have it cleaned immediately.  They took about 10 minutes to clean our table while they sat other customers.  When we asked about our dirty table, they asked us to wait longer.  When they did clean our table, one of our spoon's still had chocolate cheesecake from the last customer.   The food was good, but they were certainly stingy with the chicken."
Gerald K.,"Elk Grove, CA",12,8,2,1.0,6/22/2017,"I made a single order ""to go"" and was given a 15 min wait time. After 30 mins of waiting I asked the status of my order and the person behind the counter told me someone is going to get my order. She didn't even look at my receipt to know what my order was. Once i spoke with the manager. She wasn't to apologetic for my situation. She came back a few mins later with my order and asked if i needed anything else. She didn't try to make my inconvenience better. I asked for ranch instead of honey mustard with my order and guess what I found when I opened my order..... honey mustard. Sad to say I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory but the lack of customer service or care has turned me off to this location. By the time I got to eat I wasn't even hungry due to my saddening experience. Smh"
