Breezee E.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,22,4,4.0,12/18/2016,"I love The Cheesecake Factory.  Yes.  I love it.  Their giant portions make for plentiful and delicious leftovers.  Their lemon drop martinis are strong and better than most.  The decor is consistent and comforting.  And the brown/wheat bread before the meal is addictive.  That is my review of The Cheesecake Factory chain as a whole.   As far as the Sherman Oaks location goes, it's pretty decent I guess.  It doesn't have the scenery that Marina Del Rey and Redondo Beach have.  But it has convenience if you are coupling your meal with a trip to the movies at the Arclight or to DSW for a new pair of shoes.   I'm not a fan at all of the Galleria.  The layout is stupid, and you have to walk through a wind tunnel and a journey to get from your car to the stores (unless you pay $20 to valet your car, which is almost actually worth it).   This isn't The Cheesecake Factory's fault though so I won't remove stars for that.   I do need to deduct a star for their bar though.  As mentioned, the lemon drop martinis are bomb.  Everything else is inconsistent at this location, depending on who is bartending.  On a good day they make a strong and flavorful mai tai.  On a couple of occasions it has been quite weak though, and when I asked them to strengthen it up a bit, they charged me $10 for an additional shot.  An extra $10 to make it the way you were supposed to make it in the first place.   Same experience with their Cadillac Margaritas.   Overall, I'm a fan. I like comfort food and Cheesecake Factory does it quite well! Pro tip - ask to sit in Eric's section.  He's the best!"
Lea Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,108,5,2.0,5/27/2017,"4 stars for food quality and large menu selection but 2 stars for service.  Simply awful hostess team.  But we had a fantastic server who helped make up for it. 3 hostesses were working the reception area last night at about 7:45PM when we exited ArcLight Sherman Oaks and made our way to the restaurant to grab a bit to eat.  THREE.  We waited for them to help the two parties ahead of us and then stepped up to the counter to ask for a table for two.  We waited almost 5 minutes for even ONE of the THREE hostesses to say hello, welcome us to the restaurant and tell us it would be a moment.  No acknowledgment whatsoever.  I was a hostess for several years at various establishments.  The number one rule:  make guests feel welcome.  Even if it's just to say ""Hi, give us a few moments and we'll take care of you.""  We didn't even get a simple ""hello"".  When the girl finally acknowledged our presence (she was wearing a necklace that said something like ""Marcela""), she simply said ""How many?""  Again, no hello or greeting or ""sorry for the wait"", just ""how many?"".  We said ""2 please"" and she responded ""inside or outside.""  We said we'd take the first available and she said ""then we can seat you now.""  Great!  Without a word to us, she handed two menus to another hostess and said something so we thought we were going to the table.  She said ""not you - another party.""  This girl was like the Terminator - barely spoke full sentences.  OK, so we stepped back.  Sorry, we thought when she said ""we can seat you now"" that actually meant ""now"".  Nope.  Waited only a few moments or so and then a hostess called our name.  We approached and this girl who had previously been behind the reception desk not acknowledging our presence for five minutes upon arrival flashes a lovely smile and says ""Hi there, let me show you to your table.""  It was like a totally different person.  That lovely smile would have gone a long way when we arrived. This is a teaching moment folks -- if you work in the customer service industry, how about saying hello and welcoming your customers to your business?  It's a nice way to make them feel good and even if there's a wait to be seated, just give some kind of acknowledgment.  Even a friendly smile and holing your finger up to indicate ""one moment"" would be sufficient.  We felt like we were bothering them by even being there.   At the end of the day it's not that big of a deal in the whole scheme of life so I'm wondering why I just wrote three paragraphs about it.  LOL!  I guess it's just a small, simple thing that would go a long way towards making guests feel welcome in your establishment.  If anyone's reading this - maybe teach your hostess team some basic manners and the fundamentals of human interaction.  It would make coming to your restaurant so much more pleasurable. BTW, the food was great as always and our server was OUTSTANDING.  I wish I remembered his name.  He had a wonderful personality, knew the menu inside and out and was helpful, kind and fun.  So good job on the server staff!!"
Sofia A.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",4,32,37,4.0,1/31/2017,First timer here and there was no wait so we got seated immediately and I ordered the chicken alfredo and my acquaintance got a burger with fries. The alfredo was alright I liked it but it was more like of a soup texture very saucy if that makes sense. Then the dessert came and it was so delicious!!!! I got the Oreo dreamers cheesecake and wow!!!! For two people it came out to be almost $60 which is pricey but the huge proportions make up for it! Definitely will be back for cheesecake!
Phil R.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,17,1,2.0,7/22/2017,"This is a review of a specific dish at the Cheesecake Factory, not a review of the restaurant.  On a recent visit, my dining companion and I both ordered Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta. The menu description is ""Large Shrimp Sauteed with Tomatoes, Lemon, Garlic, Herbs and Fresh Basil on Top of Angel Hair Pasta with a Touch of Marinara Sauce"" Overall impression: lacking in flavor...we both thought the dish needed something to make it tastier..the server offered Parmesan cheese which helped a little, but the dish was just under flavored. Perhaps not enough garlic, basil and lemon.  The dish was basically a lot of fresh tomatoes with some shrimp and angel hair There were four or five medium to large sized shrimp on the dish.. However, they were a little tough and lacking in a lot of flavor. Frozen? perhaps...I'm surprised given the volume of shrimp served at the Cheesecake Factory.  I would have to say that my rating for this dish barely gets to average. My advice is to pick something else unless you are really looking for a bland dish heavy on tomatoes.  In comparison, bang-bang chicken and shrimp, one of my favorite dishes on the menu is bursting with flavor and rates very high in my book. (Order it with angel hair instead of rice). (The 2 star rating accompanying this review applies specifically to the Shrimp with Angel Hair dish.)"
Jillian G.,"Los Angeles, CA",185,24,8,5.0,6/30/2017,Our server Lindsay was hilarious. Love her will definitely be back because of her. We had a high maintenance person in our party and she put up with him and made the dinner fun. Thanks again we will be back to see her next June 13th!
Eliza A.,"Studio City, CA",216,200,82,4.0,4/13/2016,"One of my favorite Cheesecake Factory locations! Super easy to get to even from the Westside which is great. The staff here is quite friendly. The hostesses work hard to get you seated and the servers all seem very knowledgeable about the menu (that is forever changing) which I appreciate. I enjoy the bar area here if I don't feel like waiting for a regular table. There is ALWAYS a wait here 24/7 and booth seating is hard to come by (I hate that stupid half table/half booth seating you're sharing with strangers) so I have to knock off 1 star for both of those things. However, overall, dining here is yummy & convenient."
Ricardo S.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",3,52,34,5.0,11/30/2016,Years later in Cheese cake factory great experience. Happy hour not just price great tasted food and our cocktails with excellent service at the bar with Alan. Thanks Alan. Hope to back soon.
Peter V.,"North Hollywood, CA",10,182,14,4.0,5/14/2017,This branch is always solid with food and service. Rigatoni with sausage and shrimp had a nice spicy taste . Pork chop dinner was a good value with some solid sides. Service was excellent and we had a gift card..cant beat that! Good job CF!
Chloe B.,"East Harlem, Manhattan, NY",0,6,,5.0,7/8/2017,Brenna is amazing! Not only was my pick up on time but she remembered us! We had an issue with our order and when I called she made sure to fix everything! Great customer service!!
Yvana S.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,21,3,1.0,3/26/2017,"Customer service 0 stars. To management - teach your staff to be respectful, gossip less and smile. We stood at the front for 10 mins waiting to be seated while 3 of them were chatting away. After I asked if we can be seated as we were trying to catch a movie, Anna I believe was her name gives us the annoyed look. I mean we interrupted her chit chatting with her coworkers.  Do your job and be polite!  The table she gave us was under neat the AC while it's 50 degrees out. It was beyond freezing, we ask for a different table and this girl tell us they don't have any other tables while I'm seeing at least 2 sections open. Finally asked for manager who reseated us. As we were leaving her and the other snotty front desk girl start talking about us. Hire better staff and make sure they don't talk about customers and not be rude. I have never had an experience like this at this location or any other for that matter.  Dirty utensils, bad attitude and slow service."
Scott O.,"Honolulu, HI",0,6,,5.0,7/7/2017,"We had the best Waitress today, Marcia was always smiling! She gave us very timely service, we came in hungry, she brought out the kids meals first.. never had to ask for anything, she asked us if we needed more bread, our water was never empty. Great service! The foods were all good!! From my Burger to Chicken Parmesan, White Bean Chili, Thai Chicken, To the Mac & Cheese, and kids Pizza.. Yum!! Oh, yes we had their latest cheesecake!! Winna! This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory.. I like it!!"
Jay F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,1,3.0,9/21/2017,True 3.5 star restaurant.  Happy hour is pretty good for drinks and appetizers.  Better non-corporate restaurants out there with less choices on the menu.
Rena H.,"Woodland Hills, CA",971,792,4678,5.0,2/24/2015,"My friend and I love Cheesecake Factory.  Every time I come here I tell myself that I need to try something new since their menu is about 50 pages long.  However I get my usual Chicken Romano and depending on my mood, I would get the Chicken Masala or the Chinese Chicken Salad.  My Chicken Romano as usual was very good.  The chicken is tender and juicy and the pasta is cooked perfectly.  The wait staff always so friendly and we never have a problem."
Amanda B.,"Los Angeles, CA",413,18,1,2.0,5/6/2017,"It hurts to write a less than stellar review because I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory, however this restaurant is not up to the standards all the others I've dined at are.  Every time I use the ladies room I regret not going before getting to restaurant. It seems that no one attends to it; there is more toilet paper on the floors than on the holders they belong in. The same goes for the paper towels. Usually the trash is so full that the floor and counters are coated with used papers. It amazes me how messy women can be-my boyfriend said the men's room is not nearly this bad!! Hopefully this will draw attention to the lack of cleanliness. The food is amazing-most times. Twice I have left unsatisfied and both times have been here. One time was a Cobb salad, which seems hard to mess up... I asked for no tomato so they seemed to overcompensate with eggs, the chicken and avocado both had right portions, but under the eggs I went on a scavenger hunt for a few bits of bacon, and even less blue cheese. It was end of the night so I think I got what scraps were left. The worst experience, however was when my entree didn't arrive until my boyfriend had finished his. We ordered an appetizer, and when it arrived placed our entree order. The appetizer came out without the dressing we asked for, and our server seemed annoyed she had to make another trip. Boyfriend got Jambalaya and I went with my favorite-the Chicken Madeira with no mushrooms. Someone different brought the entrees and my plate had mushrooms. I politely mentioned that I told our server no mushrooms and this server took it back. About 6-8 minutes later I convinced my boyfriend to eat so his doesn't get cold. Our server returned to try and correct me by saying I told her no onions-yes, she came to tell me I had said no onions on a meal that doesn't have onions. Pretty appalling she felt the need to argue with a customer (and she was not just unprofessional, also wrong).  My boyfriend finished every last bite before my entree arrived (in the hands of someone else mind you). I asked for a to go box and the manager. He seemed a little embarrassed and apologized for the mishap as well as the unprofessional comments from server. Not the most pleasant experience... Most recent time was a delivery, and was missing bread and cheesecake. Not the end of the world about the bread (although we did request it) but we paid for the cake. The manager was cold when I asked for a solution. I wasn't trying to get anything free, I just wanted what I paid for to be fixed! Go to the Woodland Hills location-you will not be disappointed!! Giving 2 stars because the other locations all have great standards."
Stina L.,"Los Angeles, CA",410,204,347,3.0,3/30/2016,"I'm not sure why I'm even reviewing Cheesecake Factory-- by now, most people have visited it before? I remember when the chain first opened and I loved coming here, but now it's just alright. There are certainly better options, but Cheesecake Factory is always a safe choice. They have a huge menu, with pastas, burritos, burgers-- you name it. The cheesecake selection is also extensive, as you could probably tell by the name-- so this place is great for cheesecake lovers. I came to this Sherman Oaks Galleria location about a week ago with my coworker and a mutual friend for dinner. I just parked in the shopping plaza's parking structure.... make sure to validate your ticket! It cost $1 with validation.  We came on Wednesday night around 6:30pm and didn't have to wait. It definitely gets more packed throughout the night. I ordered my usual -- the Farfalle with Chicken and Garlic (Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Caramelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce). The entrees are pretty pricey (I think mine was $16-17) but the portions are huge and I had enough for my dinner and 2 lunches. The pasta is tasty, but definitely on the fattier/heavy side. It's also super garlic-y. This is my go-to item, but I probably will try something else next time. The pasta was drenched in oil after I reheated the leftovers..yuck.  I also got the banana cream cheesecake to-go, which was about $8. So expensive!! I could buy an entire pie at Marie Callendar's for that price. Lol. But it was pretty good... tasted like banana cream pie but in cheesecake form. Overall, Cheesecake Factory is okay. I like this chain better than most, but it's still not my favorite restaurant to eat at."
Vanessa R.,"Los Angeles, CA",228,24,6,5.0,4/20/2017,Oscar was our server for lunch. He was simply amazing! Best service I've ever had at this location hands downs!
Anna L.,"Calabasas, CA",589,126,184,1.0,7/10/2016,"Save yourself a trip down disappointment memory lane. By far the most awful customer service received. This isn't the first time my friend and I were treated so poorly here, we gave it a second chance, which confirmed us never returning to this location again. We came here at 9:20 pm with ample time to order and eat comfortably, our waitress was rude, full of attitude, why even bother taking our order? It's not like we ordered appetizers.... Our bill was close to $80. We were done eating and she never bothered to remove our empty dishes from the table, (no big deal, I get it, she's busy helping and clearing everyone else's table), clearly nor busy enough to bring our tab, but still leaves all our dishes in front of us.  My friend and I are looking over our bill, the waitress returns wanting the check (it's 10:21 pm now), we apologize and say we're not ready yet. At 10:25 pm she sends a different waiter to our table asking for the check, my friend asks him why he was asking for the check and his words were ""the waitress is leaving and she wants the check back""   My friend just signs quickly and hands him the check.  Should you not offer to validate parking like every other Cheesecake Factory does? Wow!  Why be rude?  Why send someone else to do your job?  Really? The restaurant is still full of people and you are kicking us out? Poor customer service Clearly, we won't be returning here again. Not worth the money for such awful experience. Lesson learned."
Samantha P.,"Northridge, CA",206,53,5,5.0,11/5/2016,I've been coming here my whole life. And today I had the best waiter of all time. His name is Andrew. I think from now on I'll call ahead and make sure I get seated in his section. Haha  Thanks for the great food & service! I appreciate you guys.
Chris H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,,2.0,3/6/2017,"So, to stat out with, I'm a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I've had great meals / experiences, but this was not one of them. Two problems, and how management handled them are at issue here. First, my family I were taken by the host to be seated, only to find that the table was not ready. No biggie, except the restaurant was very crowded and we were asked to wait at an awkward drink station in the middle of the room, with servers rushing all around us while we waited. Well, after about four or five minutes, they finally get the table cleared. As we're being led back by the host to the table, the manager steps in and seats another couple. Our host tried to explain that we'd been on our way to being seated for the past six or seven minutes, but this manager refused to here it. Instead, he yelled at a bus boy to quickly clear another table for us. Now the manager didn't acknowledge us. He could have apologized of the inconvenience, but he didn't. We were led to another spot to stand, this time by the bathrooms. Here's were the first problem intersects the second. As we're waiting outside the bathrooms, in an awkward placement that basically puts us in front of another family table, we begin to smell something AWFUL. My wife looks down, and sees that the floor is covered in feces. And the trail of sh*t leads back to the men's bathroom. So someone lets the servers know, and they get a guy to come and start cleaning the floors. Of course, we're checking our shoes, trying to dodge around the ""brown footprints"", when another server shows up and seats ANOTHER couple at the table we've been waiting for - AGAIN! At this point, we've had our table delayed or given away three times, we've been standing in the restaurant over 12 minutes, and there's sh*t all over our shoes. Luckily, our host this time demands we be seated, and we are - right next to the bathrooms. Somebody arrived and sprayed air freshener on the floor, so the odor went from poop, to vanilla and poop. Look, I'm understanding, and didn't raise a ruckus though I could have. We ate our meal and left, but I am disappointed in the manner the management treated us. They should have taken us back to the waiting area instead of standing us in various spots. He (the manager who took our first table away) should have apologized instead of ignoring us. They (the staff) should have done a better job cleaning the floors and offering guests near the smell (it wasn't just us who were suffering) accommodations or the chance to sit somewhere else. If any supervisors from the Cheesecake Factory read this, please train your managers and employees to handle these situations better. This will be the final time we visit your Sherman Oaks location. edit: Our visit took place on Saturday, March 4th, 2017, around 6pm."
