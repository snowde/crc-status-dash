Love G.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,31,42,3.0,5/18/2017,.. its been many years since ive come back to this place.. the last time i was here i forget what i ordered.. breaded chicken with pasta.. there was a hair deep inside under the breading.. maybe one of the chefs placed it there and was nor happy working for cheesecake factory.. tonight i decided to try their pizza.. their sausage and ricotta flatbreads were amazing.. however their margherita pizza was not as good as i expected it to be.. and for the price $15.. not worth it.. maybe they should steer away from making pizzas.. the cheese was not melted enough and it appears that everyone has their own version.. it was okay.. ive had better and at an affordable price.. i think ill stick with their flatbreads.. half the price and filling enough..
Cyndi W.,"Los Angeles, CA",742,363,318,3.0,8/12/2016,Good Food... so so wine list... great place to hang out before or after a movie.  It is not my first choice but I am never dissapointed either.
Jessica M.,"Los Angeles, CA",216,5,6,5.0,5/16/2017,"Been to Cheesecake Factory a few times and this past time was the best so far. It was a Monday afternoon so it wasn't crowded, only waited a couple minutes to be seated. Service was excellent! Our waitress was Angela and she was awesome! It takes me forever to decide what I want to eat and she was so patient and friendly. Their food is a bit pricey but worth it! The portions are huge! Enough to take home and save for later. The food is also super delicious!"
Tristan W.,"Spring Valley Lake, CA",0,1,,5.0,5/27/2017,"I'd like to start this review off by saying that couples do fight at cheesecake. Now on to the review portion. I entered the Cheesecake Factory Sherman oaks location with extreme hopes of having my taste buds satisfied by their world renowned cheesecake, instead my expectations were exceeded beyond belief. My server Jacque was the sweetest and most helpful server. It is evident that she is a hard worker and truly makes an effort to make her guests comfortable. I will be coming back. No doubt"
Erwin P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,3,,1.0,7/10/2016,"My wife and I eat here about once a month. Last night it was dinner from hell. After waiting an hour for food to come, waiter apologized for the slowness from kitchen. The manager came over and said food should come shortly.  Was thinking he could at least offer dessert on the house, but no. 15 minutes later food arrived luke warm. Just wanted to eat and get out.  My wife and I took half our meal home. At least we thought so. This morning opened the leftovers and found we got someone else's leftovers. Into the trash., and out to breakfast. I will be contacting management and see what they say"
Ben B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",485,37,,1.0,10/1/2017,"I went there a couple years ago, I used to be a regular at cheesecake. Ever since visiting this branch I have never stepped foot in another cheesecake. I ordered a Cesar salad, didn't taste right i knew something was wrong with it. But I was too busy my attention was with the friends I was with. I took the rest Togo the next day when I  saw the sales in light I realized the lettuce was old and the Cesar dressing was covering up the taste just enough that I didn't check that night. Conclusion if they carry lettuce that is that old and still have it in Stock that means their food quality sucks it's been years I never stepped foot back into a cheesecake factory"
Aniela K.,"Valencia, CA",0,9,1,1.0,6/28/2016,I went into the cheesecake factory yesterday and the hostesses we're not very kind or welcoming. I told her how many were in my party and she looked at me rudely and told me to stand somewhere to the left... There was absolutely no wait and no other customers waiting and plenty of open seating.  When I was brought to the table I realized it wasn't a comfortable seat and I wanted to move to a booth. So I kindly apologized to the host and asked if there was a booth we could sit at instead. She rolled her eyes at me and told me that I would have to wait 15 minutes. This was so ridiculous to me because the restaurant was not busy at all.  So uncomfortable I just walked out the door and left instead of waiting. Nobody cared or try to make me feel better about the situation. I eat at the cheesecake factory all the time and I don't think I want to go to the one in Sherman Oaks Galleria ever again.
Matue B.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,8,12,5.0,12/2/2016,Very nice place! I love cheese cake here! Original cheese! It's fantastic really! Here is very good atmosphere:)
Susan L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,2.0,9/12/2017,I usually rave about the Cheesecake Factory food and service BUT tonight I had a very different experience . We had a lovely waitress but it took over an hour to get our food ...other tables were served as we still waited .After asking several times to our waitress and being told Kitchen was busy got lots of orders at the same time the manager Justin came . Justin had no personality and seemed not to care . He offered us at this point soup or salad ...really ! Another 5 minutes went by Justin delivered the food or should I say dropped it off and never came back to see if all was OK ... really and he is a manager ! The food was luke warm but at this point we were hungry after waiting an hour plus and also no one seemed to care ...Justin disappeared and left the waitress who felt so bad to deal with it ...Justin needs to be in another position till he learns to deal with customers and resolve the problem so the customer is happy and not telling all on yelp... thanks yelp for the platform to tell the story ... I do intend to tell friends and call there corporate offices in Calabasas CA...maybe this will make Justin rethink his attitude and actions ...I will think twice before returning
Jennifer P.,"Palmdale, CA",36,8,1,5.0,6/3/2017,The best cheesecake ever! Hands down no comparison! You cant beat the fresh whipped cream ....
Anselle E.,"Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, CA",87,5,2,3.0,4/18/2017,You guys need friendlier hostesses. The ones checking in people are awkward and rude!
Maggie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,5,4.0,5/15/2017,I came in to eat here with my family on Mother's Day. I knew the wait was going to be long. I still wanted to eat here. Jessica was our waitress . She was very nice and attentive. The food was delicious . I ordered the miso salmonmy favorite! The only bad part of my experience was the bathroom . It was really messy with trash all over. I think someone is suppose to be doing bathroom checks at least every 30 minutes. Other than that it was a great choice of place to eat .
Nicole U.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",192,685,219,4.0,1/8/2016,"Super date night here using up Christmas gift cards. We walked in on a busy Saturday night but didn't have to wait too long since we opted to sit outside. Started with an order of buffalo wings which were cooked to perfection. Large wings that were extra crunchy and served with some potent blue cheese dressing. Next we ordered the bacon bacon cheeseburgers and asked for them to be lettuce wrapped and had cesar salads instead of french fries. This burger is hands down the best thing at The Cheesecake Factory. Thick pork belly, crispy bacon and a huge burger loaded with cheese. The burger was so filling that we didn't even have room for the salad. Service was great, nice and attentive. Tons of refills too."
Rebecca A.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,9,7,2.0,2/11/2017,"This location is hit and miss. Today, although I ordered the Thai Glazed Salmon cooked medium, It was so well done and crispy that I needed to dip it in extra sauce on the side just to be able to eat it. Had the server stopped by to find out how our food was, I would have asked her for another one. I love The Cheesecake Factory; however, the food and service definitely missed the mark today."
Runnerlover F.,"Santa Clarita, CA",48,122,57,3.0,1/16/2017,Never disappointed since the menu is so big and variety is good but I ordered a veggie salad and main protein was black beans but my entire salad had like no black beans and I had to ask for more and it took forever to get until I was ready to leave and asked for it to go... the waiter was very apologetic for it but not really his fault the cooks should add more when making especially since no meat on my salad ...
Daisy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,39,14,1.0,1/18/2017,"My experience here wasn't pleasant, my girlfriend and I were excited to come eat here together. We always order our chicken biscuit and share a plate. (Cause honestly who can finish a big plate on their own) anyway... first they ran out of biscuits, but we still ordered it. I asked for more bread, and the waiter OSCAR T. made a comment saying ""Too much bread can get you full"" that ruined my appetite. That was rude, and unnecessary. I am a PAYING CUSTOMER. So if I wanted 3 rounds of bread, that shouldn't matter to him. I felt personally attacked about my weight. Also he hasn't given us refills. Then when I ordered my cheesecake, my girlfriend had asked for the check. Until that moment, he didn't acknowledge her. When the cheesecake arrived, he placed it in front of her instead of myself. We left really upset, and disappointed with the service and the food."
Jennifer M.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,152,121,5.0,2/21/2016,"I love this spot! Whenever my family and I plan on going to the movies , we go to the Cheesecake Factory before or after the movie. There's a parking lot Great service  Must haves  Tex mex or avacado egg roll Factory burrito chicken madera  Louisiana pasta And I could name many more! They also have a low calorie menu"
Janine B.,"West Hills, West Hills, CA",0,7,1,1.0,9/5/2017,"We got told its a 20-25 min wait. We went back inside to ask about our table and learned that the lady never put us on the waiting list. We were lucky and they had a table for us. I have been at the Cheesecake Factory in Santa Monica and Valencia multiple times but in this location I got very rudely told my ID, which is from Switzerland couldnt be accepted and they won't serve me alcohol. The waitress immediately took this to her supervisor which didn't have less of an attitude against me and even accused me of being lucky for ""getting away with this"" at other locations. I never heard of that policy that they only accept passports and never had an issue anywhere else. Definetly won't go back there!"
Kaitlin D.,"Farmington, MO",0,26,3,2.0,2/9/2017,"Get it together. We ordered desserts through doordash. Last time we ordered the sundae, they forgot the ice cream. THE ICE CREAM, PEOPLE. This time we ordered the sundae, instead of their ""famous hot fudge"" that justifies paying that much money for a sundae, it came with a gross side of Hershey's syrup instead. I called and spoke with the manager and he basically just said ""oh gosh, sorry."" I work in the restaurant industry. The cheesecake factory has an entire staff dedicated to to go orders. No excuse."
Trina T.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,126,1,4.0,3/29/2017,I've not been happy with this location for a long time. Today we found ourselves in this area so gave it a try again. We were pleasantly surprised when we walked in a the horses smiled at us and actually looked at us while speaking with us.  We were seated quickly and our waiter was great. I had the mushroom soup which was very good and my husband the gumbo which he loved
