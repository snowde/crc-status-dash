D B.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/22/2017,"UPDATE: the french fries were cold by the time I got to my car and the toothpicks were not put in far enough to hold the sandwich together, so it's all over the box. Very disappointed.  Seems like a great restaurant but the woman taking to-go orders was very rude and unfriendly. When I approached her to ask about the status of my order (since she gave me no number/pager and didn't ask my name), she just shook her head at me and said ""Nope. No. No."" While waiting, I witnessed her being rude to several other customers as well. Bummer.  *No reflection on the food...because I'm still waiting for my order."
Diana E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,4/6/2017,"Before I mention why I didn't have the best time, I will say Marisela our waitress, was great as far as customer service. With that said, the food was average, and to put the cherry on top a roach crawled across the table. When I told Marisela, she quickly removed it with a napkin. I could tell she was embarrassed, she said, ""if it helps, I've never seen that happen before."" I was embarrassed, for a moment I thought she was insinuating that we had something to do with it, but I'd like to believe she was as embarrassed as we were. The manager came over and offered to seat us somewhere else, but we decided to stay because I didn't want to cause a commotion after all the place was really busy. We decided to get a desert after the meal, and Marisela, gave it us on the house which I really appreciated. Overall, the two stars are for Marisela, who really tried to make us feel comfortable."
Sarah G.,"San Fernando, CA",1,8,,4.0,5/4/2017,"This place was great.  The service was great, food, beverages, and when we asked to be put outside, they adhered to it and gave us a spot next to a patio heater which was nice. You have a great view of the city from the patio. Even though it was busy we were waited on very quickly. I had the Cuban sandwich and it was delicious. My dad had the Chicken Bellagio and I had a taste of it, it was so delicious and tasty. The coffee got a lot of praise from my best friend and it was very good. The restrooms were nice and clean and although it is a high volume restaurant, I'm actually disappointed that they're not enough stalls. However, the experience and atmosphere was wonderful. Will definitely go again."
Dana K.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",370,503,12213,4.0,9/28/2014,"This my be one of my favorite places to eat. I love the food, the taste of it and the selection. The have a huge menu and a skinny menu to give healthier options.  Recently we went here for my birthday and we sat outside. I love sitting on the patio under the heaters. The food was delicious as always. I like the appetizers, a lot of them. The macaroni and cheese balls, lake salad, corn fritters just to name a few.  The cheesecake  I ordered was so good. It was the new s'mores  one. It had chocolate, marshmallows, and graham cracker crust.  My one complaint about this place is they don't take reservations at night time. When I ask the manager why he said because we don't have to. I thought that really sucked for customers. That night we waited almost 2 hours for a table because we couldn't make reservations. It was my birthday and we were a big group.  And ""they don't need to""...that's why they make people wait around for hours! It's kind of a bummer because I think the food here is exceptional."
Zach C.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",45,4,1,5.0,5/1/2017,"Came in late night with the girlfriend for some appetizers and drinks. Was greeted by the host, Malachi, who was just an absolute pleasure and salvaged our night from our drab cocky server. Will literally return to this restaurant ONLY to see Malachi again. Excellent work."
Lusine S.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",4,1,,1.0,4/30/2017,"This is one of my favorite restaurant but today I was very disappointed because I found a half eaten chicken wing in my new order, seems like they serve leftovers as new and the manager Natascha Crouch didn't even discount my bill, I had to ask for it, worst customer service ever, never going back again"
Lisa M.,"Louisville, KY",4,13,27,5.0,9/13/2016,"This is our first ever visit to The Cheesecake Factory and our experience was amazing!!  Our server Stephen C was phenomenal (ask for his section!!) He was amazing and attentive and suggested dishes, which were delicious!!  He made our celebration of Molly's 16th birthday continue in a very special time! If we lived here, we'd be back and ask for his section every time!"
David A.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,7,3,5.0,4/29/2017,"This place is great. Food is good, service is great, and I love the outside seating .. For the vegans out there, try the veggie burger it's awesome .."
Dom F.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,48,2,4.0,3/25/2017,"Visited here once. The first time... on a weeknight. It was super busy, which is great for business. Wait was about 30-35 minutes. Our waitress was great, attentive, friendly. The food was good. That's to be expected here. Didn't feel rushed. Enjoyed our time."
Angela B.,"Los Angeles, CA",99,68,64,3.0,8/2/2016,"I usually come to this cheesecake location. Not a bad location TBH nothing has really ever thrown me off to never come back. The only thing was that when I went this last time, my knife was dirty and my cousins menu had food on it. I think they should be a little bit more clean. I'm really big on the whole sanitary issue so this was really disgusting to me. Service is usually good I've never really had an issue. food is always good, no doubt. Overall, okay."
Eldad T.,"Los Angeles, CA",569,86,36,4.0,2/9/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is somewhere you can always mention and a friend will have a hard time not saying yes. Best assortment of foods and cheesecake hands down. The service is hit or miss, I have had some horrible experiences and I have had good ones. Good luck trying to get seated quickly on weekends but weekdays are quite pleasant. The bar is nearly never available, but if it is you're lucky. People like to sit there for a long time."
Ula R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,30,,5.0,4/19/2017,Always great service and great food ! I've had mistakes happen with my order and they fix it everytime ! Staff is always fantastic ! That's why I keep comming back !
Alex A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,96,9,3.0,10/1/2016,"Went for dinner. It's by far one of my favorite chain restaurants!  Our waitress was great! Awesome, attentive and had a real charm. She was definitely the reason we left happy! The food however was below average this time, unfortunately. The garlic bread was too burned and the rest of the food was just not as tasty as normal. For the most of the time it's a HIT and not a MISS. Today everything but the Salmon, and the cheesecake was a miss.  I don't know if the bar staff was new, because the drinks tasted like water with ice.  Maybe it had been a long week. Anyways; I've got to repeat how great the waitress was. I can't wait to go back and write a review next time, when the kitchen and the bar are on top of their jobs the same way as our great waitress. We'll be back!"
Ava M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,11,1,1.0,8/13/2017,One of the worst host ever. He had zero sort of empathy or customer service. I don't know if he is new to the restaurant industry but he doesn't being in it. The Cheesecake Factory has always been a classy place in my eyes and his skills are beneath that. He should go and work somewhere that accepts his horrible characteristics flaws.
Melly R.,"Los Angeles, CA",102,5,,5.0,3/12/2017,Had a great time with my aunts when i came to dinner the other night. The food was amazing! had a buffalo Chicken Sandwhich and the Chicken was Really Big and filling.
L L.,"Burbank, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/18/2017,We came to this restaurant for lunch and there were about 3 people in front of us.  We were not asked where we wanted to be seated so they gave us a small table in a  very crowded room that we did not like.  We then asked for a booth and they gave us a booth next to the bar. It was very noisy and it felt like we were in a casino. I spoke to the manager and she didn't seeing to care too much.  She asked us if we specified where we wanted to be seated.  I told her that her employees should be asking us.  This is what you call customer service?  We are very  disappointed with this restaurant and we do not recommend it.
Wendy V.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,24,40,5.0,6/26/2016,"This gambalaya is so delicious they made sure they put extra chicken and shrimp, oscar was my server n he is the best n the sexiest he was super nice to us, we just loved him"
Luis C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,2,2.0,3/29/2017,"Last week was my first time on this famous place.... and I'm surprised : 1 The food... good but no so great, 2 The waitress so rude, the food runner.. rude rude rude...! No... I'm not coming back."
Shushanik P.,"North Hollywood, CA",1,37,,5.0,5/12/2016,"I don't know where and how to start my review. I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in almost a year and a half. I used to go there quite often in the past with family and friends. Due to financial reasons I stopped eating out most of the time.  On May the 2nd 2016, I happened to be in the area and I was starving. I decided to go there since I was close to the shopping center. I walked in and there was no wait, there usually is a long wait, but since it was kind of late on a Monday, no holidays or special events....so I was seated within 5 minutes. There comes a cheerful lady....my server Marisela with a confident, pleasant, nice, professional, and knowledge attitude to take my order. I kid you not, I thought she has been working there for years. That's how good she knew her job, but yet, I found out that she has been there for only 2 months. WOW!!! Shout out to Marisela:)) I ordered their Steak Diane Salmon Combo that came with asparagus and a little House Salad with ranch dressing. My meal tasted DELICIOUS!! DIVINE!! Not to mention that I was hungry the whole entire day.  I was taking small bites, because I didn't want my food to finish:) that's how good it tasted. Marisela kept checking back with me to find out how I was doing and refilled my soft drink twice and asked if I needed any more bread and butter. She was just WONDERFUL in every way and made my dining experience EXCEPTIONAL! I wish almost all restaurants can have great service like Cheesecake Factory does. After I was done with my meal, she asked if I wanted to have dessert, but I refused her offer since I was soooo full. Now, people whoever has had their cheesecake you know how goooooood it is, but I had no room for it. I paid my tab and left her more than 20% tip, because she deserved it!!  I left to go to the bathroom and I didn't like what I saw, the bathroom was not very clean and they had a small roll of toilet paper. However I am NOT going to take down one of my stars, just because of that. I hope the staff will be more on top of their maintenance in the restroom.  Beautiful restaurant, comfortable, setting/lighting, good food, nice music, clean atmosphere and that is all I can say for now.  Will definitely be back soon and I hope to get the same server....Marisela."
