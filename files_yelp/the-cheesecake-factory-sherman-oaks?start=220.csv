Jay W.,"San Diego, CA",2,30,3,5.0,2/10/2017,Typical Cheesecake Factory but where this place shines is the service! I got off work late and needed food on a Friday night. Luckily Cheesecake Factory was open because I was craving the gumbo. I arrived and sat at the bar where I was greeted by two awesome bartenders. Desmond and Jason. They instantly made me feel welcomed and went out of there way to provide me with anything I needed. Truest hospitality professionals. The Mai tais were strong and the gumbo was delicious. And never forget about the delicious and complimentary bread. Thanks again gentlemen!!!
Ashley S.,"Lemon Grove, CA",0,36,4,1.0,1/20/2017,I have been here twice to have lunch and there is always a long wait to be seated with many empty tables doesn't make sense hire more staff
Lauren S.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,37,7,1.0,4/2/2016,"We have eaten at Cheesecake Factory for 20 plus years and I've come to the conclusion that this place is completely sub par, with terrible and non existent service with low quality food.  1) I don't know who the managers are and who they are hiring but everyone is rude and no one smiles. You wait forever only to be greeted by an annoyed server with zero personality. This has been our experience frequently. Tonight was the last straw. Our server messed up our order, gave an attitude, threw an incorrect replacement at us and proceeded to talk shit about us at the server station so loud my 9 year old said ""mommy she's talking about us."" The manager was completely useless, insincere, and made a sad apology to make up for the humiliation- um sorry that did not cut it. The restaurant is so busy that the staff doesn't have to try to be nice or keep customers. No one cares.  2) You can never find anyone- if you are missing something from your meal or even need a glass of water, good luck flagging down a server even though there are 100s of staff whizzing by. 3) I find all the food to be mediocre at best. And the cheesecake in my opinion is disgusting. It's so cloyingly sweet, and mixed with so many ingredients it's hard to even call it cheesecake. Blech.  It will be a long time before we go back."
Alex M.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/21/2016,"If I can rate it a zero I would! Cameron Pugh Cameron Pugh Cameron Pugh Cameron Pugh I ordered my old fashion and it took them 10 minutes.  When I asked to speak to the manager ..... Cameron Pugh came and before I even explained my situation he already started making excuses for his bartenders.   I've been to plenty of Cheesecake Factory's and more importantly a lot more bar/lounges.  No one has ever made me wait for 10 minutes when 5 out of the 14 seats are being occupied.   It was insulting when every time I plead my case he already knew the excuse to answer.  Not good manager and am really disappointed in CCF on this one.  I hope you make a note of it and rectify this problem.  Btw, I was in my golf attire and I don't know if this had anything to do with my treatment.    Thank you."
Sean A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,1,5.0,2/17/2017,"Long wait tonight but great service and food. Tonight one of the front host ""Malachi"" was a great help. He checked in multiple times with our party through out the wait, being empathetic to our hunger and having a over all pleasant and happy attitude and presence under the swarm of hungry people everywhere. Will be back agin and we defiantly appreciate the great costumer service."
Osbaldo G.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,76,229,1.0,9/24/2016,Just bad all the way from the hostesses to plain customer service 101. Not a good place to come and spend money here. You might as well go to jack and a box.
Melissa D.,"WEST HILLS, CA",468,51,2,1.0,12/31/2016,"Had lunch here and didn't have to wait longer than 10 minutes which was nice since it seemed busy during the lunch hour. The host called my name and then I was confused why other people were being sat before us and she had us just stand and wait still? I asked her if we were going to be seated and she said with a bit of attitude ""we're going down the list""..okay then why did you call me over to have me just stand in everyone's way? By the way the service really sucks here! Couldn't flag down my waiter whatsoever for water so I was pretty surprised this location would be like this."
Kevin J.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/28/2017,Worse service. Elizabeth the manager is very rude. She shouldn't hold management position.
Carlos C.,"Los Angeles, CA",80,17,49,1.0,12/30/2016,"I received a reply from someone named null, the respond written said to log in at the website and click on general information which cant be found. If you like to reach out call me 818 2208911."
Karlen A.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,12,4,4.0,2/10/2017,Came there to eat. Ordered pizza it wasn't that good. But overall experience is very nice. Service is good and fast. I liked the booths where you can get a sit. It was my first time there.
Scott B.,"Canyon Country, CA",538,978,3107,2.0,4/27/2015,"So I just experienced the Cheesecake Factory. Schoolteacher and I had an adventure that landed us somewhat kind of around this area. Remembering that I had been given a gift certificate from my father, I suggested we visit for lunch. We parked in the nearby structure, and walked through the mall over to the place.     After giving the hostess our name, I stuffed the vibrating buzzer thingy into my back pocket, and we discussed our adventures. The place was quite noisy, and the cacophony of the crowds of people waiting for entry into the restaurant, as well as nearby diners made it quite difficult to hear the buzzers alert. However, after some time, I jumped as my left ass-cheek felt the vibrating buzzer informing us that our table was ready. Excited, I returned to the hostess stand, and hostess girl took the buzzer, and said somebody will get you . There we waited for another ten or so minutes. Standing awkwardly in front of the hostess booth before somebody eventually came to get us.      We were led by somebody around the crowded labyrinthian pathways through the throng of tables and eventually seated at a table of our own. I was reminded of those people who work at county fair parking lots, fitting one car right next to another, doing their best to save as much space as possible so they can cram as many cars as they can into a field. We had a couple about a foot our left, and a mother and young daughter about a foot to our right. As we sat down, both couples looked up at us, smiled and politely nodded to us before returning to their personal devices.       Another lengthy wait, and another person came over with menus, introduced himself and took our beverage orders. Person took off and disappeared for some time. Knowing that there would probably be a desert round, I eventually settled upon the Renee's Special, which had some soup, some salad and some sandwich. Schoolteacher went with the Eggplant Parmesan for the same reason.       Eventually, order guy came back with our drinks, and breads. He then took our orders, and left. Presumably the bread was there to keep us busy while he went off for another break or something.  It was quite some time before somebody completely different delivered our food.  Schoolteacher and I chatted about our future plans while we waited for our food.      When the food arrived nearly an hour after ordering, I was quite surprised by the soup. Mainly because order person had neglected to inform what kind of soup came with the special. Turns out it was a baked potato kinda soup. It was quite good though. The salad was also crisp and fresh. The turkey sandwich used a baguette fragment for the bread. With it's rough and super hard exterior crust, it's not a bread I'd have personally made a sandwich from. I was reminded of this several times during the meal when a jagged ridge of crust painfully dug into the roof of my mouth. I'll agree with the other reviewers, the serving sizes are indeed quite large.  I was full before too long. Schoolteacher was also slowing down on her Eggplant Parm. We decided to get everything wrapped up, and order some cheesecake for later.      I asked a random employee passing by for a to-go box, and one was quickly handed too me. We packed up the remainder of bread, and the eggplant and then waited for order guy to arrive. Who showed up eventually. At that point, I asked him for boxes, some to-go cheesecake, as well as the bill. I had hoped to mitigate the excessive time between visits by getting everything all at once.     Packed up foods and bill arrived after another excessive wait. Thankfully, my total was just ninety cents over the gift certificate. I held onto the bill until the cheesecake arrived. I then packed up my to-go items, and left him a nominal tip. Probably more than I should have, but sometimes I'm far too nice for my own good.      We got our parking stub validated, and returned to the structure to leave.  Later on that evening, after our bellies had cleared room, the cheesecake was in fact, quite delicious.    So overall, the food was simply ok. The cheesecake (and I from what I've heard the drinks) is quite wonderful. The service however was as slow as molasses in January.  I didn't know who to complain about because I had fifty different people during the course of the nearly two hour meal. The place is crazy crowded, and as a result, it is super noisy. While here, I somewhat understand why couples don't talk to each other over the table, over the noise and simply stare transfixed by their phones. I did my best to converse with Schoolteacher, and it was quite the challenge. I honestly don't think I'll be back. Unless it's to order cheesecake to go from the cheesecake to go counter."
Busy B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,24,27,3.0,6/26/2016,"Super Super annoyed by the Staff here. This place is a MISS when it comes to SERVICE. HOWEVER, my loyalty to The Cheesecake Factory REMAINS! Over the years I have had great experiences at the Multiple locations of Cheesecake Factory: (Beverly Hills, Irvine, Marina Del Rey, Pasadena, Sherman Oaks, Cerritos, Santa Monica, Canoga Park) .... and I've always noticed the same thing... THE SERVICE CAN REALLY BRING DOWN YOUR EXPERIENCE HERE to the point you don't want to go back for several months, which can be great by going out to more non-chain restaurants to explore what ELSE is really out there :)  The food here will always be consistent, so if you find that one dish you love, that is what you will continue to get :) The cheesecakes are great and each with its own intense flavor. This place has to-go service, but if you get cheesecakes to go you may not get all the extra toppings or extra decorative chocolate slashes that goes with it when you dine in.  If you have a complaint, the managers are usually accommodating unless you get that one manager who's going to be RUDE and try to make it like you're the problem. This place is good for huge parties, if it's your birthday the staff will come out and Sing Happy Birthday!....and this is usually the place I get invited to when family or friends are having a Birthday Party Dinner.  Alls I got I say it SHAPE UP YOUR SERVICE And show how awesome your chain restaurants are!!!!"
Scott R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,29,2,1.0,10/9/2016,This restaurant is unsanitary.  They always place the silverware directly on the table and they reuse one rag to wipe all the tables with.  When I asked the manager for wrapped silverware she sent me to the to go cashier who only had plastic dinnerware.  So my friend had the worst birthday ever eating her birthday cake with a plastic fork! This place is filthy and should be shut down for health code violations!!! One star!!!! :(
Carl M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,40,15,5.0,1/30/2017,"Like this location in the sherman oaks, mall. Food is always so good here especially the vanilla cheesecake a must have after a meal here. Service also great here"
Audrey N.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,82,144,4.0,9/16/2016,"We took my son here to celebrate his birthday and we were able to get a table for all 10 of us very quickly! The waiter was friendly and did a great job! The bread we were served while waiting was delicious and the food came quickly! Everyone was happy with their meal except for my dad who wasn't impressed at all with the fish tacos. Everyone else got pasta and salads and enjoyed it and we shared with my dad so he was satisfied. I brought a cake (can you believe my son loves this place for the fettuccine alfredo and not the cheesecake?!?!) and the servers kept it in the fridge for me, put the candles on and brought it to him singing after dinner. It was great! Of course we had to get some cheesecake so we chose the hazelnut one and it was truly a slice of heaven! Made my visit enjoyable!! The ambience was nice and they had outdoor seating as well. The parking is a short walk away in the huge parking lot and CF validates so we didn't have to pay. I'd recommend this place especially if you love cheesecake!!!"
Mary Sophia V.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",1,18,5,3.0,4/13/2015,I find it this place pricey that's why I hardly come here. Friends from out of town wanted to try so we went for lunch. We spent $20 average for meal & soda which is on the lunch menu. Food is good. Loud place. Server is very nice.  We enjoyed the wheat bread and it's comp!
Pal R.,"San Jose, CA",0,18,,4.0,7/13/2017,Always a busy place. Ordered take out from here this week. Was not disappointed. Great food and good portions. Pricey - about $18 for pasta for dinner.
Kyle C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,2.0,12/25/2016,If they did not serve free bread this place would get 1 star. The service has been terrible on multiple occasions and at multiple locations. I do not understand how it can be so consistently bad. Poor management and training is the only explanation. Some dishes are good but they do not make up for the service. Avoid
Candace B.,"PANORAMA CITY, CA",195,279,2578,4.0,1/29/2016,"Enjoyed a nice lunch today with my son and his girlfriend. It was her first time eating at the restaurant so my son ordered a lot of food! All of it was delicious, served hot and with a smile. The server was kind, personable and very attentive. We ordered, crab cakes, calamari, avocado things (sorry I missed the name) and fried chicken sliders to start. All arrived at the table the same time. They ordered four cheese pasta and chicken and shrimp pasta. I ordered my regular miso salmon with mashed potatoes but I changed it to brown rice later and it was a non issue. We were so full from the appetizers, we had all our food packed to go. Of course we ordered cheesecake! Lemon meringue for me and white chocolate raspberry for her. The best!!!! No matter what flavor you choose. This location is always busy but we were seated right away and there was no delay in taking our order or bringing bread and water to the table. Kudos to the server!"
Maria B.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,73,64,5.0,11/3/2016,Love this place. Looks beautiful at night. The pumpkin cheesecake is a must. And they have a great selection on the menu. Service is good. Great for a date night. Or really anytime.
