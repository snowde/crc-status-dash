Nicole V.,"Los Angeles, CA",702,547,1570,4.0,6/21/2015,"This location is ideally located and caters well to the crowd there. I have been here many times, and while it is always busy they know how to make it work. I came here on father's day. It was crazy busy, but the staff took it in stride. I was there with a party of 5, and it w a going to be a 45 min wait. It made sense because it was father's day. My parents decided they wanted to pass the time by eating appetizers at the bat area. I got a long island ice tea, which was pretty good. That was my favorite 3rd choice as they didn't have the ingredients for the first 2 drinks I had originally chosen : passion fruit Margarita and Ruby red sunrise. It was fine though as the drinks were good and popular. As a table, we decided to order the calamari and the Thai lettuce wraps as appetizers. Both were made really quickly and prepared nicely. I decided to order the skinnylicious salmon, which comes wait it vegetables instead of the the mashed potatoes that the original version comes with.  My sister ordered the lunch portion chicken marshala, which is a pretty good size for a lunch portion. It was also cooked really well.  Lastly for dessert,  my sister and I ordered the sundae which was more than big enough to share between the two of us.  Overall, it was a pretty good experience.  I don't think you can ever go wrong with the cheesecake factory. :)"
Theresa L.,"Van Nuys, CA",0,13,2,3.0,1/7/2017,"I have changed my star rating based on how The Cheesecake factory responded to my complaint and quickly gave me an opportunity to revisit their restaurant, complements of The Cheesecake factory. I went to a different location but the service was much better!! I leave the rating in the middle due to our first experience, which is:  JAN/ 2017 First the wait was too long when they had multiple seats available on the patio. Our waitress seated us and brought us bread 3 times and then went on break. People seated 20 mins after us (3) different tables, received their food and finished before we got ours. Everyone at our table was fine with the food, however I ordered the Herb crusted Salmon dish with a lemon sauce and it was more like clarified butter with a squirt of lemon sauce. Never again, will we return here!! Customer service is key, and unfortunately this place lacks it!!"
Ariella F.,"Van Nuys, CA",0,13,1,2.0,8/24/2016,"This review is purely for the take out section. I arrived at this location before the doors opened at 11:30 to place my take-out order. One person ordered before me. I ordered my salad and they told me it would take 12 to 15 minutes. I paid and sat down. 30 minutes later, the person who ordered his salad right before me had already been given his food and left, the 10 or so people who came in with phone orders were given their food and sent away, even though their orders were clearly large and complicated.  I stood up to see if maybe I missed something when the girl behind the counter said to me ""yours isn't ready yet"". I sat back down and watched as more people came in and got bags and bags of food. Finally, a full 40 minutes after I had ordered, I stood up again and the girl at the counter asked a different girl if there was a Chinese chicken salad ready. She looked out a bag on the counter and said yes, and they gave me my food. I asked what time Phone order start getting taken, because I thought next time I should just call it in since clearly they prioritize phone orders. She was clearly aggravated when she told me ""no food orders go in before 1130"". If that's the case, I do not understand why my order took so long, I do not understand why the attitude towards me was hostile rather than apologetic when I waited almost three times as long as the estimate was on how long my food would take.  I get that it's a very busy time of day, but I didn't order anything complicated, and I wasn't rude at any point, despite having to wait for so long. The least they could have done was apologize for the long wait. My advice is never place a to go order inside the restaurant. Even if you have to stand outside and call it in, you'll be better off than doing it at the counter. And don't bother to tip them. Edit: Took the salad to my (not picky) 97 year old grandma for our weekly lunch and without me even saying anything about how disappointed I was in the service she started complaining about her salad. It looked like something from Applebees.  No color, bland, barely any chicken, all iceberg lettuce, few mandarins, few ""crunchies"". It was the dinner portion but it looked like nothing. What the heck did I do to piss someone off???"
Xae C.,"Los Angeles, CA",128,59,6,5.0,11/8/2016,"Cortney R is the best server ever. She was so attentive, genuinely cared about us having a great experience and was very welcoming and friendly. She went above and beyond to ensure we had a pleasant experience. We were incredibly bummed by Trump's projected victory and she came in and brightened our day. I only want to come when she's here. She needs a HUGE raise. Seriously. I'm not joking!"
Stevie W.,"Bettendorf, IA",0,15,,1.0,1/16/2017,"Great location to meet friends however, the food was nothing spectacular and they completely failed to meet our expectations when we had requested one meal be without garlic and onion due to allergic considerations."
Tania O.,"Anaheim, CA",13,76,184,5.0,4/18/2017,this place is good the only reason why i am not giving them 5 stars is becasue they need to have the white chocolate rasberry truffle cheesecake for the one more star lol But i love this place unlike the location in glendale their table ware was CLEAN!!!!! I'm actually gonna change my mind and give them 5 stars bc cleanliness is above all when it comes down to restaurants.. at least for me! :)
Ashlee B.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",3,7,,4.0,7/3/2017,Just had lunch here. Got the madra chicken it's was very fast and true side of potatoes were great. Service was also good. Parking here is not so easy.
Uriel M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,15,1,4.0,5/29/2016,Stopped by to grab some cheesecake I didnt know they were closing in 15 minutes so had to grab it to go the wait wasn't so bad no more than 10 minutes for 3 slices and it looked pretty busy. I had the tiramisu cheesecake and it is SO DELICIOUS very happy with my visit I will be back for dinner sooner than later
Igor K.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",86,41,1,3.0,4/20/2016,"Average, run-of-the-mill Cheesecake Factory. Plenty of parking in the mall (and they validate), but lines can be atrocious on the weekends.  Pro tip: ask them to go easy on the salt.. seems like the big trend over the last few years has been to dump excessive amounts of it on all the dishes."
Victor T.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",6,56,216,5.0,2/10/2015,"Cheesecake Factory, then there is "" Cheesecake Factory, Sherman Oaks Galleria "" this location with its open air dining is very special. Same eight known as menu but with a upscale attitude and atmosphere.The service is spotty as always for a cheesecake factory. With the added amenities I will not take away a star for that. They also have this waitress by the name of Dianne makes every body feels at home, She is a star alone."
Liz S.,"Los Angeles, CA",173,20,62,5.0,4/7/2016,Come here often absolutely love this place. From the food to the drinks and who can forget about the cheesecake. So many to choose from !!! Great staff always nice and friendly.
Jonathan R.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,13,8,4.0,5/3/2015,"Came here yesterday just for cheesecake ... you cant go wrong with a cheesecake at ' Cheesecake Factory' . As for the food, most of their dishes are not special at all and I was disappointed more then 3 times. I rather try a new place then come here for lunch or dinner.  Our server was very patient (his name was Mark) and we got excellent service. We changed our mind 2 times regarding choosing the cake hahaha it was hard to choose. But at the end he helped us to chose and the 'Vanilla Been ' was very light and delicious.  Always a line in front, I am sure this is the most popular restaurant in the area of Sherman Oaks."
Simon M.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",42,27,10,2.0,1/30/2016,"I cannot understand why people come here when there are so many amazing places nearby in the same price range. The service was incredibly slow. The plates were dirty. The food was mediocre at best. The table next to us were in the middle of their meal, went to the restroom, and had their entire table cleared while they were gone. Quite amateur for such a large chain."
Roxanne G.,"Los Angeles, CA",287,128,710,4.0,1/9/2016,"This review is only for my drink.  There was a 1 1/2 hour wait to sit (@ the bar) so I just grabbed my usual well mannered dirty, dirty with extra olives & stood and drank & drank and stood.  It never lets me down! Decided to go for round 2 & had a strawberry martini (friend had a hibiscus martini) both are very good but the strawberry one is diabolically strong.  Oh well, someone has to drink it, might as well be me! ;)"
Ronna B.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,70,69,2.0,1/23/2016,"Most of us know what Cheesecake Factory has to offer so this is a review for the service at this particular Cheesecake Factory.  I've been to this location plenty of times and their service seems on and off, really depending more on whether you get a good server/zone or not. The last time I went with my husband and daughter, it was for an early dinner/very late lunch, aound 4-ish in a Friday. As you might imagine, it wasn't exactly busy at this time.  They sat us in a weird corner booth by the corner end of the bar where the servers were having their breaks! The first thing we over hear from some servers are, ""OMG you're such a slut."" ""So? I flirt with everyone. Men, women, that's just me. I even kissed that one dude."" And it went on. My daughter's 3. Call me crazy but we typically don't like to be surrounded by conversations about ""sluts"" when we're out having a family meal with her.  Then the servers got back on the floor and we thought, trying to avoid the inconvenienc of having to move, we'd stay because maybe it'll be OK now. Well, another server came to the designated break table and promptly started complaining about how she did not want to be at work anymore. She's tired, bullshit at work, she wants to go home, etc. Don't know about you but I LOVE Debbie Downers! I don't get enough free complaints and tired, annoyed sighs at work so, of course, soon as I get home I want to go to a restaurant with my family and pay to hear people complain some more! We finally asked to be moved. A very pleasant server took our order. Never saw her again. Another came by our new table and asked if we had been moved and who was our original server. This person was also never seen again. A third person brought out our food, after a much longer wait than we anticipated for such a slow time, and this person really couldn't be bothered. Did not smile, was not pleasant, was very abrupt during all points of interaction with us. Our meal was +$60. I could have gotten this treatment at a $10 per plate restaurant."
Henk P.,"Atlanta, GA",42,9,2,5.0,11/26/2016,"By the line in front of The Cheese Cake Factory, it seems like this place is everyone's guilty pleasure in LA. What really made this over indulgent outing worth it, was our server's sense of humor and great knowledge of the menu. Antwyon is a great asset!"
Eric A.,"Valley Village, Los Angeles, CA",69,114,671,2.0,1/9/2016,"While I still love the food here, I must say that the experience of dining here just keeps getting worse and worse. They have a terrible seating system. You check in and they give you a pager. Then you wait forever. Then it goes off and you turn it in. They don't take you right to your table, you then have to wait longer while other people are taken to their tables. Then someone finally calls your name and you go to a table. Tonight we waited 10 minutes between the time we turned in our pager to the time we went to our table. For people who have never been here, it's very confusing. You think when your pager goes off, you're going to be taken to your table, not wait in another line! The foyer area is very poorly designed and you have waiters rudely plowing their way through because there's nowhere for the double lines of people waiting to really stand.  Our waiter tonight, while very nice was S - L - O - W. Took our drink order and said he'd bring us bread right away. Took about 5 minutes to get our drinks even though we were right next to the drink station. It took 10 minutes to get bread. Other waiters were bringing bread within minutes of people sitting down. Took a good long while to get our food, but it was very crowded. Then we ordered dessert and it took another 19 minutes for that to come. We were actually in the restaurant for over 2 hours. Then to top it off, we had to pay for parking because we were there so long. We got one refill on our drinks and no refills on bread (I would have loved some more sourdough bread to go with my pasta.  So I'm lowering my review from 5 stars to 2 stars because the problems in how the restaurant doesn't work, overshadows how good the food is."
Griselda S.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,7,15,4.0,1/14/2015,"First time here and had a great experience. Noise friendly and kind staff. I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta and it was delicious. Thanks to the server that recommended it  Oh! And the best part, they serve bread with butter"
Kristen A.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,10,,1.0,12/20/2015,"I was all riled up to write this review after the first transgression listed below, but after the third - well, at this point, I'm just too tired.  So.... I will leave you with the following: 1. There was a milky white garlicky substance in my water (later to find out, due to a dirty cup).  2. After being promised a piece of free cheesecake for the mishap, I asked for a piece of their popular wheat bread to get the taste of garlic out of my mouth. I asked my waiter, the manager, and a bus boy. The bus boy eventually brought  it.  3. Shortly after receiving my bread, the umbrella touching the heat lamp caught on fire. Another waiter promptly put it out. 4. About an hour after the cup mishap (hey, waiter, are you avoiding us?) we finally receive our food. Hey, how come the cheese in my Mac and Cheese balls isn't even melted? Oh, because it wasn't cooked.  5. The waiter finally comes back over to us and I get another cup of Coke. Lo and behold, there is rice in it.  At this point just get us a couple of boxes to go and I'll heat this crap up at home."
