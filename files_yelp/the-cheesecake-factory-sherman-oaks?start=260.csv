Ash M.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",7,202,134,1.0,12/13/2015,"Horrible customer service, over crowded unorganized. I've been to this cheesecake location more then I would say 20 times over the years and I've noticed it's gone bad thru the years from service to staff members. Our last visit did it for me, and I will never return to this location again.  I checked in for Party of 4 they told us about 35-40 minutes. They don't take your phone number to text you, so when we asked for a buzzer she mentioned she out of it.  We return back after waiting 35 minutes to check on our table status, she advise us to wait another 20 minutes. Then they couldn't find my name, horrible service unorganized I ask for the manager he finally was able to get us a sit after an hour of waiting. Took 25 minutes to bring our appetizer, within few minutes they brought our entrées we didn't even have a chance to eat our appetizer a manager approached us to apologize for the late food arrival. But a apology don't solve a bad service. Don't waste your time going here!!!"
Lauren R.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",4,18,15,1.0,7/10/2016,My Pasta   was ok but the service was horrible we have to wait 15 minutes for Coke refill
Jessica S.,"North Hollywood, CA",76,190,45,4.0,8/31/2016,"I come here pretty frequently after the movies. They are open late and we almost never have to wait longer than 10 minutes for a table. As far as cheesecake factories go, this one is standard. They don't push you off your table. Two large patios with heaters. Sometimes service can be a little slow. I don't think that's any fault of the servers... More so that management understaffs the floor. Over the last few years Cheesecake Factory has really expanded their skinnylicious menu which is great. It is now really easy to get a pretty guilt free yet delicious meal. This is probably the ONLY chain big box restaurant that I eat consistently at. Parking validation for dinner which makes parking cheap, If not free. The lot here in Sherman oaks can be a bit annoying. You may have to park a bit far away and walk. Remember to snap a photo of where you are so that you can find your car easily."
Nina M.,"Princeton, NJ",17,61,77,5.0,12/26/2014,"The cheesecakes are to die for! Just cant decide which one to get because they are so many and looking delicious! To go save you can always eat the classic one and may put some extra topping if you want. The avocado egg rolls are indeed delicious, great for a starter and if you plan to have a main course after, they will be just enough for 2-3 people to try. The burrito grande is a great surprise and its really huge. Unless you didn't eat for a day, I don't think a woman can eat it all, so you will have lunch for the next say too :) Great service and good price wise."
Mrs W.,"Culver City, Los Angeles, CA",2,10,10,1.0,7/3/2016,If I can give this place a 0 I would. This is my first time ever trying Cheesecake Factory and I will never come back due to the service and food. The pasta was hard my husband fish and chip fish was good but fries where soooooooo bad they twist like they have been sitting for hours! I don't complain I don't even do a lot of review but for this I will post one. We asked for the bread and he said its in the oven it will be right out. 15min later no server so I called him over and asked if the bread out of the oven. Why???? Should I have to ask. I will never come back again.
Houman M.,"Los Angeles, CA",132,38,3,1.0,7/4/2016,Rude staff when it comes to take out orders. I feel as though if they are completely understaffed. This is the only time that I've experienced this; It has happened on numerous occasions.
Cinay F.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,22,14,1.0,8/9/2016,Use to love Cheesecake Factory but had the worst experience and customer service here . My friends and I ordered the chicken tostada salad and it came out very bitter and sour and barely any chicken. We complained and switched to another dish instead and the wait time was ridiculous . Took forever we were about to walk out and when the food came it was just average nothing great and an expensive bill for poor quality food . The waitress did not apologize for our awful salads we received or the long wait Time . Not returning to this place only for the cheesecake to go .
Betsy R.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",232,11,,1.0,12/11/2015,"Horrendously terrible Take-Out experience here today. The Cheesecake Factory always seems like a fun option with good food and great variety, so we thought it would be a great choice to celebrate an office birthday.  We were wrong. Our order was placed at 11:20 a.m.  We were told it would be ready at 11:45.  At 11:55 it was still not ready. After asking 3 different people for assistance and being ignored/brushed off by all of them, the order was finally received at 12:25.  ONE HOUR after being placed. FORTY minutes of waiting later. When I called to speak to a manager to let them know about our experience, I hung up after being placed on hold for over 3 minutes.  We've wasted enough collective time on the Cheesecake Factory today.  I write this review in the hopes that you will not meet the same fate. Unbelievable lack of organization, efficiency, attention or care."
Jenny M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/23/2016,"It was a Wednesday, @4pm, a party of 10, including 3 toddlers & we wanted to eat outside.   Hostess #1, says that she will have to check with manager to see if we can be seated outside.  Hostess #2, says that it is not a problem, & to give them a few minutes.  Hostess #3, walks us to a table inside.  Then I ask to speak with the Manager, who says we can wait for a table outside for 20 minutes but the service may not be good. Needless to say, we went to eat right across the way to El Torito Grill & not only were we seated right away, to an outside table, but our waiter and the food was exceptional! Now I remember why I have only frequented The Cheesecake Factory two times, in the 11 years, that I have lived in CA."
sergey s.,"Tarzana, CA",30,90,30,4.0,9/7/2015,"Service is always top notch at any Cheesecake Factory. Menu is long and cab be confusing.  Dont eat too much bread before your food comes! Every item on the menu is great, except philly cheese steak.  Do try the Vietnamese Summer Rolls, they are very tasty and come with 2 great sauces. I always get a salad every time. One of the best chains."
Ara O.,"Los Angeles, CA",615,155,904,5.0,1/3/2016,"I come here for business lunches all the time because it's close to my office and there is a 24 hour fitness in the same building - that way I can workout just before I eat. I usually get a salad and my favorite is the vegetarian with grilled chicken. I ask the server to put half in a to go box and I eat the other half at the restaurant, that way I have a meal for later too. They validate parking and the prices are reasonable. My only gripe is the long wait all the time."
Steven M.,"West Hollywood, CA",120,27,1,1.0,4/8/2017,"This is the absolute worst Cheesecake Factory location in the Los Angeles area. I know because I used to go to school at Paul Mitchell next door and I would frequent this location and never had a great experience. I came to this location twice in 3 weeks. Most recently I went for lunch yesterday with two friends of mine. The wait was only 10-15 minutes which isn't bad for Cheesecake. I always order the same item: Four Cheese Pasta with a substitution of Rigatoni. It's my favorite dish. Sometimes we order a few appetizers or small dishes. This location HAS THE WORST FOOD of any Cheesecake location I've been to. It's just never on point or tastes right. My poor friend ordered a cheese pizza and it tasted like dish soap and smelled absolutely disgusting. It's like they cooked her pizza on a half dirty and half soapy tray. The young male server with curly hair was polite, but he should re-think serving as a career choice. First he forgot my lemonade that I ordered until half way through the meal. Our waters were always low. He never remembered to bring us bread a second time. After I was finished eating, with no water and no lemonade, he finally asked if I wanted a refill. It was too late, I already was dying of thirst the whole meal! He was never within ear shot to call over to tell. My pasta was rubbery and the sauce was bland. My other friend had a salad and hers seemed good. Then, my friend (after only eating a bite of her pizza) told the waiter about the taste of her food and he just said sorry and didn't even offer her a menu or to substitute it for something else. It's never a memorable dining experience and the food is always below average here. I would re-think coming to this location if you are trying to find a nice place for lunch or dinner in this area. Plenty of better restaurants to patronize!"
Lany J.,"Los Angeles, CA",167,20,,1.0,11/20/2016,"THE WORST COSTUMER SERVICE EVER: My friend and I went to this location today for lunch today. The wait was a bit long so we asked to sit in the bar area . We find a seat in the bar area and then a waiter by the name of Cynthia asked us ""did someone walk you here?"" I said excuse me... she repeated herself and said that if we weren't seated there, then we had to move. I guess we could only sit at the top tables. We go back to the entrance and tell the guy that was doing the seating about her attitude, she starts to make faces and laugh as we are talking. Never been so disrespected in my life. We just left because I would rather eat at a place that is respectful of all their customers and values their business."
Anna S.,"Simi Valley, CA",9,22,5,1.0,6/18/2016,Terrible. Went in before our movie and sat out on the patio for 10 minutes and not even one server came to take our order or check on us. Rude and they were not even busy.
Matthew G.,"Sylmar, CA",2,4,4,4.0,4/28/2016,"Great customer service , very friendly! They came to check up if everything was okay. Food was amazing! I'll make sure I have my monthly visits here."
Evelina W.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA",514,501,526,4.0,11/12/2014,"I came here for a client event and the food and drinks were delicious! This was the pre-party to Spa Night at Burke Williams. What a treat for the clients!  We got here for Happy Hour (4pm - 6pm) and got a few drinks and appetizers. They had pretty gourmet appetizers for $5, including crab and artichoke dip. The margaritas and mojitos were also $5. The service was amazing and she was very friendly and attentive to the group. Everyone made it to Burke Williams on time.  As soon as we left around 6pm, the restaurant became packed! I don't come here often, but I can see it's a population location in the Galleria."
Nathan M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,25,18,5.0,9/26/2016,WHY YOU GOTTA FIGHT WITH ME AT CHEESECAKE... You know I love to go there.. Cheesecake is a family favorite.We love everything at cheesecake.From the breads to the pasta to the actual cheesecake.You won't leave Cheesecake Factory hungry ever.My favorite item from here would be the lousiana fried chicken pasta.Its spicy and crisp. I've been to Wallys and Il pastia and let me just say somethin...Those two restaurants are only good for the snapchat filter and geotag.You haven't had real pasta till you try the Fried Chicken Lousiana Pasta.The waiter was a cute blonde such a sweetheart.Your drinks will be refilled every second and you'll feel like a king dining.
Sabrina F.,"Los Angeles, CA",133,249,82,4.0,8/26/2016,"The food is always good, but of course there's always a line.  They were very sweet about bringing out a set up for my toddler who wanted to eat and wear the pasta. Great service here."
Sam R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,2.0,10/9/2016,Unsanitary. They put silverware on tables not on top of napkins or rolled up in napkins. They wipe down tables with the same rag as all the other dirty tables then put clean silverware down; bacteria is still on the table. I mentioned to them before but nothing changed. Food is good still so 2 stars.
Jean G.,"Van Nuys, CA",82,13,3,3.0,9/2/2016,"I used to go to here often for their appetizers. So naturally, after a long hiatus, I decided to order appetizers! I'm not sure if they changed their recipe or if the chef makes it differently. But it has definitely changed. The ahi tuna tartare used to taste so fresh and this time around it just tasted differently. Instead of chunks of tuna, it was a clump. The fried zucchini had too much batter and tasted just that, batter. I hope they up their ante sooner than later."
