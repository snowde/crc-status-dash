Naor A.,"Canyon Lake, CA",314,5,,5.0,10/21/2016,"Great service, food came hot and fast. Our waiter was called Tom very nice guy that took his time with us ordering.."
Michael D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2152,1759,2038,5.0,6/19/2016,"What can you say, Cheesecake is the ultimate corporate restaurant. Top of the food chain. Haters will say what they want but it's still the best food and service out there. I think I've tried almost everything on the menu and never have had a bad experience. I'm the type of guy that feels that the more you pay for something, the more you should expect from the establishment that is charging you! Cheesecake always delivers a top rated experience for me and my family. There were three of us and the bill came out to about $65 which I gladly paid because it made me and my family happy to be there. If they're happy, I'm happy!"
Brian O.,"Grantville, San Diego, CA",12,17,2,3.0,9/7/2016,So the last time I was here the service was not that great. I mean they did sat us in a reasonable time but when they did we sat and waited for like almost 30 minutes until out server showed up. I've been to many cheese cake factory restaurants but this one has to be the one I didn't enjoy. Like don't get me wrong the food is good but the whole service needs some work.
Key L.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,62,20,5.0,1/26/2016,"This review is for Valarie!!  Thank you for helping me with my take out order. You really went above & beyond with customer service & your suggestion was great!!  I would have been upset with the crab & artichoke dip, but you saved me!! I appreciate that!  Thank you !!!  Thank you !!!"
Shawna C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",227,44,27,3.0,1/6/2016,"My daughter is in town from college and  I had a event in Canoga Park and despite all the rain we decided to stop here for some grub.  First, yes we were a party of  two but that doesn't mean I want to eat my lunch in the bar area. Listen here hostess there is clearly space in the dining room we will sit there thanks. Secondly, we're ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta no mushrooms and....it showed up with Mushrooms. The pasta was average.  We also shared the beef burger which was actually flavorful and I requested the meat well done.  Our waitress was really nice and accomadating. Even so, I must say I won't be making any special trips to grub here."

Dean P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",114,808,3351,4.0,11/22/2015,"Had a wonderful dinner last night. For years I had burned out of this place growing up in Orange county. It was always busy and nothing was GREAT, in my opinion. I gave it another try last night and it was a very good experience. We had a salmon salad and meatloaf with wontons as an appetizer. Everything was wonderful including the service. Maybe Im a fan again..."
Miss Leo L.,"Glendale, CA",4,8,2,1.0,7/12/2016,"My girlfriends and I thought to have a great lunch date however this did not occur. We arrived at at opening time 11:40 pm opening states 11:30. Clearly the staff was not organized and ready to go. As soon as we were seated we noticed the table was extremely sticky to the touch and the menus full of food as we opened them.  Pretty gross. The waitress, Ashely, apparently was not in the mood of giving any bit of customer service as she ignored our drink order and walked away. We advised her of the sticky table and she rolled her eyes and said would let someone know.  So then.. Here comes bad employ number 2. He snatched up all 3 silverware settings  and slamming the plates as he picked up.  Ridiculous attitude everywhere. This was enough we walked to the hostess and asked for the manager and was asked why. Overall, horrible experience!"
Jason Z.,"Santa Monica, CA",162,45,298,1.0,5/15/2016,"Im Just so disappointed I really liked this place I used to eat here all the time but they just went down in quality and service drastically! I came here today and ordered a hibachi steak and they brought it out cold looked like it sat out for a while and so I told the server that the food is cold, he said they will remake it and it will take 10 or 15 min so I said okay that's fine, another server came back with the same exact plate NOT a new one and again it was completely cold and this time it also looked dry i could see that it was the same plate I'm not really sure what they did with it during that time but it looked worse so I told the server it was cold and dry he said (oh wow yea I can see it looks dry that's not okay) and offered to change it again but at that point I said no thank you this is just unprofessional, so he called the manager and the manager (camron I believe his name was) I explained everything again and he came and offered the same thing to remake it for the third time but as I said that was unprofessional and I was just upset at that point so I asked for the bill and they charged me $14.37 for the rest of the stuff and so first thing I paid it and after I paid I that I told camron the manager that I am just disappointed with that whole situation and that considering that I waited here for almost an hour receiving cold food 2 times and now I am leaving hungry and upset to go eat somewhere else I would not expect the Cheesecake Factory to charge me $14.37 for coffee iced tea and these small things! This is not the impression that I had from the Cheesecake Factory I really saw this place as a restaurant that has great service and respected they're restaurant name but they do NOT I can honestly go on for ten more minutes about the bad service I received here and how disappointed I am of this place but I will leave it at the fact that I left hungry and upset and won't go back ever just because they unprofessionally did nothing to make it up to me or correct the mistake and again I left your place hungry and I paid....."
Brian C.,"San Diego, CA",169,192,15,4.0,2/7/2015,"The food is great here. There are so many choices and that's what I love about this place.  One problem is that this location gets absolutely packed for dinner. So, it's a good idea to eat here a little earlier.  Service is hit and miss, and that's why I don't drop a 5 star rating on this place. The last time we ate here before a movie and gave ourselves almost an hour and a half to get in and out. Service was really slow, took a long time to get drinks, and our waitress disappeared like Houdini. Very frustrating. So, we skipped the appetizers and gobbled down the grub. We almost didn't get out in time.  Overall, a quality joint. 4 stars."
Alyson M.,"Charleston, WV",0,7,1,3.0,7/2/2016,"This is my first time eating at this location. I ordered to go so I could eat it on my lunch and have to say I was pretty disappointed. I ordered the Renee's lunch special: turkey sandwich, ranch dressing with the salad, soup, and complimentary bread. I also asked for a side of mayo. When I got my meal, it was the chicken salad sandwich, the salad had the wrong dressing, no bread, no mayo, and no spoon to eat my soup. I only have 30 mins for lunch so I couldn't go back and fix it. It takes a lot for me to write a bad review since I've been a server for 7 years.... but this was just aaalll messed up. 3 stars because the soup I ate later when I got home was actually pretty good and the staff was friendly."
Guillermo S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,11,7,5.0,1/12/2016,"I've been to this location plenty of times and for the most part my visits have been positive.  Last night (Jan 10th) my sister in-law decides she wants the whole family to have dinner there on her birthday. That would make 17 of us, total. After informing the hostess, she has a puzzled look on her face and tells me that there are 50 guests ahead of us and it would be a 2 and a half hour wait... We decide to wait. Not only did they have us seated in exactly half that time, but Christian was an absolute delight. Even after we told him that we had 5 separate checks, he didn't bat an eyelash. Our visit was a blast, the food was on point and as patrons, we were never left wanted more.  Thank you to The Cheesecake Factory staff and especially Christian for the phenomenal visit."
EL_Muncher G.,"Los Angeles, CA",181,32,35,5.0,7/18/2016,"Sady was sooooooooo amaziiiiiinggggggg!!!!!! Whatever you want she gottttt itttttttt!!!!! Service was truly exceptional I was so nervous bringing my business partners over here and everything turned out better than good! We all had a great time and we were treated equally, we all felt welcomed and noticed. She recommended some off the chain dishes!! I couldn't believe I was eating so good ! If there was 100 stars she would get it ! All drinks were on point l!"
Victoria O.,"Beverly Hills, CA",4,32,2,3.0,11/8/2015,"Never again, as the hostess told us the wait will be a half an hour wait, we were seat down a hour and half after with 3 children in tow! One hour for the beep to vibrate and half an hour for the hostess to seat us in this disgusting patio, with a dirty and sticky table left with some salad leafs. Yeah, it was dark, let say... The food was disgusting and all the employees are running around like a headless chicken. Crossed from my list FOREVER! Also I need to say that I complained online to their  corporation. The manager himself called me and offered me a $15 gift card. I do appreciate this gesture."
Jennifer R.,"Los Angeles, CA",77,13,,5.0,9/30/2016,Amazing cheesecake & their food is delicious. Great customer services & very friendly staff. Absolutely recommend for fun weekend nights! Their drinks are always pretty good and the food portions are just right.
Whitney B.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",0,5,1,5.0,7/15/2016,Loveeee the food here !!! And the staff is prompt and attentive. When I got my food I noticed that it was too spicy and they took it back no problem and let me order another dish.
Donatella P.,"Burbank, CA",0,32,,2.0,9/25/2016,"Horrible experience.   We were a party of eight on a Saturday at 4 pm.  Since we were out celebrating a birthday and playing mini golf nearby, we thought we'd give this branch a try.  We phoned to get an idea of the wait time was.  The rep had no clue when I called.  The first call got ""disconnected"" apparently.  The second time I called, she placed me on hold to find out.  Three minutes went by without a response,  so I hung up.   We drove there within 10 minutes and there wasn't even one person waiting in the lobby nor outside.  We were told it was going to be a 45-minute wait.  When we asked why since they were empty, the rude front desk girl said, ""Well, yes, people are waiting.""  Really?  No one around and with many empty tables in the restaurant ???  We then asked to speak to a manager and with a rolling of the eyes, the front desk girl paged her.   Stephanie the manager came out.  I explained the situation and asked why there would be a 45 min. wait when the restaurant was practically empty.  I even showed her my phone with the calls I had placed, and she saw that I was not lying.  She told me that she was going to accommodate us right away, that there were two empty tables and were going to wait for a third table to pay and leave so they could seat us.  To make a long story short, 25 minutes went by before I saw the manager again walking around.  I approached Stephanie again asking if she had forgotten about us.  She was shocked to see that we had not been seated.  At that point, we were seated right away.   I ask myself, why are they so rude?  Who do they think they are?  People with higher class and education don't do that.  If the front desk people are not happy or hate their jobs, then they should leave!  But while they're there working and getting paid a salary that comes directly from customers' money, then the least they should do is do their job in a decent manner.    There was no reason to make us wait at all!!  We love Cheesecake Factory and love to take our kids' friends there to eat as part of their birthday celebrations.  We now know never to step in the Sherman Oaks Cheesecake Factory ever again."
Danielle T.,"Palmdale, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/23/2016,"I came into this location, with some friends who were from out of town visiting from San Francisco. A party of 13 total. And they made us wait 2 hours and 45 mins for a table. It was unacceptable and we are never going back to that location."
Arlen P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,12,,1.0,3/24/2017,"My wife and I just left the Cheesecake Factory in Sherman Oaks for the last time. What happened to this once very good restaurant? It wasn't very busy but service was miserable. They never came back to check on us, see how the meal was. My wife wanted a cup of coffee ... no one came to the table. My wife got up and asked for the coffee ... still didn't come. Then I got up and asked for the coffee ... which finally came. In the meantime ... servers standing around chatting. And the food: not what it used to be. Skimpy Cobb salad. Food cold. Not very tasty. Smaller portions. Another thing: my wife went to the restroom ... and was back quickly. It was filthy. Managemnt didn;t seem to care. Odd attitude. One final thing: prices have gone up. So if you want to overpay for mediocre food, barely served to you, have fun at the Cheesecake Factory. We choose to go elsewhere ... you should too! P.S. I was forced to rate the restaurant, which I would normally give ZERO stars. It gave the place one star. ZERO stars is my rating"
Nancy T.,"Orange County, CA",405,1218,301,3.0,9/6/2015,"I'm a serial Cheesecake Factory chain visitor, so I find myself coming to this location quite often. This location is exactly what you would expect from any of the other CF chains, but it's especially good because the food (especially the bread) seems superior here compared to all other locations and especially bad because the traffic/parking can get pretty horrendous. My favorite part about this location is the enclosed outdoor patio, which gives you a great view of the inside of the Galleria, as well as bustling Ventura Blvd!"
