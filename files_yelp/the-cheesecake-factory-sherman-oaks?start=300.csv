Alex S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,22,5,1.0,11/19/2016,"Had the most terrible experience today. After coming to the place and checked-in(there was a line of couple people waiting) was told that I will be seated in a few. I asked if there is a line and hosted replied that I'm 3rd in line and it would be just a couple of minutes. I didn't count people waiting though...but after ten minutes waiting I noticed something weird different people standing near and looks like some just came in and was already seated. I decided to wait 5 more minutes. After coming back to front desk and asking what is my place in line hostess replied ""They're cleaning the tables and you will be seated shortly"". She just told me this standard phrase and she didn't even bother to double check. I believed her and waited 15 more minutes. The situation was already ridiculous and I asked some other lady standing near the front desk. She checked my name in line and didn't find it. She asked the main hostess what's up, and she checked also and replied ""well it was there"". After than I was seated. Sound like no big deal...well for me wait 30 or 40 minutes not a big deal. But the way this lady treat me is unacceptable. Excuse me, am I in McDonalds? What's more frustrating - this lady lied to me! She just lied, didn't bother to do her job and finally didn't even asked apology this? No seriously simple ""I'm sorry I messed up with your place in line"" would do. But no...nothing. And you know why? Because she doesn't sorry. She doesn't care. She's there 10am to 6pm 5 days a week whatever. Paycheck is coming and that's it. No efforts to do her job properly. Poor customer service, disorganized staff. Worst experience ever."
Michele B.,"Los Angeles, CA",55,108,143,5.0,1/19/2016,"Long wait on wnkds, but acceptable because both the service and the food/drinks were amazing. They should have a kids-free area because being kicked on the superior leg by the neighbor's bad behaved kid sucks! And note: I love kids! Just can't stand in such things. Kids running on the booth and kicking other clients? Common! End of story, best passion fruit mojito ever!! Love!"
Carlos J.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,10,,5.0,9/15/2015,"This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory and let me tell you i don't know why it took me  so long to try their food! My girlfriend and I went on a Saturday night so i was thinking the wait was going to be an hour when it was really thirty minutes.  We were seated on the patio and ordered the fried calamari. It was crispy,  mouth watering and scrumptious! not as good as the calamari I tried in San Fransisco but it was a close second.   I also ordered a  long Island Iced Tea. I don't know if It was me or I was feeling like a light weight that day, but It was much stronger than the other long island iced teas I had tried at other restaurants. My girlfriend ordered the Factory Peach Bellini. I was surprised she ordered a drink, because she doesn't drink often and she is an extreme light weight. I was thinking I might have to carry her back to my car, but luckily that didn't  happen.  On to the Entree's! I had the chicken piccata pasta. I was told this was the best pasta on the menu. I was not disappointed with it. The sauce was on point. Creamy, flavorful and a hint of lemon made the angel hair pasta taste like I was at some high up scale Italian restaurant. My girlfriend got the Alfredo Fettuccine Pasta. She enjoyed it. I'll be honest she is picky about her food too. ( I mean i consider myself a good cook, but sometimes she doesn't eat what I make her, like wtf) so she ended up finishing the whole plate. Yup we were that hungry.  Finally we ordered tiramisu. The presentation was remarkable. It looked like a $100 dessert . I was feeling a little fancy after the it arrived on the table. The taste didn't match the presentation, but overall it was still a good dessert. Frankly I am not a big fan of tiramisu anyways so I wasn't disappointed with the taste. Overall I would love to eat out here again. The environment was great, Service was fast and friendly. The bill was a little high but that was because of our drinks. Other than that I don't have any complaints about the Cheese Cake Factory."
Sam M.,"Los Angeles, CA",147,14,,2.0,3/19/2017,"The food is so delicious at cheesecake factory but unfortunately this particular location has so many problems. The take-out department is the absolute worst. This location happens to be right across the street from us so we keep using it, but that's the only reason. Our order almost always comes out wrong or missing something (we don't customize our orders BTW so it's not like it is complicated). They are also the stingiest restaurant in the world with their sauces. And if you ask them for extra sauce you get maybe a teaspoon more. The cherry on top of the sundae is that we are always quoted about 25 mins wait time and are constantly sitting there waiting for 45 mins to an hour. It's so damn frustrating. Management is always quick to apologize and offer a piece of cheesecake rather than fix the problem. I don't want cheesecake! I just want to get my food and leave.  If i was trying to spend an hour in a restaurant i would just eat there. The only reason this place gets a 2nd star is because the one time we ate in we had a great experience."
Contessa B.,"Los Angeles, CA",60,89,84,5.0,12/11/2015,Went one Sunday nite since we had a sitter for the boy. No wait. Great service. Gets 5stars!
Cece L.,"North Hollywood, CA",36,36,13,1.0,5/10/2016,"""You burned your last friend here, lady"" So it's Mother's Day and I thought ""hey! Let's take my mom for brunch"" worst decision ever.  I didn't know racism still existed this heavily at a restaurant that employees all races, sexes, and creeds. Guess that doesn't apply to how the people coming there are treated.  If I wanted to be served cold chicken, cold eggs, cold omelette, I would have gone to Marie Calenders or some sht.  And the waitress.(it was 1:45 pm shift outside patio, front patio- think her name was Lauren, she had long brunette hair and she was short 5'6) comes over and is so disrespectful and condescending to my mother when she told her that she wasn't happy with the temperature of her food. She acted as if my mother was lying to her.... She didn't touch the food at all. We don't need to dine and dash lady. We have money. She made my mom feel like crap,  on Mother's Day. I asked for the manager. And the manager was pissed. Number one the waitress said ""we can just take it back and hear it right on up for you again"" that's against health code. You cannot/should not reheat eggs like that. Or raw chicken. I'm sure it was raw cause it was cold. Worst. Experience. Ever.  Not only did this waitress become super condescending at the end, she tells another (black) waiter to come and I guess """"deal"""" with us. What a way to ruin Mother's Day. The manager did the right thing and comped the meals that we didn't touch. They took them back after they touched it and it was ICE COLD. I wasn't paying for that crap.  I will never go back to this place. Plus note, we had a wonderful dinner at a BETTER non-racist restaurant.  Green apple China bistro. Much better. Their food was ACTUALLY HOT!! Lmao."
Abe D.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,12,,3.0,8/4/2016,"We Love this place for the food and of course the cheesecake. So Yummy! We just recently went for my wife's birthday, and the guys that came out and sang happy birthday to her had the best A Capella singing voices I have ever heard at a restaurant. I know that's not saying much, but they were pretty good, and it made her night. The service staff are friendly and cordial, but very slow. It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks, and another 20 minutes for them to bring pepper to our table (the table only had salt, so we asked for pepper). All in all, we enjoyed our time here, just make sure you are not in a hurry."
Shadi M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,3,,5.0,12/17/2015,"I'm a huge fan, the food was amazing with a great customer service , You should try the Oreo cheesecake"
mary c.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,2.0,3/30/2017,"I reluctantly writing a negative review of a restaurant that was previously a very pleasant,anticipated experience. The food is till yummy.. but the service is mediocrely to poor.  Have dined many times as this location is close to home.  Have observed downtrend of wait staff essentially forgetting about us after food is served.  They may check maybe only once prior to the presentation of the check. We chose to eat there last Friday,again busy wait staff,but busy on what?? I searched for our server,and noticed many gathering  in the entrance to the kitchen...private happy hour for the staff only? I did inform the manager my concerns,my observations,he appeared concerned, but I don't expect any change...Too many rstaraunts to chose from without needing to be neglected. I don't need to be treated as "" special guest"" just another paying customer that misses when they were previously my consumer friendly. I guess just breaking up...I was still hoping for better times...grieving over."
Stars S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,101,51,3.0,8/16/2015,"I've been here many times. Food is good, waiters are (most of the time) friendly, and the hosts/hostesses are nice. My only problem is the seating. This seems to be a thing in every cheesecake location. Most of the time when we ask the waitress or host for a booth or more private seating, they cater to our needs. Today though, the girl gave us no choice and told us to sit in those terrible (no personal space) seats that are in the middle. We asked for a booth and she said ""no that's for parties of 4"". The booths were clearly suitable for 2 people rather than 4. I didn't want to get into it with her so I told her to ""forget it"" & left.  Look Cheesecake Factory, no one likes those terrible middle tables. I went to the one in the grove few days before and they sat my cousin & I in those same horrible seats. However ! That one I understood because they were having a busy night. Today in Sherman oaks though, it wasn't overboard busy and that booth was a perfect fit for 2 PEOPLE !  Idk what you guys were thinking when you made those middle aisle tables but I think they work best for the parties of 4 or more rather than putting parties 2 there. I mean you awkwardly sit there & you can't have much of a conversation cos the people at the other table are at VERY close proximity to you are listening or they start judging what you ordered or THEY'RE JUST AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS YOU !  If you seat only big groups there & not small ones then we can all have a happy dining experience (: TL;DR ? : Middle/ Crowded/ Uncomfortable seats are not for parties of 2 !  P.S. : Easy on the salt !"
Matthew H.,"Washington, DC",774,1035,605,2.0,8/21/2015,"The tables are way too bunched up, even for a Cheesecake Factory. The service is corporate as expected, and the food is subpar. I'm not sure why this chain is always busy."
Rob G.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,172,25,5.0,8/11/2016,"This food here is definitely delicious beyond the cheesecake.  Its a definite place to return to. The wait can be a little long, however its well worth it."
Candelario G.,"North Hills, CA",40,25,10,4.0,7/29/2016,Food is great the price is ok but the wait time was just a bit too much too be during a week day at 2pm thats why I will take a star away
Nicole R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,3.0,8/9/2016,"To keep it short and simple, my party and I had to wait 15 minutes for appetizers and 20 minutes after that for our main course. It wasn't too busy when we went so I was surprised at how long we had to wait for our food. I ordered the shrimp scampi and steak Diane and it was alright, could've been way better (at least for the mashed potatoes). I felt sick right after I ate that I didn't want to order dessert (I know, who doesn't order cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory after their meal?). But if I did, I'd probably wait another 20 minutes for that as well."
Ms. P.,"Greater Los Angeles, CA",70,299,,4.0,7/27/2016,"The service was not really good but seating did not take too long. Food also was brought out quickly,hot and it was supertasty!! I had the Sweet Tamales appetizer, Crab and cheese dip and Hibatchi steak. Everything was amazing, only thing was we asked for rare and it was well done but not chewy! I don't love chain places but I have to say in really enjoyed my meal here, more so than the one in woodland hills. Just a heads up that the Parking at this location is kind of a pain . Valet is the closest .Outdoor seating was really nice!"
Lucky S.,"Los Angeles, CA",44,1154,3364,4.0,11/22/2015,"I am a huge fan....always have been.  I love their Chinese chicken salad, but I substitute the chicken for salmon. We also had the crab cheese wantons which were delicious. We had great service at this particular location and would go back.  Consider eating early otherwise expect to wait."
Yarin C.,"Los Angeles, CA",307,4,,5.0,6/22/2016,Love this place! Everything on the menu is A1! There isn't one thing you get there and don't enjoy! One of my favorite sit down restaurant.
Linda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",71,3,,1.0,6/4/2016,"The wait wasn't bad about 20 minutes, our server was great, and atmosphere was good but honestly the food quality is straight up disappointing. The raspberry lemonade was way too sweet, fried calamari tasted overly salty and the steak tacos were chewy. With the bill totaling $85 for two adults and a toddler, we could have had great sushi or new american food in the valley that would cost similar. I wouldn't go back anytime soon."
Erika E.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,14,5,2.0,8/20/2016,"The only reason I'm giving 2 starts instead of zero is because our waitress was sweet. The food, however, disgusting.  My friends pasta was undercooked and cold as ice. Our lettuce wraps were a joke, soggy, with 1 little cube of chicken on each. Flavorless, and 2 hairs on my food. Gross"
Melanie F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/4/2016,"If you are planning on take out, MAKE SURE you double and triple check your order! 9 times out of 10, my order is wrong! This place is a joke! You would think that with a menu on the higher end of the price scale they would have better service. Time to find a new lunch location."
