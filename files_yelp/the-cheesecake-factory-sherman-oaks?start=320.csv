Ashley M.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,6,1,4.0,9/3/2015,"The food is great, the atmosphere depends on the time of day, host/hostesses and waiters/waitresses are friendly (yes, you come across the occasional person that has a bad day). My overall experience is satisfactory. Oh, yeah parking is validated and easy. I have Eaten at this restaurant numerous w/ family, friends, and once alone, the  issue with this location  is seating it always appears to be overcrowded (understandable however frustrating). The entryway needs more attention because people gather there a lot(it's a small space). Some advice would be to try and call ahead if you have a large party with you other then that never go when you are super hungry because it will feel like forever to be seated and order."
Sheena D.,"Mission Hills, CA",581,173,299,5.0,6/30/2015,"Awesome service, Awesome Food, Awesome sauce.  Patty on classic burger is huge and delicious. Definitely get the shrimp tempura appetizers which isn't really a tempura but damn are they good.  The wait staff here are attentive. We were quickly seated, orders taken, and as we finished plates, someone would swing by to pick them up."
Gail S.,"Northridge, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/20/2017,Doesn't anyone know how to manage a restaurant. We went for dinner on a week night and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. While waiting I noticed at least 5 tables empty. When I mentioned it to one hostess she gave me a dirty look and a snippy answer. A little bit later I asked another hostess why there were empty tables while so many people were waiting. She made up some stupid excuse about needing to push tables together for large parties. Funny since 3 of the tables were against the window and couldn't be moved. Both these hostesses had no people skills and should not be doing this job.
Candice C.,"Torrance, CA",20,2,4,1.0,7/11/2015,Dirty silverware and filthy menu.the table is dirty too... Hope I don't get sick.dang how long do they want my review to be?
Jordan U.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,1,,1.0,11/26/2016,"#UNSATISFIED. i would leave 0 stars if i was allowed to. the manager, Elizabeth, is disgustingly unprofessional. she started a fight with me, a customer, who was paying $15 for a gross plate of cold, gooey, alfredo pasta. i am disgusted to have celebrated my 12th birthday at this grotesque, dishonorable establishment. i'm over it."
Richard C.,"Oakland, CA",0,7,2,4.0,3/7/2017,Visited this location while on business. Ordered the chicken Alfredo pasta   Food and service was good. Have had Cheesecake Factory at other places and have not been disappointed
Maricela S.,"San Fernando, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/20/2016,"I had a horrible experience at this Cheesecake Factory. I went to the Cheesecake Factory with my family on a Saturday night. Our buzzard went off and we handed it to the hostess.  We waited for our name to be called and it never was. I approached the hostess and she admitted it was their mistake however they continued to seat other parties before sitting us. I approached her again and this time instead of apologizing, she rolled her eyes at me. I was then seated and noticed dirty utensils on the table. I returned them to the girl who was seating us and she too gave me a dirty look. Do they expect their customers to eat with dirty utensils?"
Mj O.,"Canyon Country, CA",11,75,76,2.0,4/15/2016,"My friend brought me here on April 13 at lunchtime for my birthday. As we walked in we were greeted by the hostess. We asked for a table for two which my friend reserved. They sat us in less than 10 minutes.  They gave us a table that was very small. My friend noticed that there was a bench that was available. We went back to the front to ask if we can take that table. They denied our request stating that the table was for four people.  We asked for a table outside that was bigger but still they denied our request.  We had no choice but to sit down on the small table that was assigned to us. The waitress took our drink order. She did not come back for a while. While we were waiting, we noticed that two people were sat on the bench that we requested for. We were wondering why they sat two people there when we were requesting for that in the first place. That is so unfair. Then, our waiter went to their table and took their drink orders and their food orders before us. They were served before us too. My friend called the waitress to ask if we can start ordering that is the only time she took our orders. We weren't done ordering when she walked away and went to another table. At this time my friend and I were already upset. I love cheesecake factory. But after this incident I do not want to go back to this restaurant at all. We felt discriminated."
Yanni P.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,15,,2.0,1/19/2016,"Meh That about sums up my experience. Ordered a Margarita, only tasted Tequila and premade margarita mix, had one sip, then pushed it away, server never asked if it was good. Fried mac and cheese was tasteful, spicy jumbo chicken wasn't spicy in the least but flavourful, server came back the usual 2 times, is everything ok blah blah, very production line, no sense of personality or honest care. left a spoon on the floor right outside the table, very very visable, not one of the 4 servers, 2 bussers, 2 hosts or managers that walked past the table noticed.  won't be going back"
Raffi I.,"West Hills, CA",206,245,658,1.0,6/7/2015,Poor service at this location this was my second visit both times had horrible experiences with the waitress. On the way out I decided to buy a cheesecake and ask for raspberry sauce for an extra $1 not a problem. got home to find that the raspberry sauce was less than 1/2 a ramekin.... Wow I never realized that raspberry sauce was like gold. I will never go back to this location again.
Carrie M.,"Encino, CA",2,20,16,5.0,6/1/2016,"Best place for a quick lunch or happy hour is the bar area here! Fast service from our wonderful bartender, Brian. He was knowledgable, polite and funny. He and other staff were very busy, but the food came out quick and hot. Highly recommend!"
A C.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,27,4,4.0,1/2/2016,"I am a fan; however, I've recently started feeling like the cake and cheesecake portions have gotten considerably smaller.  Anyone else?"
Rosanne D.,"Camarillo, CA",0,10,,1.0,2/12/2017,"Awful experience.  Waited 45 minutes for a cheeseburger and bowl of chicken artichoke soup. The   food arrived and I began with soup. The chicken was chewy and the soup had a weird smell and luke warm.  I told the waiter  there were mushrooms and other things in my soup and asked if this was actually the soup I ordered. He asked another server and he said we have clam chowder tonight. Ok gross! My stomach is destroyed from the small amount of clam chowder I ate, thank God I was not allergic and went into anaphalacic shock. Just a horrible stomach ache now.  The burger was ok. The whole waste of time disgusting wrong meal should of been complimentary but that didn't happen. Totally disappointed will not return!!! The waiter didn't deserve a tip but I gave him one anyway. The pain in my stomach is making me regret ever leaving a tip at all!"
Arash A.,"Los Angeles, CA",155,31,97,5.0,7/2/2014,"As usual , perfect.  Come on man. It's cheese cake factory.  We ordered spicy chicken chipotle pasta and four cheese with chicken pasta. Both were fresh , tasty and of course delicious . The price was reasonable too."
Aaron H.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,15,1,5.0,7/30/2016,I love this Cheesecake Factory. Brian the bartender is one of the reasons I love this particular location. He is the best. The guy always has a smile on his face and treats everyone like he's excited they came. If you get a chance to come to this location make your way to the bar and get a drink from him you won't regret it. The parmesan chicken here is amazing too.
Ryan R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,9,,5.0,8/13/2016,I just can't explain how fresh and how good the service is to their costumes are. The Cheesecake Factory is one of the most breath taking Restaurant in the world. It has so many options of what you can eat. I just can't think of a better place to eat. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Armando P.,"Los Angeles, CA",110,189,428,4.0,6/17/2014,"I tried this place for the first time just the other day and had a pretty good experience. My wife and brother both had the Mac and Cheese burger - they loved it! I had the Chinese Chicken Salad, it was pretty dam good and really big.  The service was great and the waiter checked in several times making sure we had enough water. The food was tasty and the service was great, I definitely felt I got my moneys worth.  The only thing I did not like was the parking set up. Since they share a parking garage  with several other business's it is kind of a hassle to find a good parking spot. Their food and service however makes up for it."
Carissa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,14,,4.0,2/16/2017,First time coming to the Cheesecake Factory yesterday afternoon. We sat in the patio area it was a very beautiful and sunny day to sit there. I have got to say the food was amazing we ordered the crab and artichoke dip and a Greek salad. We also ordered the fish and chips plate and the steak Diane plate. The steak plate was amazing had so much flavor and tender no need for a1 sauce. And the fish and chips plate the fish was battered so good and had a pleasant fried taste to it. The only bad part was the service our waitress did our order wrong and forgot some of our requests. We also waited awhile before even being asked for drinks and it took a long time to bring them out and we didn't get the water and tea requested until our food came out and had to request it again. But other than the service being bad everything else was great
Helen N.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,8,,5.0,8/18/2016,Was there for the first time today's eve! So crowdy but even with a waiting line of 10 people they were able to give us 4 a seat within 5 minutes! Salad and desert was amazing! Go there!
Ritzi I.,"Studio City, CA",205,129,424,2.0,5/14/2014,"I had dinner here last night. Although I love coming to this place, last night seemed a little off. When we came in to get seated, there were 2 girls at the receiving area, 1 of them was nice she had a smile on her face when she greeted us. 1 of them had no smile and was a little bitchy, she asked me what my name was and told me to wait to the side until my name gets called so i can be seated with her little smirk and attitude. Then another girl came and called my name and she looked like she was not happy to be working there either. My waiter was very pleasant, very nice.  He took care of us. Now, the food. The food is always great, but last night, for some reason, it took FOREVER. They weren't even that busy."
