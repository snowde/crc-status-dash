Emily P.,"Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,4.0,2/13/2017,Love their food! The miso salmon is the best they have great customer service all the staff are really friendly and always making sure we have everything we asked for. You almost every time have to wait in line that's why I gave them 4 stars other then that I love this place
Curtis T.,"North Hollywood, CA",2,21,2,3.0,7/28/2016,"This is the third time this happened. My food has been at the table while I am still waiting on the food for the rest of my party. So far, I have waited twelve minutes. I'm also still waiting for the soy sauce I asked for to go with dinner. I'm going to have a cold dinner. (The rest of my party's food arrived seventeen minutes after mine). I completely understand that mistakes happen. However, this was the third time this has happened to us in this location. That's a training issue, not a mistake.  Having said that, the food is consistent, once it gets to you. It's not food I rave about, but it's solid, good food. I would have probably gave them a five-star review if it had not been for the service."
Jordan S.,"Valencia, CA",140,155,3,3.0,5/24/2015,"Okay. I have to say, that this place is probably one of the most over-hyped places in all of Southern California.  I have to start with the wait. Everyone waits over 20 minutes for a table whether you have a reservation not. I mean if you're someone who constantly eats out like me, you learn to just accept that some places will have waiting period no matter what.  The thing is, you wait on average 20+ minutes, and the food isn't that great. It's not bad, but it's definitely not something to die for either. Basically, the food doesn't justify the waiting period you have. You wait 20+ minutes for your buzzer to go off, and then you wait another 15 minutes inside for a table to clear. It's quite ridiculous at times. However, the service has always been incredible no matter how busy it is, and the decor is pretty.  The valet is nice, but I do trust my personal parking more than handing the keys to one of the random guys. I have seen some crazy shit over the past many years I have been returning to the Sherman Oaks Galleria. Plus, ou save almost $30 bucks on valet and the self-park is almost always empty from the 2nd floor up. A great parking spot is always certain to awaiting. It's a definite must-try, and I will be occasionally returning. P.S. I do suggest sitting outside. People watching is fantastic for those who do so, and the heaters make the atmosphere the warm-chilly weather that leaves the air nice and crisp. It's less noisy, and less 'traffic'. Plus, the waiting period is typically cut in half."
Joanna S.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",50,182,90,5.0,10/9/2015,Had the shrimp scampi for dinner it was really good and it wasn't even busy on a Friday night!
Emily P.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,86,112,5.0,10/8/2015,"I like coming to The Cheesecake Factory. They have a large menu with many items. I often have trouble figuring out what to order.  I have tried many dishes varying from their steaks, salads, soups, pastas and their yummy desserts. I also like eating the fresh bread they bring out while you wait for your food. If you're looking for a nice ambiance to dine in with good food, Cheesecake Factory is always a safe bet."
Lorie T.,"Santa Clarita, CA",21,31,205,4.0,7/25/2015,"The best place to eat prior to seeing a movie at the ArcLight Sherman Oaks. Great menu with lot's of choices, but for me is a bit overwhelming! Still love the quality and taste of most all dishes. Always too stuffed to order cheesecake, but they reign supreme!"
Daniel S.,"Los Angeles, CA",136,74,43,1.0,4/23/2016,"The service is the slowest  I've experienced. Waiter kept forgetting simple things like getting us our sparkling water. The bartender doesn't know any speciality cocktails besides generic cocktails. The food was not great. Overall, not a great experience. Cheese cake factory turned into a rushed BJs Brewhouse. Also, accidentally called to ask about my forgotten debit card. Two different hostesses told me to wait to have no response. I clicked and then called bank to block card."
Jasmine S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,1,4.0,8/20/2016,I've been eating here for years. Sometimes I order and park on the curb and go right in to get my food. Staff is always nice. Especially Cristina. She's always pleasant and goes above and beyond. I want to give them 5 stars but sometimes my phone orders turn our wrong.
Linette P.,"Los Angeles, CA",387,603,2111,1.0,7/2/2014,"Came here to celebrate a friends birthday. Unfortunately it did not end up being a happy one. As soon as we walked in we were seated promptly. I was really happy about that considering it was packed. Why wouldn't this place be packed the food is delish! So I thought- Our waitress noticed the balloons that we had walked in with. Instead of saying happy birthday she asked if we could just move it out of the way. She seemed like she was annoyed or maybe having a bad day, who knows. I tried to not let her attitude bother me.  We ordered a chocolate milkshake for the birthday gal. Also who could go wrong with the southwestern eggrolls, chicken pasta and the buffalo blasts. We got out food all at  separate times. After having had worked ok the restaurant service, you learn to bring out everyone's food together unless otherwise specified. My chicken pasta was the last to be brought out. One night and it tasted extremely overcooked! I tried to eat it but I couldn't and I let the waitress know about the problem. She seemed extremely annoyed and just picked up the plate and walked off. I didn't know if she was going to replace it or what. I was angry at this point but I didn't want to make a scene. After some time had passed, another waiter brought my plate. Since they took so long and the birthday gal was done I decided to just ask for a box. I didn't pay $13.00 to take it home. Our waitress didn't come around to ask if we wanted to order dessert. We asked for the check and had dessert over at Crave. Thanks for the bad service and for taking so long that I had to take my food to go and pay extra because we were over our time limit at the parking lot."
Keisha H.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,258,170,4.0,8/11/2015,"Everyone knows I love the CCF, it's my McDonald's. Anyway we hit up the Sherman Oaks Galleria to work out, relax and eat. It just so happened to be happy hour once we arrived to dine.  We easily received a bar table it was Monday about 5pm. Server was eye candy and really nice. We ordered 2 salads, 3 appetizers, 2 beers and 2 club sodas. The bill was only $40 and of course everything was delicious because it was CCF. $5.50 appetizers and kept at regular hour portions which are huge. May I suggest the nachos and buffalo blast!!!! $4 draft beers, Blue Moon, Sam Adams and a few others (16 ounce) worth it! Of course I'll be back.  It's right next to the Burke Williams I like! ! That review is coming next hahahaha ."
Michelle H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/29/2017,"I would never go back. The managers Elizabeth and JP were so unprofessional and rude to us. After waiting for two hours to be seated when we were supposed to be seated in one hour and 15 minutes, they refused to provide service to us because we questioned the long wait. We were embarrassed and ashamed and she destroyed our Saturday night . We left at 10 at night after two hours standing. Elizabeth should never work again at the establishment. Please contact me for details. Please review the video. Saturday night 8-10 pm January 28th at sherman oaks location. This is unacceptable"
Rich G.,"Kernville, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/11/2016,"The food was excellent as always, unfortunately I erred by not closely reviewing my receipt. Never again! Our party of 7 (celebrating a birthday) was listed as a party of 8 and an extra meal was placed on our tab. Didn't realize until we got home.  This type of waitress error creates an atmosphere of mistrust that will make my future Galleria dinning choices more selective and obviously, I will be keeping a safe distance from the Cheesecake Factory.  0447 Table 705 Sadigatou D SvrCk: 4"
Lauren L.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,5,1,5.0,1/8/2016,I have been to other Cheesecake Factory locations before and have had very mediocre service. But this location in the Sherman oaks galleria was a different story and it was all because of the very nice server Alex D. He really made our experience worth while. He tended to our every need and even made sure our cups were never empty. He is the epitome of great customer service!
Barbie B.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",96,26,8,1.0,5/26/2015,"Let me just say first they have always had the best cheese cake ever!  BUT... The service has gone way down hill. We had to ask for bread. The drinks took too long to come out. There were 4 of us and ALL four dishes came out at different times. The dishes were not correct. That didn't help start off the dining experience. I ordered the Chicken and Biscuts, not sure what happened to that delicious dish. But it was all sorts of wrong. The biscuts were corn muffins, the gravy, well that was just not gravy. It used to be a really yummy dish. Not so anymore. Completely missed it.  What happened to you guys???"
Ramonda W.,"Los Angeles, CA",55,84,204,1.0,4/28/2015,"I stopped coming here along time ago for a reason. Poor customer service and crappy food. Ordered the fire roasted Artichokes and they tasted dry and old..... my waitress cant get it togather and the whole visit is just off.    Ordered a Lemon drop and was hoping to get another one but the waitress never came back to the table to ask if I wanted another cocktail. Showed the aritchokes to the Manager who agreed that they were old (he took them off the bill which I appreciate). Asked for my bill which was $33.00, however my waitress rang up another tables order on my card and charged me $65.00 (I think she was on Meth).... just the worst dining experience ever. If I could give Zero stars I would.  Last time coming here. Should have followed my first mind and went to Roys!"
Mimi A.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",2,14,,3.0,1/16/2017,I called in a simple order and had to repeat myself 3 times. Then when we get there to pick it up they have it under the wrong name and were missing half the order. So we had to wait for them to prepare the rest of it. I was not happy with their service and having to wait extra when I had already called it in to save time.
Ashelly M.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,8,3,4.0,1/28/2016,The best restaurant. The only problem you need to wait sometimes at the weekend a hour to sit. The food is amazing and coming in big size. The cakes also yummy. It's great to go there for lunch or with family or on a date.
Gloria C.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",18,50,84,3.0,9/23/2014,Usually the service and the food is Great! Last time I went I tried to chnage up my usual witch is the Cubano sandwich and the sald with personal pizza and its delicious! I tried the burrito and it was HORRIBLE! It looks good from outside but honestly it was bad. It was all dry rice and a few pieces of chicken. I barely ate any of it and it made me sick!!! The only time this happened is when I had the salmon and for sure will never get anything different again.
Karie F.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",260,600,450,3.0,5/17/2015,"Went with the fam for a belated Mothers Day Brunch. None of us had been to Cheescake Factory in years so we were excited to go. Katelyn was our server, very friendly and attentive. The food was not so good. Nothing wow'd us and for the price, we all agreed that we won't be back. Let me get down to the nitty gritty of my review. The only good food item we ordered was the spinach & cheese dip appetizer, this was delish!. And thank God for THAT because it took our food over 30 minutes to come out. My Omelette and potatoes were very sub par, I picked out the veggies and cheese and left the rest. I could have got the same or better at Denny's. Matter of fact, IHOP is better and portions are the same size!. No seasoning whatsoever! I felt like I was at the Seniors Buffet. Potatoes, bland and over cooked. My niece ordered french toast. The server that brought it to her, just handed it to her and didn't warn her, it was scalding hot! It burned her hands! She had to hold onto her glass of cold of iced tea to get the burning to stop. They have a weird system here. Your waitress takes the orders and checks in on you and a whole team (like 4 to 5 others, come out and deliver food) I've never seen such a display....it was literally a piece of sourdough bread loaf, sliced off, fried up and served. She said it tasted just like it looked, like a hunk of bread. Who makes french toast out of sourdough??? So basically, very bland, sub par, EXPENSIVE food. I can safely say that none of us will be back anytime soon and I will not recommend. Maybe just stick to what they are famous for, the cheesecakes and appetizers."
April Y.,"Buena Park, CA",260,525,245,4.0,5/14/2014,Portions are huge!  I was able to split the Luau salad. We requested to have the salad split into two plates. This portion was perfect for me and my friend.  Cheesecakes are an absolute must... the smores cheesecake and the vanilla bean cheesecake are highly recommended!  Don't forget to get your parking validated!
