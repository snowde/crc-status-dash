Adeline T.,"North Hills, CA",160,27,18,1.0,6/25/2015,"I don't normally complain about customer service....but this review mainly goes out to the HORRENDOUS service I received!!! First we were seated in a timely fashion...plus for that...but as soon as our server came..he took all the experience out of dining here.  A. He took our orders and didn't offer us bread. Hmmmm maybe he's new? B. He set our waters down and every server knows...serve the furthest person first...what did this guy do? Serve the closest person so that when he reached over the table to put the rest of the waters down, HIS TIE WENT INTO MY CUP. Yes he knew, because he straightened his tie right after...and didn't offer to replace my water...oh and still didn't offer bread. But eh i ordered a sangria so I figured I could just drink that.... C. We place our orders. I asked for a strawberry shortcake ""for here"" and a few other cheesecakes to-go for after the meal. When dessert comes he brings me a strawberry cheesecake that I originally wanted to go, not the strawberry shortcake, so that gets sent back. THEN I was able to finally ask for some bread.  D. We pay for the meal. Get the cheesecakes to go. And he didn't offer validation...again we had to flag him down and ask for it.  E. The strawberry cheesecake we took home was MELTED. I paid $8 for a blob of crap!!! Totally unacceptable!! We had a few drinks and appetizers with the desserts so we were at the restaurant for at least an hour. That strawberry cheesecake never had a chance!!!  Absolutely disappointed. I wish I could give a negative tip bc this guy just plain SUCKED like this worthless strawberry cheesecake!!!"
Irina B.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,36,55,2.0,6/26/2015,"I used to enjoy Cheesecake Factory so much! The food was always tasty and fresh, we all know the giant portions, I have complemented waiters there many times for being wonderful and very accommodating.... Well, lately I have had 2 very below average experiences... Last one was today at lunch. 3 of us went to celebrate a coworker birthday. My Caesar salad had almost no dressing and when I asked for some extra it took 15 min to bring that by and I could see that waitress was lost and went from table to table asking if the dressing was ordered... The same was happening when my coworker asked for an extra plate so that she can share her salad.... Overall experience was not good, food was just ok... I guess it is time to move on...."
Carmen G.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",476,17,256,5.0,2/7/2014,"Thumbs up for the SkinnyLicious menu! The peeps at Chesscake Factory are most definitely looking out for the health freaks! So nice to be able to enjoy a meal somewhere where the menu accommodates everyone's taste buds. I LOVE the Tuscan Chicken plate. A generous amount of grilled chicken breast with tomato, mushroom, asparagus with a light vinaigrette and farro. So amazingly delicious!  The SkinnyLicious menu has everything from chicken, seafood, pasta, salads, flat bread, appetizers even alcoholic beverages! Cant wait to try the low carb chesscake! Staff is always friendly and attentive. FITNESS FANATIC APPROVED!"
Mayra M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,6,1.0,3/5/2016,What a horrible service they have here. They first called you and then they tell you that it was a test. I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS LOCATIONS. They are RACIST with latinos here and just because you're not white they will try to put you a horrible location and they will ignore you too. PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE. HORRIBLE SERVICE.  *This place is RACIST as hell!!  specially Ben the greeter is very RUDE.
Rachel C.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",95,171,4,5.0,7/26/2015,"I don't get it. Why does this place only have 3.5 stars? I've never had a bad experience here with the service or food and I've been here so very many times(good place for a date).  Love love love the herb crusted salmon, steak and shrimp combo was my recent discovery and now it's my new fav. The only thing I've had that's not so good is the jambalaya. Love all the cheesecake but my go to dessert choice is their warm pie and ice cream(forgot the name). It's huge and superbly satisfying for my sweet tooth"
Victor G.,"NORTHRIDGE, CA",0,6,5,5.0,5/26/2014,My Girlfriend loves this place! Good and friendly customer service!  We always start with the guacamole and avocado egg rolls!! Margarita is a must!!! Specially the strawberry one. Try it! many plates to choose from and is not expensive at all! Good quality of food. Expect delays while waiting for food if restaurant is busy :) good customer service.
Leyla J.,"Los Angeles, CA",110,21,28,1.0,1/26/2015,The service is awful. We came at a party of 12 and waited more then 30 mins. The manager said that our table will be ready in 5 minutes. Instead we waited for a whole hour. After all we got a broken table. The waitress didn't like the fact that we noticed that the table was broken. And she didn't even want to serve us. If I could I wouldn't even rate it one star. P.S. We were there with kids.  I have never recommend this place to anyone!!!!!
James B.,"Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, CA",1109,1101,1387,4.0,11/19/2012,"It's located in the Sherman Oaks Galleria next to Urban Home and one floor below the Arclight Theaters. I tend to stay away from big restaurant chains, but Cheesecake Factory is pretty solid and consistent.  Drinks: 4 Stars**** The Mojito here is pretty good! Its sweetness wasn't overwhelming, but it was enough to give it flavor as well as a good buzz. Food: 4 Stars**** Consistent good food. I always like the avocado egg rolls and the ahi tuna tartare. As you probably already heard, the portions here very generous. Service: 3 Stars*** Needed a little improvement. The server admitted that it wasn't his finest moment and apologized.  Parking: 2 hours free with validation. The parking structure is pretty far from the restaurant. You'll need to go on a journey to reach your destination. You can also valet if you don't feel like walking."
Susana K.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,3,,1.0,1/26/2015,"I can't understand what happened to this restaurant. I have never thought that I could disappoint with their service. When we came there the restaurant was almost empty. And manager asked to wait us 5 minutes but after 30 minutes he needed 5 minutes more. Overall we waited for the table 1 hour. We wanted to fit 12 people at the table for 10 people. After 10 minutes more they brought a broken table. We asked waitress to change it. And she was disappeared for the next 15 minutes.  Unfortunately our kids were so hungry, that we had to leave .  P.S. The manager ignored us in purpose while we leaving the restaurant.  I would recommend to go to another Cheesecake Factory instead of this one."
Jacqueline R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2491,927,2572,4.0,1/8/2014,"2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 21/100 Dined here twice so far. Once was just a few nights ago. I met a group of my friends here on a Monday evening. I always assume the Cheesecake Factory to be packed, but surprisingly it wasn't busy at all! Lots of empty tables and we were one of the only taken tables outside on the patio. It was a little chilly outside, but they had the heaters on which made it actually pretty toasty! It was really nice :) Our waitress was kind and polite even when I joined the table (I came late and my friends all had their entrees by the time I arrived), AND when another one of my friends showed up late. I didn't want anything other than a strawberry lemonade and she brought it out to me quickly! She also validated my parking which was awesome! My friends said all of their dishes were very good and had no complaints about them. Overall I'd give this Cheesecake Factory 4 stars for great service and not being super busy or dreadful during a weekday evening! TIP: Parking is free for two hours with validation from the restaurant :)"
Dona E.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,5,,1.0,2/7/2016,If you have Celiac don't go here. They say they have gluten free buns and you can order any hamburger gluten free. I did and it tasted wonderful. They just don't understand cross contamination and I was very sick. Just not worth eating here and being so sick after.
M S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",11,9,3,5.0,7/6/2016,"I have been here a lot of times for the past 15 years ,different locations and the food is really good, I love their shrimp scampi always great. I eat outside a lot and this is the only place you can order anything out of the menu and at the least it will be good. Great place to come on any occasion. Will be back for sure!"
Angela B.,"Los Angeles, CA",177,40,28,5.0,7/17/2015,"Holy portion control, this place gives you so much food. Their menu can't really be beat, it's so extensive that there is always something for everyone. Always make sure to either same room, or get a piece of dessert to go. The key lime cheesecake is my all time favorite."
Barbara A.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,7,1,4.0,2/27/2015,"I just had a great meal at the Cheesecake Factory in Sherman Oaks.  The restaurant was very crowded, as usual, so we ended up eating at the bar.  The service was GREAT!  The restaurant inside is quite loud, but sitting at the bar you could actually have a conversation without yelling. The rib eye steak was perfectly done and the Caesar salad is the best. Portions are plentiful and all the bread you can eat."
Jose C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,3,1.0,11/29/2016,"What a horrible experience!!! We sent out food back twice and not once did a manager come to our table to ask what was going on. We order Chicken chipotle pasta and avocado toast, the waitress returned with AVOCADO ROLLS and the Chicken chipotle pasta that was not properly drained so the sauce was watery and bland. After she took back the orders including the avocado rolls that we did not order she came back with the avocado toast burned to a crisp i mean black and rock solid. I called her back and told her we cant eat this it is burned please bring us our check. At this point i 100% thought a manager would come to the table not to apologize or anything bc its not his/her fault but atleast to see whats happening why we are sending our food back but no the waitress just comes back with the receipt no apologies no manager. They did wave off the charges for the food but were still petty enough to charge us $7 for 2 cokes. Now that i think of it i would think the manager would have to approve any adjustments to the bill so they were aware of what was going on and did not bother. Would never go there again, ended up going right down the street to PF Changs where we were given exceptional service and food."
Karen Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",393,46,60,5.0,4/18/2016,Obsessed with this place their avocado egg rolls are the best ever! Last night I had the medallions with mash potatoes hmmmm on the skinny menu. My two favorite dishes ! Best place for any occasion
Adelina K.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,76,1,2.0,3/29/2015,"I got a weird compliment from someone on yelp asking why I still continue to go even when I gave this place 2 stars. I actually haven't been going back. They also have raised their soup price and made the cup size smaller. I would be crazy to waste $8 on a few tablespoons of soup. Again, only reason anyone at our office goes back is because Tina is so nice."
Tarie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,1,5.0,5/27/2016,The server was knowledgeable of the very big menu & offered a great red wine selection. The jambalaya pasta was amazing & the entire experience was pleasant.
Lusine M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,19,7,1.0,7/10/2016,"This one star is for the staff that served us today. The food at Cheesecake factory is always great, however today I was extremely disappointed by the service. I couldn't believe how unwelcoming and rude they were not only to us, but also to the other customers sitting at the table next to us. It was funny and disgusting at the same time to observe one of the waitress's expression of the face when the customer complained that they brought the wrong food for him. They kept us waiting for probably an hour and no one even came to apologize for the long wait even though it wasn't that busy there. I have been to Cheesecake factory in Glendale and have always left that place with a great feeling of satisfaction not only with the food but the welcoming nice atmosphere you feel there thanks to the staff that create that vibe by their genuine desire to provide great service and create a nice long lasting experience. It wasn't the case with the Cheesecake factory at Sherman Oaks location. Very unprofessional, ridiculously rude and unpleasant in their manners and attitude to the customers, as though the customers owe them something. No wonder there are so many one star reviews about the service in particular.  I couldn't wait to leave this place as soon as possible and I will never ever go back to that particular Sherman Oaks location again no matter how delicious the food was."
Mia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,352,317,4.0,3/11/2014,"We came here because Sweet Butter was too crowded. I like that they have a light ""SkinnyLicious"" menu now with plenty of choices. Curiously the original menu doesn't list caloric content.  If it's your first time, be prepared to sift through all the menu chapters, as they serve American fare to Americanized versions of international cuisine. I'd say the best food are the appetizers. The Thai lettuce wraps are really good (3 delicious sauces) and fill me up even though they're an appetizer. Tuna tartare - delicious. good size for 3 Sausage ricotta flat bread (off the light menu) with few kinds of cheeses. Good but a little salty.  My friend's veggie salad - big but forgettable. Too much vinegar in the dressing. The fish taco entree was a huge, delicious serving. 4 tacos, big pieces of salmon (I think she requested salmon). However the white cilantro-seasoned rice was oily.   Of course it's hard to pass up on cheesecake here. We devoured my personal favorite, white chocolate raspberry. Others sound tempting. I want to try the pumpkin pecan next fall (Must pumpkin be seasonal everywhere? :/ )  The banana slice is light, almost mousse-like. For me the blueberry white chocolate is disappointing. Service usually is good but today was terrible. Among other things, we had to ask for bread.  At least they compensated with 3 loaves. Isn't the warm brown bread the best?  Parking is free for the first 2 hours free and this location is convenient, right where the 405 and 101 intersect.  It's mainly restaurants here and feels like a ghost town before noon on weekends. I just wish they serve brunch all day Saturday as well as Sunday because I was really craving pancakes."
