Sara O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,2,1.0,11/20/2016,"I came here last week to eat with my husband and the service was good over all. Our waitress was nice and attentive. The problem was getting a cake. After eating we decided to order some cake. We went to the bakery section and asked for a slice of cheese cake. We waited 26 minutes to get ONE slice of cake. We payed for it and waited so long for one slice of cake. I came back today to purchase a whole cake. A tiramisu Cheesecake for my brothers birthday. I ordered over the phone an hour in advanced to make sure I would just have to pay and pick up the cake. I was wrong. I payed and waited about half an hour just so they could give me the cake. They take so long to get your orders out. I would not recommend at all ever to order from here. They take so long to give you something you ordered for that is so simple. While I was waiting I saw that they prioritized their waiters and waitresses to give them their orders to give to dine in customers way faster, while they have a huge line of customers waiting for their food or cakes that they have already Paid for. So unorganized and the managers just stand there seeing the problem and just say five more minutes. No you end up waiting way longer then that. Do not order from here for take out unless you have all day to wait."
james m.,"Playa Vista, CA",4,33,14,2.0,7/31/2015,"Just got out of there and I just couldn't let it slide, but horrible service. The food was good but how the meal took over 2 hours was just ridiculous. We had to constantly ask over and over for refills of water, bread, etc. Don't know what was going on and maybe it wasn't all the server's fault. If mgmt actually cares, here's a pic of the receipt to prove I'm not just some hater with a fake review."
Glor L.,"Los Angeles, CA",116,49,99,3.0,6/15/2015,The food is what everyone knows. Same old same old. But it is about the host who did not ask us where we would like to seat (inside or outside) when she asked to all other people. And she sat us to the very corner of the restaurant...well at least our server was nice and food is good I still give 2 more stars. Otherwise it would have been just 1. :(
Darla R.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",1250,68,42,5.0,1/24/2016,Came for my boyfriends birthday dinner. Food was great and the service was even better :)
Dulce D.,"NORTHRIDGE, CA",198,96,72,5.0,1/2/2016,Food is just toooooo good here. Can never go wrong. All I have to say is save your appetite meals are big. I only come to this restaurant once a year on my uncle B-DAY.  Be prepared to wait in the lobby for 40mins+ during Busy hours.
Nina D.,"Topanga, CA",0,16,2,1.0,12/13/2015,"Probably the rudest bar staff and experience I have ever had. Bartenders talk openly about how bad their customers are, pour weak drinks and make strange comments to their customers. When did Cheesecake Factory start hiring McDonalds quality employees? Classless and we won't go to this location again."
Julien G.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",3,58,16,2.0,7/23/2015,"I was really disappointed about the service/food at the Cheesecake Factory. First of all you cannot reserve a table by phone. This is just stupid! You need to wait 40 minutes on a Friday night to get a table.  The service was terrible, they sent me twice the wrong pastas. The manager came to apologize and we got 50% off. I don't think i will ever come back there. Sorry...."
Ariana A.,"Venice, Los Angeles, CA",0,16,18,2.0,1/18/2015,"Had dinner here last night with my boyfriend. Our server was okay. She checked on us twice during our whole visit. But never asked my boyfriend for refills on his iced tea, I get it was busy but she also walked by a couple times without acknowledging us. Maybe because he wasn't drinking any alcohol since he had to drive, she felt like she didn't need to.  Food was great as usual, everything came out perfect. Nothing wrong there. Decided to use the restroom before I left, and let me tell you, do not, and I repeat DO NOT use the women's restroom at this Cheesecake Factory. It is DISGUSTING! There were random stains on the toilet seats, tampon wrappers everywhere, toilet paper everywhere, some of it was wet too, paper towels were overflowing from the trash can. And the handicap bathroom was horrific. I didn't even use the restroom there anymore, that's how disgusting it was.  I let the manager at the host stand know about her little problem, she was a blond lady, really rude as well. All she said was ""thanks for letting me know"" and didn't even said anyone to clean it!  DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I probably won't return here, just because of that. I'm a clean freak. I can't handle how nasty that was.  I'll stick to the Cheesecake Factory that I know is clean at all times, and the staff is really friendly at the one I usually go to. Sherman oaks CCF left a bad taste in my mouth."
Viridiana M.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,10,7,4.0,8/15/2015,The avocado rolls are one of the best I've ever tasted in my life. Main dishes are good but nothing out of this world. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly.
Josh S.,"Los Angeles, CA",295,210,187,2.0,1/31/2015,"Certain people truly love The Cheesecake Factory, and I really just don't get it. The decor is gaudy (though I guess it matches a large percentage of the clientele), the menu and servings are bloated, and the food is mediocre at best. Sure the cheesecakes are decent, but when you stuff 1,000+ calories into a single slice of anything, the odds are it will probably satisfy.  Living in Los Angeles - a major city with what is probably one of the most culturally and culinarily diverse, yet grossly underrated (internationally) food scenes - I can't fathom why one would decide to venture here. If you visit one in a smaller city with limited offerings, it makes sense, but not LA. Sure, I've never experienced any bad service, and I guess that bloated menu will cater to any unadventurous eaters looking for a decent meal, but I'd like to think with a simple Yelp search and some pre-planning you can find better."
Taste B.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,56,1,1.0,8/12/2015,On Sunday afternoon. we had *hitty/rude waiter who has an attitude ( name was Oscar T) i believe.  He never checked our table until we asked other waiter for out cold food... our dish was not even warm.. so cold... i assume they let the food seat for a while.... Waiter never greeted at us at all. no smile. seems like he is not happy working at cheese cake  factory... another bad experience with server's manner... not sure if i need to go to Groove Cheese Cake or not... Mostly Cheese Cake Factory at Groove has great service all the time..
Remme C.,"Los Angeles, CA",75,86,49,4.0,3/27/2016,I would like to say THANK YOU KELLY for trying your BEST to be the BEST WAITRESS possible on a busy EASTER SUNDAY TODAY. I saw how hard you're trying to work handling 5 tables at a time and saw you've been having difficulty dealing with 5 tables all at once. You've been really attentive to us and we thank you.
Jessica E.,"Los Angeles, CA",577,156,520,3.0,1/26/2014,"This is a great place for dinner and a movie. You can park in the mall parking structure (relatively cheap), and then grab food here, and walk right next door to the theatre. The experience was a typical Cheesecake Factory experience. Good food and good service.  FOOD = A We ordered the fried zucchini ($4.95) as an appetizer. I absolutely love it!! I always get this when I visit a Cheesecake Factory.  My boyfriend ordered the gumbo ($16.95), which was very good! I ordered the Chicken Di Pana (breaded chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli for $14.95). It was soooo good!! The chicken was perfectly breaded and the mashed potatoes were perfectly garlicy!  I haven't had anything on the menu that I didn't enjoy.  SERVICE = B+ The first time I came here the service was actually pretty bad, but I think my waitress was new, so I give her some slack. The second time I came here for dinner, and it was delicious and the service was perfect. I haven't visited on a weekend night.  PARKING: Parking Structure. Free up to two hours with validation"
Christian And Chanel G.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,52,42,2.0,12/18/2014,"The food was delicious but this location has HORRIBLE customer service! Our waitress was definitely having a bad day and showed it.  She blamed it on being sick, which is kinda nasty seeing that she's serving us food. We barely saw her throughout our entire time there.  When we were done eating we flagged her down for a dessert menu and then didn't see her again for a good 25-30 minutes.  By then we decided that we were just going to get some cheesecake to go.  But then it took another 30 min to get our check and pay our bill.   THEN, we go to the cheesecake to go area and there are at least 5 girls/waitresses there.  Four of them are talking stories and completely ignoring us.  There was one poor girl working behind the counter preparing the cheesecake for dining in orders and after standing there for 15 min, she finally was able to help us.  We felt so bad for her that she had to work so hard while the other 4 girls just stood there gossiping about their boyfriends (apparently one of them is back with their bf AGAIN, gasp).  Then a guy worker even came behind the cheesecake bar place and was like, ""what are you doing ladies, it isn't story time"" and they just ignored him and kept talking.  Finally one of them rang us up and we finally got to go home, cheesecake in tow. One of the worst customer service experiences we've ever had."
Adam C.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,5,,5.0,5/7/2016,"We came here to celebrate my wife's birthday. We were a party of 8. We chose to sit on the patio around 7 pm on a Thursday. They set up our table Immediately and we were seated. We ordered drinks and appetizers, and then out main course. All of the dinners came out except for my wife's. The waiter explained that it has been sent to another table my mistake and he would expedite another order. 2 minutes later the manager came out and explained the same story and said it would be about 10 minutes and he was very sorry, and the entree was on him. After it came out, the manager checked on us again and made sure everything was good. He offered to buy us desert as well. 5 stars for a manager who was asked care of his customers first."
Cassidy L.,"San Diego, CA",7,33,35,5.0,7/18/2016,"The food here is ALWAYS consistently great. The Chinese chicken salad, turkey burger, and the shrimp tacos are my favorite. Our server, Marie, was always checking in with us and knew the whole menu! The manager, Cameron, knows how to run this place. He came around to check in on tables and even offered us an appetizer when my brothers meal took longer than expected. If you want perfect service and a tasty meal, come here!"
Ana A.,"North Hollywood, CA",1014,60,498,4.0,3/5/2014,"Great food. Great atmosphere. Nice Shopping area around. Recommend coming here with groups or just family and friends. Parking is cool first 2hrs free .    Yummy bread and cheesecake. Mmmmmmmm Starbucks riteby and 24hour fitness . Only fkdup up part was we ended up paying $17 for parking, God our meal didnt even cost that much! And we Had validation. Wack"
Benay K.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",1064,414,612,3.0,8/24/2013,"Had lunch here with a friend yesterday. We chose to sit outside, which was a mistake, as it was very hot. I had assumed that they would have had misters on in the heat, but...no.  The service was very good, not intrusive, and gave us plenty of time to choose from the vast menu options.  We both ordered off the ""Skinny"" menu.  Me: Asian chicken salad ($13.95). The lettuce was very wilted, the dressing was way too heavy, and it seemed oddly salty. I would not recommend this. I had three bites, and did not eat the rest My friend had a salad too...but dang it I can't remember what it was, other than it had chicken and beets ($13.95). She seemed to love it, and ate the entire salad. Parking was easy, and they validated the ticket."
Paulyn L.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,34,167,1.0,7/16/2016,"Worst service and location ever.. let me count the ways.. 1) chaos.. I mean I understand it's Saturday but the reception desk doesn't seem to know what to do with the influx of people no order whatsoever, 2) people working here don't seem to care about patrons needs (tonight I had to track down a 'manager' to get a heat lamp turned on. It took half hour and multiple requests to get it done, 3) although this location is busy, Marina del Rey branch is busier but they seem to know how to manage issues... this is the worst Cheesecake Factory ever, we came here for dessert and waited more than an hour and each time we asked for an update, a rude employee just basically told us to wait and that's that.. there was no explanation or reason why people walking in are seated while we've been waiting a while and we get ignored. Again worst location and service ever. MANAGEMENT SUCKS they need to try better.."
Bella S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,81,30,5.0,11/19/2015,I had an excellent experience at this location! I went on a Sunday evening and it was quite packed and we ended up waiting 25-30 min for a table but it was well worth it. Our waiter was Desmond (I believe that was the name). He was an excellent waiter! Refills on time. Everything brought out on time and the food was excellent! Everything was perfect that day! I would recommend this location highly. I guess it's so busy because they're just that good! Thanks for the great dinner!
