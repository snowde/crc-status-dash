D K.,"Burbank, CA",18,10,3,5.0,8/16/2017,"So, I was there the other day for the weekend. We had such a pleasant experience there. We met the host Malakai and the waitress Elizabeth. They were both exceptionally great and friendly. They both went out their way to helped and served us very well. There's no need to more about the food. The food was consistently awesome. We will definitely go back whenever we are in the neighborhood. Great job guys! Keep up with your great work! I wish all the other locations were as good as this location. :)"
DvsOne T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,12,23,5.0,9/2/2017,"Out of all the places to eat on Ventura Blvd I always pick The Cheesecake Factory. Yeah I know you dumb foodies hate chain restaurants but this one in particular rocks you can't go wrong. The waiter I always ask for is Eric because out of a great staff he's the best. There's only two reasons I come to this horrible mall one is the Archlight theatre and a close second is The Cheesecake Factory. If one these two wasn't here I don't know if I'd come back. It's a perfect combo to take my wife (BFF) for brunch, lunch or just a simple date to loosen her up. I love it here"
Ricardo C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,2,4.0,9/20/2017,My orange chicken was amazing & we had a very nice waitress. She was very attentive!  Place was very clean. Only thing I had an issue is that the cheesecake I asked for was not cold. Other than that great time @ this location.
Rana S.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",43,135,720,4.0,9/2/2016,"We had a lovely dinner at this very insanely busy location. My partner checked us in and while the wait was not long before our paging contraption started vibrating, we still waited about an additional 10 minutes inside after returning the device. So their logic is, you go inside, return he device and then they generate a little tag that is put in order for a hostess to then take and seat you. I think it just would make better sense to call you in when the hostess is ready to seat you.  Anyways, once we were seated our waitress took our drink and splitter order relatively quickly. First she brought out their amazingly delicious bread, then brought our our spinach artichoke dip and drinks. So, I am not a huge fan of this dip in general and found this one to be fine. My two monsters and partner loved it, so there you go. We ordered a steak and salmon combo plate, blackened chicken and shrimp and for the monsters chicken Alfredo and grilled veggies. All the food was tasty and as always we only got through 1/3 of our plates. We ended up taking most of it home, which was perfect next day.  It was nice. Nothing too exciting or exceptional. Just an overall good experience. Bon appétit"
John S.,"Los Angeles, CA",116,58,45,4.0,10/5/2017,Haven't been here in awhile. This time I had the Steak Diane w/ their mash. AND... It was really good. Temp was perfect. The mash was ok. Worth trying it if you haven't already.
Victoria O.,"Van Nuys, CA",38,132,164,5.0,8/31/2016,"Two things I really love about The Cheesecake Factory is that they literally have EVERYTHING and their portions are a really good size. We sat down for 10 minutes just looking at the menu to figure out what we wanted. Got a turkey club, Chinese chicken salad, and baked potato (like tater tots but waaayyyy better).  The turkey club can easily be shared with 4 people consider there's 4 big turkey clubs there. It was seriously the best turkey club I've ever had. I still remember the taste. Nothing wrong with Chinese chicken salad, that was also really good.  They should really be careful and pay attention to their forks cause I ended up with a retarded fork. Didn't say anything cause it didn't bother me but, you never know what kind of a customer you might run into.  The customer service was great too! Overall, great place!"
No Name R.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/27/2017,"We were a party of eight and arrived at the restaurant at 5:40 PM on a Tuesday night. I asked how long the wait would be, and they told me 45 minutes and handed me the pager. At 6:20 I asked how much longer, as in my mind we were getting close.  It was what happened next that will make me never step foot in this restaurant again.  After waiting for 40 minutes, the hostess told me it would be about another 45 minutes! I asked how this could be if I was told 45 minutes 40 minutes ago.  They said there was a 1 hour 15 minute time by my name!  Had they told me that to begin with we never would have stayed! I then asked the Manager (Joe?) what he could do.  We were even willing to split up 4 + 4. Inside or outside.  They did not accommodate us at all!  They lied about the wait time, and had the nerve to tell me, the customer that I was wrong, that they would not have told me 45 minutes! Public School 818 got our business that night. Moral of this story.....have them write your wait time in writing for you!"
Ace B.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",20,26,1,1.0,3/17/2017,"Dirty water, dirty cups, dirty silverware, slow service, and bad attitudes. Dont bother."
Vered N.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,56,,1.0,12/22/2017,"Cheesecake factory is our favorite restaurant however this location is getting 1star because of its terrible manager. When I say horrible it's an understatement the MOST UNPROFFESSIONAL EVER. We came in last week with a party of 12, we were quoted 45 minutes, well 1 hour and 45 minutes later we were finally seated, no apologies just terrible attitude from manager.  Now tonight SAME manager. Soon as we walked in to our our name down he with a horrible attitude said excuse me you will need to move and go stand in line ... there was no line for check in only for people who were called to be seated. When he noticed that still no apology, just took our name down. We are quoted 30-40 minutes, as we are waiting about 9 minutes in I see 2 parties that walked in after us seated first. So i question it to the manager and his response  you've only been waiting 9 minutes ( yet I pointed out that they have been waiting for 1 minute and were seated.) he was basically if you don't like it too bad. This guy is either full of himself with his power trip or on something because normal people don't get close to your face like that and act that way. Update add fuel to the fire, they sat us outside 90% of the heaters were not working, and the wind picked up. I asked how long now for an inside table they said we would need to start over, so another 40 min wth! We sat outside, and the manager comes over to say I don't understand why your upset you got a table! Ya in 50 degrees outside no heaters thanks  Update .... here we are 30 minutes after we ordered.... just got my iced tea and no food yet  WORST EXPERIENCE EVER !"
Rae R.,"Agoura Hills, CA",114,111,200,5.0,9/24/2017,Haven't been here in years.  I had the most delicious veggie burger. Didn't need ketchup or mayo or mustard.  Wonderful on its own. Only one of us got cheesecake. Wait till you see the picture. It's a devine Chocolate Cheesecake.  Very calming to sit outside
Jeremy M.,"Van Nuys, CA",88,37,20,2.0,12/25/2017,"I am a frequent patron of many locations of the cheesecake factory throughout the Los Angeles area and I was wondering if there is any possible way to improve the hostess/seating issues at the Sherman Oaks location. The wait times at this locations are outrageous compared to other (more crowded) locations in LA [20+ minutes often times in non-peak hours] and the tables given to me are always the smallest ones in the restaurant. I often speak with the host, the manager, I even attempt to bribe the host for a better seat but they seem very unenthusiastic to help find a table that is not in the busiest, loudest location and smallest table available. Asking for a booth or larger table results in even longer wait times. I never have this issue when visiting locations in Canoga Park or Thousand Oaks - two locations I also visit frequently. I just do not enjoy having the host treat me as if I am bothering them when I arrive and that they are doing me a favor by finding a [terrible] table for me. Anytime I arrive at the location and there is a wait time I just instantly choose another place to eat in the area, as I know I will not have a good experience at that location."
Dakari S.,"Ventura, CA",213,7,3,1.0,10/14/2017,If I could give zero stars I would. I went to the cheesecake factory to give it another chance. Their food has always tasted the same to me and made someone I'm with feel sick after. Today was my turn. I had a Montecristo and I swear that something in that dish was rotten. I only had two bites and I'm currently at home feeling like I have to throw up. Never going back. I know for a fact that the servers will give you bread without washing their hands and touch it and will also put their hands all over the food. Again with dirty hands. Never going back ever again. Completely overrated.
Gohar T.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",9,4,,5.0,12/24/2017,I've been to many locations of Cheesecake Factory and this is by far my favorite. The servers are so kind and the food is delicious. I always get the Linda's fudge cake and my husband gets the recess cheesecake. So yummy!
Art A.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,50,82,4.0,3/21/2017,"Came here on a Tuesday. It was very chill. Not too many people, just perfect. The waitress was very nice and explained the menu. The reason I give it a four star is because we ordered mac and cheese and they didn't have it - not like I ordered sturgeon.  I ordered grilled salmon. Very juicy and very tender. Would come again."
Tina M.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",1,17,4,1.0,9/4/2017,"After waiting to be seated they took the buzzer and asked for us to wait against the wall so our server could take us to the table . I was getting extremely irritated because people who were waiting after us were being seated before us . So, I approached the girl at the front desk and asked her why we were still waiting and she replied with ""do you have your buzzer "" .. I clearly told her at least 3 times that they took it from us and asked us to wait on the side . We finally got to our ""table "" and the floor beneath me was just disgusting . If you're going to make me wait this long , why don't you at least clean up the area where ill be sitting.Corporate really needs to figure their issues here..  Well , the only good thing at this place is our server Freddy !! He's very attentive , knows the menu like the back of his hand and he kept coming back and refilling our drinks . He also passed by a couple of times to ask us how our food was . Thank you Freddy !!"
Livnat V.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",19,2,,1.0,11/14/2017,I'm very disappointed my wife  went so bad to go there today and we drove all the way and it was close !!!!!! For no reason I'm very disappointed
Patrick G.,"Glendale, CA",13,35,4,1.0,12/17/2017,The gap between when our order was taken and when the food arrived to our table was 57 minutes. They brought us wrong food. Our steak plate had only 2 pieces of dry nasty steak.our server did not show up to our table for an hour. Horrible experience
Alexa R.,"Granada Hills, CA",518,96,252,5.0,1/11/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is seriously one of my favorite restaurants. I come here often for special dinners with the family. The food is always top quality and excellent (although pricey...but I mean, it's not surprising). Chicken farfalle, steak Dianne and Thai glazed salmon are some of my favorites! And omg the cheesecake varieties are awesome! I always stick to the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake!  This particular location always has a wait (but cheesecake is my fave so it's worth it to me). Expect to wait at least 30 min. There's not much waiting room space so people just crowd the hostess stand and the waiting benches. They have a parking lot on the other side of the galleria, and cheesecake  factory validates for two hours.  I think it's a hit or miss with the host staff. Some of them can be really nice but other ones can be a bit rude. The waiters are very polite, but expect to flag them down when it gets busy. It can get a little hectic."
Eilana G.,"Los Angeles, CA",70,148,155,5.0,11/29/2016,I think cheesecake factory is an excellent restaurant to go to with family. They have an array of options to satisfy anyone's cravings and dietary restrictions. I've come here numerous times with family and friends for dinner and lunch. Some of my favorites are the Santa Fe salad and the miso Salmon.  The avocado eggrolls are a must! Last week my friends and I were looking for a spot to cut to go to for dessert. Cheesecake factory showed up on yelp and I had never thought about that before for just dessert. We came here for tea and cheesecake. We were very happy with our choice!!!  I am usually so full after I eat here that I forget how great their desserts are. We got the classic strawberry cheesecake and the new Nutella crunch cheesecake. Loved it! Posted a pic too :)
Ben T.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,4.0,11/7/2017,Great restaurant really good food and the menu is with plenty of options also great for kids and romantic bar at night basically everything in one restaurant
