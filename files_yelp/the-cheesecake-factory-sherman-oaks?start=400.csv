Tereza B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,3,1.0,10/9/2016,I called to check how long is the wait they told me there is no wait i got there in 2 min and then they told me you need to wait 35-40min REALLY ??? NEVER TRUST THEM.
Eduard M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/8/2016,"This place is a joke. There have been many robberies reported at this location. They don't have any security at all and they allow people to walk in to the restaurant, steal something and run out. The location is so awful that they allowed a person to run inside, grab a purse, and run out MULTIPLE times. Their response to the situation was ridiculous. They said ""We can't do anything about it."" Absolutely ridiculous restaurant."
Janet G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,29,2,1.0,7/14/2016,"Wow!! The lowest rating Cheesecake Factory award goes to this location HANDS DOWN! I can not believe the lag of customer service that they have here. I would always have an amazing experience at every Chessecake Factory restaurant that I would go to but, today's staff (Sunday July 10th) really ruin that feeling for me. Two friends and I were sitting down waiting for over ten minutes for our server to come to our table. (or at least show his or her face so we know who our server was) Finally I decided to ask someone who our server was, I tried looking pass the fact that ten minutes had passed. The server did not even answer my question in fact, she looked around and just replied ""Oh let me check."" Her way of ""checking"" was to go towards a place where the cameras wouldn't catch her texting and gossip with her fellow coworkers for a good while. Enough was enough! Instead of making a scene, my friends and I just decided to go to other location. The Beverly Hills location BLOWS this one out of the water."
Jake S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,1,5.0,5/1/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is the best place to get an amazing meal and awesome service. When we got here the wait time was only about 2 minutes! Then we sat down, the waitress was fast and gave us our drinks and bread in no time! The food was incredible, the proportion was ginormous, and was very reasonably priced! It was my dads birthday so they sang a fun and energizing birthday song with the whole crowd getting in! The dessert was great and simple! Overall the best place to get an amazing meal after a movie!!"
Chris C.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",152,123,85,3.0,11/7/2014,"Food was fantastic as usual at this location, however another usual is the slow service.  We only ordered two salads and we waited nearly 40 minutes, we literally went through 4 baskets of bread we were so hungry lol!  Salads are giant as they are at all Cheescake Fatory locations, they're piled like 7 inches above the top of the bowl so they're definitely a large entree by themselves or generous serving of appetizer salad for two.  I usually order the BBQ salad or the Chinese chicken salad. Both are among the best and most flavorful salads I've ever had."
Shelden W.,"Encino, CA",10,41,12,4.0,2/27/2016,I always try to order it from here. Wished they delivered as much as we order from here. I'm upset they don't serve the popcorn shrimp anymore but the dynamite shrimp will do lol. I also like getting the crazy Craig carrot cake cheesecake.
Lisa S.,"Calabasas, CA",0,23,1,5.0,9/24/2016,"Amazing customer service. Got the Kobe burger & it wasn't as expected. Had a sweet sauce that didn't work. The manager immediately came over, apologized & offered something else. Didn't expect that, thank you Liz."
Steve K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,22,,4.0,4/24/2016,"After the wait, usually lengthy at the busy hours on Fri/Sat nights, the service has been generally good. TCF has the most diverse menu anywhere, all types of food. The appetizers are very good and I really enjoy the Thai Lettuce Wraps as a main course. Sometimes the pour on a glass of wine can be disappointing, but overall TCF  is a great place to dine and also share a dessert."
Jojo D.,"Glendale, CA",0,12,3,2.0,6/4/2016,I wish I was able to get the same great experience that many of the other Yelpers received but that wasn't the case tonight. We go to CF a lot as it is/was my sons favorite restaurant and we were celebrating his high school graduation. This experience was pretty bad as the waiter seemed uninterested and annoyed by us as we had to wave him down every time we needed a refill. I don't care that we didn't see him that much because of his poor attitude but at least refill the drinks every once in a while as we waited over 40 minuets for our food. when the food finally came out we were missing two orders and my son who got lucky enough to get the French fries with his meal were extremely cold. I say luck because my fries came around the same time they were bringing the check. Oh well enough said.
Christian K.,"Orange, CA",254,31,21,3.0,10/8/2015,I've been to other cheesecake factories and this is just the same in terms of food as well as service. Luckily the place wasn't busy on a wednesday lunch so the group of 9 of us got seated right away. The service was alright. Nothing out of the ordinary. The waiter did take a while to fill up the glasses of water. She did seem to rush us towards the end.
Joanna S.,"San Diego, CA",6,70,17,2.0,6/26/2016,"Went here for brunch today with my husband and babies. The waitress seemed nice but service was slow. Maybe she was busy with other tables? When she brought the bread I asked about the ingredients because my daughter has a few allergies. She replied ""it's baked with stuff,"" then asked if I wanted her to take it away. After we finally ordered, our food seemed to take forever. At least 40 min. When it came my husband's food was cold and mine looked like it has sat for quite awhile. I got the crab hash that had hollandaise and the sauce had congealed. The potatoes were overcooked and dry. The waitress forgot to ask what kind of toast so she chose white for me. The person who brought the food didn't bring any jam for the toast or offer condiments. The waitress finally came back and I asked for the jam but she hurried away as I was asking for ketchup and hot sauce so we had to do without. It was just not good."
Tess l.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",37,42,75,3.0,1/19/2014,"It was ok but comparing to great resteraunt that I have been it's not that great. It's a good family quick, i don't know where to go kinda place. However,  I always loved the ambience here.  the drinks are okay, nothing spectacular but I did like the dirty martini with the blue cheese olive. The Mahi mahi from the skinny menu was okay.. Just ok..... after all it is healthy food menu lol. ;) Tessiyah    food review  for you!"
Art L.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,4,2,5.0,4/17/2016,Awesome menu and service! I like spring rolls and tasty grill salmon. Vanilla cheesecake is very tasty.
Lisa D.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",29,10,,5.0,11/3/2014,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory this afternoon with my boyfriend and our server Alex was the best!  He was very friendly and had a good conversation about New Orleans and Thibodeaux, LA. He was attentive and took note of things with out us even asking.  We love the brown bread and he noticed that and brought more, and when our meals were taking a long time to come out with out us saying anything he told the manager who in turn compensated us with free cheesecake.   Awesome service! Awesome food! Thank you Alex! Who Dat!  Go Saints!"
Lori P.,"Canoga Park, CA",0,3,,4.0,10/26/2016,Great food. Amazing choices. Nice for big groups. Service a little slow during lunch. Make sure you're not in a hurry. Bar has amazing selection.  Menu has lunch portions available.
Camilla M.,"Houston, TX",88,59,525,4.0,3/7/2015,"We love this place. We were celebrating a birthday. It was a Saturday night. We called to see if they accepted reservations and they said NO, first come first served. We waited over an hour,."
Tony H.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,49,4,1.0,2/29/2016,"Unhealthy food, It even says on their menu that the food can get you sick. No quality in their food and it actually does make you sick ."
Judi x.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",1,50,,2.0,6/23/2016,"My guy took be for a birthday dinner last night drinks great app was wonderful dinner not so much, First our tray with entrees was dropped ok that happens. Brought comp salads. Nice but neither of us wanted them otherwise we would have ordered again trying to be nice. When our dinner arrived the salmon not cooked through and as server was placing the Sheppard pie it came so close to spilling on my guy that we both jumped. when it was severed it looked like slop like as they were remaking our food they just pushed it out. I picked the place. The server and some other guy there thought the ALMOST spill was funny I though the whole thing was terrible. Although we thought about sharing a piece of cheesecake (reason for going) we went to Ben and Jerry's and had ice cream we could not wait to leave. This one is off my list."
Ellie R.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,74,8,4.0,2/9/2015,I've come to this place 3 times already & the restaurant is always clean. The servers are pretty friendly. The food was great as well.
Jen L.,"Agoura Hills, CA",195,584,253,4.0,8/11/2013,"If I had to have a favorite CC Factory, this is the one. Never had problems finding parking in the structure. ** I love to eat OUTSIDE, it's not as noisy but not the street side, I LOVE the comfy seating on the other side of the restaurant. Love the tropical iced tea. They also carry COKE ZERO Don't forget to leave room for dessert. Currently loving the skinny menu options(soft tacos or flatbread pizza) Food: ++ chicken wrap App- I get it as a meal sometimes ++ garlic chicken farfalle +factory burrito + bagel with lox + mushroom burger +build your own omelet ++Bbq chicken salad - love the onion tanglers on top DESSERT and DRINKS ALWAYS order pumpkin pecan cheesecake only around OCT-end of year ++ apple strudel cheesecake ++ lemon raspberry CC ++chocolate coconut CC ++ Chris' outrageous CC + peach Bellini ++Georgia peach"
