Roberto R.,"Granada Hills, CA",39,152,1,5.0,7/9/2015,Great clean location with plenty of parking for cars  Or bikes.Great food and service. Close to other stores. One of our family favorite restaurants
Ian N.,"Tarzana, CA",10,50,27,1.0,8/2/2016,I've been sitting here for 52 minutes since I ordered my food. The food is still not here. Every Cheesecake Factory has the same food and same menu. So the food will always be the same. The service at this location is horrible. It's not even busy here. There is no excuse for making me and my party wait this long for such a simple meal. I won't be back here.
Graham P.,"Valencia, CA",5,25,2,3.0,11/14/2014,"Food was fine, service was slow and inattentive. Considering the price, I expected better. Feels like a chain past their prime and in decline.  Cheesecake for dessert was still great.  For the money, there are much better choices in this city."
Lisette C.,"Los Angeles, CA",440,751,189,4.0,6/12/2013,"Yay! I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory's happy hour!  Monday to Friday from 4-6pm.  You do have to find a seat at the bar, and it is only during the week, and yes, it would be nice if it was a 5-7 happy hour, but I get it.   This particular Cheesecake Factory is usually very busy, but it has a generous sized bar area and they validate your parking.  If you need to wait for your buzz to wear off, you can always head up to DSW or Urban Home and walk it off."
Aaron M.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",5,26,2,4.0,2/18/2016,Calamari was good and so was the mojito. I ordered the herb something salmon it was over cooked. They were very polite about it and got me a new plate. It was good the second time around. This place was very good service and food.
Mark J.,"Bishop, CA",97,34,31,2.0,10/17/2015,"Poor and unprofessional service.  Turned off by the wait staff, so bad we left.  Went to Glendale Cheesecake Factory and had a great time."
Erica B.,"Goleta, CA",48,7,1,1.0,9/9/2015,"Watch out for a hostess named Ashely. Terrible attitude and she has no issue with  it at all. She likes to give you a snobby reply to any question and seems to have no brain. And not to mention on top of that, terrible customer service in general here. Good luck to you if you do go."
Istara Z.,"Woodland Hills, CA",351,124,234,5.0,4/25/2013,"Quality food, excellent service, and beautiful ambience.  Came here tonight for my brothers 34th bday and it couldn't of gone better. Our server was very attentive to our needs and even made great drink and food suggestions. Food and drinks came out at a timely fashion even though my husband and I came late 15 minutes and ordered after everyone. Everyone enjoyed themselves!!!.  This is my favorite spot to celebrate birthdays for the reason that they have the space and tables to fit a party of any size. The Cheesecake Factory is good for any occasion."
Nicole A.,"Los Angeles, CA",832,655,374,4.0,8/8/2014,"I haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory in a really long time and I've never been to this location. We did not have to wait for a table, which was really nice. It was decorated in the typical Cheesecake Factory way, dim lighting, lots of white.  The best part of The Cheesecake Factory is obviously their bread. Their bread is always delicious and wonderful. I don't know what it is, maybe they put crack in it, but it's hard to resist.  I ordered the chicken stuffed quesadillas which came with onions, cilantro, delicious cheese and chicken, it was really good. I wanted to eat the entire thing but I couldn't as I was so stuffed.  For dessert, I ordered the tiramisu cheesecake which was delicious! I fully enjoyed the full taste of tiramisu combined with the creaminess of the cheesecake. Their cheesecake is extremely rich which almost took away from the lightness of the tiramisu but it was interesting combining the two textures.  I would totally come back. They have this dish that comes with corn cakes that I want to try."
Sarah L.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,77,89,4.0,3/20/2015,"I've been here a couple of times with both my parents and my friends. The place is dimly lit and we'll decorated. The have an incredible amount of cheesecake selections and well as wines and other alcoholic beverages. The food is well made and large portions, honestly I feel the appetizers are more than enough. Haha. The only downside to this place is that you have to pay for parking and it's always packed. I usually have to wait around 15-30min each time I come. Other then that, this place is great"
Krys W.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,18,6,2.0,11/13/2015,"Let me say this, I am a huge fan of the cheese cake factory but I would love to get a realistic wait time. So after we were called up via buzzer, my party of 4 and I noticed about 15 other people's buzzers had gone off as well. Why buzz that many people at the same time ? So now wait another 15 to 20 minutes?  No thanks Sherman Oaks!!! I will go back to the Topanga cheesecake next time."
Arik T.,"Los Angeles, CA",136,193,398,5.0,9/30/2015,"I'm always torn between this location and the location at the Topanga Mall as i live right in the middle of the 2 i try to juggle between them so as to not get bored with one or the other. This location is great and they validate the parking which is awesome, and it is right by a movie theater so it can go from a dinner to a date night pretty easily. The food and service is always great and they deserve each of the 5 stars i am giving them. i will be back soon!"
Ariel A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,1,4.0,2/23/2016,"Here for a relative's birthday dinner on Tuesday and Ricky is our waiter. He's fantastic! I have a dairy allergy and he went out of his way to make sure I had a dairy-free meal. He is attentive, prompt, and courteous; excellent service, especially considering that we were a party of 9. Thank you for making dinner great, Ricky!!!"
Shani F.,"Los Angeles, CA",135,91,72,3.0,2/14/2015,"We had great service, bread was stale (how hard is it to serve fresh bread?!) I ordered miso salmon- delicious! My boyfriend had the Ribeye steak requested it medium- got it cold and medium well... we didn't complain because we had a movie to catch... drinks were good!"
Joe G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,38,8,1.0,8/10/2016,This is probably the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. The people at the front are so unorganized and unprofessional. When we placed our names for two we were asked if we preferred inside or outside dinning. We asked for the first available. When our beeper ranged we went to the front and they asked us to wait for a minute and someone would sit us. As we waited we noticed other parties of two that came after us were being seated in front of us. After the third party was seated I approached one of the girls and asks why they were seating people ahead of us. We were told that those people had asked for indoor dinning. I explained to her that we specifically asked for the first available. I noticed they were giving people who chose indoor priority. At the point I noticed the girl give us an attitude and we told her we were going somewhere else.  There was no apology or empathy on her part. She waived us out and told us to have a good night. They didn't even try to win our business. I will never be back to this horrible place.
Gautam G.,"Los Angeles, CA",60,14,,3.0,2/6/2016,"Been to this Cheesecake several times. The location is great if you'd like to have a drink or dine before a movie at the ArcLight. They also validate parking up to a couple of hours. However, the service isn't as great compared to other Cheesecake Factories, and the food is hit or miss depending on how crowded the restaurant is when you dine there. If you're looking for a good Cheesecake Factory experience I'd recommend going to the one at the Topanga Mall or Americana in Glendale instead."
Jeff L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",40,235,,3.0,1/14/2016,"The food here is always good. But why do I seem to get waiters in the midst of their shifts. Manager comes over to apologize for the long long wait. Whatever, there are other restaurants around in the galleria."
Kellie E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,5.0,2/20/2016,"We had dinner here last night, and Zander was our server. He was so nice, recommended wonderful appetizers to us (we are vegetarian, he recommended the stuffed mushrooms and fried cheese), and everything was really good. Zander gave such kind and excellent service. He made our night! We felt very welcome. And of course the red velvet cheesecake was amazing as always. We highly recommend this location!"
Lirit R.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,6,,5.0,6/21/2016,The service here is always amazing! They always bring you anything you need if it's extra sauce or refills on your drinks. The avocado eggrolls are definitely a must try! This is the perfect place for family dinners. The kids will love it and there is something for everyone to eat because there is almost every type of food. The prices aren't bad either. Love this restaurant!
