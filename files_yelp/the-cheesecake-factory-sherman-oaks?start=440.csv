Marilyn S.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",188,165,570,4.0,12/22/2013,"This place always seems to be crowded. It's very convenient especially if you are going to see a movie and you can eat right after. The food is decently priced and good. The cheesecake is good, but the portions are big that you can't even finish your food let alone save room for dessert.  The servers are really nice, but the hostess taking down orders could be nicer. When are buzzer went off she didn't tell us our name would be called. She just said wait over there. If you happen to sit outside and it's cold they have warmers that work really well. It goes quicker if you don't mind where you are being seated."
Leticia G.,"Los Banos, CA",15,4,1,4.0,9/27/2015,"Had an amazing experience that definitely made up for our dreadful one across the way @ el torrito grill. BRUCE IS ONE OF THE BEST WAITERS!!  He made our visit beyond pleasant and memorable. However, the wait was a bit much and after our pager went off we still had to wait and almost got passed up by another,  equal numbered party until we brought it to their attention. Had it not been for that I would have rated the visit 5 stars. (was there yesterday night)"
Aram M.,"Los Angeles, CA",80,7,3,5.0,7/14/2013,"Came here the other night with a big party. With past experiences at other restaurants, when you go with a big party the waiter doesn't treat you as good, because typically the party is loud and annoying. This time my experience was different. The waiter we had really did her job. She took everyone's orders, gave everyone excellent tips on what to order, knew exactly who ordered what, and she even kept coming and asking if everything is okay and if we need anything else. She asked us if each of us want to get our own checks and we said yes. She went ahead and conveniently split each one of our orders onto our own individual checks, down to the tip and the tax. The food at The Cheesecake Factory has always been great for me. You can't go wrong with anything that your order. I usually try a different burger each time I go, as I love burgers. This time I got the mushroom burger cooked medium well and it was delicious. I had read a review on yelp while waiting for the food and I was told to ask for the ranch, the review had said that the ranch was amazing and to die for. Well, long story short I found the ranch to be really really good.  I personally would recommend The Cheesecake Factory to anyone. They have a wide selection on their menu which is great for large parties. Thank You to The Cheesecake Factory for the fabulous experience and the great food!"
Sandee T.,"Los Angeles, CA",395,796,4547,3.0,2/18/2013,"This CF-dining is fastly becoming a ritual~! Quick easy parking (free under 2 hours), the usual ridiculous-caloried food (but they offer lite dining w/ calorie count for those watching the waistline), and cheesecakes galore. We heart grubbin' here mainly for convenience + options' (read: 10+ page menu) sake."
Chen Z.,"Valley Glen, Los Angeles, CA",500,196,4420,4.0,10/1/2013,A lot of Food and a lot of People waiting to be seated. There is nothing new to write Every body know What is cheesecake all about. Good restaurant with any kind of cuisine and a lot of food.
allie v.,"Glendale, CA",89,67,47,2.0,1/8/2016,Very disappointed with the service this time around. We ordered the Tuna tartare as an appetizer and got something else and came out with our main entree. My sons pasta was cold and overall refills on drinks were delayed. Please hire more people.
Brennan S.,"Tempe, AZ",143,89,31,4.0,7/5/2015,"Came here after a long drive for some food, the food portions are very big and worth the $17 I spent on a pasta with shrimp. The beer on draft was amazing. The only thing was that I really didnt get any warm bread, it was all cold"
Sandy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,15,14,4.0,9/16/2014,"This rating is on food. Their food is good. Normally I do order the Jambalaya, which comes with brown or white rice. This plate is huge, very hearty. Ask for extra bread for your Jambalaya. Gumbo: hearty as well. A bit tangy. Fettucini w/ or w/o chicken is great. Large serving size worth it's price.  Ambience is ok. Very crowded, very noisy at times. Wait time can range anywhere from 30mins to an hour.  If in large group expect to be seated outside."
Monica S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,,4.0,3/3/2016,"Very friendly, spacious, and great food. My sister and I wanted to try their ""Super Foods"" menu which are nutrient rich and have antioxidants. My sister had the California Guacamole Salad and said it was so very good. She felt light and happy afterwards. I had the Super Antioxidant Salad and felt great all afternoon. I do recommend both of these salads. Next time I will try the Almond Salmon. The pictures look so good."
Angel W.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,30,5,1.0,1/15/2016,"I've been coming to The Cheesecake Factory  since the only ones around were in Beverly Hills and MarinaDell Rey. Always loved the experience but now every time I come here, I am aggravated by the time I get to my table and not much happier when I leave. The lack of customer service in this location is quite seeious. I had an18 person team dinner here and they were really awful. The manager was somewhat sassy. I let it go. Tonight I came back with my family and it hasn't chaged. The front desk is where the welcome should be warm and here it's cold, almost like they can't be bothered. I suggest they get an app to figure out how to be warm and courteous"
Jimmy C.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",419,521,33,5.0,6/30/2013,"Came here for lunch with the coworkers, they validate for parking in the structure. This was not my first time but it's been awhile. Lunch time is really busy so come early or you'll be stuck outside in the heat. Bread - unlimited bread, get the brown looking bread, delicious! Fried Macaroni And Cheese - Pretty tasty, nothing special though. Hot Spinach And Cheese Dip - spinach was pretty good, tasty, would definitely order Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta - AMAZING! the sauce blended perfectly and was so delicious. I would have finished everything had I not ate so much bread. Strawberry Cheesecake - Pretty good but just a typical cheese cake Service was great and this place is always consistent. Haven't had a bad experience."
Frederick L.,"Diamond Bar, CA",24,1,,5.0,9/10/2016,"Food is delicious but disappointed in customer service. Tonight while celebrating my mother's birthday with 5 others the waiters collided next to our table and dropped trays of drinks all over the floor, wetting 2 of our guests. Wet and broken glass went on the table also. They offered us towels to clean up with, told us to bring back dry cleaning bills for reimbursement and 2 free desserts!  Our guests live 40+ miles away! Wet,sticky and disappointed with this offer, we had to request to speak with another higher manager before our meals were appropriately compensated. Didn't complete celebration plans as the guests were too uncomfortable to continue the plans for the evening.  When the manager came she said she saw everything when it happened! So why was the burden of proof on the guests and the sleazy compensation then offered? Just do the right thing the first time maybe we will return, but not now. Shouldn't have to do this!!"
Charles R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",20,63,11,5.0,2/28/2016,"Always a very long wait; always worth the wait. First come seating in the bar, if patient, you'll get seated faster than through the front door."
Kristin H.,"Los Angeles, CA",350,463,562,4.0,8/6/2011,"The Peach Bellini will always satiate my alcoholic palate... As will the Asian Pear Martini and the house Cabernet Sauvignon. This is not to say that I am an alcoholic, but to simply put that I love CCF's beverage menu.  I always order a fish entree or the luau salad (no chicken and dressing on the side). Tonight I tried the Mediterranean Salmon. Deliciously delightful with a light EVOO sauce with bruschetta and capers, set on top of a nice mound of their famous red mashed potatoes.  I understand CCF will be changing their menu on 8/11, so I really hope this dish stays on the menu.  There were a couple of times we had to question where our server had gone, but every 15-20 minutes or so he'd pop up again.   P.S., the floor at this location is unbearably slippery. Make sure to wear your flats instead of super cute stiletto heels... You know what I mean."
Kimberly Cameron V.,"Canoga Park, CA",66,180,29,5.0,8/4/2013,"Kim Cameron, Valencia, CA This place is a family favorite!!! We go to Cheesecake Factory all the time for birthdays and special events. The Miso Salmon, Beet Salad (it's on the specials menu), and Fried Macaroni and Cheese are all amazing!! And the Cheesecake, yummmmmm... need I say more? My favorite: Strawberry Cheesecake!!!"
Denysia Y.,"Cerritos, CA",838,423,309,4.0,8/2/2011,"I've only been to cheesecake factory one time before this time, and I believe that was in 2006, and I've never had a chance to step foot into this place again. (Not this same place, but a different one!) So me and 3 of my friends decided to drive up to Sherman Oaks, because one of our friends lives over in Van Nuys, and we decided to check out the eating areas around there.  It was either this or PF Chang's. And PF Chang's had a wait of 45 minutes to an hour so we decided to skip it, and just head over to Cheesecake factory. The wait here was about 40 minutes or so, which isn't bad but it wasn't great. But it was alright because by the time we sat down it was around 9ish. By the time we got our food it was around 9:30. So we made good time.  I got the pasta cabanara. It was pretty good. I only ate like 1/4 of my food though. I don't eat that much!  The service was pretty good, but the waitress didn't come and refill my glass of strawberry lemonade at the end, which was a slight bummer. But other than that, I would come back here next time, but I'm definitely going to try something different!"
Lu Lu S.,"Burbank, CA",44,117,41,4.0,10/17/2014,"Cheesecake Factory has been a long time favorite. When we were looking for a local spot to take our staff out to lunch to that would satisfy and give plenty of food options, Cheesecake Factory was the chosen popular choice by the group. They accommodated our big group and our waiter did a good job juggling all our drink, appetizer, entree and dessert orders even though it was his third day on the job :) Thank you boss for taking us out"
Jennifer D.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,92,3,2.0,8/9/2016,The food is ok but the customer service is horrible. I just called and waited on hold for 15 minutes to place an order. The manager was rude and said she doesn't take food orders.
Nico L.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,72,,5.0,2/2/2015,I've been ordering pick up from here for the past year and I've never had a problem with the food ever.  Always good and a fair price for the portion you get. Free bread which is amazing. We usually get the meatloaf and the roasted chicken herb thing and they are both excellent.  Thanks!
Lloyd B.,"Los Angeles, CA",455,420,1588,4.0,1/10/2011,"My favorite Cheesecake Factory.  Service is fast and friendly.  The menu is constantly changing but the favorites are always there. I usually order the fettuccine with chicken and sun dried tomatoes but I thought I'd try something new instead.  I ordered the New Orleans shrimp from their special lunch menu and it was good. Served over a bed of rice it had lots of flavor without being too spicy or salty. I liked the tiny pieces of sausage and bell peppers that were mixed in the shrimp. The Arnold Palmer was perfect with my meal.  Parking was easy and free with validation. Oh, don't forget to order a slice of the always delicious cheesecake."
