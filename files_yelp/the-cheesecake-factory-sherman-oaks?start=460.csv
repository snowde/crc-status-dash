Claudia M.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,30,3,4.0,1/3/2016,"Very yummy food, good prices for the portions, we went in for an early  lunch at 1pm on a Sunday and we're sited right away, be ready to wait any time after 3pm. The place is big and it can be a bit loud so don't take your date here this is why I gave it 4 stars.  The cheesecake is great but be ready to pay $8 for a slice.  The waitress was very nice and always there when we needed her."
Anne A.,"Los Angeles, CA",400,1618,3340,1.0,5/10/2014,"Now I know why I shouldn't eat here or don't eat here as often as I did when I was in high school and college.  Horrible service.  Not once did our server check on us or refill our drinks. I'm not coming back again.  I watched him serve three tables beside us, check up on them and completely ignored us.  Discrimination maybe?  Our server tonight, Dylan, probably thinks that Asians are bad tippers because he obviously didn't to refill our drinks. I watched him go to the tables near ours several times to check on them. This is the first time ever that I didn't leave a tip for bad service and it feels good to finally not reward this kind of behavior.   Why leave a tip when you're unhappy?"
Eric R.,"Encino, CA",351,296,27,1.0,5/26/2014,Steven the manager is very rude!!  There are 5 empty tables and the workers are just standing around... I tell him we are waiting as well as others while there are empty tables and he tells me we were quoted 25 minutes and its only been 15... So why should the patrons wait when their is no need for it??!!?? Steven tells me that we need to wait because its first come first serve and that's how a restaurant works and there are other people waiting to be sat.  WTF?? The other manager Joey is a nice guy.
Jess D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1080,56,16,1.0,5/21/2015,"I took my two children here for an early dinner last night after they convinced me to sell one of my kidneys to be able to afford what the bill usually is, but kindly.. I obliged. As usual our bill was basically the cost of a Disneyland admission and just about as disappointing as the overpriced food at a theme park too. I ordered an appetizer and iced tea which was only refilled twice (apparently four tables was too much for our waitress to handle at 4pm) and my children had bow tie pasta off of the kids menu (which is the price of a Coach coin purse for the portion).  Now you would think, how does one screw up bow-tie pasta and butter, right? Well... apparently, Cheesecake Factory can and it's not a problem for their guy in the back at ""the pasta station"".  My younger sons arrived and it looked like something Gizmo from the Gremlin's threw up. The noodles which should only consist of butter and Parmesan cheese arrived looking burnt and covered in brown snot.  My other son ordered the same thing, but asked for no cheese and when it arrived it was dry (no butter, nothing). My older son was so grossed out that he didn't even want to eat anything else once the waitress came back over (after looking for her for about ten minutes). My younger son added his own cold slice of butter (that originally came with the bread) and it just wasn't the same for him, so he didn't really eat it.  We ordered a slice of cheesecake to split and it arrived and wasn't the size of the millennium falcon as I remembered it to be and was $8 (which instead of the Cheesecake Factory staff throwing in for free due to our gremlin vomit that was served to us), they charged us for it and only removed the two child's entrees from our bill, but charged me for the ""free soda"" that came with my sons entree and charged my other son an adult price for his soda.  Our bill was about $29.00 for basically two kids drinks, 1 adult drink, cheesecake and an appetizer.  So if you're into paying for crappy service, getting whiplash from searching for a waiter, and playing a game of ""what the hell is that on my child's plate?"" then by all means, eat here. But be prepared for NO manager to come over an apologize for the mix up and also be prepared for the staff to penny pinch your tab instead of doing what's right and comping your meal.  I still can't get over that they charged me for the free drinks on the kids meals! Really!?  I didn't even fight the price of our final tab, because we had a movie to go to and our waitress was perhaps doing her make-up or taking a hot yoga class, but survey says we will not be returning to this Cheesecake Factory anytime soon.  Sincerely,  Greatly disappointed"
Vanessa J.,"Carmichael, CA",260,136,121,5.0,7/8/2014,"My family and I go here every year to celebrate my birthday (a week or so after the day) which happened to fall on Fourth of July weekend this year.  Boy was it PACKED!  Our wait time was 40 minutes on Saturday evening.  Luckily, we perused the cheesecake selection, ordered a cocktail from the bar and took selfies by the outdoor fountain lol. The salmon is farm raised but delicious, nonetheless! The crab and artichoke appetizer is a must try! We ordered 3-4 appetizers, and 3-4 plates.  I could not finish (or even start!) my meal.  STUFFED with delicious apps!"
Juan Carlos O.,"Burbank, CA",6,25,2,1.0,6/16/2015,"This place is horrible waitress attention, I request change the waitres because she use the f word when she walk away, manager cool but need to teach customer service to they waitress she toll me stay and I won't pay for dinner is cool but the Nigth already done , I won't come back here I give the gift card away"
Kelsey P.,"San Diego, CA",98,197,37,5.0,7/24/2014,"I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory much but this one is one of the best.  The staff is always amazing and the food is incredible...the cheesecake speaks for itself.  Had dinner here with some girlfriends and it was great to catch up, laugh, have some great food and even better conversation. It is spacious and there is great outdoor seating as well. They validate your parking tickets so it was great to not feel rushed because of parking or seating. I had the garlic noodles and a side salad; the salad comes dressed in balsamic vinaigrette.  The pasta was light with asparagus, sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms.  Didn't save room for cheesecake this round but the Oreo cheesecake is my favorite!"
Richie F.,"Los Angeles, CA",120,64,6,5.0,7/28/2015,"What an amazing experience at the Cheesecake Factory ! Quick Service, Delicious food, and Jessica's customer service was fabulous ! 5 stars across the board !!"
Lillian B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,,2.0,2/6/2016,"I had a bad experience tonight at this restaurant, a branch I have patronized for over 10 years. I waited 35 minutes for a table ( arrived at 5:25) while 4 other sets of people whose blinking thing went off after mine- three groups of two and one group of three- were seated before us. All of us requested inside seating. We were finally seated at the BAR where I could have been  seated when I first came in. I asked to speak to the manager who gave me a blank look and an unsatisfactory apology. On the positive side, the food was excellent and the server was very good. But the mix-up at the front desk was unacceptable. And the manager needs training."
Kim K.,"Burbank, CA",145,573,3279,2.0,3/22/2013,"Not changing my rating just yet, but wanted to share that after sending my Yelp review to the corporate offices, I was contacted in a timely manner by the General Manager of the Sherman Oaks restaurant.  He did what the manager at the time should have done and validate  my feelings.  He was extremely apologetic and offered me a gift card to come back (or any other Cheesecake Factory... which I intend to do) and try them again.  Along with the gift card he included a personal letter and that made me feel good that they understand the importance of customers.   Good job on the follow up.  I will update my star rating when I can get back to that establishment.  Thanks.  :)"
Kristin M.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,38,6,5.0,11/2/2015,"I don't know why this Cheesecake Factory has 3.5 stars, because out of the all the ones I have been to in Los Angeles, which include Pasadena, Woodland Hills, Marina del Rey, and Beverly Hills this location is the best.  The food is always amazing, and they give you huge portions for what you pay for. My favorites here are: Crab Wontons, Macaroni and Cheese Balls, Chinese Chicken Salad, Chicken Madeira, and my all time favorite is the Chicken Costoletta. I've also had the breakfast dishes as well and they were really good.  Favorite Cheesecakes: Strawberry, Dulce de Leche, Pineapple Upside Down, and I just tried the Salted Caramel cheesecake and it was delicious! If you don't like it too rich I wouldn't recommend it. The service here majority of the time is amazing. Last night my family went out for my parent's anniversary dinner and the waiter we got was amazing, his name was Joseph G., so if you happen to get him you're in good hands. If you come during a busy time or on weeknight or on the weekend, there might be a possibility of getting bad service because of how crazy it is, but I think 99% of the time I come here I always get amazing, if not exceptional service. If you're in a small party of 2-4 people and don't want to wait, I'd recommend looking for a seat in the bar area, you might be able to snag something if it's not too busy and they serve everything the restaurant serves.  My recommendations for people who come here is to get here at least by 5pm, or before especially on a Friday, or a weekend. This location does get busy and you could be waiting 45+ minutes or more. They do not take reservations. The walk from the parking lot is about 5 minutes, or so. Also, Cheesecake factory validates parking for 2 hours, if you're planning to go to see a movie at the Arclight later, I would validate there since the theater validates for 4 hours."
Jessica C.,"Los Angeles, CA",377,970,2230,3.0,7/11/2012,"I could have easily gone to The Cheesecake Factory in Glendale, but I've always liked this one better... I like that I can easily park in valet, take the escalator up and there's the factory. We came on a crowded Saturday afternoon, but our wait wasn't as nearly long as I thought, the max was about 25 minutes. We where seated and quickly greeted by our server who was very attentive. As I looked over the menu everything sounded delicious and I finally decided on the angle hair pasta with shrimp sans garlic. It was a very nice portion that I couldn't even finish it but when our server asked to take my plate there was some miscommunication that I wanted to take it home and instead it was tossed... We looked over the dessert menu of course and we opted to take home two slices, one classic and one Reese's peanut butter cup ( both sooo good) for our dessert there, I had a cafe mocha which was served in a glass cup which I wasn't use too and I had a few sips of a banana peach smoothie like drink.... Okay when the bill came I was whoa.. close to $80.00 but I had a $45.00 gift card so that helped the wallet alittle.. the food is good and it was a very enjoyable evening but $80.00 not including tip and no alcoholic beverages consumed is not worth it to me.  I think for the most part when we come back  it will be strictly for an evening snack of coffee and dessert."
Jason F.,"Van Nuys, CA",284,51,20,5.0,7/16/2014,I had a great experience at your restaurant. I had a great waitress Christy that was attentive and got everything down pat. I really enjoyed my overall experience there a Cheesecake Factory Sherman Oaks. Then finish off with dessert with a strawberry cheesecake you can't go wrong with that and it was perfect.
Teresa V.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",20,27,2,4.0,7/6/2014,"I don't know why I haven't written about this good 'ol standby... but I guess it's because been there in awhile but since we were heading to a movie we decided to have some food..  I have to say my most favorite thing is the fire grilled artichoke.. It's FABULOUS!!  I have to compliment them on their ability to handle such a huge menu.. and the consistency it remarkable because of that.. The only reason I'm not giving a full 5 stars is more so because of the lack of management to take care of their bar employees As we were sitting at the bar I see the gal behind (our bartender that night) with a big clear hose that she needed to use to clean the ice bins behind the bar. 1st it was about 2"" in diameter and a little distracting to see as you are eating.. but worse it was held together with tape..  We joked to her about it but she informed us that was the only way to do what they needed to clean the ice bins.. I then commented that at least they (meaning the company) could get her a ""hose"" that wasn't held together with cheap tape.. she chuckled that they had told management that they needed a new one and this was what they returned... Come ON Cheesecake Factory.. find a better way to do this AND don't be so cheap you can't get your hard working employees (who rocked by the way in service) a dang NEW HOSE!!!"
Mara F.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",50,79,21,5.0,5/30/2014,"For some reason I used to think that Cheesecake Factory was something like Baskin Robbins LOL I was very surprised when I found out that they actually serve alcohol. Very nice place, will probably be one of my favorites now! Ice-cream servings are HUGE and very delicious))  They validate 2 hours parking in the structure. Our server was super-nice even though he was very busy. Highly recommend this restaurant!"
Edahn S.,"Los Angeles, CA",207,2,,1.0,1/28/2016,"Ordered a veggie burger, being a vegetarian. Waitress even repeated my order. Was served a turkey burger. I was polite, but that's a pretty egregious error for a server. Sorry guys. They comped the dish, which was nice, but doesn't change the one star rating of a normally very buttoned up restaurant; one that my family and I have been going to since it opened years ago."
Leo C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1054,640,3498,4.0,10/6/2012,"Only restaurant chain that I know that has a menu the size of a book with so much selection and variety of food.  Everything is so epically delicious from appetizers to entree and of course dessert.  Prices are reasonable and good portions. Nice location cause its located in the Sherman Oaks Galleria which has plenty of parking, next to Arclight theatre and shops. I like to come here on weekdays for their happy hour. Great deals on appetizers and mixed drinks for $5.  Also, it's not as crowded like weekends and we usually get a table within 10-15 minutes.  Good service. If you never been to cheesecake and wanted to try something out, but weren't sure. Here are some my favorites dishes that I've ordered in the past. Incredibly good and recommend: Appetizers: Thai lettuce wraps Spicy ahi tempura rolls Avocado egg rolls Salads: Chinese Chicken Salad BBQ Ranch Chicken Entree: Bistro Shrimp pasta Miso Salmon Cajun Jambalaya pasta Chicken Bellagio Dessert: Red velvet cheesecake - a must!! Pineapple upside down - cheesecake - awesome! Oreo Cheesecake - new obsession Chicken and biscuit - no longer on the menu  Make sure to take home leftovers. Alway delicious the next day."
Bella R.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",2,70,,5.0,10/22/2015,"This has been my go to Cheesecake Factory for years. The staff is fantastic, the food is consistently delicious and the ambiance never gets old.  On my last visit, Steven, one of the managers, really went out of his way to make sure I was a happy customer. He is excellent at his job!  Will absolutely be back..especially if the blueberry cheesecake comes back!"
Suzy H.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",0,161,36,4.0,11/12/2015,"Went here on Veterans Day.  Swamped with people, but no wait time.  The waitresses were running around out of control.   I think maybe they need more wait staff when they have a super busy day like they were having.  This location is really loud also with all the tables being filled.  I felt like I was reading the lips of the waitress since I couldn't hear what she was saying because of the loudness.  They brought a high chair, but the strap was broken.  They should invest in some new ones since it was also sticky.  (ick)  Food was good, hot and tasted fresh.  Our waitress was so busy, she never came to re-fill the waters, so I went and refilled them myself.  We gave her a break on the service since she was running around, taking orders and was really, really busy with no help at all!!!  We'll be back, but probably not on a holiday."
Rachel R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2463,216,210,4.0,4/3/2014,"I've been to this cheesecake at all hours of the day. Over all service is decent, food is good and prices are okay. I would never recommend to come here starving, you almost at all hours of the day have to wait anywhere from 10-45 minutes easy. Then you are seated and there goes another 10-25 minutes for waiting for food. Breakfasts: Breakfasts are usually better then the dinner courses because they have to cook everything and most  breakfasts require eggs, fruit, and bread you can't go wrong with that.   Lunch's: If you get a salad you usually can't go wrong, their salads are huge and taste fresh enough. Dinner: Now dinner's I have had more bad dinners because of waiting time to eating food you can tell that it had been previously frozen then deep fried (more appetizer I've experienced). I feel I'm always hesitant to order pasta dishes or appetizers. I will say however their burger are very good.   Bar: Drinking at the bar is fine, it's your typical bar but you can order food.  You also have about 2-3 other larger restaurants in this same plaza--sometimes its just worth going to the others and not battling the lines."
