Cherie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",388,137,192,5.0,4/30/2014,"Very detailed decor. That's the first thing I notice when I walk into a Cheesecake Factory restaurant. It always catches my eye upon arrival. Considering that I have frequented this location more than two handful of times. The food here is made to par. I have never had any bad plates brought to me. Presentation is great. Everything is always cooked to order and packed with flavor.  Normally when I come here, I always order the Miso Salmon. I have tried other entrees but this is my absolute favorite. The mash potatoes they accompany the salmon with is always creamy and smooth. The asparagus always melt in your mouth with just the right amount of crisp. Of course you can't forget about the infamous cheesecake here. It's the main part of their brand. I have never been able to try anything outside of Dulce De Leche. It's my favorite here. Staff members are always busy here. They always greet you with warmth and prompt service. The strawberry lemonade is good as well. Like really really good :) This location gets pretty busy because it's inside of the Sherman Oaks Galleria. Remember to get your parking validated. Saves you time and money to ensure you do. This Cheesecake Factory is really one of my favorite restaurants to patron. A must try :-)"
Laura Z.,"Arleta, CA",502,277,718,2.0,4/26/2013,"I love the food at The Cheesecake Factory.  I love the fact that they have the skinny menu.  I have tried the BBQ chicken salad, Salmon Salad and the Seared Tuna Takiti Salad.  The food was great and dessert was even better.  The only thing I really DON'T like is the service. One of the times I came here with my bf's family (we're Mexican) they made us and another Hispanic family wait over 30 mins while other parties that had gotten there after us with the same amount of people kept getting seated. I don't like to be judgemental and think that the host made our party and the other  Hispanic party wait a long time simply because didn't  look wealthy or like we would spend a lot. But that what it seemed like. Its also funny that they sent us a Hispanic waiter to serve us once we got seated like maybe we didn't understand English.  The other time I have gone the waitresses have been rude and very stand offish. When i have asked for recommendations or opinions they always look bugged."
Troy H.,"Chatsworth, CA",811,653,191,4.0,5/5/2012,"The wife and I and a couple of friends went to see the Avengers (Awesome flick by the way), and had to get some grub before hand. Its been awhile since we have been been to this location so we decided on this place.  I love the menu options they have. The have a SkinnyLicious menu, that has a wide range of options ranging from Santorini Farro Salad, Beets With Goat Cheese,Endive Salad,Arugula Salad,Little House Salad, to a Skinnylicious Pasta. I went to their Glamburger & Sandwiches options. I decided on their Smokehouse B.B.Q. Burger which is Smoked Bacon and Melted Cheddar with Crispy Onion Rings and B.B.Q. Ranch Sauce.  This is a filler. The portion sizes are huge, and you will definitely leave full. For drink,  I had to wash it down with a blue moon.  The service was great. Natasha did a great job taking care of us.  Parking is in the garage below, just redeem if your seeing a movie at the Arc Light."
Mays E.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,172,284,1.0,10/1/2015,"Not so good anymore. The quality and cleanliness is at a zero! Idk what's going on with them but every time I end up going there it's either one. Today I had both issues with quality of food and cleanliness. The table was dirty, the floor as well, and the chairs had food crumbs and splatter all over. And when I ordered my plate the turkey smelled and tasted nasty! I'm very disappointed. From now on is rather just order to go and not have to deal with the attitude the staff gave me."
Sara W.,"Northridge, CA",129,352,8,3.0,10/8/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is very hit or miss. There are a few items on the menu that I've tried and actually really enjoyed, but a lot more that wasn't so great. Their menu is HUUUUUGE so I'm always tempted to try something different; and they never really hit it out of the ball park for me.. except for a couple items. The Good Stuff: The ahi tartare is my favorite. They just do it so right w/ delicious tuna, fresh avocado and the crispy wontons. The spicy crispy chicken sandwich is also surprisingly good, as are their flatbreads. The Meh: So they're supposed to be known for their fried mac and cheese balls.. and I love my mac... but these are awful! Way too fried and nasty and greasy. Just gross. Their pastas are okay and same with the pizza... but if you want pasta or pizza, I would definitely go somewhere else.  This is a good place to meet friends because the menu is so freaking large, you're both bound to be satisfied with something. And of course, the portions are huge too."
Annette D.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,11,6,5.0,12/19/2014,"Even during the busy holiday party season, this restaurant was able to accommodate our small baby shower. We arrived at opening with many customers ready as the doors were opened. We were sat immediately at a perfect table for our party. Server came by promptly and helped with appetizers and drinks. Excellent service by Matthew throughout our meal. Refills and meals came at a perfect pace for our celebration. The manager, Jen, stopped by twice to see how we were doing. Everyone was helpful and the food was delicious!"
Nick A.,"Los Angeles, CA",541,522,2033,5.0,2/8/2013,"What can I say. Cheesecake Factory is always a sure thing. I've been to lots of 'em. Great choice if you're going with a group of people because they offer so many different kinds of food...and it's all good. The only thing about this location is the parking is kinda' lame. It's a long walk from the parking garage to the restaurant. They are exact opposite ends. It's a brisk 5-10 minute walk to get there from the parking garage, I'd guess it's close to 1/4 mile from the lot to the restaurant if you're near the back of the  parking garage.  I can't stand this parking garage. The spaces are super narrow. I guess they figure everyone is driving a golf cart or a clown car.  That's not the Cheesecake Factory's fault though. They validate 2 hours of parking. I missed it by 5 minutes and had to pay $1."
Teresa S.,"Los Angeles, CA",212,34,92,3.0,10/16/2014,"All of there food is good. It's a great place if you have a large party because of its wide range of options. I love the Mac n cheese balls, artichoke dip w/ extra chips, crispy crab wontons, BBQ chicken salad, shrimp scampi and most of all... Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. They have a chicken option also. Then top it off with banana creme ChesseCake!  I know the menu like the back of my hand. Ol' high school fav."
Jody E.,"Santa Clarita, CA",130,120,15,1.0,3/20/2014,"Love the food but the wait is horrific. One star until they decide to respect customers and allow us to make dinner reservations. The whole, ""Too many people don't show up for their reservation."" excuse is bogus. If I don't show up after 15 minutes, I go to the end of the line. If I don't show up at all or cancel within 15 minutes, you charge my credit card $50. Very simple. Haven't been there in over two years because of this silly policy. Life's too short. Taking my business elsewhere-- AGAIN."
Carol F.,"N HOLLYWOOD, CA",0,4,,2.0,11/8/2015,Always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory but hadn't gone in a while and was very disappointed.   Portions were much smaller than before and the quality was downhill. I'll give it another try at some point bit its not what it was.
Nita F.,"Los Angeles, CA",218,56,15,5.0,5/16/2014,I love Cheesecake Factory! And this is probably my favorite location. All the waiters/waitresses are super attentive and nice. My fav plate is the crispy chicken costelleta. But honestly all their food is great.  Oh if you haven't had their fried Mac and cheese try it! Their margaritas and piña coladas are delicious . :))
Bonnie A.,"Newport Beach, CA",28,26,34,5.0,10/9/2015,"Always on point. Every CCF I've been to, never disappoints. Food is ALWAYS consistently good. I often ask for special extras or deletions and my servers always meet and exceed my expectations. I find it fun to order something different, but I do have my favorites. Sweet Corn Tamalitas, Evelyn's Pasta w/ chicken, BBQ Chicken Chop Salad... And don't get me started with Cheesecake. But my true favorite dessert is the Lemoncello Cake."
Jamil B.,"Commerce Charter Township, MI",1,6,,4.0,7/3/2016,"Although I'm not a big fan of franchise restaurants with menus the size of the holy bible, but surprisingly the food was very good. The service was better. Our server Jeff was very pleasant and caring, he was very knowledgeable of the menu and very efficient. The cheesecakes were awesome"
James S.,"Canyon, TX",4,154,107,5.0,8/6/2015,Went with the Mac & Cheese burger and fries.  Total carb overload but it was great! Took home the 30th anniversary chocolate cake cheese cake which was all you can imagine it to be.  Wonderful b-day dinner with wonderful people.
Brittany B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",191,1064,133,4.0,3/14/2015,"This is an easy choice after viewing a movie at the Arclight. It's best at an off-time to avoid crowds. We went at 4:00 on a Saturday and only waited a few minutes. The menu has enough to please everybody. I opted for the Pasta Carbonara, without chicken. They brought it with chicken anyway, which I don't like because then they get skimpy on the bacon. They graciously took it back and remade it with extra bacon. It was amazing! So even though they made a mistake, they made it right swiftly."
Heather W.,"San Diego, CA",1671,906,2600,2.0,2/8/2012,"there is a running joke in my family that every time we get together for a celebration meal...i come back here and talk crap about the place. well family - im sorry! i wish it would stop happening. i dont go out of my way to write less-than-stellar reviews. its been a disappointing coincidence :/ mediocre with a splash of insult pretty much sums it up. and maybe that should be the descriptor for most chain restaurants, to be honest, and expected. but with the cheesecake factory especially, ive continued to regret eating their non-dessert concoctions. part of me realizes it was a bit silly to go and order a salad. but hey, specialty salads can be good! they have this delightful ""skinnylicious"" menu boasting low calories and a light meal was all i wanted. the tortilla chicken salad sounded perfect (especially since i--a simpliton---made a pretty bangin' version). hello giant pile of lettuce! hello sad 3 pieces of chicken hidden way below pile of lettuce (im not even lying...look at the pic of how ginormous it is with absolutely no substance). sad, flavorless, unappealing. and charged something like $12. quite possibly the worst and most insulting salad ive ever consumed. had potential if they hadnt cheaped out on the main ingredients. HEY HEARS A THOUGHT: instead of making the size absolutely ridiculously big with filler lettuce - make it NORMAL with a few more pieces of chicken. and while we are at it - take 2 bucks of the price to make it actually appropriate. because the price tag is inflated right along with the cheap iceburg lettuce.  oh but great play indeed finding the most effective way to profit off your menu items - in true chain restaurant form. im guessing this cost *maybe* $2 in ingredients since its made up of iceburg (the cheapest lettuce with zero nutrients) and tortilla strips. come for the cheesecake, stay for the cheesecake. nothing else."
Ciara G.,"Frenchtown, NJ",187,1212,7583,4.0,2/8/2010,"I think i have said it before but I'll say it again anyway, Cheesecake Factory is probably the only major chain restaurant out there where you know what to expect and what you will get no matter what location you dine at. Consistency is key and that is the only way they are able to pull off their huge menu so well.  Tonight I had something old and something new.  Something old: Crispy Orange Chicken. The presentation was different from what I remembered but it tasted the same as it did when I had it probably over 5 years ago. Chicken was crispy and juicy. Rice was steamed perfectly. Veggies were fresh and crispy and cooked just as perfect as the rice. Orange sauce was zesty and sweet and there was just the right amount of it.  Something new was the Mini Corn Dogs for $4.95 off their new Small Plates menu. Being Cheesecake Factory, the only thing small or mini about this Corn Dog dish was the price. Sweeetttt! Jes ordered the Four Cheese Pasta and I stole a few bites and it was quite yummy. I like how the use the tiny small penne noodles instead of the standard size ones.  Jeremy was our server and he was great. Water glasses were kept filled through our whole meal and we didn't even have to ask or look around for him to do so once. Did a great job at trying to sell us his personal fav Dutch Apple Cheesecake but we had to pass since we already had milk on the mind. They validate parking so bring your ticket in and remember to stop by the host stand before you leave."
Caitlin C.,"Los Angeles, CA",408,10,,2.0,11/2/2015,"The service was so poor I created a yelp account to convey how disappointed I am with this branch. My work traditionally chooses this location for work dinners and after the hostess was extremely rude and abrupt, the service extremely slow, and the poor condition of the bathroom, we will probably change that location for our parties. The only redeeming quality was that the tex mex egg rolls are delicious and it looks like they updated their recipe to improve upon them as well. Also, my friend is a strict vegetarian and her food was covered in chicken, will not be coming to this branch anytime soon."
Gregg M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,27,4,1.0,4/17/2015,"Admittedly not a fan of chain food, but had enjoyed this place from time to time when in the area -- until our most recent visit, during which not only was one of our glasses (from the bar) dirty when it arrived with a drink in it, but so was every silverware roll-up at our table... Along with the four other roll-ups (silverware) we grabbed (trying to find clean ones) from another table. Insult to injury? Although the manager came by and apologized, we weren't comped anything. Don't get me wrong, we weren't looking for free food. But would it have hurt their budget to offer a piece of cheesecake or buy us a drink for good measure? Consistently dirty utensils (and glass) is disgusting."
Dianna A.,"Burbank, CA",2,12,,2.0,10/19/2015,"Had dinner last week with my friends. Ordered Hibachi stake which came out burned... Besides took out left overs, and next day found a piece of burned tooth pick or something like that in my meat... Will never go back to this location..."
