Hannah K.,"Glendale, CA",407,313,239,1.0,1/9/2014,"What happened here!? I used to choose this location over the one by Topanga for the better service, but I was really disappointed the other night.  It was a Monday, and they weren't empty, but the food came out ridiculously slow. What should have been about an hour and a half meal turned out to be two hours and 30 minutes.  The drink I ordered had no alcohol and I had to wait about 20 minutes to even have the waitress spare me a glance so I could flag her down and ask to have an extra shot put in.  And lastly it was my mom's birthday, and I told another server in secret (since ours disappeared for so long) and she forgot to tell ours so no candles or singing for us. This probably annoyed me the most. Too many things went wrong for me to want to return anytime soon. The food is good, but so is the food at the other locations. Skip this one."
Omar M.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,6,,4.0,5/12/2016,had the four cheese pasta for lunch and the macaroni balls w my girlfriend and it was great. not busy during lunch hours
Nahal K.,"Los Angeles, CA",612,389,199,1.0,1/13/2015,"What's going on cheesecake? I have visited this place a few times in the last couple of months and the service is getting worse by every visit. This last encounter, we weren't even greeted and our waters didn't come until our appetizers did. Also, I ordered a gluten free dish which didn't come out gluten free and the waitress tried to argue with us. Like really???? Honestly, with all the amazing restaurants nearby, I keep giving them another chance. I'm okay with not coming here for a while. The calories, service and lack of attention is just not worth it."
Forevermemorable F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",16,496,1497,5.0,1/25/2014,They treat you right here.  Good service and good food!  Lousy wait!  Plan on waiting 45 minutes during dinner time!
Kyra J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,1,1.0,9/27/2015,Sitting here at cheese cake factory I remember why I stopped coming here in the first place. This time I ordered Stake I waited almost 30 min for it come come out and they brought it to me COLD. I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE UPSET! Do you think they apologized to me? Nope! Just took it away and said another will be out..... 15 more min I wait for my food. Last time I came for breakfast and got cold waffles. The only thing good at this place is the cheese cake. Really disappointed I'm the Cheese Cake Factory
David A.,"Los Angeles, CA",144,20,2,2.0,4/20/2014,"My food and my wife's meals were decent....and it stops there. The waitress definitely did not want to be there. She took our drink order, food order, and all other requests while she was walking away from us and heading to another table. Not sure if she was in a rush, or if she just didn't care, but it was obvious (and really bad). Unfortunately, our daughter didn't want eat her food and we asked it to be boxed up. We ended up receiving HALF of the food that was on her plate in her to-go box. Not sure if that was incompetence, laziness, or what....but this place is definitely going downhill fast."
Mayram T.,"TARZANA, CA",45,33,18,1.0,1/26/2015,I used to love this place. I still love food there. But I'm not going to come back here just cause of bad service. Never come back!
Timmy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,,2.0,9/25/2015,"As a former server, bartender, and manager of a restaurant no one can be more understanding than I am when it comes to restaurants and the issues that come with them.  Wednesday 9/23 on the patio around 8pm I must say Cheesecake Factory you fell so very short of what I would call acceptable especially from such a large chain.  Greet time-Eh, wait time for drinks-eh, nothing really to complain or write home about. Crab cakes came out COLD... not lukewarm... not marginally cold... COLD. They had been sitting for quite some time the patio is not on the other side of the city. To the servers credit he did get us new ones.  Food- how 5 people can not get their order to all come out at the same time is pretty insane to me. A party of 10, 20, 30? Ok I get it. But how do 2 people get their meal, then 2 to 3 minutes later the other 2... and of course my meal is no where to be found. About 3 minutes before the food started to arrive we ordered 2 more drinks, now there are 4 plates, no drinks, and no server to be found anywhere on the patio. This goes on for an addition 5 minutes or so until a manager comes over apologizes and lets me know my meal will be right out.  The server still is no where to be seen until he comes with my drink... note to server if your kitchen fails you (allegedly) I would be pretty damn sure that the customer had ANYTHING else I could possible get him until his food arrives.  Even after all that sure I was not a happy camper but I didn't drive home thinking to myself (man I can't wait to fill out a Yelp tomorrow) It wasn't until the next day when I go to eat my leftovers (boxed by the server, bags handed to each individual person) that I realize captain genius handed me my girlfriends bag and obviously mine to someone else.  FAIL."
Meg M.,"Griffith Park/Los Feliz, Los Angeles, CA",363,13,3,5.0,11/20/2015,Polly was amazing. A true example of hospitality. She made our experience amazing wonderful and was very informative on the menu. Thank you Polly we will be back and request your section.
Desarey G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,34,2,1.0,6/28/2015,Very unfortunate how horribly managed this Cheesecake is now. Food is always delicious but the customer service is awful. I would write about our last experience (which was last Wednesday) but I'm too pissed off to even begin writing it.
Lee S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,,4.0,10/20/2015,"Yes I know, chain restaurant, etc. But I do a lot of take out from the place and one thing they do really well is burgers. Honestly, not much more than what you would spend at a fast food place, you get a bigger and better burger. The only bad thing I can say about this location is the location. I wish it was in a more convenient spot."
Kira L.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,442,164,4.0,8/8/2012,"Consistently good and reliable. I've been to this CF location multiple times, and service has always been great. I spotted Miley Cyrus here in the past (before she got huge), and it's a popular locale for the younger crowd.  My favorites are the Tex Mex Eggrolls & Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Both dishes, full of flavor.  The restaurant is clean and spacious, and the wait can get long on weekend nights, but weekdays are usually fine.  Whenever I go to Sherman Oaks Galleria, CF is usually where I go for a meal. Bigger menu, more variety = better times."
Lee F.,"Encino, CA",222,437,1558,4.0,8/5/2012,"I was here on a Saturday (8/04/12) and the place was not super busy.  Still, service was kinda slow.  I had the BANG BANG CHICKEN & SHRIMP.  It was a good mix of chicken and shrimp with a dash of thai  spice added to it.  It is not  too spicy. For desert I had the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake.  it is a big cake with layers of chocolate and cheesecake in between. Overall, I had a good time here."
Sandra L.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",0,14,,4.0,11/27/2016,"I live down the street from this Cheesecake Factory in Sherman Oaks and have been going here for years. Since this place is busy most of the time (and can be LOUD) I find take out works much better. I strongly suggest calling in your order (most orders are ready within 20 minutes) and then use the temporary (white zone) parking spots on Ventura Blvd which is right next to the side entrance of the restaurant. The take out counter is right there when you enter this way so getting in and out is a breeze. The food is consistently excellent, though I suggest you check your order before you leave as occasionally they will make a mistake. Customer service is always pleasant and while the food is a little pricey, it's not unreasonable for the quality of the product. I recommend the four cheese pasta and the cobb salad (minus the egg) with balsamic dressing. These two items can also be had on the lunch menu before 5pm. The chicken marsala and chicken madera are both excellent dishes but not sure if they are worth nearly $20. And of the course, the cheesecake...my favorite is the white chocolate raspberry truffle--YUMMY!"
Jonathan O.,"Lake View Terrace, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,4,4.0,3/15/2015,"The menu is so huge so it makes it difficult to pick something, specially for first timers. Overall the food is great. The service is amazing. And there is not much of a wait time."
Jessica P.,"Castaic, CA",1,56,10,5.0,8/12/2014,"Fried Mac n cheese. Enough said. Okay we could also say they have amazing bread and incredible cheesecake, obviously."
Leishka M.,"Anaheim, CA",1,11,10,1.0,3/3/2015,The girls at the front desk are horrible and I mean HORRIBLE. The waiter was nice the firecracker salmon was way to sweet. The steak I ordered medium rare was WELL DONE AND BURNED ON TOP.  Now I am alone in a table and I don't like acting like a bitch so i paid and left but this was completely horrible. I do not recommend this cheesecake factory at all.
Jade N.,"North Hollywood, CA",2,107,12,1.0,3/27/2016,"Eating options are kinda limited at the Sherman oaks galleria, and my husband and I were going to see a movie there. We decided on Cheesecake Factory, even though my gut said not to. We got in quick, and the menu is giant! It's super crowded and you kinda feel like your a sardine in a very noisy can. Anyway our waiter comes gets us drinks says he'll be right back...20 mins later...entrees ordered, 30 mins later, no entree and empty drinks, have not seen our waiter to ask for refills. All the other waiters fly by as I try to flag one down. 10 more mins, ok food come, a different waiter spills hot grave on my husband, responds, ""oh I didn't know it was spilling."" Cleans it up and scurried away before we could ask for refills or anything else. We are shoveling our food in our faces so we can get to our movie. Our waiter finally comes...to give the bill to the table next to us, without even looking at us, he turns away. I had to Flagg him down to ask for a refill and tobacco. Refills come 5mins later, no tobacco. At this point I just hand him my credit card and ask for the bill. The bill came back immediately. I still have him 20% tip even thought it was a horrible experience and a horrible server. I am sure he was just super busy, but for the price, cheap quality of the food, and the service...never again cheese cake factory.  On a side note: I saw something kinda gross, my they were clearing the table next to us, busser pulls a dirty rag out of his apron and wipes down the table, then puts clean silverware right on the surface of the table. How is that keeping the utensils clean? My suggestion is if you decide to go there, as for a new set, because it doesn't look like they really clean the table top from previous customers before they put the silverware you put in your mouth on it."
Annalou L.,"Westwood, Los Angeles, CA",891,103,24,5.0,5/7/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! So this location doesn't differ from any other, in my opinion. Great decor, great food, great date place since i feel like this location has a good amount of tables for two. Lol Sherman oaks galleria in general is a clean shopping/restaurant area, right next to the freeway. You can get parking validation at the Cheesecake Factory!"
Paul G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,4.0,5/23/2016,Good food.  Good service.  Good price.  I love going here after the movies.  Great cheesecake.
