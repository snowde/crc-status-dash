Cat C.,"Los Angeles, CA",151,11,5,1.0,12/1/2014,"I'm definitely done with cheesecake factory. Tonight the chef claimed he made me a plate of steamed green beans.. Straight BS... I don't eat butter on a regular basis so I'm very sensitive to it. I know what it taste like, ESPECIALLY on my vegetables. I brought it to the bartender's attention and he supposedly took them back. He came back with the same damn plate of ""steamed"" green beans... The chef took butter smothered green beans and dropped them in boiling water hoping the butter would rinse off. It didn't completely and the oily residue on my hands and on my plate wasn't enough for them to be honest, so whatever. I'm not coming back EVER. I plan to share this with my friends... This place uses about 20lbs of oil and butter on food anyway daily, so I expected them to be honest about their ""technique"" to make things healthier. I'm a health professional so thank God I'm now wise enough to not go back and caution my friends who aren't ignorant to what STEAMED vegetables actually taste like and make sure they are aware to avoid this place at all cost."
RJ J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,2.0,4/30/2016,"Poor customer service!!! We love cheesecake factory, but won't go back to this location! !! 3 of our plates came, we finished our meal and we asked waitress  what happened to  the 4th dish, she went to check on it after 20 min came with my daughters plate saying that  they were  busy and green beans take a long time to cook, we asked for manager and she wasn't any better, attitude  sucked!! She said she would comped her dish then when we got the bill they charged us for the  green beans! !"
Vanessa M.,"TARZANA, CA",128,327,41,5.0,6/10/2012,"Been coming to this location for years, one of my fav restaurants. This one is located in the galleria, right at the corner next to the fountain and Urban Home. I come here often before catching a movie upstairs. Never had to wait over 20 min. (and that's when it was PACKED). Service is always prompt and nice. Last time I went my mom and I were rushing before a movie... although I hate when customers rush me, our waiter was so nice and understood and accommodated everything for us.  As far as food choices the menu is like 20 pages long. The bread they bring you (esp. the brown one) is delicious. I always ask for balsamic vinegar or vinegrette on the side and it's enough to hold you over before the food arrives. There are appetizers and small bites for less than 10$ to get you started as well. Some plates I usually get that are always good are the blackened chicken sandwich and the jambalaya pasta. Warning: the desserts are MASSIVE but also delicious. Cheesecake of course, is also great. The decor is also unique and adds a lot of character. In my opinion it is one of the most recognizable and aesthetically pleasing features of the place. Come here if you're looking for a nice restaurant that's more upscale than others yet has food options for all kinds of tastes."
Elke M.,"Los Angeles, CA",183,103,63,5.0,5/4/2014,It's just such a good place to go no matter what you are in the mood for. No matter what time a day they always have what your want. Love coming here!!! Sour apple martinis r sooooo good!!! Yum
Jeffrey M.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,1,,1.0,2/14/2015,"OMG!!  Okay, the food is good, that's a given.  But, getting a table and being treated like a person ... that's another story! got there at 3pm for early dinner.  Told it was a 20 minute wait.  after 35 minutes, I went up and asked them  They said that they had paged me (I was sitting nearly infront of them!).  I handed them the pager and said it's not working then!  Why didn't they call our name?  No answer, the girl took the pager, and handed it to another girl.  That was the last time anyone spoke to me!  I kept asking ""Can someone please acknowledge that I'm standing here asking questions?""  NO ONE DID.  I wasn't yelling, I was polite.  So after another 5 minutes, a man walked up and said we can sit you in the bar (which has open seating anyway).  I said, we've been waiting for longer than promised and no one will tell me why they gave me a faulty pager? Or why I wasn't being addressed at all.  he apologized and then sat us outside which was fine.  We sat there waiting for someone to even bring us water. Needless to say, there are other wonderful restaurants in the Los Angeles area.  I WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN!  EVER!!!  I've never felt so ignored and although our actual waitress was lovely (once she showed up), even the food came out wrong (sigh)!. Oh, I did complain but nothing came of it."
Mariah S.,"Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, CA",88,11,11,5.0,5/3/2015,"I live around the corner, so I've been here a few times. The service and food has always been great, except the hostesses always seem disinterested. I have to mention though - Alex D was our server, and he was wonderful!!"
Patty And Sergio R.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,364,5,2.0,10/11/2014,"Late Friday night,  Hunny called for a reservation and according to their policy, reservations are not allowed. We had a 30 min wait however we were sat in the middle of two parties. I personally didn't enjoy my dinner due to the woman who kept walking in and out from the long booth where we sat, I had to see her ugly butt almost knocking over my water.  Our waiter was great, I forgot his name but he came to our table very often to make sure everything was good and We do like that."
Renzzo A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/13/2015,The worst  service I have ever had. Walked out after waiting more than 30 minutes and still never got a waiter. Looks like someone didnt get the part at the audition. Never going  back.
Rebeka M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,31,9,5.0,8/9/2015,Really great service at cheesecake as well as food. The bread they give you before the meals is the best bread I've ever had i get full on it. The meals are very large portions so easy and great to share with others and a nice place to eat whatever the occasion.
Aram T.,"Porter Ranch, CA",416,158,503,4.0,1/8/2013,It's the CHEESECAKE FACTORY! How could it ever disappoint? Other than the fact that they do not take reservation and you would need to wait for some time on the weekends to be seated. The menu is literally a book.. so you know you will find something that will satisfy your taste buds and stomach.
Vanessa G.,"Arleta, CA",0,15,1,2.0,5/14/2015,I'm so disappointed. I've been coming here for many years and came for mothers birthday. I did love the fried mac and cheese and my passion fruit margarita. I ordered the fettucine alfredo with chicken added and ever since I've felt nauseous and sick to my stomach I am not even getting out of bed because I feel that crappy. I might give up coming here...not worth the result.
Linda L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,14,,4.0,10/21/2015,The food is good... Staff are great... Location is the best ... Right on 405 fwy ... Like everything about this place just needs more of service... That's why I gave 4 star
Penny L.,"New York, NY",21,10,4,2.0,7/30/2015,"The food was great, the service was mediocre at best. It was my cousin's 35th birthday and we decided to go to The Cheesecake Factory for the variety and the atmosphere. After waiting for over an hour (with a reservation) we were finally told that we could not be seated until more staff arrived. I understand the difficulty that comes with working in a restaurant, but the hostesses were unhelpful and borderline disrespectful. Living right down the street, I wish I had a better experience. No more parties here!"
Richard K.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,4,,5.0,9/1/2015,"Great restaurant. I recommend coming here after lunch hour where it is empty. If nothing is very appealing, don't worry and don't blame it to the manager, just go to another restaurant. Food is great and a recommended restaurant. Always nice servers (when it's empty)."
Ken Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",48,57,5,1.0,12/7/2015,"After coming here for the 6th time, I will not be returning to this location. Slow service, food is painfully slow coming out especially if you have children. We came here recently on a sunday evening at 4:15 and sat in the patio and it wasn't busy. We waited for 45 mins for our food to come out, if you have children you will know that 45 mins is an eternity for them and they will not stay still and start screaming. We had to pack up the food once it came immediately and leave since I didn't want to disturb the other diners. Was the food good in the end? NO. Wife ordered the jambalaya which was cold, brown rice was hard and undercooked. I ordered the Cubano with a side of sweet potato fries which by the way were cold and soggy, the sandwich was bland as well. I just don't understand why the kitchen here is so FREAKING SLOW??? I paid $70 total which included tip and one drink, for basically mediocre cold food??? Does this make sense?? I thought it was a fluke and gave this location a few chances and they are just damn slow. I'm not sure why other reviewers are raving about the service here."
Nina M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",32,72,152,1.0,10/20/2014,"It was 3:34 on Monday 10/20/14.  It was not very busy in the restaurant.  We were seated in a booth by a Servers Station.  There was a Blond Female Server having a lengthy conversation with the booth of men seated behind us. After she finished speaking with them she then proceeded to join another female server at the station and proceed to have a lengthy conversation with her.  Meanwhile my companion and I were sitting, with menus closed clearly waiting to order, as we had more than enough time to make our selections. We waited and waited.  Finally I had to interrupt her personal conversation with her coworker and ask if one of the two was our server. She then replied that she was our server. I then had to request for her to take my drink and food order as I was thirsty and hungry equally.   She took our order brought us our drinks and went back to the booth behind us to continue talking with the group of men sitting there.  We could not tell if she knew them but either way was overly attentive to them.  Again while having another lengthy conversation with them one of her other tables got up and reminded her she was waiting on her refill. Instead of immediately going to get her drink she told her ""just a minute"". The lady walked back to her table. Server continued with her convo and then eventually went to get the ladies drink refill. She passed by our table several times but never offered to get us Iced Tea refills.  We, again had to bring to her attention that we needed refills.  I wish my party of two held the same attention for her as the booth of men behind us did for her.  I then believe we would have received the Quality of  service we should have received instead of what we got today.  I'm very disappointed with my visit today at your location as I frequent your location, the Pasadena location and Rancho Cucamonga location and have never had to bring up the subject of Poor Service before this instance. FINALLY the Server who provided us with this bad experience was : ""Catherine C"" this how her name appears on our check. Check #0254"
Donna G.,"Los Angeles, CA",576,580,1164,4.0,11/30/2014,"Stopped in Cheesecake Factory for Happy Hour after the movie. The soup of the day was Creamy mushroom - and it had more than one time of mushroom in it. It was delicious.   I also got the Vietnamese Shrimp Egg Roll, which I kind of chopped up into a salad. There were noodles and veggies inside and it was also delicious. And ant Happy hour prices you can't beat it. My only complaint was when I first arrived there was a problem seating me. I wanted to sit in the bar area, but at a low table. I guess the waitress was trying to fill out the back section of the bar. And I bluntly said ""I am not sitting back here."" She started to say something, and I repeated ""I am not sitting in the back section."" And then I pointed to a table and said ""I want to sit there."", and she said there was no waiter for that area. So finally on my third try we found a table for me to sit.  I should have just taken the hostesses first seating choice, because it turned out that the women who came in later and sat next to me, had a cold and was coughing throughout her meal. I was sitting there wishing I had taken the hostesses for choice for a table and sat in the back."
AJ R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,275,,3.0,7/21/2015,"Your typical chain restaurant.  They do a lot of things good, but nothing that sticks out, I will even venture to say not even the cheesecake.  Yes, they have tens of different flavors, but nothing to write home about. The food is tasty and priced decently, but again, it is always packed, the service is average and is a good place to meet up with large groups."
Sean G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/29/2016,"Worst dinning experience ever! To make it worst, we came here to celebrate my sons 10th Birthday and it left the worst taste in our mouths, literally too. We waited 2 hours to sit down. After 1 1/2 hour wait, we checked on the status of our table. We were told our 2 tables were being put together. 40 mins later we get seated at a booth. What happened to the tables that were being put together???? We didn't know and apparently they didn't either since they had no real explanation. By this point, 2 hours went by so we're now forced to rush our orders as we had somewhere else to be. Then the bread comes out, but guess what? No white bread. There was no white bread available. We had to wait 10 mins for some white bread. When the food comes out, it was not what most of us expected. 1) Kids spaghetti & meatballs = 1 meatball. Really? 1 freaking meatball? 2) my rice was so undercooked & dried. 3) my brother in laws pasta was rock hard!!!! To try to make all this up, they offer us a Cheesecake. But get this, they only offered 3 slices for a group of 9!!!!!!!! We requested they accommodate the kids and not offer the adults anything. They're response was ""we can cut the slices in half, but each kid cannot get their own slice""??? Really!!!!!! End result, we got the check and got the F out of there. They gave us a small Cheesecake, but we didn't even bother signing to my son or allowing him to open his presents since being there 1 more minute was just unbearable. I'll never return to this establishment as I was never even a fan of this place to begin with. We only came here cause my son wanted Cheesecake, but we took their cake and tossed it in the garbage. We're sure they just spit in it or something so we didn't trust eating that crap. Worst place, worst experience and probably worst birthday my son ever had. Way to go Cheesecake Factory!"
Philip P.,"San Fernando, CA",1,10,,5.0,8/19/2015,"Great service from Chris Goodie. From start to finish he was very attentive. Definitely next time we come here, we hope he'll be our server again."
