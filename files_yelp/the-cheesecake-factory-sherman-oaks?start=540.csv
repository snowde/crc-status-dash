Oliver L.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,36,5,5.0,5/17/2015,Tonight my girlfriend and I dined al fresco. Our waiter jaymie greeted us with such charm and joy. He helped guide us to the perfect order. Throughout the meal he made us feel welcome and always kept my Arnold Palmer refilled. Can't wait to come back.
David P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,1,5.0,8/15/2014,"Excellent meal last night at the Cheesecake Factory.  Had the spicy cashew chicken over white rice.  I'm not usually a fan of ""spicy"" but this had such great flavor, that I couldn't resist.  It was a large portion (I should have taken some of it home, but I ended up eating the whole thing while I was there). Couldn't decide between the Chocolate Tuxedo Cheese Cake or the Dutch Apple Streusel Caramel Cheese Cake for dessert - so I got them both! ( I was with friends so we shared).  If I'm going to have a heart attack, at least I'll go out smiling. Great service from the waiter, and very reasonable price. Always love this place - never had a bad meal."
Rob I.,"Los Angeles, CA",277,10,11,5.0,2/5/2015,I dine at Cheesecake Factory regularly in WeHo and stopped in at this location tonight. The food was great and even though there was an issue with the timing on the flatbread the bartender Erica was very attentive and involved a manager who comped it off the check. Great service and overall a great experience.
Bill G.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/11/2015,"DRINKS BANKRUPT YOU AND TASTED HORRIBLE! Order the Sangria wine for a sweet, upbeat taste and got for $11.50 (no price listed and my fault that I should need to ask??) foul tasting purple stuff full of ice and about worth a buck. No replacement by waiter and then coffee came with soured cream that was pukable."
Maria D.,"Valley Glen, CA",45,30,,5.0,12/6/2013,Great take out menu ! Really easy to order over the phone . Tina is awesome over the phone and when she greets you while you pick up your food . If you have any complaints about your food or order she never hesitates to make everything better !!!  Thursday soup of the day : tortilla soup is delicious . They'll always give you extra bread if you requested it . Stuffed mushrooms are amazing !  Great customer service and fast service as well !!
Gina G.,"Van Nuys, CA",99,154,443,3.0,5/2/2012,"Yummy Yummy.....! For All the Cheesecakes here...! Its Cheesecake Heaven I would say... But for me though: Its the Fresh Strawberry Shortcake with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream.. I could come here just for that...! And my favorite dish for Dinner is: Terriaki Chicken. I try other dishes but that continues to be my Favorite..! My Favorite Drink is The Typhoon Punch, one of these and I am ready to have a blast...! The Negative: Is that there is always an eternal wait to be seated...!"
Jackie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,239,12,5.0,7/19/2016,"We have been to many Cheesecake Factory locations, and even this one several times.  But last nights experience really stuck out.  We had a party of six and everything was top notch.  All of their food is delicious.  They have a huge selection and even a menu the size of a normal restaurant that is all low calorie dishes.  We loved the skinny chinese chicken salad and the burgers are so tasty.  The server knew everything in detail about the menu and answered all of our questions.  The bread they bring you before the meal is sooooo good that you kind of fill up before the meal.  We also had the Thai lettuce wraps that we have been having for at least ten years and love.  The food is just so consistently good and a good value for the amount of food they give you.  We have had cheesecake before and they are to die for.  My favorite part is the homemade whipped cream on them, but you can't go wrong with any of them (especially the banana cream!).  My son's entree was like 5 minutes late the manager (Cameron) came over and apologized profusely asking if he wanted anything in the meantime.  He didn't and the food even came out a couple minutes after that.  It was above and beyond.  Everyone kept asking if we needed anything and they were fabulous.  He even offered to comp the late meal which wasn't necessary but appreciated.  A lot of restaurants don't get every meal out on time but this was the most accommodating I have ever seen a manager be about it so I had to write about it.  He was so friendly too.  #cheesecaketastic."
Jane C.,"Henderson, NV",19,11,4,2.0,8/4/2015,"Our waitress was very prompt and friendly however, we ordered nachos and requested it with beef. When they came to the table my husband said they tasted funny and upon further inspection the beef was RAW on the inside. Raw as in red not a little pink, red. He was so turned off he didn't eat the rest of it and just requested it be taken off. A manager came over and wanted to ""educate us in how ground beef is prepared"" and ""for next time if we wanted it well done we need to request it that way"" from my culinary understanding there isn't a measure of done vs well done when it comes to ground meats. When you grind a meat you are dispersing the bacteria living on the outside of the meat throughout it, thereby nullifying cook times cause the bacteria is all over it. So long story short, the only for sure safe ground meat is a fully cooked one.  There is no ordering it well done! This place needs to educate their kitchen staff or they will make someone sick! Very disappointed."
Shanel J.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,13,,5.0,1/23/2015,OMG!!! One of our favorite places to eat!!! The food here is soooooo good!!! Been to other cheesecake factories but this one is the best (in my opinion ) prices are good too!
Karlea B.,"North Hollywood, CA",96,31,11,5.0,9/24/2013,"Delicious ofcourse. Things seem pretty organized and clean cut here. My server Hailey was super sweet, punctual, and knew her food items. She let me customize my meal with out rolling her eyes. Super sweet girl and always ontop of refills."
Robin P.,"Granada Hills, CA",6,4,,5.0,5/24/2015,"The food was amazing, the service was amazing and the Oreo milkshake is a spiritual experience! I would highly suggest this place!"
Jessica D.,"Inglewood, CA",3,36,38,4.0,3/5/2015,Had the chicken piccata and the dish might have been sitting out to long before being brought out to me so the noodles were super dry and stuck together. Waited for the waitress to come back but it took about 10 minutes and then another 5 minutes for her to bring my sauce by then almost everyone was finished eating in my party. The meal was good but the food was warm and not hot.
Bob F.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,18,,5.0,10/18/2014,"As usual, great food and awesome service from ""Zander"". Came here to celebrate my son's BDay and truly enjoyed the event. The garlic noodles was great. Will always consider this restaurant for a good time especially for special occasions."
Veronica G.,"West Hills, CA",7,10,2,1.0,8/27/2014,"Came here with my mother tonight to celebrate and had nothing but disrespect from an employee behind the bar. Our bartender Erica was splendid, however, her coworker Brian was extremely disrespectful and rude. He was chewing and chomping on a piece of gum while he was serving his guests and I confronted him about his sanitation violation. He immediately began to disrespect me with his sarcastic tone and words. He spit it out in front of me and left the bar. After about 2/3 minutes, he returned and popped in another piece of gum and began to over exaggerate chewing that piece. He approached us and said ""wow thank you! I hope you come in every time I work just to keep me in line!"" And stormed off. My mother and I are both chefs and currently work in health and sanitation departments. What this employee was doing was disgusting and against the health code. All I tried doing was help him save his job and the restaurants grade.  We ordered the Cuban rolls.... They were Awful. However, the potato tots and the French country salad were nice.  We will eventually return and hopefully Brian will be gum-less."
Rich G.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",0,10,,4.0,11/13/2013,Louisiana Chicken Pasta (i always get that) = 10/10 Fried Mac & Cheese balls = 9/10 Fried Calamari = 8.5/10 Buffalo sliders = 7/10 Staff = 9/10 Overall = 8.5/10
Alyssa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",142,32,2,4.0,12/4/2013,"So after my horrendous, horrible, awful, mind blowing experience I wrote to corporate.  About two weeks later I received a phone call and it was corporate. I cannot remember his name it believe it started with a J.... Anyways he was very nice and asked me to explain what had happened. Once again I relived THAT experience. (We will refer to him as J for future reference) ""J"" followed with many apologies and explained The Cheesecake Factories goal and customer outlook blah blah.  I appreciated the personal call because after two weeks I had assumed I wouldn't ever hear from them. ""J"" asked if it was okay to share what I had told him with the store in Sherman Oaks and I said that was fine. Then ""J"" offered to pay for my dry cleaning of the pants that were ruined and said he was going to be sending me a ""very generous"" gift card ($50 is what I received.)  The disappointment there is that $50 doesn't even pay for the two meals and drinks we had paid for the first time around. Oh well. Can't be to greedy. He told me to go back to the Sherman Oaks one and ask for the manager but to be honest I don't know if I will ever go to that place again without having my sense memory kick in with that horrible vomit smell. So I went to the one in the Marina and it was great. Thank god. Our server was attentive, had personality and boxed my food up for me to go. (The first place just put boxes in front of me) The view was fantastic we sat right on the edge of the patio overlooking the water. We ordered the crusted salmon (delicious!) and the chicken piccata (comes with noodles, which need a little more sauce but overall wonderful!)"
Tosucha J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,1,4.0,5/31/2015,"You can always count on Cheesecake Factory for good food.  At times the service is slow. However, it gets really crowed.  I like the energy there.  The servers are friendly and usually serve with a smile.  I am a regular at Sherman Oaks Cheesecake because I worked out at the gym in the galleria.  So me and my gyms friends go there often.   Its been pretty good when I go."
Samiye B.,"Woodland Hills, CA",22,27,,2.0,12/30/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat, but it seems every time I could to the one at the Sherman Oaks Galleria; I am disappointed. My family and I went there this past Saturday Dec 26 for dinner. We knew it was going to be busy so that was not an issue, but we sat for a while before someone came to greet us at our table. We ordered some appetizers, and the mac n cheese balls were all burnt so we ate one then asked the manager not to charge us because the food was burnt. she comes to the the table and starts inspecting the food at the table and making a scene instead of just taking it to the back. Then we ordered dinner, I ordered sliders for my little one from the kids menu which would be 2 sliders and fries, but she said do you want to make it deluxe and add fries? so I say okay not knowing it would increase the price, and add 2 more burgers which I did not want and lied about the fries....just to charge me more... our food was cold. She never brought us napkins, extra sauces.... I don't think I will be going back to this location any more... a RESTAURANT LIKE CHEESECAKE FACTORY, deals with crowds all the time so to see this quality of food it was very disappointing. We spent close to 200.00 dollars...oh and by the time we got the cheesecake it should have been called cheese shake."
Svetlana S.,"CHATSWORTH, CA",262,348,196,4.0,7/9/2013,"The four stars is mainly for the impeccable service we got here. We had a large party of about 12 people for a friend's bday. Ryan, our server, was AWESOME!! Kudos to him for being so helpful and attentive and not letting such a big group overwhelm him. He brought us water along with our drinks without us even having to ask him and brought out a little sundae for the birthday boy without so much as a peep from us. Located in the Sherman Oaks Galleria, so be prepared to wait. We had reservations and we still ended up waiting close to a half an hour. Keep in mind, they won't seat you until at least half of your party is there. They validate for parking. Food The food is ok here, nothing amazing in my opinion. I usually get the fried macaroni and cheese balls. They're the best thing I've had on the menu. My boyfriend got the tuna tartare appetizer, which was pretty yummy too.  Drinks The Georgia Peach was made to perfection. Not too sweet and just what I needed on a hot day. I definitely recommend it."
Neener M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",16,141,,4.0,1/28/2015,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon with my love; had outdoor dining as the wait was not as long as indoors.  Our server was good; unfortunately, we had waited a little too long to have them move over one of the umbrellas over as the sun was right in my man's face but other than that, we were stuffed as always!"
