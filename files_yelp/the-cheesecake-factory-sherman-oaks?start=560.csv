Alejandro T.,"San Francisco, CA",40,7,,5.0,5/26/2015,Always great service awesome food and nice environment i always take my family any occasion
David M.,"Westminster, CO",0,5,,4.0,11/23/2014,Overcrowded and somewhat cluttered is the only complaint. Went on a Wednesday as well. Seating location was like a Chinese market.  So packed. Love the Club sandwiches here.
Sivan C.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",116,10,1,4.0,9/23/2013,"Love the restaurant. But the wait time is killing me every time we decide to eat there!! Love the food, the service is good and quick,,,,,BUTTTTT....the wait.... Still going and eating there!"
Gleb G.,"West Covina, CA",550,110,202,4.0,11/26/2014,"The service was great. The waitress was very attentive on everything we needed. The food was good. My kids love this restaurant. Usually it is about a 40 min wait on weekends, this is the reason why i only go on weekdays. Overall it is a good place to go with your family."
Tomas C.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",3,77,18,3.0,2/16/2015,This franchise is a glorified Chili's or Hooters.. The food is as stale tasting as the bread. The food came out cold and the pasta tasted like a beach ball. The classic cheesecake at the end of the meal is the only reason I gave 3 stars. Ill definitely never go there again unless I'm drunk..
Tony P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",16,25,1,4.0,7/9/2014,I generally am a fan of cheesecake factory. This was located in Galleria I really like to setting very nice and clean. Our server was very nice and accommodating  Try the sliders they are very good and tasty.   I ordered the tiramisu cheescake here and was very good.  Outdoor seating here is nice.
Tony G.,"Woodland Hills, CA",92,27,,5.0,7/12/2015,Just love it here.  Great food excellent service.  Was taken here by parents for my birthday.
Kira P.,"Los Angeles, CA",185,79,186,4.0,11/16/2011,"For my Birthday in October my mom gave me a $50 gift card to The Cheesecake Factory.  I saved it for a special occasion.--- Our 11 month anniversary on 11/11/11 :) We called the night before and requested a reservation.  We were told that that night (a Friday) would be walk in only, we also found out that they stop seating at 12:30 am, which we thought was really cool since we are night owls anyway. We arrived at 9:30pm and were seated less than a minute later.   Our booth was a 2 seater on a main isle but almost all seats in this venue somehow maintain an intimate feel no matter where they are. My boyfriend was a bit indecisive about what drink to order and even though the waitress(Adriene) did seem busy at the time she was patient with him and was willing to explain the drinks to him.   Drinks Bf- Long Island Ice Tea (which he sent back after he had a few sips to add more soda because it was strong, not necessarily a bad thing ;) Me- Bud Light w/lime. Entree Bf- The Old Fashioned Hamburger.  He substituted the fries for broccoli (no charge). The runner brought the burger and said he would be right back with the broccoli.  He never returned.  Later when our waitress checked back with us we told her that the runner never came back with the broccoli.  She brought it to us soon after. The burger was huge and the amount of broccoli that was on the side was a very big portion. Me- A Factory Combination: Steak Diane(minus the mushrooms) & Herb Crusted Salmon w/mashed potatoes which I substituted for asparagus ($1.00 charge) I'm used to huge portions at The Cheesecake Factory and that is what you always hear about the place but I do have to say the combination for $19.95 with 6 nuggets of Steak Diane was a bit lacking in the steak side than what I had expected, but I do have to say it was very flavorful and juicy with a few caramelized onions on top and sitting in tasty Au Jus.  The Salmon was an ok size considering it was part of a combination but would have definitely been too small if it was in a meal of its own. All in all our experience was a good one.  Our server was attentive and had personality and patience to deal with me and my boyfriends requests, the food was very flavorful and our drinks were delivered promptly and met our expectations.   Our bill came out to $49.43 so that was awesome aswell. We totaled out the card by leaving the left over cents on the tip line and left a $12 cash tip.   It was a great topper to an awesome anniversary and I would love to go back some time, especially if I had another Gift Card ;)  LOL!"
Laura D.,"Los Angeles, CA",225,299,343,3.0,9/1/2014,"I love this place. The food is amazing. Lots & lots of choices! Outside seating. Located in the galleria. I come here on occasion. Never had a bad experience with my food however the service is not always up to par. I almost always have slow service, and loose sight of our waiter. My most recent visit was a few days ago with my friend. Our waitress was also disappearing. Took forever to get refills on our water. We had to grab other waiters as they walked by. When we first sat down I noticed dirty silverware. Was a little annoyed that we were seated first before a few people and they got served first. Really need to work on customer service."
Sandy S.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",7,33,16,3.0,3/4/2015,"Food is just okay.. hot wings were a good appetizer nothing special.  But the wait time is absolutely ridiculous. We got here on a Saturday at 6pm. We were told the wait was about 45min. We didn't get seated until 7:30pm. Don't say 45min, When it's well past the 45min. Not worth the wait for the quality of  food."
Sophia M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,10,,5.0,4/29/2014,"Appetizers 1)tuna tartar tastes fresh!!! 2)tex mex eggroll 3)lettuce wrap Main Chicken Madiera can share btw 2 peeps (most tender n flavorful chicken with melting mozzarella, asparagus, n mashed potatoes) *Drool*  Dessert Any cheesecake *May experience long wait~no reservations allowed (thumbs-down) BUT...gives you time to narrow down and select your food from the PAGESSSSSS of the menu they have*"
Simon M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,4,1,2.0,4/26/2015,"We were lovers of the cheesecake factory before, but we will never go back to this one. I understand that it was a busy Saturday night but to keep us waiting for 1 hour when they said 30 minutes is a bit ridiculous. When we were finally seated, we realized the silverware and plates were filthy and had it sent back for new ones. After the waiter took our order, we were never given bread! We had been waiting in the cold for 1 hour to be seated and not even some bread! He had offered it to other customers but not us....? After that, he just walked over and began to socialize with his co workers in a group of 3. Very unprofessional. When the food came(we ordered a pizza and pasta), the pasta was extremely undercooked. I understand that they leave it a bit undercooked but I couldn't even eat this pasta with my fork because it was so hard. Overall, not a good experience. It was my daughters birthday so I could not complain to the waiter as much as I wish I could have, but i still expected more from such a big name restaurant."
Lilit V.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,98,,5.0,2/2/2014,Always great food and good service. My favorite is their Steak Diane and Chicken combo. The only downside is the long walk to the car in cold weather. Otherwise highly recommended.
Victor A.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,1,5.0,5/26/2014,My Girlfriend loves this place! Good and friendly customer service! We always start with the guacamole and avocado egg rolls!! Margarita is a must!!! Specially the strawberry one. Try it! many plates to choose from and is not expensive at all! Good quality of food.
Dave F.,"Santa Monica, CA",301,1475,174,3.0,10/20/2011,"I walked over to this Cheesecake factory for lunch, as I wanted a salad. Fortunately, the server sent me to the lunch menu, then encouraged the lunch portion. Even so, the salads are really BIG! Ambiance was that of an older CKF with a layer of the Valley dirt. Ok, not really that bad....but, not great.  Service was great and there was no wait. The mango iced tea is pretty good and the salad was very average."
Marconi De M.,"Los Angeles, CA",102,454,5,1.0,5/11/2013,"I always was a huge fan of the taste, but as of today, will not return... Still taste good, but today I saw  the person at the balcony bare naked hands literally grabbing my cheesecake after cleaning stuff and I was shocked - when I complained about that, someone that looks to be manager or so came to me and said that they are no longer required to use gloves... in other words... they actually don't care... if the standard is low... let's keep... and keep charging high prices... that's DISGUSTING!!!! I will definitely spread the word..."
M V.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",30,60,1,1.0,8/14/2014,"Been here numerous times and we've noticed the quality of the food is really lacking.   Hamburger was tasteless with the toppings thrown on the plate, fries nothing to be excited about.  Orange chicken arrived dry with no sauce and worst yet, the food wasn't even warm.   We're done, sticking to other local places that are consistent."
Mikaela L.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,60,50,3.0,11/25/2013,"PROS: The food is always delicious and the portions are VERY generous. The waiters/waitresses are always very friendly and knowledgable of the menu. The decor is nice. Looks upscale enough for a date night, but comfortable enough for a family dinner. And the location is great, right on Ventura Blvd, next to the 405, and in the same mall as the Arclight Theatre.  CONS: There is always a wait and never any places to sit while you wait for your table. The lobby is very small, making it difficult to push through the crowd of people once your table is finally called. The hosts are never particularly friendly. The entire restaurant has a dysfunctional floorplan, you constantly have to dodge people and waiters on your way to/from your table and the restroom, all while trying not to knock food/drinks off other guests tables. OVERALL: Food is great! Restaurant needs to be renovated for a more functional floorplan and larger waiting area."
Francesca L.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",1400,1391,243,3.0,10/4/2011,"Yes, even Yelpers go to chains like Cheesecake Factory sometimes! It's great for a mixed crowd with different tastes and price points. I actually wasn't too hungry and opted to order from the ""small plates"" section. I had the beet & goat cheese arugula salad and a tuna tartare--served with wonton chips and sesame vinaigrette. Both were tasty and reasonably priced.  For dessert, the five of us were going to share the key lime cheesecake until the waiter told us about an off-menu mango key lime that would soon be out of the restaurant. I love mango and I already wanted key lime, so why not? It turned out to be a great suggestion, right amount of sweetness and tang! Overall a good experience at Cheesecake Factory."
Alicia G.,"Brooklyn, NY",330,500,134,4.0,4/7/2013,"If you know me, you know I don't frequent chain restaurants. That being said, I loves me some Cheesecake Factory. Everything is always well prepared, the service is always great and the food is always on point.  That being said ( I say that a lot in reviews!) I've been ordering the same thing from every CF since 1997- the portabella mushroom sandwich. It has always been on point and always delicious. Well, they took it off the menu a few years back, but you can still ask for it. That's what I love about the CF!!! I see why folks do go to chain restaurants, although this is like a gourmet chain restaurant, with good food that is consistent. When I'm back in Cali, I'll be back, or wherever I go!"
