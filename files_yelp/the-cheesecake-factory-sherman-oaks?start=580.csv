Andrew J.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,25,,5.0,4/12/2015,"Every dining experience I have had at The Cheesecake Factory has been a very positive one. Very attentive and professional servers, delicious meals, strong quality espresso and fabulous desserts. The (delicious home-made) whipped cream sometimes overpowers the marvelous desserts but this is more of a personal preference comment. You might have to wait twenty minutes for a table but it is worth the wait. Beautiful interior design and atmospheric lighting, as well, make for a very pleasurable dining experience. Highly recommended!"
Jason K.,"Encino, CA",35,7,9,4.0,2/4/2015,"For an appetizer, I'd highly suggest getting the Fire-Roasted Fresh Artichoke. As for the entree, I usually go with the Teriyaki Chicken. They will serve it boneless if you ask."
Jon D.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,71,109,3.0,1/8/2014,The service here is really bad. The food here is really good. When I came in there were a lot of people waiting for a table. I got a heated patio table pretty quick. The patio was flaming hot. My group just couldn't sit there. It took quite a while to get a table inside. When we did get a table we got our waters and waited and waited and waited. Finally the waiter came and we ordered appetizers. We got our appetizers(after a while) and ordered our food. You can probably guess how fast the food got to our table.      The food was so good. My appetizer was the fried Mac n cheese. It is one of the best things I've ever eaten. For my main course I ordered the fried shrimp platter. The shrimp was pretty good. The coleslaw was flavorless. My meal was pretty good.        This restaurant is service hell mixed with food heaven.

Kim J.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,176,63,5.0,9/14/2013,"Going away party for a friend where 8 of us got together on a Tuesday night. Our server Mary, was AMAZE-BALLS. Attentive, funny, informative. Definitely recommend for large groups. Plenty of meal options and fast service. Great staff."

Gita W.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,30,4,2.0,2/21/2015,"I've eaten at many CF's and I've always been impressed by their corporate standards and well-trained employees. The group at this particular CF seemed strained, overworked and understaffed.  I ate here on a Thursday night and they were busy!!! I had a large group with me (7 people) and we were told there was a 20-30 minute wait. Fine. Our buzzer went off fairly quickly, but then after turning it in, we waited another 10-15 minutes before getting seated. Overall, our wait time was 20-30 as promised, but how strange to have our buzzer go off and then receive no acknowledgements for another 10 minutes!! The hosts all seemed annoyed, busy and overwhelmed too which is never a good sign.  Once at the table, we were greeted by our server in a very strange way. She quite literally said she was tired and in the weeds. It was weird. She took our orders and everything came out correctly and considering how busy they were, in a pretty timely fashion. But only half the table received their food. And it was a solid 5 minutes before the other half arrived.  Later on, someone at our table knocked their ketchup ramekin off and it splattered all over the floor. Four employees walked through the mess before it was noticed and cleaned up. And believe me, we tried to catch their attention."
Ali T.,"Beverly Hills, CA",296,192,86,4.0,5/30/2014,"this is a nice location for cheese cake factory its on the corner of ventura and sepulveda right on the edge of galeria you get 2 hours of free parking with validation, but if you use valet that is still $8+tip this location is always super busy, so be prepared for waiting 15-45 minutes also they dont take reservations servers are always nice, sometimes it feels like they're understaffed as it takes forever for the server to come back to the table to take your order but still its good food sometimes is hit and miss which is why i took out 1 star most of the times everything is perfect, like any other cheese cake factory but here sometimes they forget things, or you tell them you want your meat medium and they cook it to crisp, some little things that has happen they're rare though love the avacado eggrolls, love the tuxedo cheese cake"
Drew A.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,6,3,1.0,3/1/2016,"Horrible Corporate Food. Had to wait so long at the table for service. the server was busy with  ' a large party' complainted to the manager Steve, but he did nothing. he didn't even refill our empty drinks. just let us wait. Food came and the order was wrong"
D P.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,14,2,2.0,12/23/2014,Poor service. Orders messed up. Servers were rude and didn't listen to my order or my pairs order. It's a pretend five start restaurant. Them this place is going down hill. Well not be returning.
Taylor L.,"Westport, Kansas City, MO",23,7,3,4.0,2/15/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is always a winner! :) Has something for every appetite. Ask for a calorie menu...you'll fine hardly anything is under 1,000 but I guess that's what makes it so good. ;)  At this specific one, plan to park and walk a bit."
Ngozi O.,"Bitter Lake, Seattle, WA",57,6,19,3.0,2/15/2013,"I ordered my food to go I was a bit confused to where to go to order take out the lady at the counter picked up the phone as I entered an started pointing so I went to where she pointed.  The guy behind the counter sounded like he was on a personal call and the lady who came to take my order didn't know the menu well. I knew exactly what I wanted because I get it all the time but some locations add chives/parsley (I don't know what its called but I described it to her) in the order some don't I don't like chives/parsley so I asked her if they have it in the item and she said no but when I opened my food guess what was in it? I didn't complain I let it go. While I was waiting for my food there was another worker there who was really nice and wanted to make sure I was taken care of, I should of got his name he was real nice and made sure I was a happy customer! The food was good but the peas were under cooked/hard.  I got the shrimp carbonara, red velvet cheesecake and a Shirley temple (was kinda sad this location didn't do crushed ice but I'll survive!). No long lines, not to busy during lunch hour"
Hanabi N.,"Sun Valley, CA",10,61,107,4.0,12/18/2014,"I've been hearing a lot about Cheesecake Factory so I decided to give it a try last Tuesday. The place has an almost romantic feel to it with the deem lighting and intricate decor. Their menu options are extensive, more options then I could imagine especially for their cheesecakes. I got the four cheese pasta and my friend got the Orange chicken.  We were started with two kinds of bread with butter and some water. The food itself was ok nothing special in my opinion just big portions. The pasta was good not too cheesy and not too saucy. The orange chicken was ok, they were big and tender which was nice. We ordered the dulce de leche hot chocolate, and I have to say it was pretty good. Really sugary though. Our waiter was really sweet, kept making sure we were doing ok. For dessert we ordered the original cheesecake since we were already going into a sugar coma from our drinks. It was really good overall I just feel it's over priced. I'll definitely be back again but only for a special occasion."
Teren A.,"Burbank, CA",0,10,3,5.0,3/8/2015,"I have been to this location at least 100 times in my life. The food here has never disappointed me. There are so many options that you can have whatever you are in the mood for and know that it be at the least, good, at best - you will have cravings later. I also have to give a shout out to the happy hour menu. To me, this is the kind of place you can never go wrong with. My faves: miso salmon, chicken bellio, chicken potstickers, the amazing bread basket, all the desserts.  Having been here so many times, I never thought to write a review, until my server on Friday night, Allen S. changed that.  Allen was that good. I was a little nervous when he never bothered to write any of our orders down - we were a party of 5 with drinks, appetizers, and 5 separate entrees. And I was a little bummed when our bread was served cold. (No, no, no - the butter has to be able to melt and drip out of the bread sandwich while you devour it.) But that was remedied pretty quickly.  Our orders came out perfectly, drinks were refilled, we were checked on and just enough times to make sure we were happy, and we were. But what took the cake was that Allen noticed, while carding my son for his alcoholic drink, that it was my son's birthday. We had not mentioned anything at all because it had been a rather solemn day for my son. However, when our server, Allen, noticed the date of birth on my son's ID and took the initiative and time to bring out the celebratory lit candle and song, it lifted everyone's spirits.   On any given day, you never know what that stranger you just came across has been through. It is absolutely true that one act of kindness can help. Allen did that. That kind of initiative deserves praise and recognition. The food would have kept me coming back. Servers like this one will make me happy about that."
Darlene J.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,167,64,4.0,8/31/2013,Can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory! service is always EXCELLENT & Food is good..Only 4 stars at this one because whomever made my Cappucino...well it must have been their first time or tired! The Coffee was Lukewarm (old) and it looked like a Mess. But the server saw my displeasure and Whisked the offending cup away!! The Hibachi steak was yumm
Chris M.,"Valencia, CA",50,171,91,4.0,11/8/2013,"I came to the Cheesecake Factory tonight for the first time & must say I was impressed.  I loved the decor of the restaurant, it really made the experience nice.  The menu was really full of tons of options.  I had the Chicken & Biscuits & wow it was delicious.  My wife had the Kobe Burger & it was amazing!!  Pricing was a little steep, but you do get a lot of food for the price so it balances itself out.  Next time I come here it will definitely be a date night with the wife & not with the kids.   Parking is kind of a pain in the butt since you have to park in the parking garage & you basically have 2 hours to be in & out for your validation from the restaurant to count.  Otherwise being located in the Galleria is a real nice experience.  I enjoyed being in a place with so much going on."
Megan P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",346,8,1,3.0,1/3/2015,Don't be fooled by the cold Apple cider they offer on the menu. It's just a 6oz class of Apple juice for $3.50. Service was alright. They didn't seem happy to be there. We got the red velvet cheesecake which didn't disappoint.
Michael D.,"West Hollywood, CA",1252,13,3,5.0,1/29/2014,"The fastest, and nicest staff. Always busy, but great atmosphere. We had a woman, Dianne, covering our section. She was above and beyond sweet, and patient, even with every table filled. A++ This place also validates for Sherman Oaks Galleria. Big open floor plan."
Nancy P.,"Hidden Hills, CA",0,12,6,1.0,1/18/2016,"A group showed up at 12:30 for lunch. Got a buzzer then looked in bar where seats were available. Mgr told us we couldn't sit there. Had to wait 45 minutes. Waited a bit - still not seated so asked Mgr again, said no. So she let 8 people walk out. Been coming here 3x week for almost 10 years. Food & management leave quite a bit to be desired! Not going back. Other places want our business."
