Chad B.,"Studio City, CA",26,11,,2.0,12/17/2017,"I used to like CKF, I really did. But that changed years ago. As the saying goes, ""jack of all trades, master of none"" - describes the current Cheesecake franchise perfectly. Just left from what I hope will be my final trip. $125 later, with a stomachache, I am sad to say that the CKF I used to love is dead, may she RIP. The current version is OK if you like overpaying for mediocre food. YMMV."
Timur G.,"York, Toronto, Canada",101,16,65,3.0,2/20/2017,"Actual review 2.5 We went here after the recommendation from our friend who is a regular here.  We ordered appetizers and were gonna wait for them to come before we ordered the mains, this was a mistake since it took like 30 minutes. But we though its okay since it was busy, the food took a while too.  The food was ordered as medium well, and even though in the middle it was medium well the outer layer of the meat was char burned on almost all of the dishes, making the meat taste super dry. Our friend that's a regular always orders the same thing and said his food tasted off as well as the appetizers. He talked to the manager and he said that they got new chefs so that might have been the problem. The waiters were pretty apologetic and said they got a lot of complaints that's day.  The bathrooms were pretty clean as well.  I'm giving it a 3 since our friend said usually they are much better!"
Nico L.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,227,1,3.0,6/3/2017,"The food is pretty good, I mean it is Cheesecake Factory. Only three stars this visit because of the complete lack of attention by the bar. After we ordered, we were offered bread. 10 minutes later, our food comes. Then the bread comes in last minute. Gee, thanks.  We were sitting there waiting for attention, attempting to make eye contact because we wanted to box up our food. However a former (or current) employee in street clothes walked up to the bar and received all the attention. Two bartenders and a barback, servers walking by and chatting it up while he was getting free bread. Seriously? I get that they're your friend, but we're paying customers and we were ignored for a bit. If we come back to the theater, we'll pop in here if there is no/a short wait. If you want Cheesecake Factory, I suggest you go to any of the other locations in the Valley, the odds of their service being better are higher."
Its M.,"Vancouver, Canada",10,17,7,1.0,10/11/2017,I just landed from Canada and brought 12 people to this CF and i need to charge my phone but they will not do anything to help. I need to do business but they do not care. So im pretty upset. Foods good but they really dont care much about my issue now. So i give them a 1 for that. As well i will have to leave my 11 family members to go get my phone charges. Im bummed!
Matthew K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",470,124,206,5.0,12/8/2016,"Perfect location. Came to the galleria to watch a movie and we were a lot earlier than our movie time. So we came to cheesecake factory to grab coffee and dessert. Its a huuuge location with a nice outdoor patio although we didn't sit outside because it was cold.  I highly recommend their food they have a large variety from burgers to Pasta food to steak and more. We ended up getting snickers cheesecake which very good. Our waiter Matthew was awesome, he definitely went above and beyond with his service."
Nancy J.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,212,199,1.0,4/15/2017,"***Not a pre-Arclight dinner - horrible with time*** Honestly, the food can be great but when the service is awful that's the take away.  Our waitress barely bothered with us and management was no help. We had to ask for a clean napkin, for water, for appetizer plates - literally everything.  It took her nearly 30 minutes to even bother asking if we would like to order an appetizer and no matter how hard we tried to flag her down she just was not coming back to our table.  Finally I asked a manager for help and he was so busy laughing it up with the other guy in a tie that I honestly don't think he bothered doing a thing.  The last person to order got her food first and sat there with it while the rest of us hadn't even gotten an appetizer yet. Then everything else came at once.  By then we had about 15 minutes to eat and we had told her our movie time. And it was my friend's birthday.  They were just all around a miserable choice."
Sergio A.,"Sherman Oaks, Sherman Oaks, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/15/2017,I ordered pasta and it tasted so good. We were   seated but it took them 5 minutes but they were so busy but at the end it was worth the wait.
Janice Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,103,75,4.0,10/5/2017,I had a lunch meeting here and will unfortunately have to come out this way more due to the logistics of senior management people. Our server was great and took care of us even though some of my coworkers were annoying. One was allergic to dairy the other to shrimp. I ordered the white chicken chili off the skinny menu and it was yum! I don't want to be skinny but I'm watching my diet. It was chilly that day and perfect for cooler weather. They validate for parking but still had to pay $6 because I was there for a long time.
Shahen T.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",12,13,9,5.0,10/22/2017,"We were celebrating my nephew's B-day yesterday. We were happy to meet waitress Suzie. She is so friendly, always smiles, works very fast and professional. I loved this place because of her. She is brilliant. Thank you for everything. Our event was amazing =)"
Sara S.,"Ventura, CA",1,105,35,5.0,6/21/2017,"Favorite restaurant ever. Cheesecake Factory never disappoints. Perfect place for a splurge meal. The food presentation is flawless and the flavors are incredible.  For 2 people to have dinner and dessert, you will spend about $60-75, but it is so worth it!"
Marissa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,357,91,5.0,10/31/2016,"Came here with my boyfriend and his little sister. We got to have john and brance as servers, and they were amazingly accommadating. They will make excellent servers! On top of that, they gave us free wings on the house, Elizabeth I'm assuming was the manager was very sweet and made our meal pleasant!"
Nooneh K.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",220,163,82,5.0,4/7/2017,"I enjoy the menu and today noticed ""gluten free by request"" tags. I decided to indulge. Thanks Daniel for en exquisite service of the perfect combination of wit and efficiency!"
Chris A.,"Van Nuys, CA",0,5,2,1.0,8/11/2017,"No Los Angeles Dodger's Games shown here.  They have Direct TV because they are CHEAP. Every other place at the Galleria is showing the Dodgers. I asked the woman bartender, and with this rude crappy voice she said, ""Who CARES about the Dodgers?"" Not a good place to watch sports, the bartenders are also jerks to the customers. AVOID THIS PLACE, IT'S NO FUN."
Johnathan B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,22,34,5.0,6/21/2017,"Service was great food was made to perfection. Nice place to have a dinner date. My wife ate the Louisiana Blackened chicken pasta. I consumed the seafood / chicken jambalaya.  Both tasted great, plates were portioned very good. Can't complain"
Esther C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,18,1.0,2/24/2017,"Not welcoming at all, after waiting 39 minutes to be seated and requesting a nicer table than the one being seated, I had to wait another 20 minutes. Finally, after requesting a manager we were seated outside. The server took 15 minutes to acknowledge us, it is ridiculous the way we were treated. And no manners by the hostesses or any sort of kindness by the employees.  Final wait time was 1:20 minutes or more without a single human being acknowledging us. Left starving, lol what a joke. And not mentioning the hour drive :("
Pamela B.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,18,19,2.0,4/15/2017,"In the Galleria, in Sherman Oaks, 2017 prices and a hugh hole in my seat!!!! I am a little,no,a lot out done!"
Dannielle W.,"Toluca Lake, Los Angeles, CA",26,46,242,1.0,3/25/2017,"I am too tired and still too hungry to write a full review about the rude, overly emotional, dramatic yet oscar worthy phone performance the manager named Justin gave tonight. He shifted the issue of an item missing off of a pick up order completely to stuff I wasnt even talking about..smh.  People really do too much nowadays. Hanging up on a customer that wasn't even cussing you out or disrespecting you isn't normal. Getting angry so quickly because you may be a little frustrated with your day isn't cool either. I will go over him then update this with all the details. Just be aware that the manager named Justin is unprofessional with a bad temper ( going off of my customer service experience with him alone) representing everyone's favorite comfort food spot."
Eden E.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,12,23,5.0,4/7/2017,Best spaghetti meatballs ever !!!  Trying to get different dishes every time and in the end I keep ordering the same thing :)  And the service here is always great!
Vikas M.,"Buena Park, CA",173,9,1,1.0,3/6/2017,"Just felt like sharing this with others to see if it's normal or am I having a long day.  So they wipe/ clean tables with a towel / cloth and place silverware on the table , there is no way that cloth is sanitized every single time.  It's gotta have germs and then to place all of your silverware on the table ?? Not sure how hygienic is that.   Other than that server was good and good was okay.  Chicken samosas were a little salty.  They are open till 11 on weekdays so it's pretty busy at nights.  Not lot of choices at that hour of the day . Cheers  This response from Cheesecake Factory guest services seems like a computer generated reply.   They didn't see two stars ?? Or my concern ?? No mention of any of that.  Don't know what to make of it."
Keren D.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,11,1,2.0,3/21/2017,"I will start with I LOVE the cheese cake factory! But yesterday was the first time I asked them for a pick up. Ordered the Sheila's Chicken and Avocado salad which usually you get it with guacamole, lots of avocado and dressing.  What I got was not it at all! I got lots of leaves, just a bit of carrots and maybe 2 small pieces of avocado, without dressing at all!  I was so looking forward to eating the salad on my lunch break but discovered I can't eat dry leaves.  I also asked for only dark bread but got white bread instead.  I usually love eating at cheese cake but was so disappointed from their lack of attention when it comes to pick up delivery."
