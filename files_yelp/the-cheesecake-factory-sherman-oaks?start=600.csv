K O.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,4,,2.0,9/27/2015,"I took the family to the cheesecake factory for a special dinner. Only it wasn't so special! We had to wait 20 minutes to sit down which was okay, they hit it right at the 20 minutes. Has a great waiter who was generally responsive and took care of us. Ordered a Ribeye steak and Mac & cheese. The steak took over 40 minutes to get and the mac & cheese arrived 10 minutes after that. I waited a total of 50 minutes to fully receive my dinner. Waiter said kitchen problems. Have eaten in this place before but I think it is going down hill, Good food, service isn't."
Joel S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2,154,7,4.0,8/17/2014,"We waited 40 minutes for a table (didn't mind that). But we were seated at a table with no silverware and the hostess said someone would ""be right out"" to provide that to us.  Our waitress came after a few minutes, took our drink order, didn't say anything about the missing silverware and I assumed she was on top of it.   Bread and drinks came, still no silverware. Still giving her the benefit of the doubt, we waited. 10 mins after having been seated, I got up and asked another waiter if we could have silverware and it was brought to the table right away.  Now, about 15 minutes had passed since our waitress took our drink order and she still hadn't returned to take our food order.  I get thats it is friday night and its busy, but she had passed by us and assisted surrounding tables several times and never once said to us something like ""I'll be right over"" or ""I'm sorry, give me another minute"".  So after waiting 15 minutes, I got up to ask the front if they could have our waitress take our order. She then came to our table. She took the order and didn't even acknowledge the fact our table had been forgotten about.  After that, it died down and she was on her game though.  Another waiter started assisting her tables. I dunno if she was over whelmed or what. But after having waited 40 mins for a table, then having no silverware at the table and having to wait almost 20 mins for our waitress to take our order, it was a pretty poor experience. The only reason I'm giving a higher rating is because I've eaten here several other times and never had a problem."
Haim M.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",2,19,19,3.0,1/31/2016,Again these young immature unreliable hostess don't know know how to organize the the seating. And what happened to manners with this new generation?
Jackie S.,"Lancaster, CA",31,209,1,4.0,2/28/2013,Great cheesecake! I had salmon and broccoli and it was super delicious!!  Tuxedo cheesecake YUMM!!!!
Oscar S.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,4,,5.0,1/25/2015,Food always great.   We had the best server anywhere in Alexander.   I will definitely ask for Alexander when I go to the Sherman Oaks location.
Cynthia S.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",382,284,61,4.0,8/24/2012,"Love this location! Usually get seated in a timely manner... The service is great...  Parking is good, nice little walk to the location.  Our waiter last night was very helpful, and he was friendly and funny.  Had the BBQ Chicken salad and it was really good. The portions are so big its amazing. There will always be left overs for tomorrow and the salad tastes even better the next day!  The Tiramisu is to die for... the cake not the cheesecake!  There is something for every taste bud on their menu. The menu is a whole book filled with yummy yummy food!  Will be back! =]"
Kat I.,"Oxnard, CA",0,19,9,5.0,1/25/2016,Our server was very attentive and the food was great . We didn't have to wait very long for the food to arrive. We ordered calamari and fried potato tots for appetizer.   My daughter ordered corn dog with a side of fruit instead of French fries.  Her plate arrived with 3 mini corn dogs and sliced fruit which she enjoyed.  My mother ordered the Salmon Thai glazed with brown rice lunch special . It was very delicious and the salmon was cooked a little crispy - but we like it that way. The brown rice was soaked in what tasted like coconut milk! Yum! My boyfriend and I shared the chicken Madeira. For desert we ordered a slice of Tiramisu cheesecake and Oreo cheesecake.  Both very delicious and the slices came in big portions so we were able to take the rest home ! I would go again if I were in the area.
Mayra L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/9/2016,"terrible service!! do not go on busy days like Friday dinner. It is ridiculously crowded. Took us 1 hour to be seated, we had to wait standing near the front elbow to elbow with others. waiter was horrible, never came to check us or refill our drinks. the manager was great, only reason we stayed. Food took an hour, was yummy but not worth the wait. Do not go, opt for torito grill or nearby restaurants instead."
Sabrina A.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,18,,5.0,9/24/2013,"I come here often I like this one more than any other due to its location. I love sitting outside esp on weekends it's a good environment ,good feel esp since it's so*cal so its never that cold & if it is they have heaters so no biggie.  It's  located in a galleria so it's usually busy. Overall the food is very good I've tried almost everything &I love the big portions, makes a great leftover :)"
Michael S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1013,373,297,5.0,8/7/2010,"Okay, I think it's unfair the wrap that the Cheesecake Factory Sherman Oaks location gets.  I hadn't been there in a year or two but fondly remember enjoying them.  A few friends and I went this past week though and I must say, I actually felt they kicked it up a notch. Maybe I just get lucky when I go, maybe they recognize me, maybe they heard a ""yelper"" was in the building lol, I don't know...but the fact is, this time our service was extremely speedy, the food was great, ""I had a shrimp and bacon style sandwhich, something new on their menu, don't even know if it's a regular thing, but it tasted great"", and was given extra bacon free of charge because I simply said when they asked how everything was, that it felt light on the bacon...2 minutes later, he came by with a plate with 6 strips of bacon...MORE than enough, and didn't tell me he was doing it :) both myself and the girls I was with were extremely pleased with our meals.  The bill for all 3 of us combined with a few drinks, came out around $70, not bad at all.  Everything was clean, and it was speedy too ""granted it was 4:30pm on a tuesday. My bottom line is I left extremely satisfied and definitely recommend this location. I give The Sherman Oaks Cheesecake Factory 5/5 stars."
John K.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",1,17,,4.0,8/16/2014,"Try the garlic shrimp with angle hair pasta with asparagus from the skinnyliscous menue.  Perfect portion, nice change from the scampi."
Haejong M.,"Los Angeles, CA",147,197,42,4.0,10/5/2015,"One of the better Cheesecake Factory chains I would say. As in, not a long 45 minute wait, decent service, and less than 2-3 issues with our orders. My boyfriend and I waited for about 15 minutes and scrolled through Urban Home until our buzzer went off. We we're seated outside and it was HOT. However, the outside chairs were so comfortable that we obliged and stayed, lol. Our server was chill. She wasn't overly friendly but she gave the perfect amount of attentiveness. We noticed both of our entrees were less salty than usual but we weren't complaining. Actually, this is good for our health since we like to pour hot sauce on everything. Who needs the extra salt? Not us! It could've just been that night however if this is an issue for you, you can always just ask for salt! (Speaking of, why do they not keep salt + pepper on each table?) cmon son, this is standard. Anyway, we will be back when were suddenly craving jambalaya and a good shepherds pie without all the fuss."
Vadim P.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",171,178,120,2.0,1/4/2013,"sadly, not their best service. The food is not bad. Nothing special, but you do get lots of choices. Came here for a birthday beginning of Dec. The usual business.... parked in the structure, walked in, waited 25 minutes to be seated. Nothing I didn't expect. Once seated our server came by. I felt like we didn't click right away... She just seemed distant, only wanted to take the order and walk away. We asked for bread several times. Had to wait for water refills. but the thing that REALLY pissed me off was that she offered the table next to me fresh Parmesan cheese for their pasta... but I wasn't offered any (I ORDERED PASTA!) When I tried to get her attention, she ignored me... Not cool... Also, when I told her it was a birthday, she said we can either buy a slice of cheesecake OR get a small sundae on the house... I asked a reasonable question ""Can we get both?""... which seemed to stump her. She left to go ask someone... It was the weirdest thing. Long story short, there are way too many good restaurants in the valley to have to put up with places like this... I will not be back"
Brenda R.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,46,,4.0,6/11/2014,"This is a pretty good restaurant to visit. I really enjoy the skinnylicious spaghetti, but would like to see more dishes I would like on the menu such as the talapia fish. It keeps coming and going. Somewhat understaffed and mistakes get made a little more than I would like, but they fix everything."
Alex F.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,25,,4.0,10/19/2013,"Amazing avocado rolls,best oreo cheesecake and the service was great. the only bad thing is not being able to make a reservation and the wait time crazy but aside from that its by far my favorite restaurant"
Bobby B.,"Woodland Hills, CA",247,290,92,4.0,6/27/2013,"The Ranch is the best you will ever find!   This is a good location, good ambience and very good seating if you sit outside.. Their food is good and staff is very friendly here.... Will defiantly come back many times more hopefully!"
Charles H.,"North Hollywood, CA",18,7,,2.0,11/11/2014,"I'm a regular at the Cheesecake Factories restaurants and I'm always satisfied with the food.  Once in a while we get not so good service but it's tolerable, tonight however while celebrating my daughter's 18th birthday we experienced horrible service.  After being seated we promptly were greeted by our server.  He took out drink and appetizer order quickly and returned right away with our drinks.  That's the best part of the service, the rest of the dinner consisted of him forgetting to order our appetizers, waiting 10 min for knives to cut our pork chops, having to send the pork chop back because it was raw, not being asked if we wanted our drinks refilled and serving us a burnt pizza.  We should have just gone to buffalo wild wings."
Ron S.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",2,139,14,4.0,12/9/2014,"Always dependable. We come here at least a couple times a month after a movie at the Arclight. Waiting times can be anywhere from 15 minutes to 45 minutes when super busy. They give you a beeper to let you know when your table is ready so you can go check out some of the stores or whatever. Service is always great and always friendly. The menu is so extensive that even the most picky of eaters will find something. Everything we've tried has anyways been great. Their chicken and shrimp gumbo is a recent awesome find. Fish and chips with sweet potato fries is a tasty choice to share.  And no doubt the best cheesecake options around. One slice is perfect to share by three people... or at least that's what we do and are always sweet tooth satisfied. Last week I hit a movie solo and then popped in for take-away and ordered dinner for the three of us at home. Getting the order in was quick, easy and done right. It did not take long and everything was ready at which point they checked everything item by item with me to ensure they got it right. It was a first time for take-away and I was impressed. Always a solid choice!"
N K.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",56,128,2,2.0,11/3/2014,Not kid friendly. Server was too friendly... Resulted in very slow service.  Minimal to no veggie options. Surprising.
Jaelynn D.,"North Hills, CA",66,535,331,4.0,2/17/2011,"I mean honestly, what's not to like. They have a huge menu, tons of drinks at the full bar and a WIDE array of cheesecake. Came here for my boyfriend's friend's birthday and they have everything down streamlined. The service and food is always good. The portions are HUGE.  And the Arclight is close by. What more could you want? (Well, I wish there was still a Tower Records in there)"
