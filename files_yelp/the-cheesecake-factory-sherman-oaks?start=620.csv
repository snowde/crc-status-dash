Justin W.,"Los Angeles, CA",494,63,13,1.0,5/11/2012,"When I agree'd to my girlfriend's offer to have dinner at The Cheesecake Factory, I should've realized right there and then that I got a ""Get Out Of Jail Free"" pass to use during any future mishaps I might get myself into with her. THAT'S how bad this place is. The Cheesecake Factory boasts a menu that is large. No, not large. Gigantic. I dont really know how I felt about a place that serves Orange Chicken, Steak Diane, Wasabi Mashed Potatoes, and Chicken Parmeasean under the same roof, but I was willing to give it a try.  When a menu for an establishment is that large, it means it's either featuring a collection of unique items from speciality chefs around the world OR really, really, really bad food with nothing good enough to be a 'featured' item. Unfortunately, Cheesecake factory falls into the latter. When I can't decide what I want to eat at a restaurant I've never frequented before, I usually go straight for the ""What are they famous for"" factor...however I couldn't eat Cheesecake for dinner. Or could I? No. Not in public. According to the menu, their most popular dinner speciality happens to be a combination of Chicken Madiera (their most popular chicken dish), Steak Diane, and Mashed Potatoes. I ordered the steak medium-rare to  be on the safe side but was a little worried when my waitress dropped off a steak knife to our table before my entree arrived.  Last time I checked, Steak Diane was small enough medallions to where you didn't have to cut them with a knife. My Dinner arrived in a timely fashion, however my level of excitement quickly dwindled once I stared down at the disarranged slop of SHIT-ake (looking) mushrooms covering my main course. My steak was on the left, chicken on the right, and the potatoes in the middle.  The Steak: According to the menu the Steak Diane is ""a mix of sirloin medallions, onions, and mushrooms in a mushroom sauce."" There were NO onions in this mess and literally 50-something mushrooms. The sauce was extremely sweet and didn't match what I have grown up to know what Steak Diane was. I was calling the search for my meat The Great Steak Escape, but once I found my little medallions I understood why I was given a steak-knife. This steak (which was supposed to be medium rare) was cooked WELL DONE with a super gritty and fatty texture that was unappetizing and flat out disgusting.  The Chicken: According to the menu, the Chicken Madiera is a piece of a chicken breast covered in asparagus, mozerrella cheese, and a ""madeira"" sauce. First off, I can see where the word MADiera came from, because this meal pissed me off.  The chicken was flattened to the size of a piece of notebook paper, covered in globs of burnt cheese, and (just like my steak) covered in about 50-something mushrooms. The sauce was exactly the same as the steak diane sauce (imagine that!).  The mashed potatoes were made from red potatoes (which I don't care for) but weren't bad. The asparagus was quite good, actually. I don't cause problems at restaurants and never return food because that animal was still killed for a reason, not to be thrown in the garbage. The Cheesecake Factory is a place for middle-class families that want a big selection of things that they might enjoy yet have a backup plan dinner in case they don't. The only thing that gave this place one star was the professionalism of our waiter and the decor of the resturant. There's much better resturants that have $30 entrees, with food you'll actually enjoy."
Jessica Y.,"San Francisco, CA",231,223,18,4.0,4/4/2013,"The servers here are some of the friendliest I have ever seen anywhere. 4 stars for easy access: free parking within the mall, and also located at the corner (as opposed to tucked away somewhere obscure) Other than that, this place is pretty much like any other cheesecake factory: American food, salads, soups, desserts, sandwiches abound.  My personal favorites: cranberry kale salad with apples, and portobello fries with garlic aioli Also: GET THE ICED MANGO (basically their mango smoothie). Quite pricey, at ~$7, but absolutely amazing."
Nicholas H.,"Santa Ana, CA",87,113,24,5.0,9/26/2014,Had dinner with my bro and mom today it was amazing thank you for everything I actually gave them 55% tip well you have to have the drinks here omg the food is fab thanks god
Crose L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",2,27,,5.0,1/8/2013,"I love the cheescake factory for its consistency. I always enjoy what I order especially my favorite the salmon. Service is always good no matter how crowded. I'm still trying to figure out the best cheescake, so far dulce de leche is my winner ."
Taylor G.,"Los Angeles, CA",270,368,129,4.0,5/19/2012,"Best thing about the Cheesecake Factory is that they are consistent. I have never had a bad meal at any of their locations; which inspires me to try different things on the menu. Yes, they all look the same and its a little monotonous as far as design goes but its good food that is moderately priced. Our waiter Zack was very professional and attentive. Great service all around. Today was my first time here in a few years and everyone at the table shared an order of tex mex egg rolls appetizer that is complimented well by salsa and an avocado spread. I had the Thai chicken pasta that was amazing; the peanut sauce on it is a killer along side a blue moon beer. And banana cream cheesecake with real bananas for dessert. All delicious items. One thing I must say is that the portions are huge It is hard to finish a plate of pasta here, you don't want to eat so much that you hate yourself. Come hungry or be prepared for a doggybag."
Luis M.,"Monrovia, CA",6,19,1,4.0,10/11/2014,"Date night was in full swing and we decided The Cheese Cake Factory was the place that had a little of everything on the menu. The wait was less than 30min for a party of 2 which wasn't too bad. The food was delicious and the drink list had a good variety of items to choose from. I ended up getting a whiskey smash great drink my girlfriend loved it and drank the whole thing.  Our service was on point, very good at letting us talk and not interrupting every 10min to see if we were fine. He would walk by and check but not interrupt. Lol ...hate that..... good atmosphere we will definitely go again.."
Conor B.,"Chatsworth, CA",163,1350,106,4.0,1/18/2013,This location is on par with the other Cheesecakes I've been too. There really wasn't anything to set it apart from other locations.
Nazanin I.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,4,2,4.0,1/8/2015,"Very professional place, great for families and celebration! It matters what waiter you get, but mostly they are informed about their food! Would definitely come back! The wait especially at night time, is crazy!! Reserve before you go!!!"
Liani T.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",22,20,1,5.0,7/5/2013,"I am a fan.  I have never had a bad outing at any Cheesecake Factory, in fact is has been a go to place for lunch and dinner with my mom or with my friends. The food is always good, the plates are always large, and the waiters are always friendly. I haven't had any problems yet."
Anna M.,"Irvine, CA",13,72,136,4.0,8/3/2014,"We had lunch there on Saturday. I only advice come a bit before afternoon you will save yourself a lot of time. Got seated right away but just  15 minutes later I saw people waiting for a while. In short: Food 5 Stars Menu way to long and confusing, getting 4 menus is ridiculous 3 stars Service 3 Stars Overall: 4 :)      The good news. Most of our food was great. As appetizer we got Ahi Carpaccio and it was amazing. So fresh and yummy with a little avocado and cucumber. It would get it as my meal next time. Avocado rolls are weird tasting ... I am not a big fan of heated avocado. It just losses that creaminess and tastes mushy.   Pit Beef Dip had meat that was perfectly cooked. The only thing I would change, I would not use baguette for it. It is a little too hard even with Au Jus and confused flavors.  Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp was yummy. Keep in mind all portions are huge. They are more than plenty to share. Specially, if you are planning to have some dessert. Disappointing was their healthy Turkey Burger that was lacking in flavor and dry. Our waiter was way too busy to provide good service. He did not seem to care about menu, which is an issue on it's on. As soon as we set down, we got  about 4 or more menus with so many pages and items to look through that we were lost for a long time what we want. I would really recommend getting rid of a lot of items and simplifying their menu. Our waiter also would come to our table and just talk over us vs giving us a second to stop our conversation.   Overall,  a lot of great food that should be shared. Must try Ahi Carpacci"
Yelena M.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,241,156,4.0,1/5/2013,"I like Cheesecake Factory, so compared to the other ones I been to, this has always been good. Usually order the same stuff, and service is usually good. Long, long lines on weekends ( over an hour) Good Happy Hour at Cheesecake now from 4 to 6 I believe."
Elaine S.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,19,,4.0,10/21/2014,"Avocado rolls, santa fe roll and buffalo blasts are by far my fav appetizers! They're lemon drop drink is too acidic for me, but my friend loved it"
Meg A.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",0,48,1,5.0,9/23/2014,"No matter what people say about how many calories are in your plate, this place is still one of my favorite places to eat.  The bistro shrimp pasta is my favorite!  Whenever I crave this, I also get the Thai lettuce wraps or the BBQ chicken salad!  If I still have room, I treat myself to a white chocolate macadamia cheesecake or the s'mores cheesecake.  I always stick to my favorite.  The menu is too confusing - too much food and I always end up with the same thing."
S A.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,37,3,1.0,3/30/2014,"I literally JUST walked out of here after waiting for over half an hour with not even a glass of water at our table. I completely understand being busy but all other tables were being served. We had to ask 3 different servers for some service. There was one male server there however who did seem to want to help but at this point, we were not longer willing to wait.  We asked to speak to a manager before walking out and even HE was an airhead! All he said was, ""well we would love to serve you"".... Um, that's not really the right thing to say to customers who are angrily walking out of your restaurant. How about a ""I'm so sorry, please sit and have a meal on us."" Never coming back here again. Worst Cheesecake Factory. Worst service. Worst manager. We decided to drive down Ventura and stopped at Aroma Bakery Cafe - already great service after immediately being sat down."
Marlon G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,1,1.0,3/15/2015,Me and my wife really love this place and we usually go once a month. But last night it wasnt one of my best experiences. I order Orange Chicken with mush potatoes and the vegetables were burn and the food was cold. Plus the waitress came and gave us the check and we were still eating and keep on coming to out table until we payed. And once i payed she just took my wife plate away and she was still eating.
Amos C.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,3,,1.0,12/2/2015,Me and some friends when to the Apple Store at the grove to purchase an Apple Watch so when we got finished we decide to go to the cheesecake factory at the grove went inside the hostesses were very inattentive she was drinking a soda at the hostess stand so we decide to go to the bar because the restaurant was full we decided also to have dinner there at the bottom found the table we order drinks when my drink I ordered attend the raise seven I was drinking it out of a straw and then I was talking and I started feeling around the rim of the glass and it was broken we call the server over he said the manager over and I told him that you know if she should check with the bartender because us direct result of the bartender using the glass to  scoop ice she said no no no no no it was not that so in the meantime we had already ordered our dinner my friend had ordered a salad garlic ranch on it so while she was there talking to is the waiter came over and he had huge salad vinaigrette this was after he had sent it back and said he want to ranch I while we waited again the waiter came back with his salad againafter dinner was served and said here's your salad vinaigrette still up we decided that will just settle for he asked me if I want another drink in as a guest but not in real glass they plastic glasses for water and ice it asked if I could have my drink and a plastic Glass he never brought me another drink the salad friend never got a chance to read a salad because dinner was served the food was all wrong and what we decide to leave the waiter came over and was trying to talk to us and my friend said would you just go away  the waiter he got in his face and said what you mean I'm not to be a good waiter he was very belligerent he gave us the wrong check we paid it on the way out he come rushing I'm so I gave you the wrong check so you have to pay this we did let my friend went back to speak to another manager she said there was nothing she could do she already took the meal off of my meal which I do need anyway it was one of the worst times that I spent at a restaurant and spent quite a bit of money still $70 for the bill and all they take took off with my got a drink and we got a chance to eat nobody ever gave me any type of satisfaction so I am noticed at these upscale restaurants us at the mall at the grove especially at the cheesecake factory which supposedly have a good reputation they really didn't care about the satisfaction of me and my guest very disappointed
Armen O.,"Woodland Hills, CA",19,8,1,2.0,12/2/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory used to be my favorite restaurant for quality and quantity of their food.  Hadn't been there for a while & went last Sunday to celebrate a birthday. After 1 hour wait, we ordered Ahi Tuna and Evelyn's favorite pasta. Both dishes noticeably had small portion of food (probably 40% less) compared to last time. Also, quality of vegetables in Evelyn's pasta were not as good as they used to be (soggy instead of crisp). I hope they're not cutting down on what they used to be known for!!"
T P.,"Union City, CA",80,483,179,3.0,8/1/2014,"Just what you'd expect from TCF. Beautiful location, but parking is the pits. And this place is busy busy busy! Be prepared to wait. The food comes quickly, but placing your order does not. The last few times I've been here, seems like it takes forever for our server to realize they have a new table."
Beni J.,"Los Angeles, CA",651,38,11,5.0,5/2/2014,Twice a month I'm going to the Cheesecake Factory with my friends and family it's always the same kindly manner the food is always good they have decent prices and decent waiting time . I always get the avocado rolls and the T-bone steak my wife gets the big chicken salad with drinks
Maybel S.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,8,,5.0,11/18/2015,"This place is amazing. The service is really the best in town. The servers are friendly and efficient. The food is the best, and the atmosphere is very relaxing. It's also super convenient for dinner and a movie ."
