Gerald G.,"Encino, CA",232,71,6,5.0,7/2/2014,"Absolutely love this place! Me and my party of 13 got there at 10:30 PM and they took us with no problems. The service was great, the food was awesome and the overall experience was amazing! I have never had a bad experience at this place. Our waitress was beyond amazing! She kept our drinks full, made sure we had the yummy bread and even boxed up our left overs. If you go here, you will not be disappointed."
Lisa F.,"TARZANA, CA",0,87,,5.0,8/16/2014,"This restaurant is the ultimate favorite of my kids! Food here is delicious! Luau salad omg! Yummy! Everything in the menu is heaven! And the bread fantastic! I've celebrated my birthday here this year as well, and our server ""Ryan "" was fabulous! So outgoing, pro, friendly and smart, I believe all the staff at cheesecake factory are experienced .  I love this restaurant, one of the best! Well worth it!!!!"
Lulu P.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",2,26,22,5.0,5/26/2016,"Went there a week ago with 16 people for my birthday after another restaurant screwed up my reservation. I couldn't have picked a busier night...  I tbought my guests and I were going to wait over 2 hours to be seated since that's how long the wait was. To make a long story short, Cameron in the front desk was amazing , and was able to accommodate my big group for less than 2 hours. You know who else was AMAZING? ,our waiter Vincent. So professional and pleasant. Not only did he get everything perfect,  the smile never left his face the whole night.  Our food was served pretty fast for being so buisy.I guess we also have to give a lot of credit to the kitchen. One other person that got our  attention was the pretty blond girl behind the desk...my husband and I were watching her how she also kept her smile even when people were not so nice about the long wait. Overall, 5 solid stars to you guys and thanks for making it a Happy Birthday for me.;))"
Daniel G.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,43,8,4.0,7/16/2014,"I love this place... the food is alway amazing... however, the only complaint i have is the wait time on most evenings... other than that, i enjoy coming here"
Michelle G.,"Los Angeles, CA",124,36,9,1.0,12/19/2013,"Called twice to make a reservation. First time I called they told me I had to speak to a manager just to make a reservation, left me on hold for 10 ten minutes! Hung up. Called back and made sure to catch their name. ""Wendy"" answers the phone and says they don't take reservations! I said, ""well why didn't anyone tell me that?"" She then put he on hold again for another 10 ten minutes stating I had to speak to the manager! GRR! So annoying. I'm definitely writing to corporate."
Sandra T.,"Sun Valley, CA",115,49,147,1.0,3/12/2015,"I am beyond frustrated by the way the manager at this location has treated by friends and I for my birthday.  I called in a week or two early and spoke to a manager on duty by the name of Brent or Brett. I seeked his advice on how to have my birthday dinner at the restaurant on March 9th at 7pm with about 30 people.  He advised me they do not take reservations, but to come in an hour earlier and put my name down, and since it was a Monday, it is there slowest day of the week so being seated with my group should not be a problem.  I arrived on March 9th at 6:15pm and the manager on duty, her name was Sara and she informed me she could seat my group immediately. I informed her I informed my group to arrive at 7pm but I am in early to put my name down as per the previous manager I spoke to.  The manager, Sara, was soo rude.  She informed me and my boyfriend that she has a server who will be holding the section off for 40 minutes so my party needed to arrive at 7p and at the latest 7:05p or else she will give up our table and the rest of my group will be seated elsewhere. The way she approached me and my boyfriend was very condescending, not accomodating in any way. She came back at 7:05p, huffing and puffing and said she has to give up our table or seat whoever is here. I informed her I was not going to have my friends who drive from Corona and the OC who was stuck in traffic for 2.5 hours to sit somewhere else when it was my birthday dinner. My friends tried to speak to her and she did not care. When my friend informed her that we would carry the group elsewhere her response to us was ""have a good night"". We informed her that she lost a group of 30 people. She did not care. This place is rude, unprofessional, no sense of customer service whatsoever. I am appalled that Sara was the manager for a restaurant of a large food chain like this. Their corporate headquarters will definitely be hearing from me."
Yumarie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,11,1,5.0,2/20/2013,"Came in for Happy hour, stayed for two, left very happy! My friend and I ordered three items from the happy hour menu and an entree to share. The food is phenomenal, and caters to whatever your craving may be.  We also ordered the happy hour Margaritas and the Strawberry creamsicle. Great options. As a bartender I went ahead and exerted my authority by ordering a specialty drink not featured on the menu...not only did the bartender oblige but he also executed the cocktail flawlessly. I was impressed with the staffs dedication to service and accommodation. The fifth star really goes to our server Bruce. Extremely personable, friendly, and a pleasure to get to know. My friend and I just wanted a couple of bites before our movie, but Bruce provided the complete dining experience. It was truely refreshing to be waited on by someone who enjoyed doing what they do.  So ya, Sherman Oaks cheesecake factory. Kudos."
Mardi R.,"Pasadena, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/29/2015,"Have been coming to this CF since it opened and always had good service and food...until today. Went with a friend..only 2 of us..not hard to serve. Service was lackluster and food...eh. Ordered the lunch cheese pizza and salad. The pizza was overcooked, like cardboard, and so thin I felt like I was eating a slab of salty greasy melted white velveeta cheese. The salad consisted of wilted lettuce and 4 raw tomato wedges. Waitress kept trying to take our plates away AS we were eating. Never bothered to ask if we wanted drink refills or dessert.  This place has definitely gone downhill. Not going back."
Angelique L.,"Burlingame, CA",206,497,1562,4.0,2/25/2010,"i should start by saying that I don't like chains and I don't like malls, okay, I hate malls, but I do like food. Nothing is worse than going to a movie and not having anything to eat nearby. So when I find myself in this neighborhood and going to what is now the Arclight, I often duck into the bar at The Cheesecake Factory for a quick drink and a snack.  It would take an act of god for me to be here having dinner in all seriousness but the bar is fantastic. First, the people who work here are really nice. I usually sit at the bar but even at the tables, the service is great. The bartenders give you the full restaurant treatment. Second, they have a decent beer selection complete with chilled glasses. The martinis are excellent too and reasonably priced.  Third, there's something for everyone or the bar menu. The Roadside Sliders and the Avocado Eggrolls are my go-to items but everything I've had is tasty. But most importantly, apps come out fast and are consistently good.  In and out --a beer or a cocktail and a few apps-- in as little as 15 minutes. Longer if I have time to chill. Ahhhhh."
Sara L.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",232,271,157,3.0,1/5/2012,This location is never any different than any other Cheesecake Factory location. They are all busy and they all don't take reservations. This location is just as busy since it is an mall and there are limited selections on where to eat.  The menu is extensive so there is always something to find to suit your needs for meal. I only got one mean look once when I asked for things to be excluded. I chock it up to my server having a bad day (since I saw them get checked by a patron who wasn't looking where they were going).  I've had the Club salad which was nice and it also wasn't drenched in dressing which is an added bonus. The club sandwich is good but it isn't anything special and is kind of generic.  The Navajo sandwich is pretty good but the bread is fried so sometimes they over do the bread and it is just too greasy.  I'll keep coming back here because it is a good alternative to some of the places in the Galleria but It isn't on the top of my list.
Frank M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,2.0,9/21/2015,"So here we go, order five waters and a bottle of wine. The water comes and one glass has filth inside and we had to ask the server take it back. Order appetizers and all comes as ordered. The entrees comes out and my meatloaf was a little black on the edges and the vegetables ice cold. My daughter's salad was supposed to be Falafel salad and turned out to be ice cold fried crab mixture balls so we sent that back to be remade. So we ask for the two salads we had ordered to be boxed and the server asked if we wanted the meatloaf boxed and we said no. Out comes two bags one with one salad and the other with the meatloaf. Okay, dessert should be a no brainier. Order three cheesecakes and out comes two of the three we ordered and third was wrong."
Ann C.,"San Jose, CA",2,8,,1.0,8/23/2015,"This place has gone to hell recently. I have been experiencing worse and worse service and worse and worse food everyday. Today must be my last time to come to this place. Today's story started with my waiter bringing regular mojito when I ordered for passion fruit mojito. When I said that I asked for passion fruit mojito, he said, ""This is passion fruit mojito"". Really??? The passion fruit mojito has a different color than regular mojito, for God's sake. Then, my appetizer came exactly at the same time as my entree and the pasta in my entree was half cooked. When I asked the waiter to get the manager, he didn't. I asked another waiter to get the manager. After around 20 minutes, the waiter came. When I told him the issue, he didn't even say sorry a single time and simply took my appetizer and mojito away. And the best of all...they charge for all of these. Well, this is the last time they got my momey... It used to be a nice place, Alas...I will miss it."
Andie M.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",1,49,4,2.0,7/25/2015,"i admit, I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a long time. I always really liked the food, and I knew there was usually a solid wait for a table, but when we finally went to this location last week (our first time at this location) it was to order carry out. So I didn't anticipate that from the time we pulled into the garage to the time we pulled back out with our order, a full hour might pass. Granted, the Galleria is so oddly laid out that it took several minutes to get from our parking space to the restaurant. But the wait inside was needlessly long, too. We finally got home with our food, most of which was good, but we ordered one of the beef dip sandwiches and requested the horseradish sauce on the side. we got that. and nothing else. they gave us a plain beef sandwich with no cheese, onions, OR DIP! It's a beef DIP sandwich. In what world does asking for one condiment on the side equal leave every single thing off? We're lucky we got beef and not just a plain roll, I guess. And the beef was so fatty and grisly I couldn't even chew half of it. What a disappointment. We'll stick to just getting cheesecake here and go elsewhere for meals."
Eve S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,8,30,4.0,9/19/2014,I have visited the one on Ventura and the new one on Topanga Canyon on several occasions and both have been great. The one on Ventura is smaller. The food is great and big portions.
Rae R.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,32,32,5.0,4/4/2013,"Friggin LOVE this place. My first time here I sat at the bar. My bartender was Brian. Nice guy who knows how to make an amazing cocktail. I ordered the the herb grilled salmon, with mashed potatoes and broccoli. uh-may-zing. The pricing was great. I loved this place so much i wound up staying and hanging there for 5 hours with my friend talking with the bartender.  After tipping him i spent a cool $100 but i didnt care, I was happy to spend it. I dont mind spending money if my experience and food is amazing. Ive been back 3 times since then and i still havent been disappointed yet."
Samantha V.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,3,,1.0,12/16/2013,"My husband and I got food poisoning from the food here last Friday night. We each ate 1 crab cake with some of the sauce I had a bit more sauce than he did, a couple of buffalo strips - I ate 1 and 1/4, he had 3 and filet mignon. I got mine with the sauteed spinach and he got the fries. We shared the spinach and had a few fries. We also shared mushrooms to go on top of the steak. I lost 2 days of work and endured relentless, searing stomach pain for 3 days. I'm guessing it was either SALMONELLA or E.COLI.  A co-worker today informed me that she ate there once and got food poisoning and so did a few of her friends. That place was so crowded and every table was full. I wonder how many others got sick. Clearly they either have a problem with food safety or someone isn't washing their hands. I'm pissed!!!! I gave it 1 star because the bar area was fun."
Jessica S.,"Los Angeles, CA",155,106,41,1.0,12/8/2013,"A few weeks ago, my friends and I decided to go out for dinner and we picked Cheesecake Factory because they have such a wide variety of foods. We knew that the wait was going to be a while, it was a Saturday night around 8:30. The hostess told us it would be about 55 minutes.  So 60 minutes later, when our buzzer hadn't gone off yet, we went to ask about how much longer.  Like I said, we anticipated a long wait time but were starving so we wanted to know when we would be called.  The hostess was so unbelievably rude to us- she told us how busy it is and that it hadn't been 55 minutes yet. And I showed her my watch and told her what time we got there and she proceeded to tell me that I was wrong.  THEN when our buzzer went off, we went to stand and wait for someone to take us to the table.  (This process they have is completely bull, they have your buzzer go off so you have to stand in a crowd of other people who's buzzers went off, for another 15 minutes until someone can take you to your table! I don't understand why they can't have the buzzers go off when there's actually someone ready for you.)  Anyway... As we're waiting, the rude hostess is standing there giving my friends and I one of the best evil eyes I've ever seen.  Okay I get it- your job sucks. But there's absolutely no reason for you to be so rude towards me. Especially at this point, where we were just waiting for our table. (That was about 25 minutes past the time they had originally told us)  So one of my friends asks to speak to her manager, after her asking if the hostess had a problem.  As the manager comes over, and she tells him what's happened, him and his lovely hostess are LAUGHING at our situation. He walks over to me, I'm not sure if he thought we didn't have eyes and couldn't see 10 feet away from us? But he puts on his serious face. Apologizes, not for his ridiculously ghetto, rude, uneducated hostess- but for how busy the restaurant is.  I know how busy the restaurant is!! I have eyes!  As he walks away, he again laughs and high fives his hostess.  Our food was delicious and our waiter was as sweet and wonderful as can be. But unfortunately our entire meal was ruined because of how worked up we got over how unprofessional the manager and the hostess were.  So.. Not sure what kind of business that manager thinks he's running, but he's ruined it for us and we won't be returning.  And I understand this is a huge business and one customer isn't going to effect their numbers, but it isn't acceptable to be acting the way they did. Especially in front of customers!  They'll get their karma in the end. The world doesn't like mean spirited people."
William S.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",1,6,35,4.0,5/17/2013,"This was my first time attending the cheesecake factory and I have to admit it was an incredible experience. I took my mother and sisters for mother's day and the service was excellent. The place was really nice and our waitress was really helpful in our choices. The drinks were really good, my mother tried pina colada and she told me it was the best drink she ever had. We ordered appetizers and the food and they came out really fast. The food was delicious, even better than Olive Garden. The dishes were big and we could not finished them all. Same goes with the dessert. We had a great time. I would definitely come back here and try new dishes. The reason I gave it a 4 stars is because it is a little expensive. However, the experience was unforgettable and I would recommend this place to anybody"
Alyssa L.,"Santa Teresa, San Jose, CA",282,213,151,5.0,5/14/2014,"I'm a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory, I always have been. So when my dad suggested we take my mom here for a another's Day brunch, I was super excited! We had a reservation for 9:30 and had requested a booth ahead of time, which we were seated in immediately. The brunch menu was on the smaller side (considering the bulk of the menu) but you could order anything off their menu, not just the brunch items. I was pleased with the genuine kindness of the staff, with everyone who came up to our table wishing my mom a happy Mother's Day. I ordered scrambled eggs, which came with a choice of bread, potatoes, and I opted for the ham option. The ham comes on a separate plate so if you want it mixed in you must cut it up and do that yourself but that was perfectly fine with me. My dad ordered the French toast, which was fresh, soft and sweet, absolutely perfect! Lastly my mom ordered the eggs Benedict, which she thoroughly enjoyed. It was a lovely morning with delicious food, helpful and friendly staff, and beautiful atmosphere."
Lori C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,25,,1.0,10/11/2015,"my husband, son and I got violently ill four hours after our meals and were sick all night. I tried to tell the manager so they could avoid any future problems since all of us had burgers so it was probably bad meat, but they did not seem to care very much."
