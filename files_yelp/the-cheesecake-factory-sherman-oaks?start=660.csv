Farnaz S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",182,57,18,5.0,5/25/2014,The service was so attentive. We were big group which came from graduation. The waiter was around and accommodating all of our requests. The food was good and they have my vote.
Ellis J.,"Los Angeles, CA",243,251,28,5.0,7/28/2012,2nd time at this location and it never ever gets old or disappoints!  By the way this review is ONLY for the food and not the cheesecake...ive had bad experiences with that as take out...only get the desserts if your going to eat it there! Ive had many many options and today I got an omelette and again it was so filling...I believe the waiter said its a 4 egg omelette which was fantastic! I'll be back..over and over again! Pretty good for a big chain!
Aidan V.,"Los Angeles, CA",247,741,164,2.0,1/21/2012,"It was my mom's birthday and since she likes ""chain"" restaurants, my sister thought it would be great to bring her here.  We were going to meet at 6pm, but they showed up early and ordered without me (shocker). I finally get there and they already ate their appetizers and they wanted to order entrees. I knew this would be a long night unless i quickly drowned a glass of sauvignon blanc. (i was extremely annoyed by my family's 'courtesy'). I order the herb crusted salmon with the asparagus. My plate arrives and its ""warm"", not hot, but warm. My asparagus are over cooked. It was very 'mushy'. My salmon was not fresh. I dont get how people LOVE IT here. Maybe I'm not into it. Anyway- service here is always great but the food is just simply not up to par."
Min S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/19/2015,"The pasta wasn't cooked. It was still raw and hard.  We complained to the manager and he agreed.  However, it took a half hour for us to get the dishes back and it was already cold!  Service could have been much better.  The dishes must have been sitting at the cooking station for a long time!  We will never go back to this Cheesecake Factory, again!!!!  We used to go to this restaurant at least 3-4 times a year, but no more!!"
Prescilla C.,"Los Angeles, CA",106,112,61,2.0,4/10/2014,"I visit Cheesecake Factory only if it's super late and everything else is closed. Not to say that it's bad, I just believe they have become so popular that they have completely forgotten about quality and customer service. To start off, most of the food is frozen not fresh, like other big chains. I enjoy water with my meals and every time I am served water it smells weird, yuck. The last time I was here I was served old, rotten, mushrooms in my entree! I even got sick. When i informed the server she called the chef who insisted that it was fresh. Mind you I order the exact same thing every time I go and trust me it was so nasty! I might go for drinks or appetizers, ONLY if everything else is closed, but never again for a meal."
jackie a.,"Van Nuys, CA",7,100,80,4.0,4/2/2014,"Love this place, has good for everybody. My favorite dish is the chicken costoletta I really love the lemon sauce. Only thing I dislike about this place is there's almost always a wait and the floors are so slippery."
Monica G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,,2.0,12/27/2014,"Have been here probably at least 100 times and always had great experience. Today however, walked in and run into the hostess that was extremely rude. When I told her how rude she was, she actually got more rude. The food was great as usual."
Cindy P.,"Burbank, CA",4,52,65,1.0,1/5/2014,"Service here sucks!!!!!!!!! Waitress Amy has forgotten to bring our bread! We ordered coffee and the tray that holds the sugar, does not have regular sugar.  (I am so annoyed). Hopefully the food makes up for it. We will see. To be continued......"
Strmich H.,"San Fernando, CA",54,5,,1.0,1/19/2015,Love Cheesecake Factory but I'm giving them 1 star because of the horrible service. If you get a waiter by the name of Christian ask to be seated somewhere else. He absolutely had no manners and was totally rude!!  This guy ruined my lunch and will not be returning here. He's a total EFFIN douch!!!
Mahogany C.,"Arleta, CA",278,134,253,5.0,12/22/2013,"Came here on a date recently! As always good food, great service...... If you're into martinis try the dirty martinis with the blue cheese stuffed olives!"
Gabriel D.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,43,10,3.0,10/7/2012,"It's the Cheesecake Factory - if you haven't been, they have really good cheesecake and decent food in a nicer atmosphere that is supplemented by slightly higher prices. It is still a casual dining chain restaurant, but leans more toward the formal than informal atmosphere.  At our recent visit to the Cheesecake Factory in Sherman Oaks, the service and food was well.  Initially we were sat at a table that wouldn't accommodate our two small kids, and the manager was quick to respond by offering us a better table with no additional wait (despite the full dining room).  The food was good, the caramelized onions in my ""Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic"" were more burnt than caramelized, but otherwise everything  was good. If you're in the area and in the mood for Cheesecake, go here - and if you're in the mood for pasta it's always a solid choice (WAY over Olive Garden...)"
Beth K.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/20/2015,"Disabled people should avoid. The staff is inconsiderate, oblivious to those who cannot stand for the interminable wait for a table. Management needs to send everyone to sensitivity training and to revise their procedures for those who must sit and wait.its unfortunate because we made a special trip for the breakfast burrito!"
Jessica S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",79,35,9,4.0,3/25/2012,I am not usuallly a fan of chain restuarnts but this is a great one for people who don't have that appreciation for fine cuisine. Perfect for groups! I am gluten and dairy free and the staff did a pretty good job of finding me something edible. I had the skinny chicken tacos...pretty bomb for chain! And they do have a pretty legit wine list.  Not a romantic desitnation or somewhere my man and I will frequent but perfect for when friends and family are in town.
Amy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,74,22,1.0,9/11/2013,"This is solely customer service based. The staff at this particular Cheesecake Factory are rude and don't understand that they work in a costumer satisfactory based business.  I would not recommend placing any type of to go order either, as they apparently are not capable of being even remotely service based or useful over the phone!  I even asked to speak to a manager who clearly reflected why his staff was the same way, rude!"
Karina A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,7,5,3.0,8/12/2014,"I have to say that I like their food- 5 stars and find the waiting staff to be very pleasant and professional. What I do have a problem with is almost every time I go there they have dirty dishes, whether its a plate or glass, but something is always dirty which obviously ruins the experience. I think management should work on that. The hostesses could have a better attitude and I understand that sometimes they are extremely busy and overwhelmed, but customers do not need to see or hear their complaints about how tough life is. Keep those conversations away from the guests."
Tayler E.,"ENCINO, CA",12,63,6,3.0,9/6/2013,"I usually always go to this location because its right in the galleria and i can hit the movies after. I like this one its pretty cool, its not as good as the woodland hills location but its good. Only problem i had the other day is for happy hour its suppose to be self seating but i guess they wanted to sit us? well they sat us at a table where either me or my boyfriend couldn't  watch the TV. (first football game) So we moved over to the table next to us so we can sit side by side. After 30 minutes sitting we got our food and the manager comes over and says hey guys i need you to move back to the table we sat you at we need to sit a party of four and walks off. were like okay maybe you guys could've just told us that way before we ordered drinks and food and now you want me to pick up a hot plate and move back to the other table. like this is the only four top seat in the restaurant. i sat for a second and he comes back again and says hey i need you two to move now please. i kindly snapped back and said well we would like help moving our plates over because we don't work here. Overall, i feel like he did not need to do all that especially since we were in happy hour area and we were in the middle of eating. The managers here seem to make poor decisions when it comes to satisfying customers.  Also, another time they allowed a homeless woman to sit down right near us in the bar area and she smelled horrid like urine really bad the couple next to us said they lost their appetite and so did my boyfriend. she was not buying anything and i don't discriminate but this is a restaurant and if she is filthy no telling what germs she could be bringing in while people are sitting right next to her eating. thats extremely unsanitary.  Overall i will go here again i just hope none of the managers makes dumb decisions."
Briget P.,"East Bay, CA",1071,988,157,4.0,11/9/2009,"Located inside of the Sherman Oaks Galleria, nice for family dinners and outings. Always loved Cheesecake Factory's mashed potatoes! Yum to perfection. I ordered the combination dish of steak and chicken, just the right amount of portions. Service is attentive and friendly.  I went here on a Saturday night and the wait was approximately 40 minutes so we went down to the Townhouse Kitchen & Bar (couple stores down) to grab a few drinks while waiting for the beeper to go off. This way you can make good use of dead time."
Monica B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",7,104,37,2.0,6/11/2012,"I've been to a few Cheesecake Factory restaurants in various locations over the last few years, but after my most recent experience, I was left wanting something better.  We were there to celebrate a special occasion over lunch. There was about a 20 minute wait and we were seated in a not-so-great part of the restaurant. The music over the speakers was louder than necessary and the environment overall was very loud.  Our server was friendly. The food was unremarkable.  Our meals can be had at other restaurants for a cheaper price and better taste. The cheesecakes we had were just not that special. The server removed a plate from another party seated next to me and took my plate to put the leftovers in a box. She returned to the other party and gave them my leftovers. Hmmmm... I know it was very busy and she probably did not realize what she did. Also, my water glass was empty for too long before it was refilled. I saw another server set the table next to us for the next group of guests, and I didn't recall seeing the table wiped down before the silverware and plates were placed on the table- again, people are in a hurry.  Overall, nothing was that bad about this place, just not special enough to go back there again."
