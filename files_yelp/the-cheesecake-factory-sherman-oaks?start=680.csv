Kevin H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",4,9,2,4.0,5/7/2014,"Good food, bit pricey, sometimes mess up order when picking up large order. But most the time good."
Shay S.,"Los Angeles, CA",98,75,48,3.0,10/19/2013,"It is a nice place to hang out at with your friends. Service is good, management is usually good and food is always impeccable! My favorite drink and favorite dish were both removed from the menu :( my drink was The Very Berry smoothie and our waiter and bartender both tried to make a drink for me that would taste as close to it as possible... 5 stars for that effort;)  The new manager (5.5, female, mid 30s , dark brown or black hair) is horrible! All other waiter and waitresses are usually very professional."
John T.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",103,103,43,5.0,3/24/2014,Great food. Great atmosphere. Great service.  Their menu makes War and Peace look like a doctor's office pamphlet. It's friggin HUGE! My favorite items are: Avocado Spring Rolls. Mac and Cheese Balls. California Omelet. Gargantuan salads. Low Carb Cheesecake. They do great shakes too. I know alot of foodies turn their noses up at corporate establishments like this but I like to judge food by what it tastes like and not where it comes from and the food here is routinely good to great.   I come here a lot for lunch. Always have a happy experience. The tables in the bar area are first-come-first-serve so you don't have to wait to be seated.
Angela T.,"Van Nuys, CA",2,6,,1.0,5/17/2015,"I've been coming to this Cheesecake for years and I've always been served the absolute best meals accompanied by the best service, which makes writing this review a bit painful. I came to have an early dinner with my parents and we were seated quickly on the outside patio which was quite empty. Our server whose name was Nora and who's the reason why I'm writing this review, was extremely rude and needs another class on how to deal with customers. She didn't greet us, or even make eye contact. She seemed irritated. She asked what we wanted to drink and then our food order. She gave us bread that was sitting on ANOTHER TABLE, so it goes without say that the bread was cold and stale. We ordered soup as our appetizer and she brought that in about 10 minutes. As we're waiting for our food, the outside patio begins to get full and we see people ordering their meals and receiving them shortly after. 40 minutes pass and we call her over and ask her to check on our food. We didn't even know if she acknowledged our question or not because she just walked away. I then noticed her walking to the register and imputing something in the computer. (perhaps our order that she forgot to put in 45 minutes ago?) She comes back 5 minutes later and says the food should be coming out shortly. My father asks her for paper napkins and she looks at him and says, ""Anything I could bring you while you're waiting?"", my father repeats again, ""Paper napkins please"" and she turns her head away and rolls her eyes. Another glorious 15 minutes pass and we see her walking to our table with my mothers and fathers food. She tells me that she's going to go bring mine now. My father ordered his usual plate which was a jambalaya pasta, but it looked more so like a jambalaya soup. He specifically asked for no onions but behold! There were onions. I won't even bother saying how long I had to wait for my food to come, but let's just say my parents were already finished with their food. (What was the point of a family dinner again?). The manager or whoever it was who brought out my food, said my steak Diane was over cooked and that they had to remake it. He said he would take it off the check, which he did. Very long story short, I work in the retail industry which is quite similar to the food industry and we all have our bad days but we never throw it out on our customers. What was supposed to be an enjoyable family dinner, turned into nothing but frustration and anger, and not the best dishes. All I ask, is for better customer service. I don't need meals to be comped off (although it was appreciated), but for servers to show RECOGNITION towards their customers. All in all, extremely disappointed in how we were treated by our server and the kitchen staff with our food."
Amanda G.,"STUDIO CITY, CA",228,163,100,1.0,9/26/2011,"From start to finish... a dining disappointment. It's true. I love the Cheesecake Factory which is why it pains me to write about my most recent experience. I frequent many other CFs in the area, but I will not be returning to this location again. The Happy Hour at the Cheesecake Factory is great. There are tons of items for $5 or under including beer, wine and a few cocktails. We sat down at a high top in the bar at 5:05. Fast forward to 5:25 and I finally walk over to a manger and ask if I should order from the bar or if I should expect to see our server soon. He apologized (actually he said, oh let me check on that) and a server came over. She introduced herself and told us that although she was not our server, she would be happy to get us a drink while we wait. She did, in fact, get us our drinks and even put in our appetizer. The bread came out - we had no plates. The appetizer came out - we had no silverware. You get the drift... We were anxious to get out of there and asked for our bill. We give her the credit card and she runs our card for a $60 bill. I bring it to the attention of the manager, he takes my card and disappears. 15 minutes later he returns, no void slip, but promises me I have now only been charged for my original amount. no sorry. no comp. no nothing. Cheesecake, I don't care how good your tex mex eggrolls are.. it's just not worth it."
Lisa L.,"Los Angeles, CA",87,33,6,3.0,4/14/2015,"I came here the other day to get desserts. I ended up ordering a pasta after carefully telling the waitress that anything with meat (aka animal) products I can not have.  She checked with the kitchen to make sure it was something I could eat. She was very helpful and friendly. The thing that did bother me though, was that I ended up ordering a cheesecake only to find out the day after, from a random friend, that it contains gelatin (an animal product) I wish the waitress would have told me that since I was so strict on my pasta order. I ended up calling in to find out what I ate,  thank Gd it turned out that the specific cheesecake that I ordered was one of the few that did not contain gelatin.  This time I came out very lucky, but still a very close call. They need to let more ppl know about the gelatin,  I think many ppl would be disappointed to know that most of the cheesecakes contain it."
Ms I.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,148,,1.0,11/3/2011,"It is unbelievable in this economy that CF doesn't take reservations for large parties. They are very elitist and have to keep up that ""you must wait for a table"" image. For my sister's birthday, they refused to make a reservation, so were forced to wait an hour for a table for 15 people. Really, really? The food is always excellent and the portions are huge. But no food is worth an hour wait in this situation. This would make sense why they consistently score low for customer service reviews of their chain. I was going to give them 3 stars, but I decided they deserved 2. Not sure if I'm going to go back. Doubt they will notice, since there's always a wait."
Peter B.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",39,84,2,2.0,5/22/2012,"Occasionally, we will go there because it is close to our home, and the area is nice. That said, there is ALWAYS a rediculously long wait for dinner, and they don't take reservations. One thing that got us upset was our last visit there with friends, just last Sunday the 13th. We sat on the outside patio and had our three kids with us, who were playing near the table. They were not bothering anyone, were not loud, nor disruptive. One of the waiters made a snyde remark stating ""this is not a playground"", which none of us appreciated, and I had to have a word with his manager. If you ever go there, he is about 5-11 +/-, caucasion, little to no hair (Light colored), about 190 lbs. and a trimmed beard. When you see him, remind him that it is customers like us who are the reason he makes money to pay his bills, and above all, to mind his manners!  It is wait staff like him who cost businesses money. I should know, I have fired a few of them in my day when I ran restaurants in NYC. There is no room for rotten attitudes like yours pal!  I, for one, will request a different table If he is our waiter next time we go there.  FYI attitude boy, if there was an issue for you to do your job, there are better ways to ask for a person's help NICELY. Now go awa, table 3 needs more bread!"
Mariam K.,"Woodland Hills, CA",3,12,,3.0,7/31/2014,"I think their like seeing people staying outside.They had empty table but people are waiting ! We were there last Sunday July 27 and it was not good.Too much waiting and the service was not nice enough. The only reason we choose this restaurant were we knew the menu and we want to have all the friend nice time together but instead we just talked about why she is slow and how she forgot everything, even the coffee were cold!"
Ernie P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,13,15,4.0,7/8/2014,"I stopped by two weeks ago for a business lunch.  The food and service was very good, however the temperature was very low, It will have been more comfortable if the room was at a nicer temperature.  Yes will come here again."
Marissa L.,"Los Angeles, CA",321,196,3,4.0,6/6/2011,"What can I say? Huge menu, good food, amazing cheesecake and a full service bar.  I've been here several times and the only thing I'm weary of here is how crowded it gets. It really affects the service sometimes. Other than that it's a great Cheesecake Factory location! My favs are the meatloaf, Evelyn's favorite pasta, corn cakes, and the cobb salad. I'm sure there's more but I can't recall past that cause now I'm hungry. lol"
Andrea B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",6,96,11,3.0,2/19/2014,The buffalo blasts are to die for. Other than that I dont have too many other things on the menu that I am crazy about. The salmon/ steak combo very BLAND!
Lianne O.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",17,255,59,1.0,11/10/2014,"The taste of the food was really good. The waiters/waitresses were good. The wait time after ordering food was awful! My party of 6 ordered food and we waited about 20 mins and a family of 5 sat next to us and ordered their food. We waited another 15-20mins and the family's food came out and they ate. We waited another 25 mins and the family finished eating, got their check and left. The manager came over and told us ""sorry for the wait your food should be out soon"" and left. We ended up waiting close to an hour and a half. All of our food was cold except two pasta dishes which they said they messed up on. The pasta was half cooked and half hard(uncooked). Will never return!!I've never waited hours for food that was served cold. Cold steak, salmon, shrimp, and spaghetti with a meatball was so unpleasant. They didn't even offer free dessert or comp the drinks or an entree. It would have meant a lot to us if they truly showed they were sorry they made us wait that long while a family next to us came, ate and left happy. So upsetting paying $120 for the worst experience ever."
Spencer K.,"Los Angeles, CA",87,367,33,4.0,11/30/2013,"I'm quite surprised how expensive this place is.  The cheesecakes are awesome, but the portions seem to have gotten smaller over time.  Happy hour here is a good deal, which has drawn me back a few times already."
Sam J.,"Camarillo, CA",112,19,33,3.0,10/31/2013,We always dine in this restaurant .the appetizers always good . Avocado eggroll so delicious.  My wife order the shrimp pasta wasn't thatt good this time .the shrimp feel like out of the freezer and not cooked well and the sauce not even creamy . This time NoNo  for the food .
Michelle K.,"Cerritos, CA",231,120,31,4.0,8/27/2013,"Cheesecake Factory usually doesn't disappoint. Our waiter was awesome, super attentive, and the wait was only like 10 min(yay!). Also they have a skinny menu now, which is pretty cool if your watching your portion/calorie intake :)"
Anthony N.,"Playa del Rey, CA",4974,2735,19385,2.0,2/17/2011,"The first Cheesecake Factory I ever went to was in Beverly Hills--right before Cheesecake Factory exploded and became one of the more popular chain restaurants in the U.S.  I remember the large menu and the large portions.  Not much has changed.  Even though I felt their portions had actually gotten smaller a few years ago, that was definitely not the case at this very busy Cheesecake Factory located in the Sherman Oaks Galleria. This Cheesecake Factory is similar to all the other ones in terms of atmosphere--big and very crowded with a more upscale decor than most family chain restaurants. The complimentary bread was (as typically is the case) served warm.  There was a crusty French bread and a more hearty, flavorful and sweet pumpernickel bread. I tried their crabcakes (from their appetizer menu).  The crabcakes had a crunchy, deep-fried outer shell.  The center of the crabcake was better than I expected--moist and warm with a good portion of crab meat.  The crabcake was garnished with a bold mustard sauce and a tartar sauce. My entree was the Crusted Chicken Romano, which was kind of a play on Chicken Parmigiana.  The chicken breast was flattened and coated in a romano-parmesan crust.  Not really breaded like a chicken parmigiana--just a fried cheese crust.  The chicken was good.  Moist enough and a good flavor. The chicken was served with a large portion of spaghetti in a tomato sauce.  The pasta was not swimming in tomato sauce like other places--really just lightly tossed in tomato sauce.  The spaghetti noodles were fine and cooked okay, but the sauce was quite salty. For dessert, we tried the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake, which a Yelper recommended to me.  The cheesecake had a fudge cake base and was topped with chocolate cheesecake, a vanilla mascarpone mousse and a chocolate ganache top.  The cheesecake was garnished with whipped cream and an arty display of vanilla and chocolate sauces around the plate. I prefer a lighter cheesecake to the dense cheesecakes found at The Cheesecake Factory.  This one was good though because the vanilla mascarpone was light and creamy and provided a good and needed contrast to the rich and chocolatey cheesecake. Service was good.  The waitress was personable and food came out quickly.  Other servers were polite and helpful. I hardly ever eat at Cheesecake Factory anymore, but this one seems like an okay version of it.  So if you are a Cheesecake Factory fan, this seems like a safe place to stop. Parking is available in the paid structure adjacent to the Sherman Oaks Galleria.  Cheesecake Factory validates parking for 2 hours."
Tiffany H.,"Indianapolis, IN",750,1102,2719,4.0,12/20/2009,"This isn't the first time I've been to cheesecake factory but my family and I tend to come to this one when we go to this area. We have always had pleasant experiences but since I just went yesterday, I might as well write a fresh review :)  Well, the inside, is your typical cheesecake factory and the menu is the same. The only thing that sets this one apart I think is their bathroom. Never have I ever seen such an ugly Cheesecake Factory bathroom. I know it's not relevant to their food but..still c'mon you're cheesecake factory. and PLUS this branch always seems to be VERY popular. We went around 530 and we still had to wait. By the time we were done, the waiting room was FILLED with people. So maybe upgrading your tiny, ugly ugly bathroom would be nice.  Our server was AWESOME though. Charles, an African American man, was super animated. He seemed like he genuinely tried with his manager when we found out the cheesecake factory deal that says with every  $30 purchase, you get a free cheesecake wasn't applicable on Fri&Saturday. Oh well, the red velvet cheesecake was pretty good. However, I think cheesecake factory's original cheesecake is the best. The layer of cream cheese frosting is too intense and takes away from the overall taste.  I had the crabcake sandwich for the first time there. It was delicious! My family and I also tried the chicken bellagio for the first time also. It was very delicious too.  Cheesecake factory usually never disappoints, just don't look at their nutritional facts. :)"
A M.,"Arleta, CA",65,323,114,4.0,1/22/2014,"This is our official meeting spot for ex coworkers every two months, came here on Sunday 1/18/2014, as usual we sat outside, it was a lovely day.  Last time I ordered the eggs benedict, this time I wanted to try something new so I ordered the Monte Cristo sandwich, which was divine.  I especially loved the French toast!  On our next visit I'm ordering French toast only because I could imagine how delicious it tastes!  I had my brunch with a glass of chardonnay and that was yummy as well.  Staff is always friendly. I love coming here... again the potatoes were a tad over cooked, but I think because they are not cooked to order, they are probably sitting under a heating lamp waiting to be served, they were not as bad as last time though... whew!"
Brian B.,"Los Angeles, CA",226,352,80,1.0,3/27/2011,"Oh where to begin, where to begin. Ok here, we'll start here. I was forced to eat here. It was a surprise going away gathering and I was responsible only for making sure that the guest of honor arrived on time and at the right location. The guest of honor asked me a few times where we were going and I had to keep telling them that it was a secret because if they knew we were going to Cheesecake Factory they would know something was up because they know me and they know I wouldn't pick this restaurant for the dining pleasures of the two of us.  The surprise went well, but that was really all that went well. The 20 minute wait turned into nearly an hour. Once the pager went off even the hostess tried to make a joke about the wait to lighten the mood and apologized. Appreciate the effort. We were seated and spent almost exactly enough time to get situated and open our menu before the manager came over and asked the entire party of 6 to move from a table to a smaller booth. Really? We waited an hour for your hostess to put us at the 'wrong' table? Thanks. Now this next blip on the radar was out of the control of the restaurant because the fire alarm went off. No biggie, maybe a kid pulled it, maybe there's a fire, maybe it's a test. Maybe our server could have come by the table and told us what was going on, like if we needed to leave, or be worried, of if the restaurant turned into a strobe filled disco at 8:00. Nope, after enough time to get a headache from the noise and lights and ask each other questions like one of us was in on a prank we were able to flag down a server since ours was no where to be seen, maybe she evacuated, what was going on. At this point I was ready to leave and hadn't been for the group we would have. So service gets a big fat ZERO. Food, well the wheat bread was good, but that's easy to do. I've had a few things at a few different CCF locations and I can never remember what I had the last time because I don't frequent the place often. I decided that Garlic Noodles sounded good. I was spoiled by the Garlic Noodles at Crustacean which are heaven, which I don't believe in, in a friggin bowl. The flavorless noodles at Cheesecake Factory are why I now believe in a hell. My friend asked me the simple question, ""Did Crustacean ruin garlic noodles for you and are you being a food snob and not giving CheeseCake a fair chance because Crustacean has the best Garlic Noodles ever?"" My response was simple and honest. ""No! Crustacean did not ruin all other garlic noodles, CheeseCake Factory ruined theirs all by themselves."" I go to the ArcLight all the time and we pass CheeseCake Factory and in a pinch would have eaten there before a movie. That's no longer an option.  The only thing, ONLY thing I will enter this place for is a slice of cheesecake TOGO. So there's the positive in the review, I will eat their cheesecake and take it to go. The End."
