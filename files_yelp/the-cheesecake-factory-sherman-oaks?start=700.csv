Jessica L.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,211,82,4.0,5/21/2011,I honestly don't mind this place haha. As long as I get the one thing I love.  1. Sun dried tomato pasta with chicken. NOM NOM NOM. it is soooo deliciously creamy and fatty with hunks of sun dried tomato throughout the pasta. I love this dish!! nom nom nom!!!
Kyle O.,"Van Nuys, CA",68,85,13,4.0,1/23/2012,"As always, this restauraunt is a lovely place to go to if you are looking for a nice dining experience.  Not too fancy, but a lovely environment that is great for a night out with friends. Like some of the other reviews said, this place can get PACKED!  I called ahead of time to make reservations, and they would not allow it.  Typically, if you have a party of under 3 people, they can seat you fast.  Otherwise, if you are coming during 'rush hour', plan on waiting a bit.  As with most places, outdoor seating is usually first available.  They have a heated patio on nights when it gets chilly, so if you bring a jacket, outside is usually quite lovely. The only other reason this place is four stars instead of five is because of their pricing.  Not to say it's not totally worth it -- because lord knows their food and desserts are AMAZING -- but $3.50 for a coke is a bit silly in my eyes. Overall, a nice place to go with friends!  Just make sure you come with some extra time, and a jacket!"
Doron K.,"Woodland Hills, CA",626,152,28,5.0,10/2/2013,"As always, fantastic restaurant that the whole family loves. Took our 4 yr old for his birthday upon request. We were going to go to the new one in Topanga Mall but the opening was delayed a few days. Sherman Oaks location is great though. Love the skinnylicious menu but dont like having to say the word skinnylicious."
Blerime T.,"North Hollywood, CA",14,32,4,2.0,1/7/2015,"Came in for lunch and received a rude introduction by the host - after giving us a buzzer we waited ten minutes, got buzzed and returned only to be told we needed to wait (another 10 minutes) because the table wasn't clean and ready. When I asked why they didn't just buzz is when it was ready so we didn't have to stand around at the host's front desk, his response was ""I can't see through walls."" He has runners to tell him when tables are ready and they don't tell him everything was the next excuse when I asked how he then knew to buzz me? He told me ""well they don't tell me EVERYTHING.""  Apparently he can't see his eventual unemployment check looming not too far in the distance either. Major attitude as I asked if his response made sense to him considering he could simply have asks his runners. No apology for the wait, just a nasty smirk. Spoke to the manager to ask if he thought this response was appropriate - nice enough guy. He said, "" I'll talk to him."" No follow up. No offer of even a complimentary ice tea. Service was slow but pleasant, thankfully. Food was decent. My mom had a hamburger, cooked as ordered with good sweet potato fries. The crab artichoke dip was sub-par. When we left we asked for a validation for parking. Unfortunately, the validation didn't read and we got charged $19 for put parking. We had to spend another twenty minutes with the parking office to have the money returned. All in all, not worth any kind of special trip for lunch. I'm not sure I'd even come here if I worked in the Comerica building attached to the mall.  Oh well..."
Lana P.,"Redlands, CA",98,83,60,4.0,3/8/2011,"This last experience I had a cheesecake was great! First of all, our server Chad was AWESOME!! He was super patient with us because it took forever to look over that extremely long menu. He was very attentive, funny, and made some great suggestions. My brother had a hard time deciding what to get and asked the server about a dish. The server said absolutely not and recommended a similar kind of dish that he assured my bro he would like. So my brother went with his suggestion. He LOVED it!! He said the food was crazy good.  There are different things that can make an experience. At a chain like Cheesecake, service is a big factor. Our service was fantastic and the new food we tried because of the server was delicious. Good times"
J S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,59,,3.0,4/4/2014,"Good luck trying to get a table here during peak hours, you'll be waiting for an hour.  It's never a quick event, so plan accordingly. The food is pretty good for a chain restaurant.  But the place is just too crowded and noisy for me."
Mane S.,"Lake Balboa, CA",29,475,58,5.0,9/9/2011,I have been a fan since I was 16 years old. I will always be a fan of Sherman Oaks Cheesecake Factory I LOVE IT!!!
Mara B.,"Pasadena, CA",26,31,1,4.0,5/6/2013,"I don't usually review chain restaurants because if you've been to one, you know what you're gonna get in terms of food. However, I felt the service was so exceptional at this particular Cheesecake Factory that I had to come on to Yelp and give it a shout out. Wish I could remember our servers' names, but we were there last Saturday sometime between 2-4pm and we were seated very near the bar. (Mentioning that in case management checks their Yelp reviews.) Excellent job to both of them."
Kay K.,"Pismo Beach, CA",16,217,,4.0,6/10/2013,"Not a big fan of overrated chain restaurant establishments, I was talked into going to the Cheesecake Factory on a business trip with my 2 colleagues. We had just gotten into town on a Saturday night and the place was packed! Our drinks we got at the bar were a lot weaker than the drinks we ordered at our dinner table. Our server was a young perky cute little thing that was very friendly and made extra time for us even though she was extremely busy. My 2 colleagues are very decent looking charming gentlemen themselves so I'm sure that they were a cause for her attention. I felt that if they weren't with me, the service would have been mediocre rather than decent.  My portion was huge, I had half of it wrapped in a doggy bag, which my perky little maiden boxed up for me personally.  We were so full we didn't even order any of their famous cheesecake. It had been 10+ years since I had eaten at a Cheesecake Factory, if it is another 10 years, I will be okay with that. (being a fan of the Big Bang Theory, I was looking for Penny lol)"
Jennifer S.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,167,2,3.0,2/20/2012,"My husband and I are not usual customers of The Cheesecake Factory, but we received a gift card, so we decided to go to the Sherman Oaks location.  We went on Saturday , February 18 around 6:45pm, and the place was packed with a lot of people waiting.  We were told that the wait would be one hour, but we ended up getting seated after 40 minutes.  While we were waiting, we browsed through their extensive menu; I read through it about four times before I decided what I wanted to try. We got seated and our waiter was Ryan, who was very friendly and gave us great service   The bread basket had a French baguette and brown bread, which was delicious.  My husband and I shared the French Country Salad (mixed greens, grilled asparagus, fresh beets, goat cheese, candied pecans and vinaigrette.)  We loved this salad and would order this again!  My husband loves pizza, so he ordered the Spicy Meat Pizza (Italian sausage, prosciutto, pepperoni, spicy \salami, caramelized onions and tomato.) and I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, their most popular pasta dish (shrimp and chicken sautéed with onions, tomato and peppers in a very spicy cajun sauce, all on top of fresh linguini.  I love spicy, so I loved the pasta; so did my husband.  The servings were large, we ended taking home leftovers of the salad, pizza, and pasta dishes. We left room for dessert and shared a slice of Linda's Fudge Cake (layers of rich chocolate cake and fudge frosting with chocolate chips.  To the side was a generous serving of whip cream.  We took half of that home too. Overall, we enjoyed our evening, and the restaurant had a nice ambience.  Parking with validation was only $1.00.  When we left around 8:30pm, the place was still packed with a lot of people waiting.  We're not sure if the food, along with the higher prices, is worth the wait."
Maryam R.,"Encino, CA",64,164,15,4.0,3/13/2011,"I don't always love the food at Cheesecake (except for the wheat bread. I love the wheat bread!) but, they definitely won me over the other day! Brought the baby with me out to eat again (I can't really escape that little guy).  Anyhow, the waitress was fabulous. She greeted him and immediately took off on us to go get him a plate of bananas and some bread.  I didn't even know cheesecake had bananas.  Who knew? Anyone who has a baby knows what an ordeal taking one out can be.  So, if a service person makes that experience easier, they're a winner in my book! BTW, did you know you can get a half glass of wine at Cheesecake?  Again, another great attribute since I don't want to drive drunk. Thank you Cheesecake!"
Dez R.,"Chatsworth, CA",51,26,,4.0,5/20/2015,"I recently went here with two other friends and it was very crowded, but I was warned of this before I went, so I wasn't detoured. It took about 20 minutes to be sat, but I didn't mind, we were browsing the menu and looking at the wonderful cheesecake. When we first sat down it had a nice cozy feel to it, and the lighting made it even better. It took some time to get a waiter over, but he was very friendly when approaching us. We ordered a chicken salad sandwich, jambalaya, and some edamame. Our drinks were an oreo shake, raspberry tea, and a water. Now, due to it being very busy and having experience in the food industry, I expected it to take some time for our order, but it took an unusual amount of time for the bread to come to our table, it took about two times of us asking our waiter for bread until we finally received it. However, like everyone has always told me, the food was remarkable, lots of flavor. My overall experience with the restaurant was a big A+. I know the restaurant can't control this, but the only reason it wasn't as good as it could have been was the child in the booth across from ours that was screaming his lungs out. Overall, I recommend this place highly, especially with friends, just be prepared just in case you have the same luck as us! :)"
Michelle P.,"Los Angeles, CA",677,593,1665,4.0,12/14/2008,"Despite the fact that this restaurant is a chain, it seems to be a favorite for many cheesecake lovers.  A drink called chocolate monkey, the endive pecan salad, and pumpkin cheesecake made up for my less than perfect fettuccine with sun-dried tomatoes. Our waiter was friendly, and attentive, and it made for a perfect sunday-afternoon lunch with the girls.  It's not the best for a romantic dinner (all of them seem to be too noisy and crowded), but it's a nice place for family or friends to gather."
Rob S.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",10,54,1,2.0,12/31/2013,Bad service and cold calamari. Waitress forgot to put our order in. Then blamed the kitchen when it took another twenty minutes. I normally like Cheesecake Factory but this location is the pits!!!
M M.,"Long Beach, CA",2,17,4,5.0,2/17/2015,"I've been here many times and have never had a bad experience. Yummy food and the servers are great, too!"
Rox G.,"Sun Valley, CA",104,310,583,4.0,8/10/2011,"I really want to hate cheesecake factory because of the whole chain restaurant thing, but the truth is I am yet to try a dish I don't like there.  Gosh darnit the food is just too good. This location is definitely a good one and the service is really good.  They were nice enough to go out of their way to give me an all day validation card because I told them I lost mine and dreaded paying $20 for a lost ticket.  I guess the only downside to going here is the parking I hate pulling into that huge parking lot and seeing nothing but compact spots full of SUV's.  And there's this semi-awkward walk from the car to the restaurant because there's a 24 hour fitness in the same shopping center so as you're on your way to stuff your face, there are gym junkies coming right atcha subliminally reminding you what you should be doing instead."
Robert H.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,57,,5.0,5/12/2014,Took me wife here for a Mothers Day treat on Sat to avoid Sunday crowds to my surprise it was a 35 minute wait so we were handed a pager and to my surprise we only waited 5 minutes!  Next we were seated outdoors in a confortable small area next to singer Brandi! Pretty cool as I loved her music. Next we were greated by the sweetest waitress Kelly W. she was great her attitude was awesome even while she was responsible for caring for other patrons she made us feel as if we were the only ones. Refills were pletny and her concern over a little overcooked filet was awesome even after I assured her it was ok...Would I go back yes if my wallet was a little fuller and we could get  the same waitress. Way to go Cheesecake Factory I usually never give 5 stars!
Brian C.,"Encino, CA",163,545,207,5.0,1/17/2012,This place gets packed at lunch time. Sit in the bar area for the fastest seating. Try the new Skinnylicious menu to cut calories. I ordered the Turkey Burger and side salad. Yum. The Patty was delicious and the smaller bun took away the guilt.  I also ordered Cheesecake to take home which I just remembered is still in the fridge!!!    Yikes...  I better go eat it! Don't forget to have your parking validated and visit the Urban Home next store. Love their Home furnishings and stuff!  Hate the mall.
Mary S.,"San Francisco, CA",130,68,10,2.0,5/17/2011,"What do food poisoning, a horrible waiter, and crappy food all have in common? CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!! Now I'm not actually saying that all Cheesecake Factories are bad. I've actually been to a few that I really enjoyed. But the one in Sherman Oaks is the worst! It began when I arrived with a group of about 8 and we had to wait 45 minutes for a table at 10pm at night. We finally sat down and when our waiter found out that two people in our party worked at a different CF he proceeded to ignore us the rest of the night (assuming that our friends would take over his duties). When he was asked if we could get the employee discount he said he would check with his manager and let us know, but he said that it should be fine. He took our order and disappeared. Everyone's food came out at different times including a pizza that didn't arrive for almost 20 minutes past everyone else's food (which was now getting cold). I ordered the hummus and it was horrible. Bits of raw garlic in there that gave it a pungent taste. The waiter arrived at the very end to hand us our check and then informed us that we wouldn't be getting the discount. We figured out our bill, gave him our cards, and then waited 30 more minutes to get them back. We signed (had to pay automatic gratuity even though the service was horrible) and got the hell out of there. If you really love Cheesecake Factory food, then I suggest getting it to go and skip the hassle of crappy service. Oh, and both of my roommates got food poisoning that night. Stay away from the pizza and popcorn shrimp ;)."
Katrina O.,"Studio City, CA",3,7,,5.0,6/12/2011,"My favorite thing about cheesecake factory is the basket of warm brown bread they serve for free!  The portion of the food is very generous and well worth the price.  And for dessert, I recommend the strawberry shortcake. One drawback would be the wait time one will frequently encounter. But if you come for lunch, it should be fine."
