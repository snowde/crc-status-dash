Fred B.,"Glendale, CA",507,122,,4.0,8/3/2011,"I'm a regular at the Cheesecake...  Which explains all those extra calories I can never burn off. Last night, we walked in around 10:45 right on the heels of an 11pm closing time.  We did not get hassled and didn't get any weird looks.  It was almost like they were happy we were there!  I ordered the Luau salad for the first time to try it out as a light meal that late into the night.  It comes with grilled chicken breast and some won-tons(spelling??) - the won-tons have a mango glaze on them which is a little too sweet for my tooth. Lastly, I tried their new Hershey's cheesecake.  Very chocolatey and very sweet - but very good!"
Demetrius G.,"Encino, CA",0,57,1,1.0,12/29/2012,"No reservations. That's fine. Our party of 8 got there at 7 pm. They promised they'd seat us as soon as possible. Lies. Instead of putting adjacent tables on hold when they cleared up, they kept seating smaller parties ahead of us. (Desperate, money-hungry liars!) 9:55 pm we were still waiting out in the cold. We finally left, but of course every other restaurant was closed so we just went back home and ate old cheese and condiments. Hate you guys."
Eric L.,"North Hills, CA",93,126,93,4.0,9/13/2013,Great atmosphere always fast good service the food is pretty good the portions are very large and not cheap. Great for big groups and party's  full bar and Tvs amazing cheesecake and every flavor you could think of then some!!!
Meredith S.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",2,9,,4.0,3/7/2012,"I just wanted to say I have been other here a few times and, unlike other reviewers, had a great experience. My boyfriend and I were seated in a cozy private nook last time, and our waiters have always been very polite, extremely attentive and courteous. Didn't bother us too much, and checked-in just enough. We usually come when it's not too busy though, so perhaps that is the secret to having a good experience. Last time we went on a Monday. I gotta say though, our Avocado Spring Rolls and Chocolate Sundae Cheesecake dessert were good, but my Santa Fe Salad was bleh. I have had good salads there before though and shall try again."
Justin F.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",70,92,72,3.0,8/14/2011,"The cheesecake factory is really turned into a baseline franchise restaurant. When before it was theme based and added something special to the visit. I guess now that there are so many of them, it seems to have something lacking.  Don't get me wrong, the portions are good and the food remains decent but maybe it's the prices. $7 for a piece of cheesecake is getting to be a little high. (and I'm not one to look at cost when it comes to that) but come on, with the economy getting worse you would think they would avoid adding cost. But they don't, and as long as you will pay it, they will charge it. Much like sporting events!! Jeez, where dd I go with this review?? Just go, eat, have some cake and you'll like it. It's great for date night and couples nights out!"
Jeff M.,"Van Nuys, CA",76,23,,4.0,5/7/2015,"i love their skinnylicious menu. the stuffed  mushrooms appetizer is awesome and yummyyy. its filled with cheese and garlic. the banana cheesecake is my favorite with dark chocolate fudge. wow drooling over it. the mango crush is very good loved it. the lunch pasta is the easiest one to choose, cause you can choose your own sauce: i always take it with the marinara. waiting in line on the weekends can be annoying. parking is ok. the servers are very fast and professional."
Joe C.,"STUDIO CITY, CA",154,76,,3.0,12/17/2013,"Good  food!  Staff is  okay,  but needs to be more ATTENTIVE , so this restaurant can get Repeat Buisness!  Service and the hosts could  be  better.  This is where the weakness is, I will be back and see if my next visit  is better."
Janella B.,"Discovery Bay, CA",70,149,113,4.0,9/9/2011,Went here late at night with the boyfriend with a hankering for some good Ahi tuna ever since visiting the Elephant Bar with my sister yesterday in Burbank. So this is what we ordered Ahi carpaccio ( thin slivers of raw tuna; with sesame dipping sauce and some light amounts over sauce drizzled over it) For 12.00 you would expect a few thicker slices but eh...good things don't happen to everyone. The clam chowder was pretty good for being this late at night. We decided to share the Bistro shrimp pasta and at the moment we are waiting for it as I type on my Droid 2 phone. Overall the atmosphere is typical of all Cheesecake factories in this area. By the way we ate at this particular cheesecake fact restaurant due to the amount of reviews and star amounts. Happy eating!  BTW the pasta arrived as I finished this review! First bite was heaveeeen!
Priya P.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",35,24,24,4.0,9/2/2013,"I really like The Cheesecake Factory. They have an extensive menu, so there is something there for everyone. This sometimes makes it hard to decide what you want to eat! I really like the Chipotle Chicken Pasta and of course love the cheesecakes! I LOVE cheesecake =) I've tried a few appetizers from here and they are just OK. I'm not a fan of the spinach and cheese dip (In my opinion CPK has a much better one).  On the weekends its packed! The good thing about this location is that there are shops you can browse in to kill time.  Remember to get your parking ticket validated."
Pier H.,"Los Angeles, CA",238,353,128,5.0,6/6/2011,I have always had a good experience at this restaurant.  The last time I went the service was prompt and friendly and the food was very good.
Alex M.,"Tarzana, CA",56,105,5,4.0,2/20/2013,My family loves going here for birthday/anniversary events. So I've been here many times. The food quality is always great. Large portions. Service is great. If there are any delays we always get free desert. The only problem is that this place doesn't accept reservations.
Chong L.,"Hancock Park, CA",522,244,40,5.0,2/19/2011,"Love Cheesecake Factory. Its foods are elegant, well priced, huge, and delicious. This one is no different. It's in a great spot in an outdoor mall in Sherman Oaks. Great date place. Their burgers are excellent, the Renee's Special is a lotta different food for a little $, their steaks, pastas, salads, soups are all well done. The cheesecake slices are from the heavens. I can really only eat a bite (not much of a sweet tooth), but it's quality stuff and can probably get you some good payback from your date. Their drinks are excellent and their strawberry lemonade is my personal favorite."
Maria A.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,46,4,4.0,7/14/2013,Great service. Great for large groups & first dates! Plus you can go to a movie after :)
Nicole N.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",8,35,,4.0,11/4/2013,"Food at cheesecake is always great, the staff is usually very friendly and the bread yummy!  Plus the portion size wow. but sometimes there is a long wait."
John M.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,5.0,3/6/2014,"This particular Cheesecake Factory has the best service amongst the rest. If you are ever in the area stop by. If you've never been to Cheesecake Factory, make sure to order the firecracker salmon rolls as appetizer. Their orange chicken entrée plate is also amazing."
Laurie L.,"North Hollywood, CA",54,96,26,4.0,8/2/2013,It's usually pretty busy whenever I come here.  It's a chain so they are all pretty much the same.  The service is fine.  The cheesecake is great.  The food is decent.
Ryan V.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",9,71,7,5.0,10/25/2013,"This kind of restaurant for me is personally one I wouldn't normally choose, but me and a friend went to this on in Sherman Oaks about a week ago. The food was pretty awesome. What really made this experience great was the girl who was our server. Her name was Cara, or Kara...  My friend had some Portabella Mushroom Burger that they dont have on the menu anymore, but we asked Kara and she went to check in the kitchen if they still had the ingredients to make it, and they whipped it up for him. She was so incredibly nice and accommodating and just a really genuine person. We weren't sure if we were going to be having dessert, we asked some questions, she was happy to answer them, then we didn't even get any, she was great about it. Honestly this girl really made the entire experience exceptional."
Dana P.,"North Hills, CA",65,299,28,4.0,5/25/2011,"This is the closest Cheesecake Factory to my house.  While it's not my favorite location, it's good.  I have had some bad experiences, but everyone is allowed an off day. The food is consistently good like the other locations.  The other awesome thing about this locale--FREE PARKING w/ validation.  I don't know of any other location around here that offers that and I really hate paying for parking!"
Marci C.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",331,66,3,4.0,12/28/2012,"I might be a bit biased on this one because i'm a regular here; but that alone should say plenty shouldn't it? The food is always up to par and the drinks, well, they're usually A-ok. I always sit at the bar, just because I feel like that's where I get the best service. If you're going to try the red velvet cheesecake, however, i'd recommend that you skip it - i've had better elsewhere."
J J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,27,1,4.0,10/13/2013,"This place is great when you want to go to the restaurant and when you don't really know what to eat. The selection is vast and there's basically something for everyone. Its good, staff is friendly and pro. The only downside is that this place is most of the time full so you'll have to wait a bit to get your order."
