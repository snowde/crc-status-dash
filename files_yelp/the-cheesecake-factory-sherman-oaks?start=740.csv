Merritt G.,"Simi Valley, CA",55,44,25,5.0,1/1/2013,I ordered the chipotle chicken pasta and was really impressed. The service was great and the manager even stopped by to see how things were. Everyone else in my. Party loved their meals and the leftovers were just as good.
Maggie W.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",0,59,,1.0,7/16/2014,"I used to like this place, but the last time I went there the food was really bad. The chicken sandwich I love tasted burnt and the chicken was rubbery. They also seat my mum and I in the back of the restaurant too. It is strange. I'm not sure if we are being discriminated against or we just have bad luck. In any event, we will never go back. They are too expensive for the cheap quality of food."
Jana M.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",124,76,2,4.0,10/5/2013,Long wait to be seated at 830pm on Saturday night to be expected. Great service. Great food once inside. Crusted chicken parmesan and the Chinese chicken salad are my faves!
rex b.,"West Hollywood, CA",0,13,,1.0,5/24/2014,"i went to this cheesecake factory ,Sherman Oaks last nite with my friend... the worst server from cheesecake... most server at cheesecake are attentive and great.. but not this waiter.. name is jesse or something.. tall white or italian or mexcian looking guy... he never came to our table to check how we are doing or so... we wanted to leave.. took all food taking home!   no service NO TIP!  ok dear waiter?"
Oronne N.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,209,44,3.0,8/8/2013,"Food was standard. Service was okay. I'd return, but not in a rush."
Leslie D.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",57,39,,2.0,2/16/2015,My husband and I shared a vegetable salad that had about  a tablespoonful of diced minute vegetables mixed in iceberg lettuce which the menu listed other lettuces.  We each ordered chicken chili with white beans.  There were no beans to be found and the sauce was watery.  They need better quality control in the kitchen!  The manager was trying to blame the waiter!
Mich Z.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",0,22,8,5.0,9/14/2013,Have been to many cheesecake factories but this one definitely takes the cake. Great service all the time. I ordered a steak cooked medium... And it came well done (first time that's every happened) and they insisted on bringing me an entirely new steak grilled to perfection with a free dessert on top of that. Service that actually cares about their clientele is rare in LA.
Susan G.,"Canyon Country, CA",4,19,3,5.0,5/14/2012,"Another great experience. I love this location. The front desk experience is just getting better every time. They used to put these young girls at the counter with a bad attitude, however this location has changed a lot. The service is always nice, never a long wait (except holidays). I had another wonderful brunch this mother's day. I just can't stay away from their eggs benedict and waffles. The breakfast menu is absolutely amazing, but the lunch is equally great. If you are around please try a godiva or tuxedo chocolate cake. Congrats on the new skinnylicius menu by the way, for those of us who can't eat half a horse."
Angel H.,"Panorama City, Los Angeles, CA",0,14,2,3.0,2/17/2015,"I been here few times, i like the place. Good service, clean place, Food is good. The only thing is that when it comes to holidays they need to know how to do their orders right . I went to pick up my order on Valentines day. I order 2 chicken fettuccine alfredo. But guess what i got the alfredo with  no chicken?? WTH.. and food was cold. I hope you guys can do better next time."
C H.,"Toluca Lake, CA",2,55,1,2.0,8/11/2011,Every other Cheesecake Factory I've been to would probably get a 3-4 star review. My visit to this location wasn't very good. We went there on a Sunday afternoon. There was food in my seat when I sat down (obvious enough that i can't believe the person who seated us didn't see it). I ordered pasta marinara and it was disgusting (worlds easiest dish?). It took a billion years to get our bill. My husbands food was pretty good but that's about it. I love Cheescake Factory in general but not this location.
Rebecca R.,"Encino, CA",0,15,5,4.0,9/23/2011,"Only been a few times, but CF always treats us right.  I fully recommend coming here for fun cocktail drinks (or beers) and 3 appetizers to share between 2 people, and a honkin' slice of cheesecake to follow.  Their main dishes are great but have tremendous portions, so if you're going to see a movie immediately following, apps are the way to go - no takehome boxes. Very nice waitstaff too. Also their outdoor seating is great, the heatlamps are perfect and the glass walls help to keep it quiet."
Todd B.,"Encino, CA",13,14,1,4.0,7/21/2011,"It's hard not to come here when there's a group of people.  Everyone gets what they want and there's rarely any issues with the food. Staples: Jamaican black pepper shrink (w/extra mango salsa) Avocado egg rolls Lettuce wraps Red velvet cheesecake Tonight was a change from the norm.  Orange chicken and sesame chicken.  Not bad at all. Great service in Sherman Oaks.   Beverly Hills seems to take twice as long for service, but food is consistently good."
Michael D.,"Woodland Hills, CA",364,280,206,3.0,2/11/2013,Anticipate the long lines and they do not take reservations over the phone unless you are a regular with a black card. I was lucky enough to have a friend that did this for my party of 20  once .   but i was here the other night just left the arclight movie theater upstairs and walked into a 1 hr wait needless to say i did not wait.
Clotee A.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",381,40,259,5.0,8/3/2010,"The best dish here is the ""Cajun Chicken Littles"". I luv this dish with the succelent mashed potatoes and vegetables, yummy! My favorite cheesecake is....... I just can't pick one. The Orange Chicken is great too but a little too sweet for my taste. This is one of my beloved restaurants in Sherman Oaks!"
victor t.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",1,28,2,4.0,9/1/2013,I come here twice a week for the sear tuna steak and Broccoli  good stuff . Like the service and the green ice tea.
Linda Z.,"Venice, Venice, CA",18,335,510,3.0,3/1/2011,"I'm up and down on this CF. Location is convenient for me when attending meetings, but it's a little cookie-cutter. Always crowded, always noisy but always good food. It's a give and take. As with all CF's, food is good, portions are large and cheesecakes are yummy."
Sarha S.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,8,,4.0,12/18/2013,"I recommend getting the chicken Romano,four cheese pasta,and belagio chicken there great. Especially when your hungry.The service is good and never had a problem with any waiter their very friendly."
Shane M.,"Los Angeles, CA",157,17,1,5.0,4/28/2013,Everything I have ever had here tastes great. The atmosphere is detailed and complete. I have never been disappointed with this place in the slightest bit. try the samosas or the avocado eggrolls.
Rebecca L.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",35,42,18,3.0,5/29/2013,"Appetizers are fine, nothing spectacular.  When nothing else is open on the Holidays it's easy enough to find a seat but other than that I would avoid."
Amy P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",637,264,1,3.0,5/9/2010,"I know. I know. This place is an average chain from Averageville. My foodie friends would scoff at the fact that Ive even been here. But... I do love a good movie and when waiting for the Arclight theatre I needed some grub. Ya, not impressed with the atmosphere but what did I expect? I will say that the porkchops were actually very good, not overcooked and juicy, The only entertaining factors: an ob-ho-noxious ADD bartender bounding of the walls and a gay one who told me I was pretty. Aww.. shucks.."
