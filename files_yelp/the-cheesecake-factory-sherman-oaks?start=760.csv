Oonariina O.,"TARZANA, CA",2,3,,4.0,11/13/2013,Had a nice dinner with my friend on Friday night and although the restaurant was packed and we waited about 25 minutes the waiter was extremely nice and friendly. He was telling us jokes and really made us feel like we were important. Fish tacos were amazing. We also had two pieces of cheesecake and took the other home.
Todd G.,"Van Nuys, CA",35,160,18,4.0,2/8/2011,"I love The Cheesecake Factory. They are aittle pricey, i always get the orange chicken....i believe its $14 bucks, i mean it is orange chicken....ORANGE CHICKEN!!! but it is so good and they give you alot. The waiting isnt so bad, you will probably 15-20 mins but it goes by fast. The parking is a hassle cause you have to park far away in the lot and walk but its worth it."
Morgan W.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",59,160,19,2.0,3/26/2012,"I was here yesterday and we had just finished our meals when the power went out. I understand this can raise some issues, so I am more then happy to allow for more time for things to happen, but this was a bit much. So the power goes out and 20 minutes later a runner comes to let us know our server will bring us our check shortly. At that time we asked him if we could please order cheesecake, he gave us a surprised expression and said he would be right back. Now isn't that the only reason that people overpay for mediocre entree's? So that they can have CHEESECAKE at the CHEESECAKE factory. Upon his return he told us that he would be unable to serve us cheesecake as they didn't want to open the refrigerator and have the food spoil. We were all very disappointed but whatever. About 20 minutes later we get our check, no discount, but the server forgot one's person's entree and didn't care to fix it. We pay like the law-abiding citizens we are and leave sans cheesecake. HOWEVER upon walking out we see waiters walking by with CHEESECAKE! We stopped at the front to ask and the manager said he had changed his mind and would we like to purchase some to go. Um no, F you and your cheesecake I will go elsewhere. So overall I had a mint julep which was excellent and the skinnylicious shrimp tacos. Don't order the tacos."
Greg L.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,13,,4.0,8/25/2013,"Tyson was a great waitress. We did get our food as soon as our appetizers showed up, and she apologized for the food coming out too fast. Their draft beers are good."
Laura L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",70,382,406,3.0,9/23/2010,"I usually come here for dinner but wind up drunk. Their food is always yummy. Lately I've been getting the chicken Caesar. I used to get the Louisiana chicken pasta but due to my carb addiction I must stay away now. Both are really good choices though, very large portions. Their drinks are hella strong. The Mai tais are deadly strong for some reason. I love their long islands better. If only their drinks were cheaper but you get what you pay for. It can get crowded so just be patient. Maybe check out the cheesecakes as you wait for your thingy to glow/buzz. The fresh strawberry cheesecake is my favorite. The pumpkin cheesecake is also really good. I love carrot cake but their carrot cake cheesecake isn't too great."
Louie F.,"Santa Barbara, CA",182,291,80,4.0,7/1/2010,"I must say, the worst part about eating at the Cheesecake Factory (any location), is figuring out what to order. The menu is huge and the advertisements abundant. I'm not sure if I should order the Navajo sandwich or a diamond watch! In any event, I've never had a bad meal here. The dinner bread they serve is delicious and usually steaming hot when it arrives to your table. The avocado egg rolls are by far the standard I compare all other restaurants too.  I've had many entrees from the menu, but the the Chicken & Biscuits has to be my favorite by far. The chicken is tender and moist while the biscuits are fluffy. However, the magic really happens when they dump gravy over the entire dish! Now we're talkin!  Now to the dessert...the item that gives this restaurant its name. The cheesecake here is so creamy and rich that you find yourself planning the rest of your meal around having room for dessert. Although most of the time, my eyes are bigger than my stomach and I end up taking the cheesecake to go -- makes an excellent breakfast too FYI."
Courtney B.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",53,92,18,4.0,7/7/2010,"""Yay! I'm a fan.""  No joke.   When I have the money I love going here.  I haven't been here for a while, but when I do go in, it's like I never left.  Good date place before or after the Arclight."
Linda N.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,32,,4.0,12/3/2013,Visited this Cheesecake Factory location for the first time. The staff was nice and the food was great. Loved the orange chicken.
Milly V.,"Los Angeles County, CA",2,105,51,5.0,4/17/2013,This place is sooo DELICIOUS!!!  You could never go wrong...It doesn't matter how busy they are the food is always great.  We always get our cheesecake to go because their food portions are HUGE.  If you have not tried it I suggest you go with an appetite.  We've never gotten bad service...you never have to ask for a re-fill.  Their constantly making sure your happy with your food.  I can go on and on..but I prefer you give them a try and see for yourself.
Jeremy V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,34,,5.0,8/27/2014,"Still disappointed with them getting rid of the Thai Chicken Pasta, but other food is still great.  Service was great last night."
Madhusudhan R.,"San Francisco, CA",12,194,70,4.0,4/12/2013,Good food but every other visit we bump into a rude CC employee... so with so many other choices CC will not be missed.
Darren H.,"PANORAMA CITY, CA",0,5,,5.0,8/3/2013,Let me keep it short & sweet first time here with my date for my bday. Food was awesome atmosphere/vibe was great. I am definitely returning back to this place. BUT not because of the food or the atmosphere. Reason I am going back to this place is because of our waiter RYAN. I am BIG on customer service i will choose to not return to a place regardless of me LOVING the food. Customer service to me is EVERYTHING and RYAN more than delivered it. His attitude was great he had a sincere smile in his face and made me and my date both feel comfortable.  RYAN you rock brotha appreciate the AWESOME service!!!!!!!!! FYI i just created an account here on yelp to RAVE about this guy RYAN.
Jamie K.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,72,1,5.0,7/3/2013,"I've been here many times and the food and service are always average.  This time, Alicia waited on us, and she was fantastic!  Very attentive and went out of her way to make sure we had a pleasant dining experience.  The food was even better this time than normal and they have gluten free bread here now!  Also, their Ritz Martini is the best:)"
pranav m.,"Lake Balboa, CA",104,91,81,4.0,10/15/2012,Love coming here for lunch on weekdays. We always like sitting at the bar facing the street. The steak Diane is my favorite and so is the hummus with pita bread. Parking is free with validation and the service is always good. See you soon
Mr T.,"San Fernando, CA",0,44,,1.0,4/27/2012,"My family and I have been going to this Cheesecake Factory for years now.  Today is the first time we walked away from a sub-par meal.  So sad to see a wonderful restaurant like Cheesecake Factory become just another corporate chain that obviously places cost above quality.  My food (Baja Chicken Tacos) was DRY and tasteless.  My middle child ordered a Mexican salad that was awful. My wife ordered the Hawaiian salad again sub-par.  Our youngest had the macaroni and cheese that was again poor quality.  We all liked the appetizer (firecracker salmon).  Myself, My Wife our oldest and our youngest all became sick after the meal.   I would love to meet the idiot with the spreadsheet that convinced Cheesecake Factory corporate to stop placing quality as the central goal of CCF and shift it to profits.   Sure you will make millions for a couple of years.  Then CCF will end like a thousand other great restaurants that were bean counted into oblivion.  So sad, yet so typical of corporate America today.  I am sure the idiot with the spreadsheet will be promoted when the beans are counted and he/she will be the one with the golden parachute when it comes crashing down."
Sebastian G.,"West Hollywood, CA",1,23,,3.0,6/11/2010,"It's sad that I have to say that this place has some of the most tastiest food that is at the same time some of the most unhealthily food EVER!  The service is nice, I've been here a couple times and caught a nice waiter or two which always seemed like happy-go-lucky people which made my experience all the more better. The food tastes great, it really does. A lot of rich and decadent flavors that really make you want to go back to this place again. However I can't go back there after finding out a single meal from their menu consists of more calories then a humans necessary daily intake."
Charlie C.,"Burbank, CA",3,432,,4.0,2/3/2013,"As I try to do with most restaurants, I like to go outside of their busiest hours.  This time, I walked in just before the rush hour lunch crowd on a Friday.  Perfect.  Dianne was our waitress and she was terrific.  Wonderful attitude and great service. I hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a while and I had forgotten how nicely decorated it is inside.  This one was very nice.  And better than that, the food here was excellent.  I ordered a Herb Crusted Salmon on a bed of mashed potatoes with asparagus. Perfect presentation, extremely delicious.  My guest ordered the lunch portion of Shepherds Pie and he said it was delicious. By the time we left, the place was packed, with a wait.  I will be going back, as soon as I can get a day off during the week!"
Francis F.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",12,46,1,3.0,11/28/2010,"I took my little cousins and girlfriend to cheesecake factory Sunday brunch.   I had gone before and loved it.  This time I was a little annoyed at first  The hostess and host couldn't decide where to seat us, and the place had just opened and was empty. After a few minutes they decided. Thankfully !!! Then they told my girl that they could make her specialty coffee drink. Always a disappointment , and I think the bartender was probably just too lazy.  After that our server brought our drinks and took our order. The food came in three installments , instead of , all at once , so we had to watch some of out food get cold. The food was delicious though, so most was forgiven. And the server was really nice."
Nena R.,"Sylmar, CA",11,22,1,4.0,4/10/2012,"We just had date night there and it was great!  its been a while since we had been there and theyve added some new things to the menu.  I ordered the Chicken Di Pana and it was awesome.  The papas bravas was nothing special, but the drinks and bread made up for that.  And of course, the cheesecake is delicious.  I just wish it wasnt so loud in there."
Tiffany G.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",2533,994,1356,4.0,7/17/2012,"Have come here a few times lately and I must say things have picked up. The service is way better and the food seems better too. You can't been the desserts. I only wish they had ""mini"" slices so you could have 3 or 4!!!"
