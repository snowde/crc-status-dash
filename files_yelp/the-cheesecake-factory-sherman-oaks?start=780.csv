Vicki M.,"Whittier, CA",21,18,5,5.0,4/10/2013,"By far the best Happy Hour!!!!!!!!! I have been there for brunch and dinner before and they have really good food but last night I did happy hour there for the first time and wow was I impressed. Awesome Happy hour choices, like the tamale cakes, tex mex egg rolls, buffalo blasts, and avocado egg rolls...just to mention a few. Great portion sizes and only $5 each!!!! It really does not get any better than this!!!!"
Henry L.,"Long Beach, CA",3,205,,4.0,7/18/2012,"OK so i know people talk flack about the cheesecake factory all the time but this place seriously rocks.  For one reason, this place is open later then all those other spots in the galleria.  We were chilling drinking, eating until 1am on a wed one night.  That's great.  The rest of the restaurants in the galleria during the weekdays close at 10pm or 11pm at the latest.   The food overall is OK. I mean its high school stuff.  The small portions are a Rip off so dont even bother with those.  The staff is cool and friendly.  But overall i like this place because i can take a bottle of wine or two and chill outside in the patio and drink and eat well whatever i want."
Nicole M.,"North Hollywood, CA",96,65,304,4.0,2/7/2010,"Love the bread! As much as I try to resist, the fresh pumpernickel & sourdough bread call out my name. Followed by a cool refreshing passion iced tea.  The menu has a great variety of food an the prices are an average of $10-$20 per plate.  You can't visit the Cheesecake Factory without trying their famous CHEESECAKE! So many to choose from & slices are big enough for two. The restaurant can be very busy on Friday & Saturday nights so be prepared to wait an hour. Staff is usually very friendly. Thanks & ENJOY!"
Kathy R.,"Palm Desert, CA",264,203,42,4.0,7/30/2010,"Well, aside from THAT bread they put down that is so good and fresh, there really isn't anything I couldn't recommend over the years that I have tasted.   So many things to choose from. Service is usually decent - the last server we had was beyond excellent. The kitchen screwed up the timing of our order and the salad came after the entree - they took the entree back and made a new one.  The last visit I had Chicken Enchiladas and they were very tasty. Portions of everything are always enough to take home. If you didn't you would never have room for cheesecake!"
Tasnu R.,"Winnetka, Los Angeles, CA",2,20,8,4.0,10/6/2012,"This place has played host to many great occasions from birthdays to anniversaries. I'm indebted for all the good memories. My usual orders consist of either chicken piccata (w/extra capers) or Da Vinci pasta (w/extra mushroom), Shirley temple, and a cheesecake...the red velvet is amazing! Foods always tasty and the hosts are very friendly. But just in general I feel like all CF have slow service. This location is my fav with the waterfall facing it and the convenience of being next door to an Arclight."
Green-eyed F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1,19,,1.0,3/30/2012,"I used to love cheesecake factory, and we visited this location frequently by ourselves and with our friends. However, the last several visits have been extremely disappointing.  The food has been consistently over salted (like, unbearably, revoltingly salty) and the sweet drinks way too sweet. And last time there was a very sharp broken piece of a dish hidden in my lump of cold rice next to my warm salmon (suspicious, no?) - I thought it was some kind of bone at first. They tried to cram our very large party into a tinee tiny space where even if we sat elbow-to-elbow, 2 people could still not fit.  Plus this location is not very kid-friendly, even though it's supposed to be! I never cared for their cheesecakes, as I prefer my deserts dough-y, so I can't judge that."
Aaron B.,"Pacifica, CA",11,12,,2.0,12/28/2009,"I used to freaking LOVE the Cheesecake Factory.  Then it happened one horrible day: they got rid of the veggie burger.  Not only was the veggie burger one of the best in LA, it was also purple from beets and served with fries and bomb special sauce.  Unfortunately their vegetarian options are somewhat limited now that they've done away with my precious. I'll still come here if I want amazing cheesecake or want too large portions and overpriced martinis.  Yes, their brown bread is good.  The decor is kind of McMansion chic and it is at the Galleria which I try to avoid now that I live 3 minutes away from the Arclight Hollywood. BRING BACK THE VEGGIE BURGER AND I WILL INSTANTLY BUMP TCF TO 5 STARS!!!"
Maria R.,"Glendale, CA",22,23,,5.0,8/26/2011,I love this place. Waiters are sexy and cool. it's basically all I like about this particular place. the rest is regular Cheesecake factory. Tasty High Carbs and sugar food. Big Plates and cozy yellow-brown chocolate  atmosphere
Ellen O.,"North Hollywood, CA",390,48,7,5.0,4/17/2010,"The food at Cheesecake is just remarkable. There service can't be matched!, I mean one time we went and our table was late so the manager came up and escorted us to our table and gave us free appetizers! Now that the nutritional information is out about Cheesecake, it is shocking to me how fattening their dishes are. BUT IS THAT GOING TO STOP ME? Never. I will not eat for a week just to I can have dinner there! recommended dishes! . pasta da vinci-pasta in wine sauce, with mushrooms! yum .lousiana pasta chicken-crusted chicken breasts with pasta and peppers .buffalo blasts!-chicken pieces with cheese, hot sauce! .avocado egg rolls!"
Alex F.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",32,176,,4.0,9/20/2010,I had a fantastic pulled pork sammich here with fantastic sweet potatoe fries.  Really it was just fantastic.  This place seems to really deliver. Everyone i went with enjoyed what they got a lot.  This place is really perfect for big groups because it really can accommodate anyone and everyone.
Daisy R.,"Palmdale, CA",1,8,,4.0,12/1/2013,"Their food is really delicious. Their dishes always fill me up since they're quite large servings! I always get the Low Carb Cheesscake with Strawberries and it's so yummy! The food is so juicy and tasty! I would recommend this place! The only downside is that it's a kind of pricy, but worth the food!"
Kirsten M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,24,,5.0,9/6/2014,"I have always avoided this place, thinking it was just a low-end burger place with a limited menu.  But I went with a friend recently, and I was so wrong!   Now I go regularly before a movie at the Arclight.  The stuffed mushrooms, ahi, and mediterranean sandwich are so succulent.  Outstanding service every time, even when it's a full house.  Huge thumbs up."
Carla B.,"New York, NY",382,482,582,2.0,5/22/2010,"***How CAN you screw up bread and a salad, really?*** The first round of bread was so bad, the table was completely covered with crumbles, which wouldn't happen if you don't over re-bake the bread. Evidently in an attempt to re-heat it and make it seem as if it just came fresh out of the oven, they ended up toasting the bread too much. That's bad for a first. But when you order a 2nd round of bread and get the same, you realize someone doesn't feel like working tonight! Oh, and the salad. I get it: this is not supposed to be high cuisine. Cheesecake Factory is like any other average restaurant chain. But for heaven's sake, I'm ordering a salad. You don't even have to cook it. Just make sure the ingredients are fresh, because that's the whole point of salad: light and fresh. I ordered the tuna tataki salad with avocado, tomatoes and wasabi. Unlike other Cheesecake Factories where I've had it and licked my fingers afterwards, the salad in this particular restaurant was NOT fresh at all. They got the cheesecake (seasonal Pumpkin) right, though. But then again, they better if their name is The Cheesecake Factory! Granted, I should know better than to try and have dinner an hour before closing time. But in fair theory, since they don't lower their prices an hour to closing, the service and quality shouldn't vary either!"
Skca K.,"Culver City, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/29/2012,"Cheescake Factory is one of my favorites restaurants and have to been to this specific one many many times.  Service yesterday was BAD - The folks at the table next to us dropped a bottle on ketchup on the floor and made a mess - the waitress didnt even have the courtesy to ask my friend if any ketchup got on her clothes, nor did she offer to move us (most tables were empty). We requested we be moved and she pointed us to a table and did not move our stuff. My friend had to make 3 rounds between tables to get stuff to our new table. Ridiculous!!!  Complained to the manager - not much help...Needless to say, not going back there!"
Dawn W.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",228,226,56,2.0,7/16/2012,"Not so happy with Cheesecake Factory visit. The place was packed at 130 on Sunday we ordered some cocktails from the bar which came out after our food. I worked at the CCF back in the late 80s and early 90s and i think they were more health conscience then.  They have few appetizers that are not fried and the rest of the menu made it very hard to make a good choice. They had a lighter menu but when you start of with dishes over 2000 calories, a 1000 calorie meal likes healthy. They need to the put the nutritional info next to each item on the menu so we know what we are getting. Disappointing the CCF caved to horrible eating habits."
Steph G.,"Santa Barbara, CA",185,93,28,4.0,8/22/2012,"I didn't used to be a fan of CCF (I know, I should be stoned!), but it's won me over recently. I recently fell in love with their miso salmon lunch special, but really, $1 upcharge to sub 2 1/2 pieces of asparagus for snow peas? Come on, now! That's crazy, it already comes with the herb-crusted salmon (which is gross). Their strawberry martinis are great. Made with fresh strawberries, smooth, and you can get a nice lunch hour buzz from just having one.. takes the edge off of afternoon meetings pretty nicely. :) As far as cheesecakes, I've only had the red velvet and the banana cream. Both delicious!"
Betsy P.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,1,5.0,2/3/2013,"I love this restaurant. It has: great food, friendly staff, & great atmosphere. It's a great place for business lunches and to dine out with friends and family! I love the miso salmon! The waiters are always so attentive. The mojitos are excellent (not too strong, just right). I also recently tried the Diane steak & it is delicious! You cannot go wrong with pretty much anything on the menu. It's always better to make reservations because this is a very popular spot especially Fri-Sun evening. Additionally, since there is an Arclight Theater within the area, it creates longer waits."
Evelyn D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/25/2015,"Went to our neighborhood Cheesecake for dinner last night (Saturday) at 6:30 pm and anticipated a wait. 45 minutes and got a pager. Asked the hostess if it was open seating in the bar and she said ""YES"".  Went to the bar area and saw a table for 4 (there were 4 of us) ready to leave.  We waited for the table to be cleared and sat down. I even sent my husband to return to pages while we waited. A server came over and told us it was not first come , only the high tops and the bar. The entire area is enclosed by a low wall that separated the entire ""bar area"" from the rest of the restaurant. We told him the hostess said it was open and he said No. You have to leave.  We called the Manager who basically threw the hostess under the bus and said she made the mistake but we still had to leave. Considering the Managers job is to keep people happy,and  supervise staff he failed completely. Being stock holders in Cheesecake didn't have any pull and he insisted we could get our pager back and wait.  Whole experience awful. Terrible management skills Carols gets an F"
Johnny J.,"Los Angeles, CA",760,61,70,4.0,5/14/2013,"Great food get the thai wrap lettuce plate. the service is one of the best, all the food there is really good everytime I go there I choose something different  on the menu. it's good for your family and friends and business meeting."
Katie L.,"Wellington, FL",287,606,22,3.0,9/26/2011,"Only 4 reviews for this place yet it is ALWAYS PACKED... I just moved to LA from Florida about 9 months ago. In Florida it is OK to like Cheesecake Factory because there are no other options. However, in LA this should be the LAST PLACE you would ever go to. Food is overpriced and under par for quality.  ""Sizable portions"" is an understatement. They overload you on the food. But only on cheap food, like mashed potatoes, french fries or chicken.  I ordered the Tuna Tatake Salad (at $16!) and I got 4 pieces of Tuna.... NOT HAPPY! I only order the Tuna Salad there because with the forced Calorie Menu, I could not bear to order anything else. A veggie burger is 1270 calories, while the Mac and Cheese buger (holy heart attack!) came in at around 1300 calories. It just doesn't make sense. BTW, I only came here bc my friend had a gift certificate... just to clarify. He ordered the French Toast- cool, 10 huge pieces of French Toast and that's it.... boring. BF got the Shepard's Pie lunch special which was actually pretty delicious and fairly priced. Overall, save your wallet and your waist size for much better cuisine in LA. But if you love Miley Cyrus, then frequent here often because it is one of her favorite spots..."
