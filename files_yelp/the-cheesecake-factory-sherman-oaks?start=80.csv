Nicole J.,"Riverside, CA",3,21,2,5.0,6/8/2017,I had a very great dining experience. The lunch special was very good as well as the dynamite shrimp.
Harry H.,"West Hills, CA",73,83,12,1.0,8/6/2017,"After coming to this location for such a long time. Th experience my fiancee received by staff from the front desk has been terrible. I came in the evening time for a meeting and had sat by the bar. 30minutes before close, my phone battery had died, luckily I had a phone charger on me. My fiancée worried had called to ask front desk to announce my name. First staff member refused and shut the phone on her face. Second staff member answered, refused and had hung up on her face. At least teach your staff to be respectful and have manners when speaking to customers. Never coming here again."
Jennifer C.,"Glendora, CA",53,23,8,4.0,8/15/2017,"I've always liked The Cheesecake Factory especially when they had the shrimp BLT on the menu. We were going to the movies on Sunday, so we decided to grab a bite before I was craving protein, so I ordered the ribeye, my husband had a salad. Everything tasted great the service was good, my only complaint was the steak was extremely thin. Just a tad bit thinner and I could use it to make carne asada. No joke."
Floyd A.,"Studio City, Los Angeles, CA",41,42,37,1.0,4/26/2017,"Having frequented this location numerous times we wanted to introduce a friend to Cheesecake Factory... Food was good as always. Our server could not have been any nicer.  After our meal I realized I left my wallet at home and our friend and I waited at the restaurant while  my husband drove back to get wallet to pay for check. I explained this in detail and asked if it would be ok to step across the way to Urban Home until he returned to which I was told ""no problem"". We entered Urban Home and within seconds 2 - two men approached our guest and began questioning him. I immediately joined the inquisition sharing with ""both"" what was going on and how we were told it was ok. They said they needed a form of collateral to which I said we would return to the restaurant so they would not feel we were walking in the check. Both ""men""  sarcastically responded and escorted us back in. Last visit."
My S.,"Farmington, NM",0,9,3,5.0,12/5/2017,I love this location! our server was amazing! The food was addicting and amazing! I had the catfish meal I later ordered it the next day to go. Thanks for perfection cheesecake factory Sherman Oaks. No complaints.
Max S.,"Palos Verdes Estates, CA",399,166,1660,3.0,8/28/2016,"It's been a while, but the food is still good. I had the huevos rancheros for breakfast/brunch and it was good. I would have it again, even though the majority of the dish is lined with black beans on the bottom. That's the one thing you can say about the Cheesecake Factory, that the food always tastes good. The only reason why I haven't been in a while is because they are always busy, too. It was pretty empty when we sat down, but was super crowded by the time we left."
Linda M.,"Markham, Canada",40,160,210,2.0,1/16/2016,"Everybody knows this place. Who doesn't love cheesecake. But just because you have cheesecake doesn't mean you score 5 stars, Ceesecake Factory! When you are keeping people waiting in a crowded lobby for well over an hour with nothing to do but stare at a glass case full of salted caramel cheesecake, toasted marshmallow smores gallore cheesecake, lemon raspberry cheesecake, chocolate mousse cheesecake, and oreo dream deluxe cheesecake, that costs you a star.  When your meal is cold and dried out that costs you another star.  And when you have to rush your meal so that you can make it to your movie on time, you lose yet another star. Yes the food is cheap and yes the portions are huge but let's be honest. The only reason for going here is for that wonderful, beautiful, cheesecake. The thing that cheeses me off the most is that we didn't have enough time for cheesecake."
Emilio T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,27,,1.0,5/8/2017,"By far the worst service from this cheesecake factory they constantly seem to be ignoring their customers went in a few weeks ago around 3 pm, not busy what so ever had to wait about 5 minutes for a table first which was fine.  We get seated quickly, and then we waited around 30 mins for someone to come by and at least acknowledge us. It wasn't until I went and said something that we got a waiter but I was pissed off and left.  My mom spoke with the manager and she seemed so incompetent to even be running the store, she could care less about the customers. So not cool and I will not be coming back anymore to any cheesecake factory."
Aubrey T.,"Quartz Hill, CA",10,8,,1.0,9/14/2017,Horrible food and service. Bad management. I will not return. 5 customers lost forever. Compelte fail. I would give zero stars if it were an option.
Kimberly Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,58,5,1.0,11/25/2017,"Food was as expected from Cheesecake Factory. I noticed while checking my bank statement that they overcharged me by about 50%. Luckily, my wonderful credit union dealt with it for me. This was my first visit at this location and if i do return I will make sure to pay cash."
Nicole K.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,10,9,3.0,11/20/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! This certain location has such a sweet staff, my waitress was really sweet but at the same time seemed very inpatient with me and my boyfriend but with another couple next to us, she asked them if they need a few more minutes... yet when she asked us what we're having she just stood there. Another downside is that after they brought us our bread, when our food arrived they just left the plates and the bread basket there instead of taking it with them. I don't know if that is how this location works, but usually when my food arrives they take the appetizer plates with them and the bread basket, along with any trash. I wish I took a picture of our table when our food arrived, it was such a small table with such big plates for the food:( next time I'll ask for a booth."
A. C.,"Sierra Madre, CA",7,85,,1.0,8/25/2017,"I have been a Cheescake Factory regular, usually go to the one near my work in Arcadia.  Yesterday i dropped by the Sherman Oaks one for early dinner.  We arrived at 6pm and was a party of six.  Our server, Michelle (mid-20's, heavy set), provided us with very poor service.  First, she double-ordered one of the pasta dishes.  Second, she never came by to refill our water and my coffee.  If we needed anything, we had to wait, spot, and wave her down.  Even that did not work half of the time, she would simply pass by without making any eye contact.  What a disappointing experience!  I know Cheesechae Factory can do better than that."
Yoseph B.,"Manhattan, NY",19,9,4,1.0,1/25/2017,"For the first time ever, I find that there is no line at the cheesecake factory, With joy me and my friends go in and get an immediate table for 3.  Took a little while for the waitress to come but once she came, she was on it.  Ordered Alfredo, Spinach dip, Crab Wontons, Fried Mac and Cheese and Louisiana chicken. order went smooth then I ask the waitress for more bread.  She brought back 5 loafs of bread and I said ""wow thats a lot of bread"" then she replied "" You look like  you are very hungry"" Not sure if she was referring to my extra sized body or if she just meant I was hungry.    After this point I never saw that waitress again.  We got our food and we finished eating.  Waited for 30 minutes for someone to pass by so I can get the check and no one came. So I decided to call the resturant. I dialed the number and I can see the girl at the front desk looking at the ringing phone. Had to call her twice so she can answer and she picked up on the last ring. I informed her about my table needing a check and there is no waitress, she said ""She will get there""  10 minutes went by and no one came, So I called her again, she did it again and didn't answer till the last ring, looking at the phone doing nothing else the whole time.  She again stated that the waitress will be coming. I told her I had been watching her and that she did not make any calls or pick up a walkie talkie and I asked her for her manager.  At this point I hang up and go to the front, ask for my check in person. My Waitress comes out of no where with the check.  I pay $100 including tip and I leave, and most likely will never go there again."
Ladi S.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",74,13,1,5.0,9/15/2017,I have been to this Cheese Cake Factory for over 7 years it's always been a tradition for Christmas and when family visited from outside the county
robin s.,"Culver City, CA",18,80,39,5.0,4/7/2017,After not coming here for quite a while and mostly going to the Beverly Hills location we had I'm very fresh Chinese chicken salad and great service by Freddy
Gigi M.,"North Hollywood, CA",2,14,3,1.0,9/27/2017,Let me start by saying this is my 3rd fav restaurant this review is based on this location In a nut shell the server was just to large for the outside patio space as a result he keep bumping my table every single time he passed by. Once i understood there was no earthquake i moved my belongings and the table as far over out the way as i could this guy still manages the waste the melted butter onto a laptop keys i had just purchased the night before see this was a business lunch that was now ruined by the careless staff. And ontop of that he shared what he had done with another female staff and they thought it was harlarious when i was  confronted by management yup u read it (confronted) it was hostile Even though i had not yet pressed one key ohhh except to try and remove butter.  I was told i could go get it repaired but they will not be replacing it WTF??? SHAME ON YOU CHEESECAKE FACTORY
Emily B.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",31,65,9,2.0,3/19/2017,"Ordered take out at 7pm on a Friday. Was told it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. I requested that it be ready at 7:45 since I was driving home from work. Got there around 8, and it wasn't ready. Finally received at 8:20...I should've gone with the 15-20 minutes. Also my food was an appetizer and cheesecake. So it shouldn't have been that long compared to what a steak would take. Fries were limp and the Cuban Rolls I got were under cooked. Was not $20 worth of experience."
Lauren A.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",122,85,18,4.0,8/18/2017,Service was awesome and the celebration Cheesecake was tah die but the food is always underwhelming. Def will be back to get multiple slices of cheesecake and no food.
Russell L.,"Paso Robles, CA",30,17,11,4.0,5/17/2017,We got a bad piece of cheese cake (sour) and let the waiter know.... He told the management and they said trade it out for them so at least they didn't say that we're out of luck. Took a long time but food was good and service was good too.
Jeanette A.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",598,15,58,2.0,9/9/2017,"The food here is normally pretty decent at this location but for some reason I always seem to get a waitress who's in a snappy mood every single time I come here. This location is convenient for me to go to but if I want to bring my boyfriend or friends here, I have to keep in mind to not pay attention to the dine-in service because it always puts a damper on our eating experience. By the way, the to-go service in the bakery is always way better so I've just been ordering to-go instead."
