Jack L.,"San Francisco, CA",26,57,,4.0,6/11/2010,"One of my favorite chain places! Most of the menu items are quite tasty and the cheesecakes are incredible. The portions are rather large too... always a full feeling afterward =) Some of my favorites are the angel hair pasta with shrimp, combination of steak and chicken/salmon, or the shepherd's pie. The main downside is that there are SO many calories in each entree... so it's not a place I can visit too often."
Mary W.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",263,186,17,4.0,6/13/2009,OMG I GAINED LIKE 5LBS IN 1 WEEK WHEN I LIVED NEXT DOOR TO THIS PLACE!

Paul A.,"Irvine, CA",700,105,63,4.0,4/25/2010,"My 2nd favorite Cheesecake Factory location! Conveniently located at the Sherman Oaks Galleria, right off the 405. I usually eat here when I'm up in the Valley...just wish LA County would do something about that damn sales tax! pushing 10%"
Nicole K.,"Los Angeles, CA",599,169,15,1.0,5/2/2009,"Ugh. I hate the Cheesecake Factory.  I hate the long waits. I hate the uninspired, fattening food. The best thing on the menu is the Pasta Divinci, but you really shouldn't eat that unless you want a cream induced heart attack.  Cheesecake factory decided to trim down the 140 page menu to 112 pages and some how decided to get rid of the Veggie Burger.  Let me repeat: They got rid of the VEGGIE BURGER.  W.T.F.  This is LA! How can you not have a f'ing veggie burger?  Let me digress.  Cheesecake Factory is for people who are OK with the idea of consuming thousands of calories before their main course arrives in the form of fried macaroni and cheese balls, followed by 5 pounds of creamy pasta, and capped off by a 3,000 calorie slice of Snickers cheesecake.  I do not subscribe to this, and neither should you.  F this place."
Patricia H.,"Pacoima, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/23/2014,Went for happy hour with the bub and shared an appetizer and cheesecake. The waitress made my first happy hour experience the best. Debbie was so nice and attentive. Definitely coming back.
Ethan S.,"Van Nuys, CA",191,61,,2.0,8/15/2010,"I've never really been impressed with the Cheese Cake Factory . They make food I like, just not the way I like it. That goes for the one in the Gallery as well. The last thing I had here that disappointed me was the brownie with ice cream. Normally, I would have  expected the brownie to be warm, and moist, going well with the cold ice cream. This brownie was a cold brick. By the time I hacked through this block-O-brownie, the ice cream had melted, and eventually I just gave up on it... Stick to the cheese cake folks. The services has been good. The place looks good. Others seem to want to go here, but it just does do it for me, especially for the price."
Sydney E.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,105,,3.0,8/13/2012,"Yeah yeah, it's a chain. Got it. Come on, this place is pretty good and the service is usually fine. The good thing about CF is that they're so consistent with the quality of their food. Wherever you go, you're going to get the same taste. Of course, it fluctuates a bit now and then, and some places have dishes others don't (e.g., Pasadena doesn't offer the pan-seared salmon plate that I know they have at least in Brentwood and Sherman Oaks). In terms of fresh versus frozen, I don't know. Honestly, everyone ""knows someone who works at CF,"" including those who say their items are fresh and those who say their items are frozen. Idk. What I do know is that their food is crazy high in calories and the portions are embarrassingly big.  As for this Sherman Oaks location, I think it's rather nice. Parking is terribly annoying, if you know the Galleria, but at least they give you validation. I find the service all right -- nothing special. However, a complaint is handled rather professionally so at least you have that."
Anna G.,"Chatsworth, CA",388,464,253,4.0,4/5/2012,Service is a little slow at this location but that did not bother me too much. I was being calorie conscious and so I asked our waitress for the calorie count on their Peach Belini....25 minutes later and she still did not know. At that point I didn't care too much and wanted to order my food already. Their lettuce wraps from their small portions menu was amazing! We chose the Asian style and loved it. Everything else was pretty consistent. I guess everything is good when you're with good company.
Cindy W.,"Burlingame, CA",307,707,47,4.0,6/18/2009,"I know why America is obese. Just look at the portions at CF. I'm not complaining though. I come here because I expect to eat one meal and have enough to take home for lunch tomorrow. Whew (I'm rubbing my distended belly.) Cheesecake Factory has long been a dependable favorite. I have cravings for the sweet brown bread flecked with oat which I can only satisfy there. Today I was especially ravenous and inhaled 3 warm buttered slices. Mmmm so good. I've had quite a number of items from its extensive menu over my lifetime, and today I was yet again surprised by the new ""special menu."" I thought I was going to order an oldy but goody, Cajun Jambalaya or the BBQ Chicken Salad, but the Chicken Bellagio pasta ($12.95) tempted me. Thin breaded chicken (so that it had a nice crisp when you bite it) sat atop basil pesto (redundant I know) spaghetti noodles. On top of the 2 large thin chicken patties was a sizable sheet of prosciutto with arugula leaves raining upon them all. Honestly, it was very good. It's not a difficult dish to make by any means, but it was hearty and filling, and the slight bitters complemented the salted meat and the tender chicken. I love the textures you get to experience. Mmmm. And of course, I had leftovers to enjoy the next day. Since I felt like treating myself, I caved to a slice of cheesecake too. I was torn between the carrot cake (which I've had and is very good) and a cheesecake of sorts (e.g. tiramisu, key lime). I came across a Carrot Cake Cheesecake... and I thought, it's perfectly meant for me! So I gave it a shot. It definitely is carrotcake swirled with cheesecake, cream cheese icing and patted down with almond slice. It was decadent. I liked it but I do think I will have to stick to one or the other going forward.  Now I am home and replete with food, and content knowing I have more of both entree and dessert just waiting for me in the fridge. Cheesecake Factory never disappoints."
Steve M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/12/2013,I've been going to this location for the past year. I keep going back to this specific location because I have had great customer service and never have to wait more than 5 minutes for seating. I will definitely keep going back. Love the Lemon celo cream torte!!
Toni L.,"Los Angeles, CA",907,873,3488,4.0,9/17/2007,"I can say pretty much the same thing about every Cheesecake Factory in the chain, so I will. 1) Long wait w/ no possibility for a reservation 2) BAD service (see below) 3) Fattening food that tastes awesome while you're in the restaurant but might give you indigestion after a few hours pass 4) Leftovers galore 5) Half cheesy (HAHAHA) half art nouveau decor which works in my opinion but I can see how it might not for everyone Some notes about this particular location: Whoa... this one actually had GOOD service! The waiter was super cool and explained everything in detail (often times too much detail). I could not believe how fast he was in bringing drinks, appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I hope he's not dead from the high levels caffeine he's probably consuming on the hour because he really made the evening decidedly different from my other CF experiences."
Shan G.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,6,,3.0,9/25/2012,"So, I went there today since I was in the area. The food was okay (I rarely go to CCF. Only when I'm in the area or during a family celebration.) Anyways the food was okay, my waiter Greg was good and I wish I could give it 5, but I think it deserves 3..."
Andrea S.,"Franklin, TN",83,61,8,1.0,8/29/2011,"This was a bad choice to come to. Our service was the worst I have ever received at any place. Our waiter took what seemed 20 minutes to even come to our table and it got worst from there. We had to stop him each time to order our drinks, food and told him we wanted bread. Told the manager and he only offered us a free dessert. Plus as we were sitting in the bar area the manager killed a cockroach running across the floor, gross. I will never come back here again!!"
Ameera D.,"San Francisco, CA",101,117,390,5.0,1/24/2012,Love it. Half way for my friends who live in LA. Food is always good. Love the skinny menu and parking is only $1 after 4pm!
Eric O.,"Downey, CA",36,204,134,4.0,5/17/2010,"Always super busy, but it's not that dull kids screaming olive garden wait!! They have great ambiance, service is exceptional, and food... Fagetaboutit!! Delicious!!! Huge selection. Snickers cheesecake for me!!! All day.  The usually get the chicken avocado club or there porkchops! Wifey tries a new item every time! Been here maybe 30 times??? Never had a bad experience!!!"
Collyn J.,"Pacoima, CA",112,150,535,5.0,12/11/2011,"All the cheesecake factories I've been to have the same taste in food, so the food here is no different from the rest. I love the Bellagio Chicken and their sourdough and brown is always warm which is a plus. Location's nice, service is nice. No complaints yet."
Matthew G.,"Valencia, CA",12,6,,1.0,8/9/2011,"Tonight I am sadly giving a Cheesecake Factory a one star. Service was okay, nothing special. Food came out pretty quick. My girlfriend ordered the Chicken Piccata which was again nothing special. I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo (Because it is Macaroni & Cheese for adults). Tonight's Alfredo tasted like fish, looked like it had been sitting out for a little bit and most of the noodles were hard and stuck together. I love Cheesecake Factory and will continue coming back, but not to this location. It is unfortunate because this is the closest location to where I live."
Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1536,1308,2750,3.0,2/21/2009,"The boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night and the wait wasn't too bad, 20 minutes at most.  We requested first available and were given a table outside on the patio underneath heated lamps.  To be honest, the heated lamps didn't really help. Our waiter was good, nothing out of the extraordinary or too bad, so very average.  He didn't bother us with a lot which was nice, and dinner went very smoothly.   Food was good (again, everything about this dining experience was very average), however, I've noticed lately (all) Cheesecake Factory's have been skimping out on pasta sauce and I always have to request for more.  Maybe it's just a coincidence, but this has happened the last 4 times I've dined at CF (not particularly this location) - just saying though."
Stephanie S.,"San Fernando, CA",17,37,,4.0,4/15/2010,"I've been to this location a few times and it's absolutely fabulous!  Every dish is delicious, from the monstrous grilled cheese sandwich to the creatively tossed salads to the fried appetizers to the decadent, chocolatey cheesecakes. The service has been excellent each time; the waiters are friendly and fun.  Great location for a date -- you can hit the movie theatre after! My only complaint is how crowded it is.  Don't come here if you want a quiet, peaceful dinner!  But it's worth it for the food and good times.  Enjoy!"
Rosie C.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",7,10,,4.0,4/13/2010,Went last night to celebrate my friends birthday. Ordered a margarita on the rocks....bad move. Waiters brings me a basket or warm sourdough and maple bread with butter..YUM. For my entree I ordered the Factory Combo.. Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon with Smashed Potatoes and Steamed Asparagus for $19.95. Nonetheless it was delicious. Steak very tender smothered in a reduced wine sauce with mini portabello and crimini mushrooms. Salmon sitting on a lemon-butter sauce was so good (and I'm not a salmon person) the potatoes were soft and very flavorful. I was very impressed.  Pros: Huge Menu Selection  Cons: overpriced cocktails $8.95 on a short glass with no flavor
