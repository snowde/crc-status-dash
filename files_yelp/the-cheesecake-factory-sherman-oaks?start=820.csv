Carly Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,3.0,11/11/2012,"Took about 20 mins to get seated at 4 pm on a Friday which isn't bad. We weren't told or even asked about happy hour, though, so once we realized it existed we asked to be moved (to the bar area, the only place happy hour is available.) That's fine and all but then they forgot to bring us menus for about 10 minutes. The waitress even came over to take our order, before she realized we didn't have menus. Really Cheesecake Factory?!  Overall, if you don't feel like finding someplace unique & interesting to eat, the food is always good and of course, there is plenty of variety. More of a family place than a romantic place, I think. & The cheesecake is always killer! Oh.. and if you want a 7-alcohol-milkshake.. try the flying gorilla. :)"
Digital B.,"Studio City, CA",5,56,3,5.0,1/25/2012,"Best chain restaurant in the valley! Faves are the Four Cheese Pasta, Pasta Da Vinci and Gumbo. If you can't find something you like on this huge menu, you have serious problems. They've also recently added a Skinnylicious menu for you health nuts."
Ina M.,"Lake Balboa, CA",0,36,9,3.0,9/15/2010,"My friend and I had dinner  last Monday evening (9/13/10). I loved their Sour Apple Martini, which had a splash of Midori liqueur in addition to Pucker. It was delightful, but a slice of green apple would have made it even better. I love chewing on those. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio and it arrived with the chicken delightfully crispy with the breadcrumb coating, topped with prociutto and an arugala salad, while sitting on a big mound of pasta with pesto. Could have used a bit more pesto.  I ate about half and had a lunch from the leftovers the next day.  My friend had a Vodka Gimlet - nice (I tasted it) and spaghetti with meat sauce... ehh, but she wanted ""comfort food.""  Huge portions, if that's what you're in to. P.S. We chose the patio seating because we could see the people going in and out. I noticed that there was an incredible array of major hunks coming in with gym bags... seems there's a 24-Hour Fitness upstairs. A little eye candy before dinner. Yeah, I know, it has nothing to do with the restaurant, but it's a bonus non the less :-)"
Mirage K.,"Rowland Heights, CA",58,29,,2.0,8/8/2011,"i've been to other Cheesecake factory's plenty of times and have received quality service. This one, not so much. Waitress did not check up on us once"
Vu N.,"Van Nuys, CA",96,71,58,3.0,7/31/2011,"Food is good but I have to say the service is the worst. Every single time I go here, the servers think they are better than the guests. C'mon I'm paying you not you paying me! Serve me better!"
Kay S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",17,58,4,4.0,12/29/2009,"First of all, I love the Cheesecake Factory. It's my go-to place for birthdays, etc.  But this one is awwwwwful. I hate that its always so busy. I hate that the valet parking closes early on random days and you have to park a million miles away.  And most of all, I HATE that they discontinued the Blackened Chicken Pasta. I mean, REALLY? Of all the dishes on the menu that's the one you thought we wouldn't miss? Not so much, Cheesecake! Not so much!"
Michael T.,"Calabasas, CA",62,38,,1.0,5/10/2013,"Worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. Lets tell customers the wait is 15 minutes, 45 minutes later, you aren't sitting down yet. The host staff doesn't have a clue is to what they are doing. The management is nowhere to be found. It's like they are hiding from customers. What a disappointment. Will not be going back here."
Cindy R.,"Granada Hills, CA",15,85,1,4.0,12/14/2011,Been coming here for my work holiday dinners every time....love the rene's special and the dulce de leche cheesesteak....love the environment!
Joyce T.,"Glendale, CA",71,91,,4.0,10/3/2009,"It's worth driving to Sherman Oaks for good Cheesecake Factory food. By far my favorite Cheesecake establishment, and it's all to do with the food. I don't know who the head chef is here, but they have a really great pallet. My favorite delectable items are the lentil soup and Seared Tuna Tataki Salad. The raw fish is always fresh and has just the right amount of sear to it. Excellent! Admittedly the service has room to improve - the quality of the people are great. This location just tends to get SUPER BUSY. Be prepared to pay extra at the parking structure. Still worth the wait in my opinion because the food is that much better. If I'm going to drop $16 at any Cheesecake Factory for my favorite dish, I'd rather spend my money here for the quality."
Melissa J.,"Encino, CA",4,81,2,3.0,3/23/2012,"The food at cheesecake is always amazing!  The service, unfortunately, isn't.  We asked the waitress for ranch dressing, and she said ""its going to be in a few minutes."" 10 minutes later, we asked her again, and she said, again, that its going to be a few minutes. MEANWHILE, we're sitting with our food in-front of us getting cold, waiting for the ranch!"
Nikki I.,"San Francisco, CA",248,335,1255,3.0,8/2/2009,"Been here a couple of times and love this location. I pretty much love every Cheesecake Factory but I've had some good before/after movie experiences here. Two dishes I remember vividly were the salad with salmon and the Thai chicken pasta. Had the salmon salad during my pescatarian kick and thoroughly enjoyed its freshness and flavor. The Thai chicken pasta was more recent and really surprised me. The portion was insanely huge and not only that, but everything was so rich and overwhelming  (in a good way). Chicken Madiera's always been my favorite but this would have to be my new favorite. So good. The key lime cheesecake is also a favorite. Only thing I am not crazy about is how cramped this place is and how small the bathroom is. The food and service makes up for it though. :)"
Georgio A.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,104,1,5.0,3/16/2012,Not much too say just great food... Same old cheesecake factory just another day.
Amanda S.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",1157,471,2110,5.0,10/6/2008,"Alright, alright. I hate reviewing chain restaurants and i've especially avoided reviewing Cheesecake just because it's such a cliche middle class fake upscale restaurant. But! It is delicious and i don't know anyone who will really deny that. And this is by farrrrrr my favorite location. And it deserves more than 3.5 stars in my opinion. Most of the people who don't like coming here just don't like it because it's not what i'd consider a 'bargain' and looking through the menu is like reading a novel that you flip back and forth in to re-read some sections. Annoyinggg. Not for me though. I have literally tried most of the menu and while everything is delicious, i stick to a few select things. 1. My favorite, the Herb Crusted Salmon Salad. Delicious. 2. Club Sandwhich. their applewood smoked bacon is the best in the world. i'm positive. 3. Chinese Chicken Salad. the plum vinaigrette is so good. 4. Chicken Piccata. the list sort of goes on, but it's much less extensive than their entire menu haha. their eggs benedict is actually pretty good, as are their omelettes. I wish they had hashbrowns though :[ But who can say no to the fresh baked wheat and sourdough bread they give you? I can say no to the sourdough, but definitely not the wheat. I could live off that shit. their lemonade is also a must. It's too strong for some people, but i'm not some people. I eat lemons by themselves all the time (i know, i know, it's bad for your teeth. I've cut back, don't worry). But their lemonade is the closest thing to a lemon as it gets. Mmmmmm. :) Anyway. I could probably write a couple pages about how i'm always satisfied when i come here (which is every single Sunday of every single week. Never fails.)  I also met Steven Speilberg and the entire cast of House and Gossip girls, amongst others. Not that cool, but whatever. It's nice to see celebrities outside of a typical trendy Hollywood joint. there is no way you can come here and not find something that you'll like."
Christine P.,"Tucson, AZ",77,12,,4.0,5/7/2012,"Before this weekend, I'd never been to Cheesecake Factory (yes, seriously!), although I've always heard great things. We went for my best friend's birthday celebration with some of her family. We went in and asked for a table for 9, and agreed to first available. The man at the counter was about to give us a buzzer, but one of his associates told him not to, that they could do a table that size right then. They got our table ready and not 5 minutes later led us to it. The party arrived at kind of a trickling pace, and they were very polite, asking each person what they wanted to drink as they arrived, and bringing us fresh bread baskets more than once. Speaking of the bread, I'm not crazy about the white bread, but the brown bread was...addicting. We polished it off almost as soon as it touched the table. Our initial waitress went on break, and had a waiter named Stephen help her out while she was gone. He was hilarious, friendly, and I actually liked him better than the first woman.  I ordered a raspberry lemonade to drink, which came with a margarita-like rim of sugar around the top of the glass. This stuff is great. And with free refills, I drank so much of it before my meal! For the meal I ordered a Skinnylicious Veggie Burger without mayo...not because I was watching my calories, but because it came without cheese, which I don't eat, and it was $1.00 cheaper. It came with a green salad, since it IS Skinnylicious, but I substituted Sweet Potato Fries. The only time I DIDN'T love the service is when I was getting ready to eat but realized there was no mustard at the table and no waiters in sight! After a decent amount of time trying to find and catch the attention of our waiter, my friend's aunt called over a random employee and asked him to bring some spicy mustard. He didn't speak very good English, and brought over regular mustard, but then after we clarified, he brought over some Grey Poupon and I was able to dig in. YUM YUM YUM! The sweet potato fries were cooked to perfection...in fact, some of the best I've ever had. The burger was visually appealing as well as tasty. It was made of various vegetables and grains, and contained beets, which gave it a nice deep magenta color. I was unfortunately so full of lemonade and bread by the time I got my meal that I had to bring a lot of my burger home for dinner, which was STILL good several hours later. I did, however, finish my fries, because fries are never good the next day so I have a thing about eating them all at once! I was SO impressed by this place, from the service to the food, and heard good things from the people I was with about their food, appetizers, drinks, and dessert. It didn't hurt that at a later point in our meal, we realized there was a celebrity sitting two tables away. This place isn't the cheapest, but I will be returning whenever I feel like splurging...or whenever someone else wants to pay for me."
Eric H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,4.0,4/9/2014,"like the salads and pasta but the cheesecake is nasty, not sure why, just too rich for us.  everything else is good service is always fast which makes up for long wait time,  great date night place.   tip: DONT ORDER TOGO its never as good as eating there, the salad was weird and its usually the best"
Chris O.,"Portland, OR",590,1676,261,4.0,7/14/2011,"Pretty much your standard Cheesecake factory and the service at this branch was good. I'm a fan of the place in general even though I don't eat most of what's on the huge menu. Things are always done well and overall very tasty food can be found here. Now if only they had a few more healthy dishes that didn't have cream involved, let me save that for the cheesecake! hehe"
Sarah A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1255,148,157,3.0,8/7/2008,"The Good: - Avocado Egg Rolls. Much too good to be eaten as an appetizer. They should be given entree status. And maybe some sort of medal or trophy. Because they are winners.  - Alcohol! Lots of drinks. Lots and lots. Pages and pages.  - Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. Yes. Yes, please. The Bad: - Obvious. Corporate environment, boring, mediocre food and too much of it, Americans are fat and lazy, yadda yadda yadda, we all know. - The ""bacon dressing"" on the BLT salad tastes like tartar sauce someone stored overnight in the gas tank of a car and then transported to the restaurant in a well-worn sneaker. The Ugly: - There is a (trademarked!) item on their menu named ""Buffalo Blasts"". I want you all to sit and think for a minute. Think of what a repulsive, horrific, grotesque name that is. I can't even imagine what imagery they wanted to conjure with that name, because I am certain it is not the horror-show that my mind has to endure every time I see that phrase. Note to all restaurants: I don't want to eat ANYTHING that has the word ""blast"" or ""explosion"" or ""eruption"" in it. And God forbid you should pluralize one of those monstrosities as the Factory has done. Those are words that don't belong anywhere near my food. And please don't even get me started on Outback's nightmarish ""Chocolate Thunder from Down Under""...."
Sonny D.,"Los Angeles, CA",309,364,34,3.0,8/21/2008,"What you need to know before eating here! This is from the persepective of someone who currently works there (unless someone from corporate reads this, gets their panties in a wad and makes my life difficult). Just want to give some useful tips going in that might make your experience better.  1)There is almost always a wait at night, espeically on Friday and Saturdays. Please come prepared. You can always score a seat at the bar with no wait but that only pertains to the bar top itself and the high top tables in the bar (meaning the 5 tables in the middle of the bar that separate the bar from the half booths.) The high top tables will be dirty, so please be patient as it takes time to clean. 2) Some people aren't aware that you can substitute *certain* side dishes on your plate for other items at no additional charge.  Make sure you ask before, as one a few items cannot be done or carry a small additional charge.  3) Smoking is no longer allowed on the patio, state law.  4) Speaking of laws, you must have a current United States government issued I.D. to order alcoholic beverages. It's the law people, sorry.  5) If you have a movie to catch, make sure you tell your server as they will do their best to meet that need.  6) Parking is  validated but only a receipt can be given as proof you ate there if you left it in the car.  7) During lunch the validation is only 2 hours, meaning after that is up parking cost 1.20 every 15 minutes.  8) There is only one soup per day, don't think they hide others from ya. 9) Water is no longer automatic because of a new California state law. Simply ask.  10) There is no printed kids menu, but there are kids items. Just ask. And those were 10 things!"
Chris W.,"Los Angeles, CA",354,53,5,5.0,10/4/2013,"This is one of my favorite restaurants and I have never had a bad experience here. The location of this one is also a plus for me because it's next to the Arclight Sherman Oaks, and I am a movie buff. I live in Northridge about 20-25min away, but I love coming to this Cheesecake Factory anyway. A lot of the time my girlfriend and I will meet here after work to enjoy their amazing happy hour specials in the bar area until 6pm. EVERYTHING IS $5!!! And the portions are still huge! You can get 2 appetizers and 2 drinks for $20 at Happy Hour which will fill you up, and if you split it between 2 people, that is only $10 a person! Dinner and a movie? Like I said, Arclight Sherman Oaks (my favorite theater) is right next door so this is the perfect place for that. The food is amazing no matter what you are in the mood for. The selection is insane, they have a book of a menu with all different kinds of foods. You can't go wrong eating here, and yeah it can be pricey... but not at Happy Hour! You rock Cheesecake Factory!"
D B.,"Van Nuys, CA",2,8,,3.0,3/17/2012,"I really, really do like this place, but there are some things I have issue with. First, price.  The food is good, but it is definitely overpriced.  As good as the cheesecake is, I don't know how you can charge 50+ for a whole cake.  Baffles me. And as for the food, I don't think anything on their menu is that outstanding, but it's priced fairly high.   Once again, I do like the food, hence the 3 star rating, and I think the service is pretty darn good, and I like hitting the place up before going to the Arclight.  I just wish it wasn't priced so high."
