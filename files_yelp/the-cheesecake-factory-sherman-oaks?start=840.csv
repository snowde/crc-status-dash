Erika Z.,"Lancaster, CA",115,81,11,2.0,1/18/2011,"I don't know why I come here.  It's very pricey and the portions are decent, but I'm not a real fan of their food.  I do like their cheesecake, but I prefer to get that to-go."
Jellie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,139,115,4.0,9/14/2011,"have been here a lot on different occasions. the waiter were always nice & friendly & the service was good.  the reason it's a 4 & not a 5 is that cheesecake factory is not a fine dining. it's kind of casual, but the prices are a bit too high.. sides of 7 to $14, main dish of $13 to $30, and dessert of about $8 is too much. have an alcoholic drink & you'll be paying equal to a fine dining in beverly hills!"
David X.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,435,1,5.0,10/18/2011,"I have never actually eaten at a Cheesecake Factory for obvious reasons, but was forced to while waiting for a movie at the arclight. I wanted to hate this place but it was actually quite good. I had a kobe burger and a strawberry martini. Based solely on this meal i give them a 5 star rating."

Jeannie P.,"Westlake Village, CA",17,80,,3.0,8/23/2011,Usually I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory but went there last Saturday and was pretty disappointed. I ordered the Jambalaya and my friend ordered the Veggie Burger and we shared a side of fries. My Jambalaya came out with minimal sauce and then I found clumps of pasta noodles stuck together. The waitress did bring me more sauce but the clumpy overcooked noodles kind of killed the dish... my friend grabbed one of the fries and realized that it wasn't even cooked... maybe it'll be better next time around.
Shey P.,"Chicago, IL",0,41,,5.0,10/15/2013,"One of my favorite restaurants and my favorite cheesecake factory!  Nice atmosphere, good service, clean utensils,  good portions.  I always get Evelyn's favorite pasta.  It's the best.  Nice place to take a date or go with friends."
Fran B.,"Lacey, WA",34,277,,4.0,10/12/2011,"Was dragged here by a coworker as opposed to Buca Di Beppo  ( i could already taste the fired mozzareaal) and was expecting and hoping for crappy service , if only to conform what i already believe. BUT much to my dismay and shock, the customer service was excellent. Since i am again low carbing , the omelet was VERY filling and huge! The side order of spinach was tasty and fresh. I think i left a generous tip, contrary to my guest's opinion. The meal was 37, i left 7.00 Is that not generous in this economy for eggs and spinach? Oy vey!"
Sunnie D.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",433,63,10,3.0,1/15/2009,"The food's fine - nothing spectacular. But tasty. The only thing I dislike is that the restaurant's patrons are PIGS. Real pigs. Somewhat, they feel like leaving a gigantic mess behind them and they dirty the bathrooms are well. I guess this is acceptable wherever they're from. Not cool, people. Let's respect our surroundings. Really. Watch out, Cheesecake Factory, if you continue letting in dirty people in your joint, El Torito and PF Changs will take all your clientele."
Amy L.,"San Francisco, CA",2,10,11,2.0,11/29/2013,"This is my first time writing a yelp review because my waiter was just that bad.  I ate at plenty of Cheesecake factory with more customers waiting in line for seats. In fact, when my server was bringing my bf and me to our table, there were so many tables open. We waited for 40 minutes for just a table for 2. Anyways, when I got to my table, I checked my plate and utensils. My plate had dried out green onion like substances stuck on it. My spoon had unwashed dishwasher soap accumulated at the dip of the spoon. My forks had bread crumbs hanging. I was appalled. When I called my waiter ALLEN over, he saw the dirty dish and utensils and took them before I could even complain. That was how bad and dirty they were. He could see them at a further distance in the dim lit room. Then he comes with my new dish and utensils and guess what??? The forks had bread crumbs hanging from them AGAIN! So I called him over and was made sure I held the fork up. I said, ""There's bread crumbs on this fork again. May you get me a new one"" and he quickly took it and slip it into his apron pocket without saying sorry or an explanation. Now I'm wondering how clean any of their dishes really are; especially the ones they serve their pasta on. Anyways, this random female waiter came with our food and she forgot the cheese so she didn't even offer us any cheese. I had to search for ALLEN for 10 minutes and ask for cheese. My pasta dish was already mildly cold when I got it at my table so it was cold when I finally got my cheese. The bread and my dish were very delicious. I was satisfied with my dishes :)  ALLEN was going around the tables making sure everything was okay and he saw us just sitting there waiting for dessert or for the check. He skipped the table next to us who were complaining and my table and disappeared off for another 20 minutes. My boyfriend had to stop him when he came back around to tell him we're done. We were nothing but respectful saying thank you for his service throughout the night so there was no reason for his continued sucky service. When he collected our plates and gave us the cheesecake menu, I didn't even acknowledged his presence and didn't say thank you. He didn't deserve it. I usually tip extremely well, but that was the first time I gave only a $3 tip from my usual $10 tip.  If you're reading this ALLEN, go get a reality check and get off your high horse."
Yosub K.,"Brooklyn, NY",276,264,5,3.0,3/1/2009,"Cheesecake factory is up and down. I guess it all boils down to your server. There are some places where you don't really need to care for the waiter, like Claim Jumper. Why? I don't know. But this place, you need to depend on your waiter because of the bread. You need them to fill up your bread when it is depleted and your energy source has vanished in the span of 3 seconds. The pastas are okay, but the orange chicken is great. It is quite Americanized but who cares? It tastes good.  I give it a three star because no matter how bad the food was, you know that the cheesecake will always be there to make you feel better."
Michael H.,"Marina del Rey, CA",163,315,121,3.0,3/9/2011,It's a chain. Three stars cause they have an awesome bar. Food tastes like the Cheese Cake factory...nuff said
Ana A.,"San Francisco, CA",3,155,,2.0,6/6/2009,"I've been to this particular one a few times. Recently, I've been here twice and it kinda sucked.  The first time was good service, decent food, but I went there yesterday and was greatly disappointed.  1. Why does it take 10 minutes to get bread? 2. Why did I get my entre before I even had a beverage to sip on? 3. My friend didn't even get his side salad until he asked for it 2 more times? The food was OK once it was all brought out. Maybe they're good on a Tuesday or Wednesday when it's not too busy, but don't try it on a Friday night."
Alex S.,"North Hollywood, CA",1,16,,2.0,11/10/2011,"One thing I don't understand is with all these great restaurants around why would one wait for hrs to be just seated and then another 45 min to get the food.  We were forced to go to a birthday party here and and waited close to an hour and a half just to be seated, apparently they don't do reservations, insane right?  after seating, took the waiter forever to come to our table and  after all this ordeal forgot bring my drink. lol, I guess you can say it was not my day."
Alex K.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",40,19,,4.0,8/28/2011,"Over the years living in LA, I've been to Cheesecake many, many times.  Their food is always good quality and the portions are huge.  This location also has outside seating which is great for a cozy evening.  The only problem as is all the popular places, you'll have to wait for a while before being seated."
Nathan I.,"Studio City, CA",1,39,4,5.0,7/25/2013,"I have been coming here since 2007. This location and the Redondo Beach location are my two favorites. Consistently great food, and excellent service."
C R.,"Anaheim, CA",46,29,29,3.0,1/23/2011,PACKED! This place is always busy so make sure t keep that in mind.  Other than that the service is great and food consistently comes out good.
Sergio G.,"Woodland Hills, CA",9,26,,3.0,6/19/2011,I had the avocado rolls for the appetizer and it was pretty good then came the Mediterranean Mahi Mahi Which I doubt it's fresh and it lacked flavor being Mediterranean you expect lots of flavor it wasn't terrible either.... The service was excellent but the bill was high for a restaurant of this type I rather go to Romano's Macaroni bar and grill for half the price and better food... The Tuxedo mousse cake was an inside the park Home Run though so I gave it an extra star for that
Stacey M.,"Lake Balboa, CA",369,29,16,5.0,12/18/2010,It's like goin to McDonalds. You know what your getting. Always yummy...
barbara s.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,47,1,5.0,6/9/2013,"I've been to different Cheesecake Factory locations many times. Never ordered a food item I did not love. The food and desserts are all delicious. Huge portion sizes. You really get your money's worth and always leave satisfied. Although it is a chain restaurant, one of my favorite places to eat. Also, great place to go with little kids."
Evan M.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",108,34,,1.0,6/28/2010,"The worst service I had in years.  My waiter was rude and aggressive towards me and my friends which was unwarranted, especially after a long week at work and just wanting to be waited on.  The manager apologized for his server's bad attitude, but that was it.  It ruined my night and feeling threatened at dinner is not cool.  A simple ""sorry about that"" didn't turn the evening around.  It wasn't until after I wrote to corporate that I was offered a complimentary piece of cheesecake, ha! Too little too late, plenty of other, more unique places to eat in the valley."
