Danny L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1095,65,26,3.0,2/5/2008,"Our God Son loves this place and therefore, we brave the experience every birthday. Even though it is well priced, even though it is saturated with food choices, even though the service is well orchestrated  and the staff is contemporary, even though the tables are big and comfortable, I never enjoy the 15 minute wait turning into 45 minutes.  I especially don't enjoy the inevidable FOOD BLOAT that accompanies the bill. But freakishly good Cheesecakes may be the ulitmate cause."
S C.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",0,24,,2.0,5/13/2013,"They do that thing here where women dining alone are banished to the hinterlands of the room. I didn't notice until servers congregated on the other side of the low wall three feet from me. Great view of the kitchen! Hadn't been treated like this at other Cheesecake locations, so maybe it's just the Sherman Oaks location that segregates. Went to treat myself, wont go back."
Adam F.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,98,,2.0,4/19/2010,Pricey. Sizable portions but very generic. Decent bar. Good for after movies but often a long wait and not worth the hassle.
Eric C.,"Los Angeles, CA",233,75,8,1.0,6/12/2012,"I have no real issue with Cheesecake Factories as a whole.  But this one was the worst.  First, I went in and asked how long the wait was for 2 people.  The hostess said 15-20 minutes, put my name down and gave me a pager.  No big deal.  So 35 minutes passes.  I don't mind waiting a little longer than the hostess' estimate.  Generally they overestimate, but a little long is fine.  We're talking 15 minutes here.  In addition to that, people who arrived after my date and I were being seated.  Finally they call my name and say ""Oh, your pager must be broken"".  Shouldn't they have realized that when they attempted to page me and I didn't go up?  Fine, whatever.  We're starving and we want to eat so we sit down.  It takes another 5 minutes just for our waiter to acknowledge us and say he'll be back around.  Then another 5 for him to return and take our orders.  After 7 minutes of waiting for our drinks to arrive (water, by the way), we called it quits and left.  Sometimes at places like this, you're just another cattle at the trough.  I'd rather go somewhere where my business is appreciated."
Misha S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,6,1.0,9/4/2013,"If there was a rate under 1 I would definitely rate that for this cheese cake factory. I went to this cheeses cake factory several times and I won't go there anymore. The quality of the food, service and the servers are terrible.   Last time when I went there, server threw my mom's plate on our table rudely and although we told her that she doesn't want to have a spicy pasta ,they made it very spicy and after returning my mom's food, she got a another pasta which was cold. Today I had a to go order and when I had my food (Louisiana chicken pasta) , I noticed the pasta was uncooked, hard to chew and there was only a couple mushrooms in there, bell peppers was chopped so big...... When I called to talk to the manager they put me on the hold for 10 minuets, at the end I told the manager that how bad was their food and she just told me Ok, what do you want me to do for you ?????!!!!!! Now I prefer to go to the cheese cake factory in woodland hills rather than this one and not wasting my money there....."
Alex A.,"Sylmar, CA",399,259,24,3.0,10/27/2010,"Ive been here a few times since my last post, and I think the more I come back, the worse the food gets or at least the stuff I order. I was craving some pizza and ordered my favorite, pepperoni pizza. Looked a little on the pale side, not so appetizing, but the cheese was good. I wouldn't order that anymore...I had the calamari app. and that was good, nice place, lousy waitress, but I would come back for some old favorites! Until then!"
Jason P.,"Sacramento, CA",211,193,1,5.0,4/29/2010,"This is one of the hippest Cheesecake Factories I've been to. The music was hot, all the staff were hot,lol. The service was very good, especially since they were really busy, the quality of service wasn't jeopardized. The food was great and prepared as expected. The only thing I do not like is how close the single tables are to each other, for the fact that there was a couple sitting next to us and the woman was just all in our mouths while we were talking and had the nerve to jump in on our convo wtf! But besides that, it was an enjoyable experience. I will be dining here again ;-)"
Courtney P.,"Los Angeles, CA",145,330,35,5.0,8/14/2008,"Yummy, Good company, good food and good service.  This place is just a nice place to hangout.  I had avocado eggroll appetizer things, yum. Went back and got like 6 pieces of cheesecake, all different kinds for only 3 people, hah, anyway, they all rocked. Yum."
Frances G.,"Los Angeles, CA",162,316,20,4.0,9/15/2008,"My last reviews were because I went on crowded nights and the service just is not as great! Neither is the wait. This time I went on a Sunday evening, my birthday no less. Our party of four was seated immediately. Our server was friendly and attentive and I couldn't have asked for more. I ordered the Firecracker Salmon Rolls. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.  My drink could have been refilled a little quicker, but I wasn't dying or anything. Strawberry Shortcake with Candles and singing? Priceless.  Couldn't have asked for more."
Julie N.,"Studio City, CA",52,288,,3.0,6/8/2008,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a while, so my husband and I decided to eat there with some friends because we can walk there from our home. Well, now I remembered why I haven't eaten there in a while..long wait for a table.  We got there at 6:30 and waited there for about 45 minutes.  Once, we sat down, we didn't see a waiter for about 5 minutes.  That's okay though because it takes 10 minutes to go through their menu.  It's like a book. We all know the food is just okay and you'll have leftovers to take home for lunch.  The Vanilla Bean cheesecake was absolutely delicious, but I couldn't finish that either. It's a great place to eat with friends and you don't want to spend much money.  If you're a big eater and I noticed several of them, then you'll be in heaven. Be ready to wait for a table unless you get there really early."
B S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,115,6,4.0,10/22/2010,"Sweet potato fries are good, as is the new chicken sandwich. Warning, it is spicey, but works. Not sure if it's a relish mix or just seasoned veggies, but more cucumber would be good. I like the thai peanut sauce on the side.   the everything salad is tasty, too. could do without the salami and shrimp. beets would be a nice addition."
Min T.,"Los Angeles, CA",427,2158,544,2.0,11/26/2007,"I'm trying to be objective here as I dislike chains.  But seriously, $16.95 for mediocre chicken pasta?  And the chicken wasn't even all white meat and to top it off, I didn't know it was going to be fried!  Oh, and not to mention there was very little of it (probably about 6 oz in comparison to the 3 pounds of pasta they served up). I ordered the garlic noodles and there was NO garlic flavor to be found in the spaghettini which unfortunately, they gave me spaghetti.  Arrgh!  The asparagus and shitake mushrooms were okay in it.   There is one appetizer I do like which is the avocado eggrolls.  Unfortunately, this CF didn't deep fry them enough so the wrapper was a bit on the raw side.  Ick.   The Steakhouse salad (poorly named as it has no steak- but we knew this when we ordered it) was actually really good.  I would call it more of a caprese salad with extra lettuce (it reminded me a bit of how Casa Bianca in Eagle Rock serves theirs).  It was way garlic-y (good thing since my garlic noodles turned out to be ungarlicy!). Someone please tell me what their CF favorites are because I'm knocking the garlic noodles down.  Way down into the  ""best not go there again"" file.  Although, no, I pray I never have to go to a CF again.  Yes, that's it!"
Steve C.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,182,835,3.0,11/8/2007,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory a number of times at this location and tried quite a number of selections, including their cajun fried chicken, pasta da vinci, chicken marsala, chicken sesame, and pasta jumbalaya. In all, their food is pretty solid. But definitely not A league material. The problem is that some of their dishes are pretty great, while others are kind of lackluster in taste and/or quality. Actually, if I could give this restaurant a 3.5 rating, I would. But I guess the 3 will have to do. In all, is this a restaurant I would recommend if you haven't tried it already? I wouldn't highly recommend it, yet I wouldn't discourage it either. The food will still be satisfactory for the most part, and it's great for large parties. The service is good as is the parking in the Sherman oaks location. But my 3 star rating goes to food taste/quality only."
Jack H.,"Lancaster, CA",114,34,53,5.0,6/4/2011,"The Pasta Jambalaya here rocks! The salads are fantastic, and the desserts are awesome! Would definitely recommend for a nice dinner date, or just a nice lunch! Great atmosphere, and beautiful architecture."
Kayden H.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,116,1229,4.0,7/22/2012,"love the cheesecake factory.  been to many different location and glad no matter where i go i get the same type of food and service.  love the free bread with butter in the beginning of the meal, weird i know.  love the cheesecake selection.  i am never disappointed."
Cheesebucket T.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",116,133,14,4.0,1/17/2011,"We love Cheesecake factory:)  Service and food is great!!  The location is not the best place to have this kind of popular Resturant because parking is kind of hard to find any enterance sometimes.  Once you find them, it's not that bad.  We love this place:)"
Sandy S.,"San Francisco, CA",25,88,3,2.0,4/24/2007,"So yea yea the cheesecake factory is known for the long gruleing one hour wait but in the end the food isnt that good. They have a great selection of foods, from burgers to shrimp, they have everything but  a) Huuugee portions and we people in america need to learn to have smaller portions and b) the food has no taste. It's just a  bunch of ingredients mixed together for the heck of it. The only thing that is good in this place is the warm bread basket , and the cheesecakes.. So for me its not worth waiting this long wait for tasteless food!!"
Robert L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,27,2,5.0,2/11/2013,"I looove Cheesecake Factory. Their lettuce wraps are to die for and they are so huge, my wife and I usually share them. Great appetizer. This location can get crowded in the evenings, so beware."
Hilda B.,"Valencia, CA",20,51,7,1.0,1/3/2010,"There quality of food keeps going down as the years progress.  This time they really blew it for me.  I will not go there again.  The service was poor, I got the wrong drink and when I asked for it to get corrected the waitress forgot 2 twice.  My order was incorrect but decided to eat it anyway since I didnt want to wait for the correction.  I order the garlic noodles with shrimp and got chicken instead.  The noodles were very plain and they tasted like they did not have garlic in them.  It was just noodles with chicken flavorless.  I would have been better off at MCdonald's."
Nicole A.,"North Hollywood, CA",4,8,,1.0,2/4/2012,"I have to say that I am really disappointed with The Cheesecake Factory. Yesterday, my dad was nice enough to bring me home lunch. To make sure the order was crystal clear, he wrote it on his napkin: NO ONIONS! I open up the box and the sliders are smothered in onions...melted into the cheese and everything. Justifiably upset, he called to speak to a manager. The woman asked if she could put him on a ""short hold."" My dad agreed and after being put on hold for 10 minutes, finally hung up. This was one of our favorite restaurants and we were loyal customers, but after this, they won't be getting our business."
