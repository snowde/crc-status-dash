laverta S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",21,23,2,5.0,11/28/2010,"I noticed that I had not written an updated on my review. My initial issue was the fact that I could not make a reservation for my family gathering of 20 people. They just kept telling me to show up an hour early and I did not feel comfortable with this because I wanted to be certain that there was space to accommodate us comfortably. Well, we decided to go anyway due to the last minute. They did have space for us and the waiters were wonderful, very nice and very accommodating. We ended up having a wonderful time and I will have another family gathering there in the future."
Herve D.,"Studio City, CA",128,28,,4.0,1/20/2013,"I've been coming to Cheesecake Factory off and on since I went to college in Boston back in the late 90s, and what I like is that while the food is similar to the types of things you can get at other chain restaurants, the quality is consistent between all of the Cheesecakes I've been to.  The drinks are always spot on, and taste the same no matter which chain I'm at, and the food is remarkably the same between locations.  This Sherman Oaks location in particular is a good spot because of the outside seating area which is a nice place to have a quick bite and cocktail on a nice day.  Yes, sometimes it can get quite busy, but I would prefer that over an empty restaurant that no one goes to.  They must be doing something correct.  As it goes with most mid-level chain restaurants like this, you hire and fire people left and right, so its only normal that you will once in a while get a waiter/waitress who is a bit slower with the service.  That comes with going to a place like this, and I won't hold them to the same standard that I would a Ruth's Chris, Mastro's or Fogo de Chao.  As long as the service is adequate, and the server doesn't completely ignore me or act rude, I'm ok with waiting a little while if it's a bit busy.  For what it is, Cheesecake provides consistent quality between chains, and there is a very large selection of dishes and drinks to choose from, and c'mon, the Oreo Cheesecake doesn't disappoint.  Whenever I'm in the mood for buffalo chicken strips, spinach and artichoke dip / chips, and similar food, Cheesecake Factory Sherman Oaks is always an option I will consider."
ruzanna M.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,3,,4.0,10/10/2009,"This location is so close to my work. Went there yesterday for lunch, and had the best experiance. The food was amazing and good service. Try their santa fe salad and the tex mex rolls. The outside patio is the best next to the fountains and you get to see the rush outside. Remindes me of New York. love the food and of course the best cheescake ever. Teramisu!"
Jin N.,"Las Vegas, NV",279,1042,1684,4.0,2/23/2007,"I like Cheesecake Factory.  Have you ever tried the BUFFALO BLASTS?  If you haven't, stop wasting your time ordering the cream cheese wontons or the macaroni balls, and try a Buffalo blast.   We all know the Chinese Chicken Salad here is unbeatable.  I've ordered their Orange Chicken, Bang-bang chicken and shrimp, steak, fettucine alfredo, and all of them have proved to be great choices.   It's not the best restaurant in California, but they have great dishes overall."
Stephy S.,"San Francisco, CA",4998,2603,1054,3.0,10/18/2006,"Never has a restaurant proven the point more succinctly that we as Americans eat TOO DAMN MUCH than The Cheesecake Factory. Don't get me wrong, I love me some CF, but Good Lawd, these plates are HUUUGE.  Even on my hungriest day I've never been able to finish one and since I am not a fan of leftovers, I wish they offered half sizes as it seems like such a waste and people are starving in...Canoga Park. With that said, order the FULL appetizer sized ORDER of Mac n Cheese BALLS with Marinara dipping sauce. My oh my oh my, can you say guilty pleasure. Their Philly Cheesesteak (Nowhere near authentic) is tasty along with most of their gynormous salads. Then there is the namesake. And that cheesecake does not disappoint. Almost makes me with I had a bigger sweet toof. As far as this location goes, it's just like any other CF I've been to. Corporate and the same meal every time, which sometimes is a nice backup plan for this lil foodie girl as you can only subject yourself to so many Iffy places in a week's time."
Jennifer H.,"San Francisco, CA",296,525,4,4.0,6/26/2007,"Any time I could sneak away from work for a long lunch, I'd come here.  The reason for the long lunch was the wait at this location.  Woo it's something else all right!  Food is good though, and the servers are super nice. P.S.  If you can, ask you friend to get there before you and put your name in!"
Patrick H.,"North Hills, CA",21,125,5,4.0,4/24/2007,"If you were a foreigner, you'd never know Cheesecake Factory was a chain restaurant.  The wait is ridiculous..I've waited like an hour and a half before I got to sit down. And then the food takes forevuhhhh. but it just might be worth it. The bread here is unbeatable. Its whole wheat with grains. Its served WARM and its really good. Its very similar to the bread they serve at Outback Steakhouse.  Appetizer you must get is the tuna roll. Its 12 bucks but its flavored sooooooooooooooooooo well. I died. The chinese chicken salad is reallllyyyyy good too. Very impressive. But I've had some less impressive things here, which I think is a problem. The restaurant seems to not specialize in anything, so some dishes just plain suck. But the cheesecake does not. Fatty-friendly."
Cindy T.,"Los Angeles, CA",190,127,55,2.0,3/28/2008,"2 stars is generous. I had lunch with one of my friends there and wow talk about the snobby Hollywood cliches! One of the servers was sporting his sunglasses AND eating and drinking as he was serving food! I couldn't believe my eyes. He had a mouth full of food, chewing obnoxiously as he was setting plates down in front of customers. If you ask me, I would NEVER allow my employees to ""sport sunglasses"" in the patio area of a restaurant. If he had sensitive eyes...he should have been working INSIDE! Not to mention MY server...we were one of the first customers on the patio for lunch (we stood outside the doors waiting for them to open mind you) and my half salad and small cup of soup took forever! And because I have eyes and ears everywhere...I overheard the server tell one of her other customers...""Your Arnold Palmer is coming out right now."" 3 times! Let me translate for those of you who have never been a food server... ""Holy shit, I totally forgot your stupid lemonade/iced tea! I'll bring it out in the next few rounds."" I'm not even a fan of this place, but we are all entitled to mistakes sometimes..."
Luke Z.,"Studio City, CA",6,61,11,4.0,3/3/2011,"I'm only deducting a star because it's so unhealthy love the fried mac and cheese from the bar menu and the sliders. Can't go wrong with those 2 vanilla bean cheese cake is my favorite! Really rich, best vanilla flavor i've had."
Catherine D.,"San Buenaventura (Ventura), CA",21,73,,4.0,8/17/2007,"You know the deal... you've read plenty of reviews about CF. I've been to multiple locations. I like this one because of its outdoor seating in the galleria courtyard.  LOVE the Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand. For ~8 dollars a glass, just go for the bottle ($30)"
E S.,"Los Angeles, CA",458,390,,3.0,10/20/2006,"Short Version: Corporate American Restaurant. Long Version: Look, it isn't that food is poorly prepared. In fact, the food is the best part of this restaurant, which is why people go, right? The staff is very polite, sometimes to the point of being stiff. The problem is that this location is exactly the same as any of their others. Cloning couldn't get closer than these copies. There is no personality to this establishment. The portions are a bit excessive, but again, quite well-prepared. Great for lunch or dinner, and yes, the desserts are great, but any atmosphere you encounter will be what you bring in."
Sarah S.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",9,27,,4.0,11/6/2009,"""Try the Red Velvet Cheesecake"" a wise person recently told me. Living in SLO of course I had to wait til I came down to the valley, and thus I did for the next couple of days. I was with a friend and cousin and were all craving their complimentary bread basket given in the beginning. Indeed as soon as we got seated moments later our server introduces himself and immedietly asks what we wanted to drink and gives us the heavenly bread. I swear I can eat the pumpernickel (brown bread- not wheat) or chocolate bread as I like to call it. It was frehly baked! omg, to die for. Crazy me coyly asks for a second basket knowing it was a death trap but I didn't care. We started off with appetizers, buffulo blasts and onion rings. A pluses for me. I ordered their herb crusted Salmon dish. While waiting for my food we agreed to each get a slice of a cheescake no matter how full we were. Our dishes came and we dug in, yummy my salmon was fresh, and you can tell as it sat on this lemon flavored sauce. Mashed potatoes were delish and the asparagus were the right consistency. My cousin got the spicy chicken pasta and I took a bite and it was actually spicy, yum! Halfway through my meal I couldn't help but think of my cheesecake that's about to come..  Red Velvet Cheesecake. I love cheesecake, I love red velvet cake..put them together= heaven! It was flat out one of the best, if not the best cheesecake I have ever tried! And of course I took advantage of the other two cheesecakes on the table. 30th anniversary cheesecake and the Godiva chocolate cheesecake! Chocolater lovers, beware as they were both amazing. I swear one of the buttons on my shirt was about to pop open and I literally couldn't move but no, I still kept eating. If you come to a cheesecake factory please try any of the 3 mentioned above, you won't be dissapointed!"
Jasmine L.,"Manhattan, NY",54,645,,4.0,3/26/2010,"i'm not a fan of chain restaurants but i am a fan of Cheesecake Factory because it's consistently really good food whether your in L.A., Las Vegas, DC or any of the other locations. my favorite thing to eat there is the cobb salad - it's one of the best cobb salads i've ever eaten and i probably would eat here a lot more if there was a location in NYC, but alas there isn't and there's other great places to get cobb salads - but the Cheesecake Factory definitely makes my list for top 5 places to get a great cobb salad. and i almost forgot, they have an amazing banana cream pie cheesecake, YUM!"
Will C.,"Queens, NY",2269,594,473,4.0,3/1/2009,"Left happy, no complaints - get cheesecake! the whole thing. This one of TCF's finer locations, the wait can be hefty if you have a big party. Give me some of that yummy brown grained bread and some butter any day!"
Phil O.,"Woodland Hills, CA",20,26,,2.0,6/19/2010,"So I still can't believe why waiters at the CF would NOT bring parmesan cheese when pasta is ordered and when you call them back for it they look at you with this idiotic face and ask: ""so you want parmesan cheese?"" even if you go to the smallest place on earth, they will automatically give it to you. Mediocre, uneventful and not staffed properly; cheesecake is OK, nothing comparing to East Coast.  Oh! and overpriced too. Specially drinks."
Zedar B.,"Los Angeles, CA",137,409,32,2.0,8/4/2007,"Positives: Bar, diverse menu with something for everyone.  I had a delicious steamed artichoke here once. ?: Huge portions.  An appetizer salad is the size of a large entree.  Also, no reservations policy. Negatives: The cheesecake is waxy and may be contaminated: scary bacteria was found in it in the past.  Disgusting!  Advertisements in the menu, long wait for seating. Bottom line:  The Cheesecake Factory embodies mediocrity.  At the Galleria, I would rather eat at El Torito Grill or PF Chang's!"
Wilder K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,18,,3.0,5/12/2008,"Recommendation to The Cheesecake Factory corporate office: invest in food that is worth eating.  Bland, uninteresting, and just not worth the effort of parking at the Galleria. Now, a lot of other reviewers here have been knocking the staff. And, true, true, true, they aren't exactly doing their job.  But, give them a break, they sure do look good while not doing it.  Every actress and model on the rise must work at this one location.  All genders and sexual orientations represented.   The after-hours at this place must be something to see."
Patricia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,44,18,2.0,10/19/2009,"Not once, not twice, but THREE times they have given me the wrong parking stub forcing me to have to pay for parking when it should have been free (I swear there is some kind of scam going on here). Also, I have received under cooked chicken on two occasions, one occasion causing my sister to have horrible stomach issues for the rest of the day. I love cheesecake factory, but now avoid this location like the plague. However, it is good for cheesecake takeout, which is the only reason I gave it two stars instead of just one."
Joseph L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,6/25/2012,"I came here for a breakfast and ordered a omelet, to be honest with you, this tasted horrible and i nearly threw up, the egg was like rubber and tasted horrible, don't eat breakfast here!"
k h.,"San Francisco, CA",5,440,27,4.0,10/4/2011,"Cute waiter was very nice and attentive.  And by attentive, I mean he was good about keeping our glasses filled.  Warning: the floors are slippery, especially if you're in heels."
