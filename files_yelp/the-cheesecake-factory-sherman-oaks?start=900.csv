Meredith T.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,17,10,3.0,3/19/2009,"They have  happy hour food specials,  who knew? Try the patio and the happy hour priced little apps. before a weeknight movie. The stuffed baked dates are to die for."
Vince D.,"Portland, OR",13,461,209,3.0,8/25/2009,"A giant corporate restaurant with the largest menu of unhealthy and indulgent food around--I'm in! I want to hate a place like this, but can't. It's almost like the Costco of dining--there's just so many options! If you want it, they'll most likely have it buried deep within the pages of their incredibly dense menu. Every time I eat here I leave in a self-loathing food coma, then can't wait to go back. They have a great bar, too, so you can leave feeling both self-loathing AND drunk."
B P.,"Los Angeles, CA",84,381,16,2.0,8/25/2009,"I don't understand why places like The Cheesecake Factory are popular.  The food here is so generic and unhealthy.  It's like someone went down the isle at Costco and just put one of everything on a plate.  Gross!  I avoid corporate restaurants like the plague but sometimes you just have no choice.  Vegetarians are basically screwed at this restaurant.  Unless you are one of those people that think Chevy's is good Mexican food, you probably won't like The Cheesecake Factory."
Erica H.,"Los Angeles, CA",154,352,62,2.0,11/18/2009,"I usually go to the Cheesecake Factory at The Grove. Their food seems tastier for some reason. We had a big party, with decent, not fantastic service. Parking at the end of the business day with 2 hour validation was $17 dollars! I hate to think what the maximum for the day was."
Melissa B.,"Northridge, CA",6,35,,4.0,3/17/2007,"This place is known for its great food, and I totally agree with that.  It's also known for long waits, but what more can you expect on a weekend night? I've tasted its Bistro Shrimp Pasta, Steak Diane, and a few of its cheesecakes -- White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, Chocolate Cookie Dough Cheesecake... I have also tasted its White Chocolate Macadamia Cheesecake which they sell in their Waikiki location in Hawaii. Their food and service has never ever let me down.  The only downfall is the long 1 hour wait before being seated.  But I think that if you occupy your 1 hour doing something productive then it goes by pretty fast.  You can even take a look at the menu sometime during that hour, so once you're seated, you can just tell the waiter what you want to order. I just wished that this Sherman Oaks or any L.A. location for that matter had a certain ""L.A."" thing to it... like how the Cheesecake Factory in Hawaii had their White Chocolate Macadamia Cheesecake... it would be cool if the Cheesecake Factory's in L.A. had some sort of signature cheesecake that you could only find here."
Sara L.,"Los Angeles, CA",167,1245,757,3.0,12/17/2008,"First of all, anyone who doesn't enjoy eating here just shouldn't go here.  I think we've all been around for long enough that we know what we're going to get at the CHeesecake Factory.  Long lines, noisy environment, consistent food, decent service.  So don't complain.  It would be like Morgan Spurlock doing a whole other movie on Burger King and then getting mad after he got fat. That said, I don't like chain restaurants.  But last night I was faced with a date night with my hungry wife who'd had a terrible day, and needed an activity we could do in the cold, ie. dinner and movie with the option to skip the movie if we got tired and wanted to go home and watch TV instead (that's what ended up happening).  Upon reuniting after work, we realized that if we were to stay in the valley (she was too tired to spend an hour driving to the city an back), our options for a nice place to eat were SO limited!  Where could we go?  Pinot Bistro, but we'd been there.  There's minibar, but we'd been there, too, and I liked it but she didn't that much.  I thought of Katsu-Ya, where I haven't been, but my wife loves it, but she said I'm no fun to eat sushi with because we don't share (she keeps kosher, I prefer my fish cooked).  We'd heard about a placed called Max, that could work, but wasn't near a theatre.  We really were stuck.  What to do?  This realization that there are literally next to NO nice places in the valley was kind of dumbfounding.  I mean, there are places that people go.  But then, people go to Universal Citywalk, too, and that's totally inexplicable to me.  There just aren't any places like Luques, AOC, Craft, Providence, Bastide, Ortolan, Nook, Wilshire...the list could go on forever.  There aren't even any pseudo-good hipster restaurants like Geisha House, or any of those places in Hollywood.  I don't get it! Suffice to say, after not being able to figure out a nice place, I suggested the Cheesecake Factory downstairs from the movie theatre, and there we drove.  I mean, if we HAVE to go to a chain, at least we knew they'd serve decent food and good portions.  So, it ended up being exactly what we thought it would be, although there wasn't anything playing at the theatre that we wanted to see, so we just went home.  Ah, well...it is what it is, right? Now why doesn't somebody open up a few nice places in the valley?"
Vince C.,"Austin, TX",81,53,13,2.0,8/29/2011,"ah, the land of the rediculous phonebook size menu. reliable food, reasonable service, oversized portions that are commensurately overpriced."
Jennifer B.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,93,2,3.0,9/25/2009,"Now that they provide the nutritional content of their meals, I go less frequently.  Having said that, I always have leftovers since the portions are rather large.  The food is always tasty, they have a variety of food like no one else and a good drink menu.  I love their brown bread too.  Funny enough, I hardly ever order cheesecake, but it is good. Beware, there is usually a long wait on the weekends."
Linda A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,3.0,5/11/2012,"Overall, good food. But there needs to be more vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options.  Also, we can totally tell that when we go later in the evening, the bread is always stale.  I'll never stop going here, but I have to say, the silverware is ALWAYS dirty.  We have to ask for new ones every time we're there.  They need to take the time to clean properly. But hands down, the best Arnold Palmer in town!"
Linda M.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,34,6,2.0,7/27/2009,"I don't mind Cheesecake Factory, really, I don't. But this one in particular just kills me.  My roommates and I always go to lunch here and always seem to forget our previous experiences... I hate when that happens!  We work in the hospitality industry, so patience and benefit of the doubt are always on the side of our server. I don't know if we just are the forever ill-fated Cheesecake diners, or if their management is really that bad at staffing appropriately- but our service is just awful every time we go here! They're always on a wait (not a big deal - understandable, and usually a testament to the restaurant)- and I'll give it to them, they don't leave open tables open for too long. BUT- if you're ALWAYS busy- then why are you not, by now, staffing for it??!?!?  Somehow we always end up with a server that has so many tables that they forget we exist-  We ask for water, it never comes The server offers bread, we say yes, they never bring it. Our food takes forever We wait forever for our check.  And- it seems, servers at the Cheesecake Factory either have never heard of muti-tasking, or they simply just refuse to live by the phrase... perhaps they're afraid that if they carry more than one drink at a time, they'll spill something on their all-white getup. Not to mention- if a guest says they want their strawberry margarita on the rocks-- and yes, I've had it before, and YES- I know what it will taste like... please BELIEVE ME! Why is it necessary for the server, the bartender, AND the manager to stop and inform me that they usually come blended? ... funny- the manager has time for that, but not to check on us otherwise.. All in all- stars for the concept in general (I'm so glad they have gotten rid of their confusing menu with all the ads)...  No star for their ridiculously large menu (too many options confuse people! especially the simple-minded like me!) Negative stars for this particular location... management- I implore you --- please hire some more staff! Smaller stations! Concentrated service!  Thanks! :)"
Kelsey W.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/3/2013,"Horrible service from the front of the restaurant all the way to the back.  Please save yourself time and pick another place to dine.  Waited over 2 hrs to be seated.  Per the front check-in ""sorry we can not move 3 tables at this moment for your group.  We have assigned you to this table and we are just waiting for them to finish their desserts."". As the night got later it's obvious that our group was skipped to accommodate other parties.  Furthermore, we expected their staff to display proper customer service by providing us with another table and not have us wait for a group to finish. We didn't expect them to kick the group out but it would have been great if they give us another table. We asked to speak to the manager but she was not helpful.  No apology from the manager no nothing.  Quickly after ""the talk"" our pager went off and got seated.  As we walked to our seats, empty booths and tables were noticed.  Basically the staff was to lazy to work last night.  The dinner was to celebrate a family birthday...they didn't come by with the typical birthday song.  Never ever coming back."
CJ W.,"Los Angeles, CA",70,3,,1.0,3/27/2010,"Usually I love going to Cheesecake Factory, but today I was not happy with the food or the service. First of all, I had to ask the waitress to bring us some bread. She was not attentive at all. Second, the food was bad. What a waste of $12! I ordered the turkey burger expecting a gourmet burger with alot of flavor. I was very disappointed. I wasn't even sure if it was turkey meat! The burger was falling apart and I had to eat it with a fork. It was very unappetizing!  To top it off the fries were overcooked and dry! I've had better fries at McDonald's! The quality of the food and service is not what it used to be. Defintiely not worth the money!"
DeAndra R.,"San Fernando, CA",0,1,,2.0,3/12/2012,I love cheese cake factory over all the food is amazing and cheese cake but the last time i went there they were basically acting like they were trying to get me out of the way they kept forgetting things  and i didnt get any forks . i was very excited to go there becuase it is my favorite but the service i received makes me not want to go any more . i hope they straighten up
Sarah M.,"Los Angeles, CA",578,133,1,3.0,5/11/2011,"i love this place for their garlic noodles. it's my favorite, next to their meat sauce pasta. i'm really particular about pasta's cause i hate most of them. but i really like those two here. and obv their cheesecake is really good too"
Claudia S.,"Chatsworth, CA",3,36,15,4.0,12/22/2009,"Consistently great. This location will be on a wait, but the restaurant will actually be full. When I visit W.H. cheesecake, they will start a wait with an empty/half empty restaurant. The food is better in this location too."
Alvin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,210,,3.0,5/25/2009,Not a huge fan of this place. They do have some good cheesecakes though. The portions are liberal and I do like the bread you get in the beginning. A good place for a group where you want to play it safe and stick with a chain.
Foodman G.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,120,1,3.0,6/16/2009,"its a household name, and the live up to it. the food was pretty good. the prices are high, but its a high end restaurant supposidly.  had a issue there though where the smart waiter decided to drop her tray and spill wine on my 150$ of shoes and expensive jeans. if i recall, my order was free, so i made sure to cover the cost i just lost on my shoes and the jeans just washed out so it was cool. what a putz."
jennifer J.,"Los Angeles, CA",236,65,27,4.0,10/24/2009,"okay so lets just say there ""BUFFALO BLASTS"" are the best thing. i dont even know how to explain how wonderfull they are."
Chuck D.,"Studio City, CA",103,226,4,4.0,3/8/2009,I like the cheesecake factory and im sure everyone has been once already. So ill make this short. Cheesecake factory is good food at a decent price and you wont be leaving hungry. I tend to complain about the service. Especially at Sherman Oaks....I think I have ordered a Turkey Club there possibly as much as 50 times over the past 2 or 3 years and always order it..No Mayo..No Tomato. Not that hard to understand. However more than 50% of the time it doesnt come out right. Very mind boggling. This is a great date place and you wont have to dish out too much money for good quality food. 85/100
Kristen F.,"Vancouver, Canada",28,421,,5.0,10/25/2006,"Alright so the wait sucks but that's all because you all got there at the wrong time. You know what they say. Wrong place at the wrong time.  When it's busy I'll park myself by the bar. Nothing like getting my drink on before I stuff myself silly. I'm in no rush to eat unless I'm starving hungry. In this case we'd go some place else, but because we're in no hurry, we wait. They have a huge freakin full bar galore which I love destroying every time I'm here. A billion different martinis, vodkas, rums, etc... I don't know where to begin or end. I'm like a kid in a candy store!  We're finally called to our table and I'm stumped the second I open the menu. I don't know if I want pasta, salad, chicken, seafood, pizza, a sandmich, I have an anxiety attack just trying to decide. I usually close my eyes, flip the menu around and land my finger some place on the menu. If I don't like what my finger chooses, I do it again!  The portions are HUGE might I add. The foods been known to give me food coma a bunch of times. I wind up eating half and saving the rest for later. I've never had a bad meal here.   After eating and drinking ourselves silly we move to dessert. I don't know how I'm able to eat another bite after this. I'm not a big fan of cheesecake but I love the oreo cheesecake. So melt in your mouth good!"
