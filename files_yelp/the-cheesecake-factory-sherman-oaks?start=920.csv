Kim N.,"Orange County, CA",174,309,12,4.0,1/3/2008,"We walked in four deep on a Friday evening and scored a bar table within ten minutes.  That is usually the case though, so it's nothing new.  Our server was Patrick Hruby, a talented artist of children's books.  He was absolutely amusing, always kept our pint glasses full or asking us if we wanted more drinks, which of course, we did, and by the time we left, we were as lit as candles.  I honestly don't remember the quality of food (did we even order any?), but knowing the three I came with, I marvel at the fact that they didn't kick us out.  Great sign!  Love it!  Close to where we were staying, parking was convenient, great area.  I would come back here in a heartbeat."
James-Tiberius S.,"Salinas, CA",7,34,,4.0,5/31/2007,"Came here w/ my sister.  She had the kobe burger, I had the meatloaf.  I'm not normally a meatloaf guy, nor do I go to CF primarily for the food, it's all about the cheesecake.  But good call sis w/ the meatloaf recommendation.  The balsamic vinaigrette w/ the table-bread was a nice touch.  I also factored in the truly tremendous service - Jeanette, if you weren't married we'd be in Vegas tonight (that is if you like chubby white guys).  The wait was surprisingly brief too, despite us coming during primetime.  They gave the usual good-sized food portions (so I got 2 meals out of it).  Decor was nothing memorable, but this was the first ground-level CF I've visited. Overall, a positive experience, hence the surprising 4-star rating. Meal Memory:  1st off, cudos to the management for putting that small (& somehow stylish) trash can right by the exit door in the corridor leading out of the bathroom.  Per my OCD, I usually use toweling to touch the door-handles as I leave, & that little trash can saved me from the oft impressive gymnastics routine I normally have to do to swing that door open, bolt over to the trash bin to toss the toweling (or hold that door w/ my foot), and then dive a la Indiana Jones through the closing bathroom door (it's for this very reason that, unlike Indy, I rarely wear a hat. Though I do tend to carry a whip ... for other reasons I suppose). It's a particular pain when there's a separate corridor you have to exit apart from the bathroom area.  Anyway, having that little can there all by its lonesome was definitely sweet & much appreciated.  In retrospect, I suppose I should be alarmed that this made such an impression on me (at what point do I become a danger to myself, or to others?). 2nd thing, during the brief wait to be seated, we checked out other stuff in the immediate area & I saw a spectacular & posh El Torrito.  That's right, a decked-out El Torrito (hostess confirmed, w/ a rather sheepish smile, that it was part of the chain).  They'd doubled the price of the entire menu (I guess to match the decor) & the staff were all young well-dressed hotties.  I just had to laugh & think now I'd seen everything.  It does give me hope that, somewhere out there, there's an In N Out Burger overlooking the Pacific, where the patrons sit on mounds of cushions surrounded by post-modern art, order off a gold-leaf menu, and the staff are all models (w/ attitudes to match).  Yes friends, maybe mythical El Dorado does exist.  In fact, maybe all those ancient legends do not actually refer to El Dorado, but to El Torrito."
Natasha T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/10/2012,"I was just there yesterday and will never I repeat never go back again. The food is and pretty much always has been just so so it just works for groUPS when you have people with different price points, and when you just want a basic meal. But even a basic meal needs to be Sanitary and clean. I ordered the New Orleans Shrimp to go and the minute I lifted the lid I knew something wasn't right. It smelled awful, I tasted it and it tasted like dirt and grit, like something that should have been cleaned, WASN'T!! I send it back, they bring another, I didn't taste it this time because it smelled better. Get it home and much later heat it, sit down and with just the light from the TV I can see that the shrimp were filthy front and back, and by filthy I mean Completely FULL of shit!!!  For any eating place this is astronomically  unacceptable.  This isn't, oh I didn't like how it tastes. This crap could have made me seriously ill and I mean more than the extreme nausea that I'm feeling today at the thought of the food I did eat there which was also a shrimp dish. I guess I should be happy that I didn't have much of an appetite yesterday, otherwise I would have ingested who knows how much Filth from this place. If you're not taking the time to clean the food before you sauce it and send it out, what else are you doing or not doing!!"
Debbie M.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",27,87,12,3.0,9/30/2006,The usual get a buzzer and wait game at this place...yet I keep going back. This time we waited an hour for a table and basically it seemed like an hour til we got our food. What can I say I like being tortured all for the sake of good food. This place was packed as usual and we happily awaited outside....finally led to our table we attempted to sit in the most odd configured table configuration I have see for a party of 4 with a baby....basically a table for 6 so that meant 3 in a row and a baby on the other side with one person..after a few minutes of back and forth discussions we decide this was ridiculous and we some how managed back into a normal 2 and 2 table conversation....GRRR!! but as usual this place does not disappoint with its food. I had the cashew chicken and it was yummy. Great place just hate the wait....and of course I will come back again!!!!
David G.,"Valencia, CA",17,97,41,3.0,12/25/2007,"Well... what more can I say that hasn't already been said.  It's the Cheescake factory.  Their food is good, not super.  Their Cheescake is good too. No complaints, no raves either.  It's just good."
Michael F.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",13,60,,4.0,9/13/2007,"gotta love the cheesecake factory, but not the wait. I don't know what makes the place so amazing that people are willing to wait an hour or more for a table at 8pm on weeknights, but hey sometimes i've got nothing better to do, and its in a nice location to hang out to kill the time. The cashew chicken, madeira chicken, and chipotle chicken pasta (ok, so i like chicken) are all amazing. and for desert, don't steer away from the cheesecake, everything else is just blah, and i definitely advise against the tiramisu, the martini's.. well, you can't go wrong there.. the waiters are nice, but don't go there if your planning a quiet romantic rendevous cause it's not gonna happen."
axid b.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",3,19,,5.0,1/25/2009,"i dont believe posting for a corporate chain can make em or break em, but here it goes. love it.  love the hibachi steak.  so soft, so succulent.  their fillet mignon is a wonder of its own.   if you love steaks, this is one place you should consider having dinner at. has excellent dedor, service and food. pricey (but worth the  $$$), and long wait (again, worth the wait)."
Iris G.,"Tucson, AZ",113,107,19,3.0,5/5/2008,"So Cheesecake factory would be getting 4 stars, but I'm knocking it down a star because the service was kind of blah.  Our waitress was hard to find and very mechanical.  Otherwise, the food portions here are so much more massive than I ever thought they could be.  My boyfriend got the standard chicken fett with alfredo sauce minus the sundried tomatoes, and I got a chicken burrito.  We both took massive amounts of food home.  I ate less than a third of the burrito and was very full, that's how huge it was.  Got a piece of peanut butter chocolate cookie dough cheesecake, and that was sooo yummy.  My only complaint is about the service and the hard to find waitress.  I'm not sure if she had tables inside though (we were sitting in the patio) or if she was just one of those waitresses that takes the order, checks in once, and takes the bill."
Joy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",165,128,1131,3.0,4/10/2008,"we had a good dining experience in the past the first time we visited this cf location, so my bf and i decided to go back.  we opted for an early dinner for visit #2.  our timing was great because our wait time was only about 2 minutes.  we were seated in a little booth and brought yummy warm bread and butter shortly after.  we had about 3 bread basket servings before our food arrived.  we both ordered the steak diane - mine with the shrimp scampi and his with the herb crusted filet of salmon.  both dishes were good.  we finished our meals and couldn't eat another bite; however, we ordered a slice of oreo cheesecake to go because we knew we'd regret not getting one once we got home. not a bad place and will consider returning again sometime when we're in the area... as long as we keep in mind to have a late lunch/early dinner to avoid any long waits."
terra d.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,605,29,4.0,1/8/2008,"im skeptical of any restaurant that has over 19 pages of ""specialties"" and dining here over the years has proved me correct...  although, one night with their herb crusted filet of salmon won me over. the lemon sauce went finely over the fish, asparagus and mashed potatoes. and, always a drink in hand, the factory peach bellini is a classic."
R L.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,88,,2.0,9/23/2007,"The long wait is annoying, particularly when there's 15 people standing in their lobby and another 15 standing right outside.  The best part is the yummy yummy bread and butter. After that, it doesn't get any better for me.  Our waitress was nice and professional. The variety of food was endless. However, it took a long time for it to arrive. In the middle of dinner, a new waitress came and let us know that she would be our waitress for the rest of the night. She seemed pretty busy and we did not see her much. She only refilled our drinks when we were already almost done with the food. Then when we were about to pay, she brought us one bill for three people. We specifically asked the first waitress to separate the orders into three different bills. We explained this to the 2nd waitress and she just rolled her eyes. All of us apologized to her for the inconvenience and acknowledged that it wasn't her fault, but she just interrupted us with ""Are you all paying with diferent credit cards then?"" Very unprofessional and rude.  This was my first visit to the restaurant and because the food didn't stand out and especially because of the service we received, I don't think I would come back."
J F.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",0,88,7,5.0,7/13/2010,Damn I love this place. Great food and huge portions. The chipotle chicken sandwich is my favorite. The food is making me fat though because I just can't get enough.
Tim F.,"Studio City, CA",60,16,,1.0,6/13/2010,"Terrible, terrible service. The huge menu translates into some items being delivered to table within a moderate timeframe, and then having to wait another half hour for the other items. At least that was our experience. The seating staff was rude, and the waitstaff insisted on charging us for food we ordered - even though it did not arrive until we asked for the check."
Josh A.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",332,6,,4.0,6/10/2008,"I like Cheesecake Factory, but its always busy. I feel like im in Vegas everytime i go because of the decor. The menu is massive so no matter what type of food your into its available."
Evelyn M.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",128,106,23,4.0,1/22/2008,"This is usually my restaurant of choice when I'm out with friends. The food is tasty and not too expensive, but it gets four stars for the long wait; usually over 30 minutes."
Sue D.,"Tarzana, CA",0,7,,5.0,6/13/2010,The menu is extensive and consistently good.  They have great brown bread and I love the chicken madera!!
shirly r.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",0,2,,2.0,3/9/2010,"Service slow, portions have become so tiny your Tiny bites salad looks like the garnish under your shrimp.  All their new small items do not have the quality and ingenuity of their old menu.  95% of the time when I order to go I find something wrong or missed when I get home.  Salad dressing on to go order are so minute it's ridiculous.  You ask for extra dressing and you get two containers but each is only a third full.  Their attempt at cutting down costs is cutting into their reputation which used to be about service, always awesome dishes, and generous portions. Now they are known by me and my friends for cheap size portions at full price with slow, non-thorough service, and only half menu that actually tastes good."
E H.,"Panorama City, CA",3,4,,2.0,2/24/2012,"Last Friday at around 1:00 in the afternoon my friend and I decided to head to CCF to get some lunch and have a few cocktails. we ask the lady if we can have a booth somewhere a little quiet The waitress takes us to the back of the restaurant by the bathroom presenting us to a table. across from it in all its glory was a quiet booth next to the window for a party of two. We asked to be sat at that table. After about 15-20 mins a cute little Mediterranean girl came to our table to take our drink orders I asked the waitress if they carried Ciroc vodka and she didn't know, my friend asked if they had cotton candy martinis, she didn't know that either, but she did offer to go check with the bartender, we gave her alternative drinks if they didn't carry what we preferred I ordered belvedere and pineapple juice and my friend had a patron ultimate margarita. 15-20 mins later she returned empty handed to get the same drinks ordered in the alternative stage of the first visit. I asked for some crab bites as well as some crab wontons. The cute little waitress disappeared for what seems like hours to return again empty handed (no drinks, no bread) to take our food orders. I asked for some bread and water please. She said okay sure, ill get that for you and then again she disappeared for like another 30 mins before she brighten my day again with her smile and my drinks (SARCASM SARCASM) so around the fourth round the food comes, we ask for more hot fresh bread and cuteness (waitress) (SARCASM) smiles and says I will get that right out to you guys... well again she disappears for about 20 mins before returning and saying that the bread will take an additional 7 minutes because it was in the oven.. OK we said and continued to have a good time... Ok this is where it all goes downhill... We ask her to wrap this food up so we can get out and enjoy this sunny Friday afternoon. She wraps up everything and returns with the check... The check is roughly about $100.00 (CRUMBS compared to what my Boo-Thang and I spend on Sundays) we look over the check, drop off $120.00 cash, pick up our belongings and proceed to take the 15 min hike from the restaurant to the car... laughing and being merry the whole way. We are literally seconds from the elevator (in fact just past starbucks) when we hear some African American girl screaming excuse me, excuse me, we never stop to see whom she screaming for because it has nothing to do with us... but this NOISE is getting LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER, CLOSER CLOSER CLOSER ... BOOOOOM (this chick was coming for us) she runs right up to us and says (verbatim)  EXCUSE ME LADIES (SARCASTICALLY) YOUR CHECK WAS $91.94 (EXACTLY) AND YOU ONLY LEFT... she open the bill fold and counts out right in my FREAKING FACE RIGHT HERE IN THE FREAKING COURTYARD $120.00 CASH. Then this sweet little African American girl (SARCASM) finds her indoor voice and says I apologize we didn't count the money right, thank you and disappears back to the CCF. Standing there holding my mouth in my hand because I am SOOOOOOOOOOO Appalled at what just happened, my homegirl and I looked at each other and said... we should have asked her for our freaking $28.00 tip back... I told my homegirl I am calling the restaurant to complain as sooon as we get to my house. Get home get settled, called the restaurant and spoke with the manager I forgot her name seeing as she was so helpful, sweet and attentative (SARCASM SARCASM SARCASM) I won't even go into detail about that phone call because it was even more appalling that the girl accosting us in the courtyard.... Ill wrap this up seeing as I have already dragged this story out and imp beating this horse dead for life... I ended up calling there corporate headquarters and speaking with a lady by the name of Colleen.... Oh what a TRUE GEM... (I really mean that) She was everything that I needed to feel better about the experience (FOR REALS)not only was she just as appalled as I was about the experience. She was sweet, apologetic, attentive, ready to please... she listened to me with great concern, she was not dismissive like the restaurant manager. She assured me that she would for sure make up for the bad experience and too looks for something sweet in my mail box... So I am looking forward to that!  I said all this to say... I work in the medical field and I always try to execute the same customer service I would want back, so shockingly I was at my own job on Tuesday 02/21/2012 when I had a new patient, the patient filled out his paper work and proceeded in to see the doctor, after he was seen by the doctor the chart comes to me for billing and coding.. I reviewed the information in the chart; the patient was a staff member at the CCF in Sherman Oak. SMAL SMALL WORLD!!!"
John S.,"Studio City, CA",3,84,,5.0,6/29/2009,"Amazing food, great service, and reasonable prices.  Other than that this place is ok (lol).  Haters beware this place rocks each and every time we go.  Its easy to pick on Goliath but in this case the reputation and long lines are well deserved.  The new White Pizza is amazing.  Just had the fish tacos and could be the best ive ever had.  Come hungry."
j w.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,190,,5.0,4/23/2011,typical cheesecake factory.  plenty to choose from. awesome happy hour.  my 5 stars is for the folks @ the bar... they're awesome!
