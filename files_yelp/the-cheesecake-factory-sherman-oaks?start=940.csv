Brian K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,4.0,9/28/2009,"GREAT FOOD!!  I would eat there 7 nights a week if I could! Great Food, Huge Menu at reasonable prices.  There Bacon Wrapped Dates are the best i've ever had! I've ventured out of my regular menu selections many times and was only disappointed once. I call that a victory.   I frequently get David as a lunch server and he's so friendly to us.  Have no experience with their breakfast food. I'm curious, though..."
K K.,"Los Angeles, CA",145,124,2,5.0,3/10/2008,"i love the ice tea (passion) here, the bread, the service, everything is always good & they have so much to pick from :)"
Lisa P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1198,1166,,4.0,11/11/2007,"I went here last night with a friend. It was very good. A very pricey place. I wont order drinks from there again, otherwise I love the place"
Ski M.,"Las Vegas, NV",534,160,12,5.0,12/12/2008,if you dont like the cheesecake factory then there is something wrong with you. seriously. get yourself looked at... but anyways this is probably my favorite restaurant. they have a shitload of choices and the decor is very nice. the prices arent as steep as you would think and they give you alot of food for your money. my favorite is the jumbalaya chicken pasta with cheese with a strawberry lemonade (which are the best lemonade i have ever tasted). damn... i might just go tonight!
Roman l.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,14,,5.0,10/13/2009,Sherman Oaks Cheesecake factory is great !! The food is always consistent ! Service is great every time i go. I recommend this location!!!!
Bruce K.,"Studio City, CA",49,188,,5.0,10/6/2006,"I have figured it out, oh, yes, I have figured it out.  What have I figured out you might ask and I might tell you for why should I withhold such things from you?  I have figured out that if you do not want to wait for ridiculous amounts of time, get there at eleven in the morning or between three and four in the afternoon - no wait, good service, and voila.  As much as I occasionally hate eating at those off times, I will say that I have never had less than great food at this location - the spicy cashew chicken being my fave.  But, I also love their Caesar, their taquitos, their sweet corn tamale cakes, and my new fave, the farfalle with pancetta, chicken, peas, and sundried tomatoes in a cream sauce - out of this world!  Ironically, in all my visits (and there have been hundreds over the last fifteen years) I have only actually eaten the cheesecake twice - it was good, but it's not why I go there.  So, if you don't mind eating at weird times, I recommend it wholeheartedly.  I simply will not wait, especially with those dildo things they give you."
Dina Z.,"Canyon Country, CA",107,118,7,4.0,9/30/2007,"what is there t o say about the factory? oh yea, amazing martinis. i like a place that can make a decent martini that does not have fruit, chocolate, or a sugar rim. the classic dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives hits the spot. the food is not spectacular. i came here for a two-martini lunch and shared a deconstructed version of chinese lettuce wraps. although i hate the ground up poultry flakes that normally make up this dish, it consisted of actual strips of chicken. whatever, it was just something to coat my stomach with."
abercrombie f.,"Van Nuys, CA",0,3,,5.0,6/23/2007,"First of all,I don't know why this is not an average of 5 stars because I honestly love this place.The food is great ,the service is awesome.A lot of people think that they wait too long , but come on-- what kind of restaurant would you order and the food comes out the next second?This is a great quality restaurant and it really is a place where you can come with friends,family,business,or whatever.The first time I went there, I was surprised when they offered to grate some mozzarella cheese on my spaghetti and pasta plate.I believe this is a great restaurant and don't forget the cheesecake.It is amazing.Especially the original cheese cake...DELICIOUS......"
