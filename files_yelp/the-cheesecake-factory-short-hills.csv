Mark D.,"Brooklyn, NY",29,42,7,5.0,1/8/2018,"After such an incredible meal at Cheesecake Factory yesterday, I knew first thing I wanted to do Monday morning was leave them a five star review. I am so surprised to see so many negative and one star reviews for this location. Especially so many within the last month!  My fiancé and I were shopping at Short Hills Mall when we decided to stop in for a late lunch/early dinner. As with every other Cheesecake Factory, this place was packed. The hostess told us it would be about a half hour wait. We put our names down, grabbed a buzzer, and plopped down in the waiting area. 15 minutes later, I felt a buzz, buzz, buzz in my back pocket, we weaved our way through the herd of people waiting for a table and were ushered right to a nice intimate table for two.   Both feeling healthy we decided to order off the SkinnyLicious menu and boy was it delicious. I got the Lunch Miso Salmon substituting the white rice for spinach. My fiancé got the grilled steak medallions. Both entrees were outstanding. My salmon was packed with so much flavor. It tasted just as good as if I got it from Nobu. We also decided to split the Korean Fried Cauliflower (which was probably one of the best appetizers I had a very long time) and the Edemame. We were so full and satisfied that we couldn't even order a cheesecake. You can always count on a great meal from this place. Even our waitress was really great. She checked on us often enough, and always made sure our waters were full. We don't eat at Cheesecake factory often, but when we do come back I already know what I want to order."
Victoria H.,"East Brunswick, NJ",0,6,4,1.0,1/5/2018,"Thinking of ordering take out? Think again. This cheesecake factory location has made me wait on the phone EVERY TIME (exactly 3) I've called to order for at least 45 mins. I get the restaurant is busy, and the server is seating incoming customers and managing the take out phone simultaneously, but 45 minutes is just not right. 30 minutes into listening to reception music from the underside of 2006, I call to politely remind the front desk that I am waiting to order. I am always rudely transferred to back to hold, without comment or apology. Then I wait out of principle. I've started to think this location likes to punish people who try to order take out. Operant conditioning to deter take out orders.  I've eaten at this location and the food is as good as at any other location. Regardless, treating all patrons with respect and efficiency is entirely lacking. If I can't order food after 45 minutes, it's not a restaurant, its a bad waiting room radio station. Cheese, yah gotta do better"
Derek Y.,"New York, NY",90,212,481,5.0,1/1/2018,"I regrettably was not able to eat at The Cheesecake Factory today but we did swing by to redeem two free slices of cheesecake. This review pertains only to the cheesecake we got to-go and literally nothing else (e.g., service, pricing, flavor), so I strongly believe that the five stars is wholly deserved. If you've never tried one from the restaurant because of its exorbitant prices, TRY ONE! Yes, they're generally very expensive (and normally out of my budget), but they're sooo creamy. I don't even want to think about how many sticks of butter had to be sacrificed, but I am pleased. I got the fresh strawberry cheesecake (it's just regular cheesecake with strawberries) and it was AMAZING! If you like good things, you'll like this. If you don't like cheesecake, then shame on you."
Jamila L.,"Houston, TX",306,117,577,2.0,12/28/2017,"I absolutely adore the Cheesecake Factory.  When I come to my hometown for the holidays, we always Isis this particular location because of its' convenient residence inside the mall. This location left us extremely disappointed though. Here's why... 1. First, there was a 40-minute wait. Ok, no biggie. It's the holidays. It's 8:00pm and the mall is closing in an hour.  2. As our buzzer went off and we get up to be seated at our table, in walks a man with a little chihuahua on a leash. All of our mouths dropped. One lady with a family of 5 asked the hostess if dogs were allowed in the restaurant. The server said, only service dogs. The lady exclaimed, ""that was not a service dog & he was not blind"". The hostess just shrugged her shoulders. The lady and her whole family canceled their reservation & walked out exclaiming how unsanitary it was. I totally agreed. And had we not been starving and waited over 40 minutes, we would have left, too. Luckily, they sat us on the other side of the restaurant.  3. The service was horrible. Our table didn't have enough silverware, it took forever to get our bread and some of us got drinks while others didn't. I was with a party of four. When we requested more silverware, one of the other servers (not our waitress who couldn't be found) got it and apologized, stating it had been a crazy day. Again, cool. It's the holidays. We get it.  4. But, this last thing took the cake... we all began devouring our food, only to get halfway through & my mom finds a long, curly black hair at the bottom of her plate. We were disgusted and informed the waitress. She took the plate, came back & stayed she took it off the bill, but the manager argued with her that the hair didn't belong to any of the cooks because they were all men. Manager never came to our table to address the issue or apologize.  After the hair situation and lack of professionalism by the manager, we decided to skip dessert, pay our bill & just leave. This has left a pretty bad taste in my mouth... literally. We will not return to this location EVER!"
Jeannie B.,"Elizabeth, NJ",6,1,,1.0,1/7/2018,Hate to dis this place but the manager here does not know what he is doing. Does not belong in the hospitality business. I'm sure that the staffs inability to get their shit together has everything to do with his lack of leadership skills. My daughter suggested I clarify what manager I am referring to the big guy with the red shirt. Any decent manager would have introduced himself to me and made sure my experience was on a par  after my first complaint.
Kenya M.,"West Orange, NJ",87,132,397,2.0,10/30/2017,"2.5 stars and that's IT! We waited less than 5 minutes for our table which was great. But when we sat down, we noticed that the table was dirty and there was food all over the floor. A lady came over to clean it and insisted that it wasn't dirty! Um, we're not blind. Our waiter blamed it on a kid that was there before us which was no excuse. After we placed our order, it took 42 minutes for our food to come out &  it came our barely warm. I hate to send food back but my broccoli was ice cold! The brunch combo was extremely boring- dry pancakes, overcooked bacon and my over easy eggs were over hard!! The chicken fingers were pretty good- too bad it was paired with old celery. Our waiter was clearly over his job and it showed. So, believe the reviews that you read on here! This is a beautiful restaurant with ugly service and hit or miss food!"
Auggie L.,"Fort Lee, NJ",107,222,485,5.0,6/26/2017,"Went for Dinner Food - 5/5. The bread selection they offer is lovely and the pumpernickel has good taste. Steak Diane had great crust with a warm pink center, just like how I asked for. Good seasoning on both the steak and mashed potatoes, with the mashed potato having nice chunks between the creaminess. The sauce was the main attraction of the whole dish as it added a nice savory and tart flavor to the entire plate. Service - 4/5. We had a big party of people that was to arrive but many were late and about a quarter of them canceled last minute. The staff were still very accommodating and professional about the whole ordeal. Value - 4/5. The pricing is pretty average as this is a chain restaurant. The food is good and for $20 you get a steak entree. Not bad at all! Parking - Mall Lot/Garage (Free)"
Rick G.,"Roseville, CA",0,58,10,2.0,12/26/2017,"I'm from California and this store would never cut it there.  Service: meh. 3 times I've come here in as many days (bus. trip) bad service. At 4:10 pm with about 10 tables occupied it 5 mins to get my Sprite. It's :15 now and still no bread.  Cleanliness: Dirty/grimy ... Everywhere. Bathroom filthy.  No one really makes eye contact unless absolutely necessary.  Hold on, I have to ASK for my bread....server disappeared 5 mins ago.  The only redeeming value is their good cheesecake.  Music: VERY ethnic. Not dining music. I may start avoiding CF's all together with them trending this way. Posted 12/17.  Last visit: 6/17 Delay in review due to technical glitch on Yelp."
David N.,"Brooklyn, NY",119,561,776,3.0,11/27/2017,This is the all too well know chain. I'm sure everyone has been to one at some point. The calorific menu is a gut buster if you don't watch it. Food quality is good for what it is. Plenty of items on the menu from salads to hamburgers. Their Cheesecakes are good but in moderation. I think the lettuce cups are one of the best options on the menu. Still plenty of food but you won't walk out feeling disgusted and maybe even able to share a slice of cheesecake.
Ayelet D.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",0,3,,1.0,1/9/2018,"All I have to say is oy. Where to begin. My coworker and I thought that the Cheesecake Factory would be a great place to conduct a business meeting, boy were we wrong. We decided to head to this location around 3pm, right after the lunch rush and before dinner service. We walked in and asked the hostess for a table for 2. Immediately we received a look and an attitude - how dare we interrupt her personal conversation with her fellow coworkers. With a sneer, she took us to the smallest two top table, when every other table/booth were open in the restaurant (we were also carrying large bags and backpacks). It took over 10 minutes for anyone to greet us and when we ordered drinks and an appetizer, we could sense the server was disappointed with our order. Since my coworker and I are both in the food business, we know how hospitality should be and we made sure to take really good care of the server. While our server was tending to another table, I asked a fellow server for 2 glasses of water- the response? ""She will get it for you"". Really? What happened to team work and helping out your fellow coworkers to ensure great hospitality for your patrons? We really didn't ask for much, but boy was this experience just miserable. To top it all off, I accidentally left a bag with my purchases at the restaurant. I called about 2 hours after i left to ask if they found a Gap Bag. The manager quickly told me no bag was found and he would call me back if they found it. I heard nothing and called back the next day, asking about the bag, and then again was told no bag was returned. Really?????? Did the bag grow legs and just walked away? So not only did I waste my money on terrible service and mediocre food, but my purchases are lost and Cheesecake made zero of an effort to help find my bag. Save yourself some money and energy and don't bother dealing with this establishment. Hopefully the management and servers can turn their frowns upside down and treat patrons properly."
Danny H.,"Levittown, NY",0,3,2,1.0,1/2/2018,"I have never felt more rushed and not wanted in my life. From the moment I walk in I got the impression I was bothering the staff. The hostess was very unfriendly, the server was clearly having a bad day and the bus person gave me an attitude over 2 waters!!! I am in the business and was appalled at the way I was treated....i am spending my hard earned money on this place and they have the Nerve to be bothered by a customers presence???? I can only imagine what management must be like. Me nor anyone I know will ever eat at a Cheesecake Factory again I can promise you that."
Eric D.,"Chatham Township, NJ",0,5,,2.0,12/10/2017,"Ordered a salad and avocado egg roll from here which was delivered through DoorDash. No issues on the salad which was enjoyed by my vegetarian friend. However, the avocado egg roll, though delicious had a small piece of stone in it. Ofcourse there was no way I could have known until I had put that piece of egg roll in my mouth. Still trying to scratch my head around how it might have got inside the roll and also raises questions about the Cheesecake Factory's food quality control. Order the avocado egg roll will caution, never know what secret surprise you might find in it."
Maria V.,"Jersey City, NJ",1492,416,2186,3.0,2/24/2017,"I find this location super busy at the short hills mall. Lately it's been hit or miss. Service is good/ok but everyone looks rushed.  I notice small things like having a fork but no knife. Bread without butter served .Things that happen when staff is stressed/rushed and don't pay attention to detail.  Food has been mediocre at Cheesecake lately . Not awful but not like how I used to feel/be excited. Plus the calories are ridiculous with most meals.  Bang bang chicken and shrimp is one of my faves . I like the seared tuna salad, miso salmon. Lemon chicken.  Apps- I like the fire cracker salmon, avocado egg rolls, crab wontons"
Trina H.,"Springfield Township, NJ",1,11,35,4.0,12/7/2017,"Just came here for Happy Hour.. Ordered Tex Mex Eggrolls, Factory Nachos & Long Island Iced Teas ALL $5.95... I forgot to take pics but food was delicious.."
Day Y.,"New York, NY",0,18,8,1.0,10/28/2017,"We've been to this place many times. I enjoy TCF and its many menu options. Our family of four went there on a Saturday night. It was the standard 30-min wait but we didn't mind. We went strolling through the mall during the wait. So this is the sequence of events tonight: 7:15 - we are seated and our waiter immediately takes our drink order 7:30 - our drinks arrive in staggered fashion with the beer arriving last; we place our food order 8:00 - couple in table next to us leave 8:05 - new couple arrives at the empty table 8:20 - our waiter apologizes for our long wait and says he'll find out what's happening in the kitchen  8:25 - our neighboring couple's food arrives; I go ask the front desk (since our waiter is MIA) why we've been waiting so long for our food; manager says he'll find out 8:30 - our food arrives but we're fuming mainly because someone f'ed up and everyone was pointing fingers (manager said kitchen messed up; waiter said he had no idea; food servers said they're just doing as told). So we waited a full hour for our food (nothing complicated - Caesar salad, two steaks, and one chicken) and we told them to take it back. I said I would pay for drinks, but the manager was nice in saying that our drinks are covered. But, if anything could have salvaged the evening, it would have been a word from the manager or waiter saying that he screwed up (instead of blaming it on the kitchen) and asking us to enjoy our food with drinks on us (or some other discount for the long wait).  In any case, bring food to customers in the order they arrived and everyone should be happy. This place is a madhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings. That is just my one bad experience. I'm fairly sure by their popularity that others have good experiences. So take this for what it's worth - just one review among many."
Uneka H.,"Rahway, NJ",41,180,422,5.0,2/17/2017,There always pretty good to me here. I normally come after work or sometimes during the day after shopping . The staff is pretty cool...the food is always good here. Definitely cant complain.  Ps-it's normally more crowded during the day so if you come at night it's a little more laid back.
Jay C.,"Newark, NJ",31,9,24,3.0,11/12/2017,I love the food and cheesecakes but was upset because we had a 2 1/2 hour wait this pass friday. It was a birthday group of 15 : we called the day before to find out If we need to make reservations or maybe come in early because the group size and they stated no it should be fine to seat us all. Of course we waited because had everyone there but they should allow reservations for large groups.
Frank S.,"12, MD",13,1,,1.0,12/16/2017,We had an awful lunch here. First off the rice that came with the Jamaican shrimp was hard with uncooked rice grains. Then one person in the party found a paper label in her food. Good thing the waitress was right there and saw when she found it. They exchanged it for another entree and did not comp us but charged for the replacement. Very unhappy with this location and will NOT be returning here!!!!
Yuki Y.,"Union, NJ",0,1,3,1.0,12/15/2017,"My husband called to order me a bday cake night of 12/14/17 bc i told him i wanted an oreo cheesecake, he called and asked for a small oreo cheesecake, the lady said that, that isn't an option and they only have a big one (which is a lie, bc i got my husband a small one for his bday) so my husband said okay to the big one bc my bday is the next day. And today we finally opened the box so i could blow my candle, but this is what we see in the box a cheesecake surrounded with paper, and does not even look like a bday cake. It looks like we are going to sell cheesecake. What a disappointment on my bday. We called trying to ask maybe they could give us the one that doesn't have all this paper but they said no. And they even said that the one we got was a corporate cake. Why did we end up with a corporate cake. LMAO. Too funny.  The lady lastnight was definitely a liar and lazy. Smh. Also the manager was no help. He didn't want to help my husband with his concern. definitely not going to buy cakes for next special occasion in this location, we might get a corporate one again   the one in menlo park mall is better."
Billy V.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",580,500,655,5.0,2/13/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory a national chain with restaurants in higher end malls or locations. Let me state that I have never been to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant ever. Two weeks ago, I was just blown away on my first visit. It was a WOW visit. From the moment I walked in, I was just impressed with ambiance, service and food. What more can I say. It was just awesome. I was at the Short Hills Mall waiting for the wife who works just across the street. I happen to enter another restaurant a few hundred feet away and just had a horrible experience. Everything that drives me crazy about service in a restaurant; they did. Moving forward, as I walked in at the CF music was at right level. Perfect lighting. Everyone just busy doing their jobs, without looking like they where running around ""like a chicken without their head"". Everything seem perfect and working right. Found a seat at the bar and let me say it was busy. Bar area was packed with Happy Hour customers. Ordered a Mojito; delicious. Good. Damn good. It was as perfect a mojito as I ever had. That mixture of tartness and sweetness with the aromatic mint, made for a wonderful delight. Best part $5.95 for this delicious drink. Remember HH pricing. Now I am a burger guy and when I see sliders I just order. It is the perfect food when enjoying adult beverages. The order consisted of 4 sliders that were moist and tasty. It was a real deal at $5.95 Happy Hour Special. Service was just outstanding. Period. The young lady was personable, friendly and made a mean drink. Life is good. At 6:08 or so I asked if I can order apps. The Bartender said, let me check if they changed over from HH menu to regular menu and made it happen. No hassle. No drama. She just offer me the HH menu for food with no worries. Overall, The Cheesecake Factory will be my Happy Hour place when in the area. With outstanding service, food and cocktails this customer is a very happy camper."
Amber A.,"Brooklyn, NY",137,170,59,5.0,4/10/2017,"""Why you gotta fight with me at cheesecake, you know I luh to go there!"" - Drake.  Yeah I had to haha. Anyway, the famous cheesecake factory is so damn good I don't know why I haven't tried it sooner. It's pretty straight forward All-American chain restaurant with huge portions and delicious food omg. I had a bacon burger with a simple salad and iced tea. It was sooooo packed like geez, we waited 30 minutes which isn't too long but it is seems like forever when you're hungry as hell. My aunts and I were seated promptly, the waitress was bubbly and the food was 100% on point. For starters we had fried calamari (AHHHHH sea alien) and warm complimentary bread with butter on the side. Afterward, I had a godiva cheesecake which I didn't really like that much because I prefer plain cheesecake but I decided to be adventurous. Ugh, everything was so tasty. I finally understand why this restaurant is so popular."
Justin Y.,"Livingston, NJ",745,77,32,4.0,2/20/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory was pretty packed on a Saturday night. Got here around 7:00 and had to wait an HOUR for a table. I guess it's expected but still.  Just your typical Cheesecake Factory. We love the Chicken Bellagio ~ I think it's the best thing on the menu. Had the chicken Picatta this weekend, nothing too special.  Cheesecake it good though. Loved the Godiva Cheesecake. The hazelnut Cheesecake had a little too much cake base it in but was pretty tasty"
Rachita B.,"Jersey City, NJ",52,220,188,1.0,6/30/2017,Waited at the cheesecake factory take-out area for 32 minutes. I contacted several employees - none of whom could assist me --- I was told that the job to take a take-out order and ring someone up was delegated to one individual who couldn't be found. I ended up leaving. This was at 12:30 PM today.
Rida H.,"Newark, NJ",32,46,10,5.0,10/5/2017,"I always have a great experience at almost any Cheesecake Factory location! For breakfast, I love their waffles and for lunch/dinner I love the four cheese pasta! I have never witnessed a wait here longer than 5-10 minutes even on weekend breakfast days, or weekend evenings. Their service is very quick and the menu has a great variety, there's some for everyone. It's a lovely place and the mall itself is my favorite. Perfect for a bite after a long day of shopping!"
Daph E.,"Irvington, NJ",1,12,8,3.0,5/6/2017,"So let me preface this by saying don't go to a Cheesecake Restaurant and try to order steak. I made the mistake so you don't have to. Now if you read this and decide to order a steak after I told you not to, that's on you.  My girlfriends and I arrived on Friday, a little after 6:00 and were told there was a 10-15 minute wait. We didn't have any issue with that because we hadn't seen each other for a bit and we 3 are gifted with the gift of gab! We didn't wait 10 minutes which was great.  On to my dinner, which left me underwhelmed. So I ordered the Hibachi Steak because I let my anemia choose the entreé. It was supposed to come with Wasabi Potatoes and Tempura Asparagus, but I substituted Tempura Asparagua for regular asparagus. Our waiter, Joey was very patient with us, as we had one wholly indecisive member in our party. He had to visit 3 times before the entire table was ready, but I ordered an Herbal tea to pass the time.  So I was really excited to try Wasabi Potatoes but unfortunately I was served a GIANT pile of regular unsalted red-skinned potatoes. There wasn't a whiff of Wasabi in the mashed potatoes (which is pretty hard to miss), nor did I see wasabi on the side, so that left me disappointed. Also, I don't know about anyone else but when I order steak (and pay damn near $22 for it) potatoes should be a side! I go to a restaurant for food I can't make myself, and I certainly don't get steak and potatoes to eat the potatoes!  The meal was mostly blah potatoes, about 2 pieces of cut up asparagus, and maybe 6 or 7 slivers of damn near done steak (which I requested cooked medium) Also, I'm an adult, and I want to cut up my own damn piece of meat. Just saying. Anyhow I ate half of my giant plate of potatoes and saved space for the Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake which was plated so nicely, that I almost forgot my underwhelming steak dinner.  Our waiter was busy and so I didn't bother to address the steak situation but there seemed to be individuals going around watching people eat but they didn't ask us how our dinner was going, so I left well enough alone.  Next time I'll just skip dinner and go straight to the cheesecake. They've got those down, dinner service not so much."
Sue S.,"Newark, NJ",774,136,131,4.0,7/27/2016,"It's always a pleasure to come here! I love the atmosphere and how amazing the food is ! Starting from the bread to dessert, everything was deliciousssss and filling. Especially the oreo cheesecake...omgoodness, I can still taste it! I definitely recommend people to come here for a nice, yummy meal if they're in the mall!  The only thing is, because they are so good, they are usually busy so they did not come around to refill our waters which was annoying because I was parched."
Maricia H.,"Caldwell, NJ",141,199,418,1.0,11/2/2016,"Follow up to my initial review of the cheesecake factory visit.  I respond to the request of the representative who wrote on my page to basically be told that they could not find a record of my visit.   If the company honeslty looked into the complaint there is no way they would not be able to find a record of me being at this resturant on September 20th. When you arrive they always ask for your name so that they can put your name down in the computer or on the paper so that you could be seated in the order that you arrived and availability. Secondly, I'm sure an establishment as large as there's has cameras, third but not the least my party paid with several credit cards that night so I am site that the company would have records of that.  If The Cheesecake factory  didn't want to take this issues seriously they should not have responded to review of one of their establishment."
Prachi M.,"NJ, NJ",237,33,51,4.0,7/11/2017,"I love going to the Cheesecake Factory after work for a drink or for lunch. They have a huge menu with options for everyone. I really like their skinnylicious menu because it's healthier and has smaller portions. My all time favorite bartender is Christine, she is the best! They don't take reservations so, that can be annoying with a large group. It gets very crowded during dinner time especially Thursday- Sunday. Their portions from the regular menu are huge so, you can definitely share. Same with their Cheesecake slices. There's parking right outside Cheesecake and in other parts of the mall."
Natalie W.,"South Plainfield, NJ",331,71,525,3.0,2/28/2016,"After the NY Winter Wine Festival at the Hilton we went across the road to the cheesecake factory for some much needed chow. I normally go to the Bridgewater or Menlo Park locations. Thinking that all Cheesecake factories are created equal I ordered my usual. My sister and I shared a Ceasar Salad( that was good) and the Dynamite Shrimp (overcooked and greasy).  For entrees I had my usual shrimp and salmon combo with mash potatoes and asparagus and my sister had a burger and fries. My Combo came out and the shrimp were so brown I didn't recognize the dish. The salmon was not very warm but I ate it while I asked for new shrimp .  I was a little surprised when the manager came over he didn't offer to take the entire plate and fix order instead he just got me new shrimp . I actually enjoy the combo when I eat a little shrimp and salmon in same bite so this killed it for me .  My sisters burger came out with no fries because they were making them still. FRIES really they are the shortest thing to cook.???  Anyway I did get an replacement shrimp it was less dark in appearance but a little gummy . I told the manager when leaving it still WASN'T RIGHT,  He told me he watched them while making it and they did it right. So I guess I was wrong lol.  The Bartenders really saved the experience as they made us amazing Stoli O cosmos and were very pleasant.  I would NOT order my favorite dish from this location EVER ! At best I would probably  have drinks at happy hour price."
H H.,"New York, NY",108,95,245,3.0,4/18/2017,"Not the worst, but not the best... here's why: Pro's: as always, lots of choices of food and drink, the service is pretty quick (please note-we sat at the bar on a Saturday early evening for dinner), and it's convenient. Con's: because it's attached to the mall, expect it to be packed, filled with kids/babies/families, and it was not only dark inside, but really dirty (floors had chunks of food and the counters were a mess).   Pretty much you get what you pay for here... just wish it was up kept a little more."
J W.,"Randolph, NJ",7,57,,1.0,12/2/2017,"Don't. Just don't. Crowded, loud mess. Entrees came ten minutes apart. Mine didn't come at all. Manager was summoned and said that a waiter took my entree and gave it to another table!!!! Dish finally came and the potatoes were stone cold. OMG."
Audrina G.,"New York, NY",4,58,2,1.0,8/4/2017,"Came here on a Thursday night with two friends. We were told by the person at the front that the wait was 15 min they gave us a buzzer for when to come back to the front to be seated. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks in the meantime. About 25 min go by, our buzzer did not go off. Our friend walked to the front and the person said ""we called your name and you didn't show up"" then what is the point in having a buzzer if you are going to shout people's names? Finally we get seated after 40 min. Our waitress was fake friendly and you could tell she hates her job. We ordered 3 dishes. Only ended up with two. We didn't bother to mention it to the server because she completely forgot. The food was bland and not to mention the floor is extremely slippery almost as if they poured cooking grease all over the floor. surprised they haven't had a lawsuit yet. Will never be returning here."
Mylene T.,"Rutherford, NJ",350,171,805,2.0,12/1/2015,"So the Cheesecake Factory at Short Hills always seems to disappoint me BUT I continue to visit because the food is not what I complain about....IT'S THE SERVICE!!!!  Place is clean, the people are nice, but OMG it was slow.   Met with my girls and you need to be on top of your server.  We ordered soup and 15-20min went by and we realized we didn't even order our entrees.  The waiter explained 7 tables just got pushed on him but it's not an excuse......it's a Monday night! So ended up having corn chowder which was delicious then the following: Luau Salad - The dressing was yummy and the crunchiness was perfectly blended with the rest of the ingredients.  We shared this amongst 4 gals and it was more than enough. Louisiana Chicken Pasta - don't like spicy...don't order this....it has a nice kick to it and I love bowtie pasta.  Chicken is pan fried....really yummy. Wish we had time for dessert....but like I said service was slow. Yah I would come back....just so convenient after shopping.  Hope the service is better the next time around AGAIN."
Melissa A.,"Denville, NJ",35,5,,1.0,7/16/2017,"Extremely slow service, waitress never came to ask how food was (if she did she would have noticed we needed refills. We had to ask another waitress for more drinks. The floors were so greasy, I slipped going into the bathroom where I was met by disgusting conditions and no hand soap...how can employees wash their hands without soap!? Never returning to this Cheesecake Factory."
Sara M.,"Jersey City, NJ",2918,538,3321,3.0,8/24/2015,"I haven't been here since I was 14 and it was cool to come for a birthday dinner...and judging by my most recent experience, that's probably a good thing. I knew it had been a long time when I discovered that they had a cocktail menu. Last time I came here, I didn't even know what a cocktail was. I game in for lunch with some of my girlfriends after an exhausting day of bridesmaid dress shopping. I had a bunch of mixed emotions during our lunch, and because of that I'll settle on an even 3. Here's why:  5 Stars- The menu selection. If you've ever been to a cheesecake factory before, you'll know that their menu is a small novel. There is a ton to choose from, and plenty of decadent sounding lunch specials. Oh also, their hot sourdough bread and butter is the stuff that dreams are made of.  4 Stars- The Mojito. It had fresh muddled mint and blueberry. It was divine.  3 Stars- The overall dining experience. Read on and you'll see why... 2 Stars- The service was waaaack. No one asked how we were doing and it took like 30 minutes to bring us our check...after we asked 10 times.  1 Star- The food. I should have stuck to what I knew, but I honestly didn't think that fried chicken sliders could be messed up. Instead of 2 or 3 neatly presented sliders, it was a platter of haphazardly assembled greasy chicken patties and mushy buns with a mess of lettuce and tomato on the side. I felt like I was ten and eating a meal at summer camp. Super nasty.  It's not the worst mall chain restaurant to snag a quick meal at...next time I'll just need to stick to what I know."
Olivia C.,"Jersey City, NJ",28,31,,1.0,3/1/2017,"This place is such a tragedy to be called part of the short hills mall. The staff is rude and uneducated about what the restaurant offers. They also only take reservations on a M-Th, which is fine, but I had to call and got placed on hold 4 different times because the staff isn't properly trained.  The fact that this is at short hills and they can't find better people to manage the restaurant and their employees is unacceptable. I expect better from this area, even if it is a chain."
Nick H.,"Florham Park, NJ",0,58,1,3.0,11/9/2016,"Food is consistently good but service has dropped WAY off. Service use to always be awesome. Now the attitudes of the servers are ""Meh"". A big no-no in the restaurant biz is the customer having to wait and wait for an initial greeting from the server , even if it's a ""Hi ! I be right over to get your drink order"". At Cheesecake it is now wait wait wait. Drink service is slow with our 3 beverages coming at 3 different times. God forbid you need a refill/ second round. Wait time for apps and entrees is fine but oddly enough , desserts can take longer to come out than the entree ! I mean - how long does it take to slice a piece of cheesecake ???  I don't know if this is a chain wide problem or just at Short Hills but it is very noticeable the last 4-5 times we visited. I keep going back  for the food but it can be an ordeal."
J L.,"Short Hills, Short Hills, NJ",0,15,,4.0,8/19/2017,"Food: the food portions are huge! There is nothing bad on the menu Service: the staff is slow and forgetful. And very pushy on dessert Atmosphere: LOUD. Unless you are in a booth you can heat the conversation of the table near you The hostess does not stick to the order people come in. The hostess seated their ""friends"" while other people were waiting"
Mr. G.,"Manhattan, NY",184,141,459,3.0,5/2/2016,"I wasn't particularly blown away.   Sat at the bar, had the calamari and the sweet fries.  It was good and I would come back but my socks weren't blown off as I  had expected.  Service at bar was ok could have been more attentive.... Asked for water... I never got my water,  etc. The pizza margharita was good.  The carrot cake was HUGE!!  (""That's what she said."") I'll go back and try to add a star to this review.... Overall it was just ok"
Paul K.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",27,1,1,2.0,10/21/2017,"Today was almost the worst Cheesecake Factory experience I ever had. First we had to wait 20 minutes just to get bread and water, then another 40 minutes or more to get our food. After complaining to the manager about the slow service he compensated us with a free slice of cheesecake. I would have rather had my meal on time. FYI they do not have free Wi-Fi that only made the wait worse. I will not be returning to this location. Not to be totally negative the food was okay once it finally arrived"
