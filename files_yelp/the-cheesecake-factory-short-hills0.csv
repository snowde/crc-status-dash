Mo S.,"Newark, NJ",0,25,,2.0,7/13/2012,"I love the decor of the place.  Hostess was very friendly.  The front desk seem a little unorganized.  My food was not satisfactory.  I had grill pork chops with mash potatoes and spinach.  My pork chops was ok.  But the mash potatoes had too much pepper in it and the spinach was wilted, not cook leaves of spinach with white spots.  Both sides tasted terrible.  I brought it to my waiter's attention and they did make another batch of spinach for me to go and it also was not done properly.  The waiter did not ask me if everything was ok or nothing before I left.    I was very disappointed on the service that night.  Next time I will not have dinner.  Just dessert and a drink."
Matt S.,"Andover, CT",56,8,1,4.0,8/14/2012,I had the Herb Crusted Salmon. It was cooked perfectly with a lemon butter sauce that went well with the asparagus.
Anonymou S.,"Cypress, TX",12,46,5,1.0,1/20/2012,"This was my first time to a Cheesecake Factory.  I thought the food was great! (which gets 5 stars) But the host table, wait service, and manager needs an overhaul.  This restaurant needs to start over on the staff."
Pia S.,"Seattle, WA",1029,680,48,1.0,3/22/2012,"I've been a big Cheesecake factory fan all my life, but this one just doesn't cut it. I think they went a little too grandiose and overlooked the details. While this location is aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately, it misses the mark where it counts - the food.  I know one shouldn't expect too much from large chains - but the drinks were just okay and overly priced and the food wasn't the quality I've had in their DC/VA locations (to the point that we cancelled one of our entrees). Also the silverware was dirty and we had to wipe them down before use. Not an experience I'd like to repeat."
Mike S.,"Chatham, NJ",128,34,1,5.0,8/9/2011,"I'm gonna go ahead and admit I'm an employee here, but that doesn't change that I looooove the food here, and knowing the trouble that servers go through to make sure the guests are happy, I doubt you're gonna get better service many other places. Just know that although we have healthy options on our menu, I don't think those options are our tastiest. I think the best cheesecake experience will be had when you kinda let yourself go and really indulge. That's what the huge menu and all our waiter training is all about: giving you that one meal you reeeeaaally really wanted and making sure it's perfect. If you go in restricting yourself and saying ""I can't eat what I want to,"" then you probably won't end up with the best food we could give you. Above all things, save room for cheesecake :-)"
Amanda B.,"New York, NY",22,4,1,1.0,9/6/2011,"Horrible service, had to eat our appetizers and bread without silverware or napkins after asking for repeatedly.  Waited 20 minutes just to get water and be acknowledged, 50 minutes in, still no food...later talked to the manager about our issues, didn't even say sorry or do anything to resolve the situation.  Had to flag down other waiters and waitresses to get dessert and our bill paid.  2 hours at the table, rediculous!"
Kurtis P.,"Matawan, NJ",56,435,2,4.0,12/12/2011,"As always The Chessecake Factory delivers. Great atmosphere, great menu, great food and always a great time. There is nothing new here from any other location. They use the same great menu (where everything is a specialty) and the staff is fantastic. Yes its in a mall, but thats the only difference to it all. Might make it a bit harder to find parking but otherwise no drawback there. My only complaint is that for a Cheesecake Factory, its a bit small. We'll definitely be going back as we're very happy to have one move this close to us. Great addition to the area."
Heather S.,"Livingston, NJ",5,25,6,4.0,12/16/2011,"Can't wait to check out the new gluten free menu that came out or is coming out. In the meantime, the staff was very helpful.  Service was great.  The place is so loud....but they always are.  BUSY BUSY BUSY, as expected.  If they have a gluten free cheesecake, I'l move in."
Dodya R.,"Millburn, NJ",288,52,,2.0,6/6/2012,"Ok, this place takes way to long to get your food. Lines are unbearable and the food is just way too much. Prices are decent but it just isn't a great place to be. In pretty much every category, there's a better place around the area."
Spring S.,"Berkeley Heights, NJ",0,12,,3.0,1/21/2014,Food was very good - tomato basil pasta was light as promised and very tasty. The fettuccine Alfredo was also very good. The cheesecake with strawberries - excellent!  Three stars because the service was horrendous !  We came on Monday at 6 pm - the restaurant was 40% full and had ample waitstaff. Yet we waited 10 minutes to be seated in spite of many open tables and once seated waited 10 minutes for a server to take our order.  My dining partner's order was wrong - he ordered whole wheat pasta and waited 15 minutes for the correct order. We asked for water when seated and finally flagged a bus boy after 20 mins to get a glass of water.  The waitress was polite but invisible. All in all the hostess and servers left the impression that they didn't want to bother with us.  Very disappointing.
Anna D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,45,,1.0,8/13/2013,"Worst. Cheesecake factory. Ever. let me start by saying my family is big Cheesecake factory fans, but this place sucks. 1) The waiter was just bad. So slow we could have cooked the food ourselves. Whenever we asked for something, like the bread which we got after the food arrived (and should we really have to ask for it at all?!), or the beer which we got after the food arrived too...., but didn't get it, she claimed ""it didn't fit on the tray"". Huh? We waited for the drinks. We waited for the food. We waited for the check. We waited and waited and waited.  2) French country salad with approximately one beet, one asparagus and one tiny piece of cheese. Where was the erst? Maybe it didn't fit on the tray... 3) My 3 year old wanted Mac N cheese from the kids menu. When it arrived the top was kind of congealed. I tested it for heat, and it was luke warm, so my son proceeded to eat, but he ate from the middle and SCREAMED from burning his tongue. Seriously - Microwaved Mac N Cheese for kids? What the... We called the manger over who proceeded to explain in a derogatory manner that when cooking mac N Cheese they boil the pasta and cheese. No shit, of course they do. But NO restaurant with any sense serves PIPING HOT FOOD to children. Boil it all you want (or in this case microwave it since it was hot in the middle and cold on the outside) but make sure it is safe fro children before you serve it. The manager kept protesting and really didn't get it. He offered a free dessert. Really, we should have made a huge scene, but we were frankly to shocked. Again, the manger didn't understand what was wrong with serving piping hot, microwaved food to small children. He should NOT be working in the food industry and he is lucky our son wasn't seriously hurt. But he now refuses to eat Mac N Cheese, or pasta, he was so scared from the experience. 4) After this seriously disappointing meal we headed to the bathroom. The ladies room smelled of urine and had paper towels on the floor like any old fast food place. Is this supposed to be a Cheesecake Factory?  Really? Disgusting.  If I were at Cheesecake Factory HQ I would fire the manger and most of the staff and start over and I would teach those supposedly professional restaurant people how to serve kids food before someone gets hurt. Add some deep cleaning while you are at it..."
Ellen L.,"Summit, NJ",0,8,,2.0,8/23/2011,"I ate at the Short Hills Cheesecake Factory on Aug. 15, 2011.  I wanted to order what they call their specialty drinks.  There were no prices on the menu.  I asked the waitress to check on the price of three different drinks and she came back to me with an answer from the bar that they ranged from $7 to $10.  I told her I did not want to spend $10 and so I needed a definite answer on a pomegranate martini.  I ordered it and she came back and said it was $12. So I just ordered a glass of wine which had the price on the menu.   Why are there no prices on the drink menu? They post food prices, but not drink prices. Is this true in all the Cheesecake Factory restaurants?  Are you deceiving the general public? I will not go back to this restaurant for that reason alone.  In this economy people want to know what they are spending before the bill comes."
Hudson F.,"Summit, NJ",0,17,7,1.0,7/27/2011,"It's tough to review a place so soon after it opens so I normally wait but my experience was so bad I just don't see it making a difference.  First off, this is a largely successful corporation that just did a multimillion $ renovation to bring its restaurant to demanding clientele of the Short Hills Mall. So, why in God's name do you put two 18year old girls at the host stand to run your place? Two disasters that told us it would be a 20min wait and 50mins later still were not seated.  The place is going to be packed as all their places are. So, they need to have someone with some sense at the door. Once seated things really didn't get any better. Food was mediocre at best. Salads were bland with no dressings. But the one stand out was my Farmhouse burger with pork belly and fried egg. It was Very Good. It did take 45 min between salad and burger to hit the table.... The corporate team better bring in the big guns quick or the doors will be closed.I'd say pass on this place for 6 months-  On the brightside though, Joe's will have less of a wait for a while so head over there."
Campbell S.,"Caldwell, NJ",0,34,,2.0,11/28/2011,"My husband and I had a very disappointing first visit to the new Cheesecake Factory. First off, the interior is VERY dark and the ceilings are low so it feels crowded and the acoustics make for an extremely noisy dining experience. As is always the case with TCF, the food was great. Unfortunately the food was hugely overshadowed by the ATROCIOUS service. Beyond S-L-O-W!! The server was quite nice, but she would disappear for ages before coming ""right back"" to take our order or bring us napkins and silverware. We ordered our cheesecake at the end of the ""to go"" so we could get the heck out of there. She finally took our order and then she disappeared. She didn't come back. We had to flag down another waiter to take our check and get us our dang cheesecake. It's so frustrating to feel like you are being held hostage by servers that don't appear to have any training at all. They are nice enough, but no clue how to properly expedite orders in a timely manner. Only go to The Cheesecake Factory if you have at LEAST a couple of hours to kill.  I think I'll stick to Au Bon Pain for a quick bite while I'm shopping. Even Joe's is faster and they are always super slow."
NA0795 0.,"Morris Plains, NJ",0,111,,3.0,8/10/2011,"I'm normally a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory and am used to the fact that you typically have to wait.  Maybe it's because they've only recently opened but it seemed last night that they definitely didn't have their act together.  After the little buzzer lit up, we were told to stand to the side to wait for our table (this was after waiting 15 minutes).  The second wait (to actually be seated) took another 15 minutes.  The set up didn't make any sense to me and staff really didn't seem to care.  Once seated, we did like our meal but it seemed like the server had way too much to do and didn't refill drinks, etc.  Hopefully this is just growing pains!"
Maren M.,"Manhattan, NY",57,24,,5.0,8/10/2011,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a long time and this was the first time I went since going vegan. There was a short wait of a couple of minutes when we go there. Our waitress was Ally/Alexandra. She was the sweetest. I asked her for vegan options and she told me about a pasta dish, then a few minutes later came back to tell me that the pasta has egg in it, but they could replace the pasta with white rice. Perfect. My date (the 12 year old I babysit) ordered the Da Vinci pasta dish. The food came and unfortunately mine came with pasta. I told the guy that it was supposed to be rice, so he retuned it to the kitchen. Ally came over to apologize and so did a manager. He asked if he could get me anything while I waited. A few minutes later my food came out and it was DELICIOUS! I'm glad I went with it instead of a boring salad. I finished the whole thing. It was a lot, but since I don't eat the cheesecake I figured I could. The kid loved her past and finished half, to leave room for some cheesecake. She had half of her (according to her amazing) red velvet cheesecake. Ally and the manager came ovr again to apologize for the wait before we left. It was a great experience and when I go back, I will try to get a table in Ally's section."
Dana D.,"Morristown, NJ",0,5,,2.0,9/18/2011,"Horrific service both dining in and take out. Food is very good, but servers are horrible and slow. It took us 10 minutes for the waiter to acknowledge us and then when he saw us said he would be right back...10 minutes later! Tried to order take out one night so I didn't have to deal with bad service and was put on hold for over 8 minutes....I used the time to review another menu and hung up!"
Jennifer M.,"Bayonne, NJ",0,3,,1.0,4/13/2013,"I've been to my fair share of cheesecake factories, and have always thought it to be  my favorite place, but I have to say my first experience the other night at the Short Hills Mall CCF was my worst experience ever.  I ordered a chicken sandwich and in it, I find and chew on a piece of a broken toothpick in the middle.  It was a club sandwich, so they do stick a toothpick in the middle, but the toothpick I pulled out was whole, so where did this borken piece come from?  How gross.  I lost my appetite thinking about that and that fact that I was spending $13 on a sandwich that had a broken toothpick in it and how dangerous that was.  I told the manager what happened and she looked at me like I was crazy when I said I lost my appetite.  She did not offer me anything else; I'm not even sure she apologized about it.  She just took it away and took it off my bill. Then I order cheesecake to go and when I get home and eat it later that evening, I end up chewing on and finding a thin piece of paper in the cheesecake!!  How utterly disappointing.  My friends and family are not huge fans of the CCF, like I was, but I'm beginning to see why.  Above all else, their prices have gone up drastically in the past few years."
