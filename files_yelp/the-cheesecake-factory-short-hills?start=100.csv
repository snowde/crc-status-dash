Reb P.,"West Orange, NJ",0,9,14,1.0,2/23/2015,"Terrible service. Waiters and waitresses literally avoid eye contact. Didn't get our table waters until I got up and found someone, who happened to be the manager, to bring them for us. Today is Monday night and the restaurant was not even busy, I don't understand what these waiters could have been doing but obviously it wasn't their jobs.  The waitress also gave us the wrong food and we waited 10 minutes for her to come to the table and by that time we decided to just eat because we were so hungry from already being there for an hour and a half.  It's such a shame that such a nice restaurant has such poorly trained waiters."
Julie M.,"Chatham, NJ",0,2,,2.0,11/13/2016,ALWAYS leave something out of my to go order. Not necessarily a full item but an ingredient or two in a salad will always be missing or they'll give me bread and butter when I said no and leave it out when I say yes. Just very inconsistent.
Aleathia S.,"Irvington, NJ",21,250,744,5.0,5/10/2015,"This was my 2nd time visiting this particular location. The place is clean and service is outstanding. The fish tacos and pasta dishes are amazing. You can not go wrong here. Parking is bit of a hassle but once you find a spot, all green lights!"
Sui B.,"Jersey City, NJ",161,766,1235,4.0,1/5/2012,"I LOVE cheese cake factory! While other moms may take their children to Mickey Ds for a treat, my mom loved to take me to the cheesecake factory growing up. We always got the same thing, shrimp angel hair pasta, and because it comes in a huge portion, we would split it, but not before indulging in the warm fluffy bread they serve before the meal comes!  After walking back and forth in the short hills mall, we headed over here for some dinner and loved everything. My only complaint is the fish tacos which were not that great. Our waitress was efficient and nice! I would definitely be coming back here the next time I decide to go window shopping in this 5th avenue mall!"
Benjamin P.,"Manhattan, NY",134,37,62,3.0,1/14/2015,"Pretty classic meal all around, it's exactly what you would expect.  It was tasty for sure, but not the best quality you are going to get for the money. We had the Avocado Eggrolls to start which were quite good.  The Americana hamburger had great toppings and was cooked as I asked (medium rare) but not he best tasting beef.  And, of course, the cheesecake itself was the best part.  Solid choice for the area."
Rasha K.,"Flemington, NJ",9,28,24,2.0,3/19/2016,"Let me start off by saying I came here yesterday to celebrate my birthday. I had to wait over 2 hrs to get a table for 12 which is completely unacceptable. Then I had one of the managers tell me at least 15 times that the table is almost done and they will be leaving soon. After about 10 mins arguing with him I insist he walk over to the table and see what's really going on. Told me the table was empty (no food, no drinks) and they had already paid their bill and they were basically talking the night away. Common courtesy, when the restaurant is busy and your done eating drinking and you paid your bill, please leave and don't waste time. Once that was settled, he sends over the busser to wipe down the tables and reset them. Once that was done, we were directed to the back of the restaurant in a private and enclosed area away from everyone. First thing I notice before I sat down was the utensils plates and napkins were not properly placed on the tables, they were scattered everywhere. Our server then comes over and introduces himself to us. Order our drinks and brings over 2 baskets of bread for a table of 12. Since we didn't order appetizers we munched on atleast 5 baskets of bread before we ordered our entrees. 15-20 mins later it's already 10:45pm when our food comes to us and we basically didn't enjoy the meal as we hoped we would. I barely ate my food that I had to pack it to go because of how late it got. The staff then came over and sang happy birthday to me which was a nice touch to ending the night. I would give this place a 1 star but I gave it a two just to be nice. Won't be coming back here on a Friday night ever again!"
Giotta V.,"Morris Plains, NJ",22,32,2,1.0,3/13/2016,"Maybe the cheesecake is good here but the dinners are very disappointing. We had a couple drinks in the bar while we waited for a table and noticed that the drinks didn't have prices on the menu.  the wine did, the beer did, the food did, but no drink prices... which we found to be a little odd. When we asked how much things were they said it depends anywhere from 7 to $8 and up to $13.  I ended up ordering a skinny Margarita and it was 10.50 but no one could tell me what the price of it was  before I ordered it.  I don't think that's good practice to not put the prices of drinks on the menu and the servers and the bartenders didn't even really seem to know what the prices were until they rang it up. Then we got our table  and I ordered the Almond crusted salmon and kale salad and the reason I ordered this salad was because it had a lot of things in it that I like such as avocado, brussels sprouts and kale. when the salad came out it was just a big pile of kale with some arugula and a piece of salmon on it so I asked the server what happened to all the other things that are listed in it so she brought it back to the kitchen and 20 minutes later brought out that same salad with more kale and some pieces of avocado on it so I just gave up and ate it but they really didn't seem to have any kind of quality assurance nor did they seem to care.  Tables to the left and tight of us were also having isses and sending things back.  the couple next to us had such problems with their food they sent it back and then one had their food 1 didn't for at least 45 minutes.  The person with the food tried to wait for the other person to get their food which I'm sure the first person's food was cold by the time the second person's food came out 45 minutes later and when it did come back they rejected it and sent it back again.  All this time the waitress never came to check on them.. and then they ended up dining and dashing and suddenly  the waitress appeared and took off running after them!  another person next to us left their whole meal on their plate, no one seemed concerned to ask if something was wrong with it.  it seems like this place is really badly run and worse yet, no one seems to care..."
Annie H.,"New York, NY",193,560,1437,1.0,7/10/2013,"Nostalgia... why do you deceive me so? Cheesecake factory was my go-to place in college back in LA.  We even went there for my farewell party before I left for the East coast, so fond memories were always associated with the place.  So you can imagine my excitement when this place opened, despite the fact that my fond memories were years ago, and I've learned a lot more about what food should ""really"" taste like. So coming back to CF, yes the food is generic and formulaic.  Which is okay if you're here because you've been loyal to the place even at your taste bud's protest.   But this time... when you sit and wait for 20 minutes, no one to take your order, not even a glass of water, then try to hail down a waiter for another 5 min, you begin to question your choice of restaurants, your judgement in food, and whether basil belongs in a good cocktail.  And no one, should EVER have to question the deliciousness of basil. I think I'll still visit my old joints in LA, but I won't be back to this one. Sidenote: If you do visit and need to buy a whole cheesecake, note that they come from the freezer. And takes 2-3 hrs to defrost.  No joke, you can save some money buying at Costco."
Alexa A.,"Woodrow, NY",163,118,72,5.0,1/15/2016,Always eat here and usually always have great service. I recently visited and had to wait for the first time but only 10 mins. Got sat and server came right away and took our drink orders and brought bread and than ordered. Food came very fast and server came at least 4 times to check on us. Foods always good here. Will be here again soon and for happy hour.
Jim R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",2,2,,2.0,2/23/2016,I love the Cheesecake Factory but this location offers poor service and inconsistent food prep quality.
Dillon F.,"Livingston, NJ",6,58,,1.0,1/11/2016,"Tuna tartar is supposed to be accompanied by avocado. Avocado is not supposed to be accompanied by tuna. I ordered the ahi tartar and made sure to tell the waitress every time they give me no tuna and too much avocado. I watched her write it down. When it came out, it actually appeared as if there was even less tuna than normal. I immediately asked for a manager and when he came over he managed to try and explain to me that unfortunately ""it's measured out in the morning and I can't do anything about this"". I asked him to take it back and to please just hurry my food up. I will NOT be back here and I will no longer recommend this place to people, and I am someone who came frequently (4x a month) NO MORE !"
Steven H.,"Maplewood, NJ",360,463,2277,3.0,7/24/2011,"First, I admit it is not exactly fair to review a restaurant in its first week.  But this IS Cheesecake Factory, so you know that even a new one is pretty likely to adhere to the corporate formula.  This is (so far) a welcome addition to the Short Hills Mall, having replaced a Johnny Rockets and some other stores I never shopped at.  It is pretty in that CCF faux-finish way.   It was not yet chaotic the Sunday I ate there in its first week, and the food was actually quite tasty, and arrived  in a well-paced, unhurried way.  Our table started with white bean hummus, sliders and (gasp) fried mac-and-cheese balls.  All were quite tasty, especially the latter, which, while utterly delicious, is loathsome from a health perspective. We had a variety of salads and pastas.  All were good.  We were all stuffed, so no dessert,  and I am not a big fan of their cheesecake in any event. I have a feeling that in the coming weeks this place will be mobbed once word of its opening gets out, so I have no illusions that I will have the patience anytime soon to wait for a table there again.  But I am glad I got to try it early on."
Agustin K.,"New York, NY",677,993,432,3.0,7/4/2013,"One star reduction since they no longer have my shrimp and grits!! And they ran out of brown bread when we were there on Tuesday night.   I am happy they are keeping their small plate menu items so will most likely come back for that.  And of course, pasta da vinci, it's their version of Milanese sauce but much better!! I like the bar area... Faster service since it is close to the kitchen, bar and registers."
Kieran B.,"West Orange, NJ",63,30,102,1.0,8/27/2014,"Normally everything is fine but not tonight 8/15. Server came to the table, didn't introduce herself. The server brought the bread to the table and asked if we wanted anything to drink and was standing like we were taking too long ( 5 sec ) later. I said could we all have water with a lemon. She left and I said to my wife and mother- in- law. Maybe it's Sunday so attention to detail isn't important. Annoyed! Down hill from there. My check was the best part of the night because I could leave...."
Michael G.,"Florham Park, NJ",51,141,1,3.0,1/12/2016,"It's decent for a chain but it's always so crowded and I find the service to be spotty. However, if you sit at the bar area during their happy hour the service is much better and they have a half price menu which is pretty good."
Desiree N.,"Newark, NJ",0,2,1,1.0,1/29/2016,No one is in the restaurant but we still wait for service for 20mins at 12pm........ So bad never come to this one again
Megan W.,"Flanders, NJ",137,25,1,1.0,11/11/2015,"I'll never go back. If I ever go with a group bigger than two I wait entirely too long to be seated.  I don't think I've ever been greated by a host with a smile, everyone there always seems to have an attitude. Always have to wait forever for the server to come to the table. Service is always slow. Sometimes you get bread, sometimes you don't. The portions are big and the food looks good on the plate and it tastes good. Can't complain much about the food but the staff needs to be better trained."
Mike P.,"Livingston, NJ",314,551,161,3.0,5/16/2013,"TOO MANY CHOICES!!! All of the food is formulaic.  They make very good salads, but with that many items on the menu, it's no surprise that most of the dishes are hit and miss. Of course, they do make excellent cheesecake. I find myself overwhelmed at every visit, simply because the menu reads like a phone book.  I get intimidated..."
Tova B.,"Jersey City, NJ",92,338,394,2.0,9/12/2012,"I'm not the biggest fan of chain restaurants, however when my Canadian friends came to visit, it was very high on their list of places to go. Why? I couldn't tell you, except they were obsessed. On their last night here, we went to the Cheesecake Factory.  After we were seated the waitress, not so nicely introduced herself, following it up with telling us that the restaurant closed at 10 - it was 8:30. While I thought it was a little unprofessional and rude, I ignored it.  We were waiting for the forth member of our party - which we had told both the hostess as we were seated and the waitress when she came for our drinks orders. She seemed very annoyed that she had to wait, and disappeared... not to the point of we could not see her, she walked past us plenty of times, but she ignored us until SHE was ready.  While she did seem very familiar with the menu, she did not seem to want to answer any questions. Thankfully a different server delivered our food. Of course, as it's the Cheesecake Factory, my Canadian friends want cheescake (I had tried to take them to Juniors, but they weren't interested). My Canadians friends and my boyfriend all ordered cheesecake, but as the only New Yorker in the world who doesn't like Cheesecake, I ordered the Apple Crisp. Well, as the waitress had not written down away of the desserts we ordered, she brought me the Apple Strudel cheesecake. When we mentioned it was the wrong item, she took the dish back, but not before we heard her say ""Bitch.""  My Canadian friends were very upset and had the manager come over - who was very understanding. However, I don't think a server should have that kind of attitude - at least not in the dining room. Like I said before, I'm not a fan of chains, but I will definitely be staying away from this particular location."
Laura G.,"Morristown, NJ",0,19,1,5.0,1/10/2016,"One of my favorite restaurants in Jersey it never disappoints, Yes the menu is big and Yes it is more pricey than other restaurants in the area but it is worth it!!!!!!!!!  The service is all ways right on top of it,  are waiter never let are glasses run low with diet soda or water. I still am having dreams about my salad when that happens I know it was good."
