Patrick C.,"Jersey City, NJ",243,24,44,3.0,10/13/2014,"Typical Cheesecake Factory. The food is nothing extraordinary and the menu is about 30 pages long. The issue with that is the meals are inconsistent and there's no ""go to"" meal. I tend to stick to the skinnylicious menu here because their regular portions are huge.  The service here was pretty good considering we had a large party (20+). We made a reservation day of and they were able to accommodate. Food came out relatively quickly."
Vanessa R.,"East Hanover, NJ",43,28,14,4.0,10/3/2014,"Well we had to wait for a table, but considering it was a friday night the wait wasnt half bad. The last time i came to a cheesecake factory I was left super disappointed but they totally made up for it. The food. The service. The drinks. On point. I ordered the pineapple mojito and it was heavenly. For appetizers we had crab cakes and they were a bit heavy handed on the mayo but I like that so I enjoyed them. My entree was the chicken madeira and I loved it. I practically finished the entire meal. The mashed potatoes were SO good. I didnt order any desert. I knew I wouldnt eat it, but its the cheesecake factory,  so im assuming with all confidence that you cant go wrong with cheesecake. Our server was really nice and super attentive. My water cup was NEVER empty and he checked him often enough with us. I really liked him. Over all a good experience in the chain restaurante department."
Nancy P.,"East Hanover, NJ",53,43,22,3.0,7/26/2014,"Wait is always a killer...but if the mall is open you can shop around with the buzzer they give you.  We had the sliders and potato skin apps pretty good, tots were a little over fried for my taste.  The waiter started off great and then got less attentive as the dinner went on.  I waited ten minutes for more water.  The floor is super slippery in the bar area as my husbands chair kept sliding around during our whole meal.  We are waiting now for our cheesecake going on ten minutes.  I'll take a pic lol so will be be back yeah, maybe in 5 or 6 months def not in the near future"
Ross G.,"New Providence, NJ",0,14,,1.0,11/27/2015,"I wrote a fairly negative review when this CCF opened up in 2011.  However, we hung in and so did they.  Service got better and we probably averaged two visits a week since then. We generally time our visits in the late afternoon on weekdays to avoid waiting and, while spotty, overall it was good enough to keep us coming. That said, we have seen a considerable deterioration of both service and food quality over the last six months.  While there are some great waiters and waitresses, there is a lot of standing around and talking to each other when the restaurant is not busy and seeming overwhelmed when it is.  Either way, no one checks and refills drinks or comes around to see if everything is OK.  People walk around but still ignore customers. We put up with this because we loved the food, but almost every time we have visited this restaurant over the last two months something has been wrong with one of our meals (cold fries, cold mashed potatoes, mayonnaise when we asked for dry, etc..) such that one of us ate while the other waited for the correct food.  One visit, it took so long to get the correct meal that I ate dessert with my wife and took home my main course when it finally arrived.  We have also noticed great variation in portion sizes, things generally getting smaller then occasionally huge again.  Cake is most noticeable in the variation.  It also takes a long time to get food, even when the restaurant isn't busy. The last straw was Wednesday.  We were seated immediately.  The waitress was friendly but overwhelmed.  My wife's fries came out cold. And my meat loaf came with a few drips of gravy.  My wife got her new fries.  I asked for more gravy.  We did not see our waitress again for 10 or 15 minutes.  I never got gravy.  We had to eventually stop another waitress to ask for our drinks to be refilled.  We were so frustrated by the end of the night that even my wife, who cannot get enough of CCF agreed we were going back to other restaurants. Noticed lots of managers in the store CCF must know,they have a problem.  Doesn't seem to be working."
Kim D.,"Fremont, CA",1,81,34,1.0,8/7/2015,"Usually order takeout. You call, someone picks up and puts you on hold... You wait and wait and wait. Finally, you hang up.  Then you call the reservation desk, explain that no one is taking orders, they take your order and walk it to the to go counter.  Need a better takeout/to go system!"
Alex L.,"West Orange, NJ",254,10,,1.0,1/19/2015,"I have no idea wth happend with the Cheesecake Factory tonight but it was a real disaster. To start things off when we got in the door we were initially given a 20 min wait time, real wait time 1 hour. My mother at one point when we were waiting had asked for a glass of water and it took me on line at the take out counter for 30 mins to be able to get that for her. I had even asked one of the staff members for the water and had nastily been told to wait on line. I'm not asking for cheesecake just water... Calm down.   When we finally got to our table the utensils were dirty wth? Our server was a nice girl but her head really wasn't in it! First she forgot the wine we ordered and it took 3 times back to the kitchen to get my meal right. Mind you when it did get to the table my parents were done with the meals they had so I just had enough time to grab a bite or two and get the hell out of there. It wasn't anything weirdly complicated either, just laziness. Beyond that the food was bland and really not worth the  80 bucks they squeezed out of us.  Not going back. Oh.. Also... They need to have a more proactive policy on screaming toddlers. These kids had managed to scream throughout the entire meal and it gave me a throbbing headache. As a server or staff member doesn't it ever occur to you that this may be really uncomfortable for the other guests to have to listen to?"
Linda M.,"Warren, NJ",1,59,,4.0,11/5/2015,"I often meet friends here for lunch and we usually have salads.  I get the Asian Chicken Salad, which has a plum dressing that is delicious.  Pretzel crusted chicken appetizer is amazing as is the fried zucchini.  Interestingly, the desserts aren't that good.  The chocolate cake is good but it is so rich that you can't even eat the whole piece ( which is huge).  The scary part is the number of calories in some of their items. The salads are near 600 calories and a slice of cheesecake is over 1000 calories!!!   Wait staff is usually attentive and frequently refill sodas and ice teas.  Prices are good.  Ambience is very nice. Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employee"
Priscilla J.,"Morristown, NJ",0,20,,4.0,4/26/2016,"Although I generally find chain restaurant food to be decent but underwhelming, the Cheesecake Factory seems to be the exception. I've been to several locations over the years, and only today I realized that I've never had a bad meal there. Two of my usuals are the Thai Lettuce Wraps (when I want something a little lighter) and the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas (those corn cakes on the side are ah-mazing). Today my boss treated the staff to lunch for Admin. Professional's Day, and everyone loved their meals. We shared several appetizers: Avocado Egg Rolls (always a favorite; these are ridiculously good), Buffalo Blasts (really good; the portion is huge), the Crab & Artichoke Dip (okay but not great; the flavor was a little lacking), and the Fried Mac n Cheese Balls (I mean it's fried mac n cheese. what's not to love?) For my meal, I had the fish tacos with the tempura style fish. I've had plenty of fish tacos in my day, and these are pretty exceptional. The cabbage slaw takes it over the top with the right amount of acidity and crunch. The rice and beans on the side were better than average as well. I ordered my cheesecake to go because I was beyond stuffed at this point. I had the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake, and I'd definitely recommend it (as long as you're not one of those if it's not chocolate it's not dessert kind of people). It was the perfect balance of sweet and tart, and the ladyfingers added an extra textural element which I thoroughly enjoyed. All in all, an amazing lunch and the leftovers made for a delicious dinner."
Robert F.,"San Francisco, CA",89,62,9,4.0,7/7/2014,"If you've been to one cheese cake you've been to then all. The service was good. Brought everything out hot and quick. Waters refilled as needed. They had the soccer game on, which was nice. If you're in the mood for the cheese cake factory, head here."
Lance B.,"Scotch Plains, NJ",0,12,2,3.0,11/8/2015,"This location isn't one of the better ones I've been too.  The service is OK, not great.  Our server, Larry is always very cordial and does a great job with our orders.  He carries himself with much class and is always polite and respectful.  I feel he deserves to work at a much better restaurant.  This location is beneath him.  The food is not up to the standard of what The Cheesesteak Factory is known for.  My appetizer wasn't good.  And my Mexican Omelette dish had dry, hard pork ends instead of pork chunks thats supposed to be in it.  I've been to this location numerous times for brunch, and they are getting lazy with their food presentation.  And they always want to seat us in a corner in the back near the kitchen or the register.  Today we went to the Woodbridge location, and everything was so much better.  Skip the Short Hills' location."
G B.,"Kenilworth, NJ",12,674,4853,5.0,3/29/2015,had the loaded baked potato bites. so good!!!
K S.,"Millburn, NJ",2,69,15,4.0,8/12/2015,Extremely good resturant. Always busy and really good cheesecake. Really attentive people. The downfall is the business.
S C.,"East Hanover, NJ",21,383,42,5.0,5/25/2015,"Awesome happy hour deals - drinks for $5.50 from 4-6pm in the bar area. Love the strawberry shortcake dessert! One of the best ever made with scones/biscuits and lots of vanilla ice cream and strawberries. Their beef sliders and guacamole are both pretty good too. Great service if you sit at the bar - friendly, attentive and efficient."
Louise M.,"Cranford, NJ",178,209,22,3.0,3/16/2014,"Came here around 2:30pm on a Sunday and there was no wait for 2 people. We were seated right away, which is great because we are used to waiting 30+ minutes at other Cheesecake Factory locations. There seems to be a longer wait for larger parties. Our waitress was chatty but friendly, a little slow on the refills but that's ok. I ordered my favorite Chicken Bellagio - prepared to perfection but was not as hot as I would've liked. The boyfriend had his usual crab wontons - this one was made juuust right.  Things they could work on:  The bread. Waaay too toasted and not warm enough. It felt like we were biting into croutons!  Silverware. Lots of suspicious water stains. At least, I want to believe they were just water stains. I asked our waitress for a cleaner butter knife and received an equally dirty one. Otherwise a pretty solid Cheesecake Factory. Will come back again."
Rocio S.,"Berkeley Heights, NJ",21,4,,2.0,8/2/2015,"Second time eating here, second time I get a hair in my food! Ugh!!!!!!!! Manager comes back with a replacement item for my hairy food. I had to tell him to just take it off the bill. On the second occasion I was with my kids having brunch and again a hair in my toast. When I told the waiter he got the manager who came out with replacement toast. So again I had to ask him to just take the food and take off my bill. I told him this was the second time and he just said , ""oh sorry,they all wear head nets"". Seriously!  So so disappointing!"
Noelle S.,"Morristown, NJ",7,41,31,5.0,12/3/2013,"This place is awesome.  They have a huge menu and there are so many things I want to try but I'm stuck in a rut.  I always go for the lunch size salads (either the cobb or luau).  The portions are huge!  The staff is super friendly.  I used to meet my sister here weekly and I miss it so much. I would recommend this place to anyone as they have all types of food. It's always packed but you never really have to wait to long,"
Morgan D.,"Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ",2,7,,5.0,5/29/2015,"The food was great as always and the service was spectacular! This location is especially gorgeous and well maintained! It was definitely hard to decide but if you're looking for a good appetizer, I recommend the factory nachos! I'm coming back for sure!"
Holly B.,"Union, NJ",10,8,,3.0,5/29/2014,"I like the cheesecake... in fact I love the cheesecake, there's something deliciously creamy and smooth about a no-bake cheesecake... I usually stick with the original it's still the best and not as sugary as all the other options.  And there are a lot of other options. That said, I've never had a good meal here.  The menu just might be too big... I've had the chicken mushroom dish, steak Madeira, Jamaican curry, not a single dish was that good.  Except the avocado strolls, but $9 for eggrolls???"
Edna C.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",129,372,137,3.0,7/26/2013,"Delicious foods but it takes forever. Be prepared to spend 1.5 hours here, 30min eating and 1 hour just waiting for your order to be taken, the food to be prepared & served to you, and your check to come. I like that they have a 'healthy' menu, because all the normal appetizers are fried or made with a ton of mayo/cheese.  Portions are large, cheesecake is plentiful. Lots of screaming babies & children."
Tonia S.,"New York, NY",2,42,13,5.0,4/11/2015,"I was slightly reluctant on eating at the Cheese Cake Factory because One of the guest in my party has severe food allergies which makes dining out extremely difficult especially since it's a child & I didn't want to single them out ... I went in, asked to speak with the manager (as I always do) & was seated... When she came over i expressed my concerns & I have to say she went up & beyond to accommodate us & was totally grateful & surprised because of poor past experiences at other food chains... I will definitely return with confidence in knowing my concerns where just as important to them"
