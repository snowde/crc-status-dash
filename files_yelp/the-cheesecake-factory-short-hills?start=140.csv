Sergio O.,"Elizabeth, NJ",0,4,,5.0,4/6/2016,"Great service and great food. Awesome atmosphere, not too dark not too bright. Service was great and I'd like to point out outstanding service of a young shnazzy good looking, sexy beast of a busboy Sam F who attended to my frequent request :)"
Lucy F.,"Florham Park, NJ",25,28,25,4.0,8/5/2014,"This is a neat place to have a nice meal whether it is a casual dinner or a special occasion. They have a pretty big menu with lots of options to choose from. Came here with family and was not disappointed at all. It was a birthday dinner so the wait staff sang a bday song while bringing the cake with a candle on it which was nice of them to do. The food, the drinks, and the service were great"
John M.,"Florham Park, NJ",48,46,10,2.0,2/12/2015,"Ate here twice. Food was ok, hair in my food once... 2nd time the waiter was training another waiter. I guess there weren't enough people working. Took forever to get my food even for utensils. Asked for extra dressing for my salad.... Didn't get it until I was practically done eating"
Amanda T.,"Fishers, IN",1,3,,1.0,6/1/2015,If I could give zero stars I would. Terrible terrible take out service managers have no control of their staff. Took me 30 minutes just to get a hold of someone to take my order.
Vonnie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,328,519,4.0,12/30/2013,"I like to visit here when I am staying at the Hilton across the street.  I've only eaten at the bar and never sat down inside the restaurant.  The bartenders are always friendly, service is always quick and their food is usually consistent as a chain. If I had to be picky about anything at this restaurant is that when I was in the takeout area, I overheard one of the employees loudly complaining about customers.  She didn't realize that I was there and was just venting but should probably be more mindful next time."
Craig R.,"Newark, NJ",0,6,5,1.0,3/30/2015,"The service level on SUNDAY 3/22/15 was horrific. My friend and I arrived at 8:45pm, we were seated at 8:55p. After waiting at the table for 9 minutes, my friend asked the hostess who was our server. We then saw and heard several servers arguing about who didn't  want to take us. Finally, after another 4 minutes our server appears. He just asks what would you guys like. Normally, Im asked would I like to start off with drinks or appetizers. Great servers even tell you the specials. I felt very dissatisfied as a customer and will never eat at CHEESECAKE FACTORY in Short Hills ever again. I will tell all my friends and family, this is a place that doesn't redpect you, so dont spend your money there. Corporate will definitely be notified!!"
Sharon M.,"Berkeley Heights, NJ",0,3,,1.0,11/24/2015,"Instead of eating at Cheesecake Factory, stay home and eat a few tablespoons of salt. You'll save money and won't be consuming as much sodium as most of the entrees."
Jane P.,"Summit, NJ",5,34,10,4.0,1/8/2015,"We always have the pot stickers, wings, and ahi carpaccio for our appetizers, all of which were wonderful.  Great menu choices for everyone."
Dawn P.,"Sussex, NJ",0,6,,2.0,3/5/2016,I'm a regular at other locations of The Cheesecake Factory. This is the first time I went to Short Hills. The menu and food were typical but the service was horrible.  We were seated for some time before our food order was taken and I thought maybe the waiter was giving us time to chat.  That was the start.  We didn't receive bread until I asked for it with our main course.  We had to ask for drink refills because they were completely empty.  At other locations the server brings them when they are half empty.  I don't think I've ever had to ask. It was just plain slow.  Took forever for a cappuccino to arrive.  Sad part is I didn't order cheesecake because I couldn't stand to wait again.  It took 2 hours to eat here.  I've been at other locations where it was packed (including Valentine's Day) and I've always felt that I've had good service.  Not here.
Blond B.,"Stroudsburg, PA",121,280,105,5.0,10/27/2013,This is definitely my ultimate favorite chain! I used to go here since I was young to the Long Island Westbury location. I used to beg my parents to take me there when I was a teenager ... always delicious with good service.  The factory nachos or buffalo blasts are the best for appetizer ... the bread is delicious ... I have tried so many different entree's and they all have been amazing however my ultimate favorite is Chicken Madeira and Moroccan Chicken ( I ask for the mash instead of rice tho ... yum yum). Drinks are so yummy as well and can't forget dessert!!! Overall I have been to so many different locations numerous amounts of times and love it there all the time !!!! Only downside is sometimes the wait is a little long ... but they say good things come to those who wait ... and it's definitely worth it !
Arlene A.,"Cranford, NJ",21,137,37,3.0,10/19/2014,"I really enjoy the IDEA of the Cheesecake Factory, and their exasperatingly huge menu... Each time we pay them a visit, I secretly fantasize that all the delicious menu items are lovingly handcrafted by five-star Michelin chefs who are simply waiting for each order to come to them. Usually, there is something or another that occurs at TCF that brings me plummeting back to earth. Take for example yesterday. My family and I went for a late lunch and were promptly seated. We ordered the cheeseburger sliders for our child and kale salad & Vietnamese style fresh rolls for me and my husband got the Chicken & Biscuits. When my child's order arrived, my husband took a test bite and found a looong red hair embedded in his bite. We informed the waitress, who without a word brought back the offending plate to the kitchen and several minutes later brought a freshly cooked order of new sliders that were delicious AND hair-free. My salad and rolls were as good and fresh as always, and Hubby's chicken and biscuits were fantastic. When we got our bill, we saw the child's slider order was removed, which was completely the appropriate thing to do, and we added the amount towards the waitress's tip. TCF is great in theory if you don't really pontificate about all the moving parts that it takes to make it operate. Just enjoy it for what it is and keep an eye open for the occasional stray hair."
Raul A.,"Saint Louis, MO",125,335,209,3.0,8/13/2013,Pretty typical Cheesecake Factory experience.  Service was pretty good.  Bummer they ran out of Dulce de Leche cheesecake and so we had to opt for another selection but overall a good experience. Side note:  The amount of birthday celebrations were crazy. I swear it was like 8 or more sing along Birthday chants.  Wow.
Frank F.,"Morris Plains, NJ",0,18,5,1.0,8/7/2015,"Went for dinner on a Thursday night it was pretty busy we were told that it was about a 15min wait we patiently sat and waited. After about 20 min the buzzer went off we were escorted to a tight table between other patrons we nicely asked for a booth so we could have our conversation in private they obliged and put us in a booth they gave us our menus and left, after 5 min a manger or hostess came over and told us that we could not sit there because this table was promised to someone else???? After being sat we were now told we had to wait an additional 20min if we wanted a booth! Really we left and will never be back to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant ever again!!!"
Clara R.,"Hopatcong, NJ",33,77,49,4.0,12/9/2014,"It's a fancy diner, if a diner could ever be fancy... I come here for their happy hour.  $5 LITS, mojitos, margaritas and a couple other cocktails.  They have several appetizers for only $5.  I love the breaded Mac n cheese balls, although they are clearly frozen and then fried.  They're a guilty pleasure!  I am also a fan of the crab goat cheese wontons.  Its a very generous portion for $5.  I also ordered the ahi tar tar.  It was OK, as expected since Cheesecake Factory is neither a seafood nor sushi restaurant."
Leslie Y.,"Elizabeth, NJ",40,61,23,5.0,10/1/2014,I'm giving this five stars because I really like Cheesecake Factory (they are somehow able to mass produce tasty foods of a ridiculous variety) and this location is often quite free as opposed to other NJ locations.
Purpose T.,"Hillside, NJ",1159,301,100,4.0,5/19/2014,One of my favorite locations. Service is great. Food is always good. Pasta dishes and miso salmon are my top picks. I had the bbq ranch chicken salad w/the buttermilk pepper dressing. it was decent. nothing too spectacular.
Dave P.,"Portland, ME",31,8,,5.0,10/5/2014,The mac and cheese burger. Lemon Raspberry Cheese Cake. WOW! I am even more so impressed with the service. Everyone I was with was stunned. The setting. The noise level was perfect. I highly recommend The Cheese Cake factory. I will be coming back to try every cheesecake!
Jon L.,"Jersey City, NJ",85,70,71,4.0,9/9/2012,"As Atul Gawande opined in a recent New Yorker, the Cheesecake Factory is, above all else, consistent in what it offers - a family-friendly dining experience with huge portions (it's no wonder that professional athletes cite tCF as their restaurant of choice on the road). No, it's not Michelin star-worthy, but the food much better and more varied  than your run-of-the-mill family restaurant chains.  Why this place gets at least four stars: -If I were to rate the chain as a whole, I'd probably give it 4 1/2 stars, so it starts at a high baseline. I can't think of any other restaurant that has a menu as big as this one and manages to pull off even 2/3 of the dishes passably well. Notice, I said passably well, not great. But, when you have leftovers for another meal (or two), you shouldn't judge too harshly. Why this place gets no more than four stars: -This particular location is smaller than others I've been to, so sometimes the wait can be long.  -Another infrastructural issue - the restrooms are smaller than usual - both in terms of space inside and the number of stalls. Maybe the designers figured the smaller seating capacity makes it a moot point, but did they anticipate having an additional list of patrons waiting 30-45 minutes?"
Sergio S.,"Stewartsville, NJ",0,5,,1.0,11/5/2015,"Terrible experience - poor food quality, high price, slow service. Returned dish twice. Manager never came."
Tina Q.,"Bayonne, NJ",0,25,12,1.0,1/17/2016,I was there on a Sunday night. Almost 6:00PM. The place was packed. I was trying to place a carry out order. I was standing by the counter for almost ten minutes. No one would like to come over to check on me. A waitress saw me at least six times without saying a word. And a waiter passed a order to the customer in front of me and run away right away. He looked like he was afraid to talk to me. In this situation I left without any other choice.
