Angela L.,"Philadelphia, PA",155,27,12,3.0,4/24/2013,I love the new location! However the staff can be unfriendly at times.. Avocado egg rolls never fail! It's a nice place to eat after a day of shopping at the Short Hills Mall.
Michael G.,"New York, NY",41,45,13,4.0,8/17/2012,"Had a great experience here for lunch yesterday.  I did not know that CCF had a happy hour menu and was kindly informed by my server Holly (who was amaze); This is typically not the case in the service industry where the service provider's wages are based of ""commission"" of sales.  Because of Holly's upfront honesty, attentive service ( she even struck up conversation about the book I was reading) and customer first mentality I ended up leaving her a 35% tip.  I would give CCF five stars but the host was a bitch and they put giant (five inch plus) sized pieces for chicken on my nachos that needed to be cut with a knife and it was soo much trouble that I took them home!"
Samantha S.,"Clark, NJ",501,462,,3.0,2/26/2012,"I love the Cheesecake Factory.  I think the food is generally very good, the desserts are great, and the service is usually more than satisfactory.  However, I was not overly pleased with this particular location.  It seems smaller than most, which is fine, but will undoubtedly lead to long waits during peak times.  I came for dinner with a friend on a Wednesday evening, and we were seated right away.  Our waitress did not appear for several minutes, and then it took some time to receive our drinks and bread.  We could not find her to order for a time that seemed too long for our liking.  I ordered a tomato, basil and cheese pizza, and my friend ordered the chicken parmigiana sandwich.  We both were very happy with our meals.  The food was great, as always.  We then had to wait again for to-go boxes and the check for quite some time.  It was becoming annoying. I think this Cheesecake Factory location will be very successful, as the Short Hills Mall was slightly in need of another dining spot.  I think the food is great, but the service seemed to need improvement.  Hopefully over time, this will get better.  I think I will stick to the Menlo Park location."
John F.,"Hoboken, NJ",42,254,,3.0,10/21/2012,"If you've been to one, you haven't been to them all.  Even though the menu is basically the same at every CCF, the quality of the food and service may vary.  That being said, the food here was very good, came out hot, and tasted fresh.  In fact, my burger (Smokehouse BBQ) happened to be very good and was cooked to a perfect medium.   The service was solid, but nothing to write home about.  Lunch specials are reasonably priced.  I'll be back next time I'm at the Short Hills Mall."
Katir S.,"Wayne, NJ",0,2,,2.0,12/3/2015,"It took 20 minutes just to get someone on the phone so I can place my order, then they said to come in 20 minutes to pick it up. When I was there, it took an extra 30 minutes just to bag it and find which one was mine. I double checked with one of the staff to make sure my order was right before leaving and she  didn't look but insisted that it was. When I left, i was sadly disappointed to see that it was not what I ordered."
Doug L.,"Madison, NJ",0,16,,2.0,5/24/2014,"You know what you are going to get here, production line food that is bland and has no real thought in it. My advice is to go somewhere that care about the taste of the food that they are serving. At being said. They had a great selection for kids."
Z H.,"Denville, NJ",41,18,,2.0,8/22/2015,"This was our second visit to this Cheesecake Factory.  The service as very slow. They got my order wrong, and the coffee was so horrible that it needed two sugars to make it drinkable."
Vanessa T.,"Honolulu, HI",155,444,14,1.0,1/9/2012,"Let me start off by saying that I love Cheesecake Factory food. Their Pasta da Vinci and salads are what keep me coming back. Cheesecake Factory is like BJ's/TGIF/Applebee's - a place you avoid like the plague unless your friend is throwing their birthday dinner there. Why? Because you'll wait forever for a table, then wait forever for your waiter, wait for your food and so forth. Dining becomes a long drawn out experience peppered with frustration, self-questioning and muttered threats of going home and Yelping. I understand that these types of places are almost always busy and Sunday lunchtime is no exception. However our bread basket arrived 20+ minutes after our waitress asked us if we'd like some and by a completely different waiter. The bf's soda had to wait 30 minutes to get refilled (also by a different waiter). Are you serious? Where did our server disappear to? I was not offered fresh parmesan for my pasta and um hello.. my middle name is ""More Cheese Please!"" Food is always consistent and service is consistently lacking. No thanks."
Luke S.,"San Jose, CA",1,46,15,1.0,7/3/2015,Ordered a medium well burger and got it extra well done (ie burnt and bitter from the char) and the patty falling apart. Sent it back for a medium and it was still more than well done and still bitter. I was just craving a decent burger after wasting an hour at lunch I didn't get one.
Bill M.,"Florham Park, NJ",3,16,1,1.0,12/14/2013,Order all screwed up. Sent my burger to wrong table. Rude manager.  I watched the four other people in my group eat their meals. Then they watched me eat. Great celebration. Management's idea of compensation: a free slice of cheesecake. Not in a rush to go back.
T F.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,39,6,2.0,6/12/2015,Wow food was just nasty service was good and fast our waiter was very nice but the food was just nasty I guess the Cheesecake Factory isn't what it use to be..
Dominique M.,"Pelham Gardens, Bronx, NY",34,7,2,5.0,5/2/2014,Love love this Cheesecake Factory compared to the ones I been too stay away from Ridge hill cheese factory terrible service
Matt R.,"Short Hills, NJ",0,2,,3.0,8/15/2015,"This place is what you'd expect from a typical Cheesecake Factory (or similar) chain. Think-a step above Applebees/Fridays (IMO). This location is always busy and the service is usually fine, nothing spectacular-I've worked in restaurants before so I can understand mediocore service during the dinner rush. The menu is absolutely insane (its spiral bound like a book) and I never end up liking what I ordered because there are so many options for meals. The entrees aren't worth gushing over,  but the avocado spring rolls are a great appetizer and obviously the dessert is where it's at-you pretty much need to order cheesecake when you're here. When it comes to CF, keep your expectations medium to low so you are even more satisfied when you're digging in to your peanut butter choc. cheesecake!"
Irene W.,"Livingston, NJ",187,44,3,5.0,10/31/2013,Can't beat the happy hour specials here - half off appetizers and drinks from 4-6pm!  Love coming here after a long day at work.
Akee S.,"Gretna, LA",0,4,,1.0,7/17/2015,"I would give 0 stars if I could! Pathetic!! Called right before leaving to get there, they told me that they had a lot of empty seating when I got there we had to wait for 35-45 mins."
Kareem P.,"Newark, NJ",3,6,,3.0,3/22/2015,"So cheesecake factory the food is always amazing. But omg the service is the worst. We heard severs arguing bc they didnt wanna take us. We were two black men hungry n looking to drink. Now you get y they didnt want us. But the servers arguing  bout taking us were also black . He  came over n said yall ready. He gave  us little to no interaction unless i made eye contact. I was so mad that i still got my snicker cheesecake togo, which was delicious, but would have been to irrate to speak with a manager. People come out bc they have a crap day n when yu paying for something n wanna be tipped on it than take pride.  My friend payed the bill n i told him not to leave anything bc service sucked but good thing we have Hackensack n edison. I went there n there service games is on point.  Only given a three bc food again was good.."
Annie O.,"Scotch Plains, NJ",0,87,121,4.0,11/22/2013,"For its Happy Hour and the chicken potstickers on that menu - a cheap, cheerful and tasty time !"
Gina A.,"South Orange, NJ",0,5,,2.0,11/8/2015,"we love cheesecake factory for the menu, and would get this once a week if we werent so frustrated by the management at short hills.  this particular location is very poorly managed.  we've gone out as a family several times here and always encounter lackluster service.  dont bother even trying to do takeout at this place."
Jane M.,"Morris County, NJ",138,361,206,5.0,9/11/2011,"Finally! Cheesecake Factory has arrived at the Short Hills Mall, what took you so long? You can't beat the menu, but you will need to be patient.  Just  like every other Cheesecake Factory, you will need to wait, and that is just life at the Cheesecake Factory. Sade our server was happy, attentive and quite knowledgeable.  The meal of course was terrific.  They offer complimentary valet service when validated so take advantage of it."
Dara M.,"New York, NY",70,230,10,5.0,11/1/2013,"What can I say? I absolutely love this place. I mean, it's a chain, right? How different can they be? Well, not so different afterall.  But the location is good, right at the mall, and opposite one of my favorite hotels(Hilton), so all in all I'd say it's a good place. Been here twice already, and I'm sure that it's not my last!"
