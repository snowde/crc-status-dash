Elizabeth L.,"Upland, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/10/2015,You can never go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory! Always a favorite and never disappoints no matter which location I go to.
Donnell N.,"Baltimore, MD",1,3,,1.0,3/25/2014,"Was in town on business and decided to grab lunch on 3/21 with clients before heading back to Maryland.  This particular visit was awful.  After waiting 20+ minutes to be seated, server arrived quickly and took our order.  Shortly thereafter, 2 out of 3 meals arrived.  The 3rd one never came and we could not find our server.  She was MIA.  When she finally returned to the table, after the two meals were almost completely eaten, she noticed that I didn't have one and quickly apologized and said she would check on it. I asked to see the manager who showed up at the table with a bad attitude and had the audacity to say she saw my pizza sitting in the window and didn't know why it was never delivered.   The server then arrived with my salad and pizza at the same time.  It was obvious that both had been sitting back there for a while.  When I declined to accept, the manager asked me if there was anything else she could do.  She never really apologized and when asked for a comment card, she simply replied they do not have any and that I would have to go online to submit my comments. Thanks to them, I didn't get the opportunity to eat and ended up grabbing a quick bite at one of the service plazas on the Turnpike.  Shame on you Cheesecake Factory for being so horrible this time.  I have taken clients there before but will give serious consideration to taking them there again. There was no ownership or accountability from management.  Donnell"
Elizabeth D.,"Morristown, NJ",3,28,5,1.0,8/4/2014,"Reason for the one star -- the service and management is HORRIBLE! Just had one if the worst dining experiences and it wasn't because of the food. 20 minutes without a greeting, 15 minutes to get drinks, waiter not knowing the menu... And worst... Obviously looking around and trying to get someone's attention and not one person lifted an eyelash. Where was the manager or staff? I wouldn't be this disappointed if a similar situation hadn't occurred 2 weeks prior. I will not be going back. My advice- hire accountable staff, train them properly and be an aware and proactive manager. The level of service had decreased significantly since it opened at short hills. This is coming from someone who was in the service industry for years, I have beyond patience and understanding, so you can tell how upsetting this dining experience has made me."
Vivienne G.,"Morningside Heights, Manhattan, NY",73,21,43,4.0,8/25/2013,"Everything is pleasantly perfect, expect the fact that it is sooooo crowded... We arrived at 6 pm, and have our dinner at 8.30 pm.... However, the dishes are amazing that I believe I can forgive that....LOL"
Larry R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",9,93,116,2.0,7/18/2013,"The food is consistent with the rest of the chain, predictable and plentiful. The wait staff seems to be in perpetual training mode and not at all clear about menu choices and preparation- yes it's a very large menu. What frosts me the most is that after 3 visits it's been the same, wait time 15-20 minutes stated by hostess, actually 35-40 minutes. Complaint to manager was met with an apology and excuse that hostess staff was understaffed, does that make sense??????"
Michael M.,"East Hanover, NJ",0,10,,2.0,7/14/2014,"Short Hills Mall location - Food was good but I agree with the other reviews on here and on Facebook ... the service is terrible.  Our waiter took forever to greet us, after served us he never came back to check on us, he finally came with the check and took it while he had a pile of dirty dishes from another table in his hands.  If you're looking for decent food and don't care about slow/absent service than the Cheese Cake Factory at Short Hills is for you."
Steve M.,"Montclair, NJ",66,158,93,2.0,8/13/2012,"Not a fan!  Have tried twice and both times our food was not that good.  Really wanted a better place to eat at the mall.  Also, it really took way too long to get served."
Frank G.,"Severn, MD",39,301,4,1.0,5/25/2012,"Large portions of horrid, processed food served in a loud, crowded space inside a shopping mall. Basically, the perfect vision of Hell."
Lucy D.,"Nantucket, MA",41,682,41,4.0,6/13/2013,"Happy Hour rocks at this place! Service and food were very good. Portions are quite large, so come hungry."
Miguel S.,"Jersey City, NJ",16,10,,4.0,12/4/2012,What can I say? Its the cheesecake factory. Awesome service and great cheesecake and of course large portions.. So come hungry or be ready to take left-overs home to enjoy later..
Tim R.,"Springfield, NJ",3,23,,1.0,7/5/2012,"Usually I'm a big Cheesecake Factory fan, like the Willowbrook Mall location 1000 times better! I've tried the Shorts Hills Mall location several times and each time they have been worse. At first i thought because they just opened up and getting used to things, but nope. There service and food have gone totally down hill. The last time i went with my wife and son and both me and my wife got sick! Would NOT recommend!"
Moshe A.,"North Miami Beach, FL",7,6,,1.0,9/8/2013,The worst experience ever I was there yestrday with my wife and friends we got a table in about 10 min service was decent the waitress recommended there special Thai crusted salmon so I decided to try it    What a big mistake when I got home I had a special night of throwing up and stomach pain all night never again will I be eating in Cheesecake Factory
Hunter Y.,"Washington, DC",26,123,211,5.0,3/9/2013,"A bit unconventional, but I go here for the toro tartare. Or what they call ""Ahi Carpaccio."" I know, I know, there's no toro tartare on the menu, but just tell them to take their ahi (tuna) and serve it chopped up (tartare) instead of sliced (carpaccio). They taste great every time. Who would have thought Cheesecake Factory would have decent fish?"
Joseph M.,"Maplewood, NJ",35,44,164,1.0,7/22/2012,"I did not like the Cheesecake Factory and don't understand what attracts so many to wait so long for so much food with so little taste. Maybe it is the ""family friendly"" atmosphere where all the children appear to be having sugar rushes while their adult minders ignore their banging on the tables with their utensils and screaming at each other. Service is inconsistent. The food was fair but you can do a little better for a little less at a local diner."
L K.,"Cranford, NJ",3,135,1,3.0,10/9/2012,It serves the purpose.  Good consistent food.  The portions are large and the prices are good.  I've been twice.  Once for dinner in the summer and once for lunch in the fall.  It's just what I want when I am meeting a girl friend for lunch at the mall.  The drinks and dessert look great but I generally don't have either at lunch.  The bread could use some improvement.
Scott S.,"Union, NJ",3,23,,2.0,6/4/2012,"All Hope Abandon, Ye Who Enter Here... We found ourselves at this Cheesecake Factory on a recent Sunday afternoon, at the suggestion of some friends who desperately wanted to share with us the fatty, poor quality food and poor service for which this restaurant excels. As others have pointed out, this place is always packed and the customer is the one that suffers. We were seated promptly, for which I give the hostess credit, but then it felt like forever before a) we could order b) we got our drinks c) we got our meals. It must have been an hour between the initial hello from our waiter (who, strangely was handling tables on two sides of the restaurant!) to actually being able to eat anything.  And what a disappointment when the food finally did arrive. Look, I know it's chain food and I shouldn't have expected much. I figured I'd play it safe with a salad, and it was a good choice - except the salad was the size of a large mixing bowl. That's not healthy.  One of our friends mistakenly ordered the chicken and biscuits, and it was the single most disgusting plate I've ever seen. Frozen chicken breast swallowed-up by mountains of mashed potatoes and soggy, rubbery biscuits. Ick! Somehow, we accomplished to leave a little room for dessert. Each ordered a different cheesecake, hoping to share a bite or two. Lo and behold, only two arrived. It took a good 10 minutes to flag down our waiter to inform him the food had gone missing. He apologized profusely, and was very apologetic about it, but it took another 10 minutes before another server brought over the missing items. How can that happen? All they needed to do was cut two slices of cake and bring them to our table. It's a 30-second process. And the name of the restaurant would make you think they have the whole ""serving cheesecake"" thing down to a science. Of course, in the interim, the manager came by to offer a half-hearted ""so sorry, we're really busy"" apology and walk away before we could say anything. That was perhaps the most disconcerting part. Rather than make things right, he went through the motions and left before knowing the situation had been remedied. Bad, bad customer service. In all honestly, the cheesecake really wasn't very good. It was obvious it had been made someplace else, put on ice for days, and stored in a very cold refrigerator to prevent spoilage. This wasn't the kind of cheesecake you can get at Junior's or any number of places in the NY area famous for that dessert.  And if you can't get your signature item right, well, you know where this is going... By the time we left, a simple afternoon meal had turned into a two hour ordeal. It may not be hell, but it certainly was not a pleasant experience. There's a very good diner just around the corner. You'd be better served going there instead."
Pasquale R.,"Madison, NJ",1731,1526,245,2.0,12/30/2011,"My guest and I were reluctant to wait 1.5 hrs at 7pm on a Thurs. Come on already. Needless to say we decided to head to the bar for a drink. It was mobbed as well. To be expected. When all of a sudden a light came down from above and rows of people began to part as if Moses was in control. There 5 feet ahead was a couple leaving a table that was first come first serve. Like a linebacker I pounced on the table as is it was a quarterback. Success!!!  So the wait was under 3 mins tech but we got lucky. Ok well you get the idea. So when we finally settled in to several looks of jealous couples, we waited and waited finally someone came to take our order, for drinks. Once that was complete, it was time to review the book of food. Nearly the size of a phone book. So much to choose from. Burgers, pasta, chicken, apps, so much to choose from. When we finally received out drinks, which was a while, we finally put in an app order. Nachos with chicken. The chicken didn't taste fresh. After a couple of tries I picked of the rest of the chips I ate. They were skimpy on the cheese as well. For a meal my guest had the ahi tuna salad which seemed to disappoint. I had the Cuban and I really regretted doing so. It tasted old and non fresh. So as far a meal, even though there is a large selection I have always left CF disappointed until ,that is, dessert. Again you get a separate menu with a laundry list of cheesecakes. Too many to even mention. All tasting better than the other. I opted for the tiramisu ck. I rarely am disappointed with dessert but this ck tasted like freezer burn. Ugh! The entire experience from the service to the quality of food was very frustrating. Although the waiter was nice his absence and prolonged disappearing acts was unacceptable. The food is overpriced. Their cks are their only saving grace and that was a letdown. Would I go back, good question. Be prepared for a long wait all the time."
Samantha M.,"New Haven, CT",285,279,22,3.0,7/31/2012,"I have only been here once where there wasn't a wait. However, I've experienced this at most of their locations. The food is still great though! The cheesecake is awesome."
alaina h.,"New Brunswick, NJ",0,1,,1.0,9/11/2015,"We had an awful experience at this restaurant. My family and I went to celebrate my brother's birthday and it took about 10 minutes of waiting before we got our drink order, which we then were also able to order our entrees since we had so much time to decide. The server apologized and we let that go since it was busy. However, things went downhill after that. Our bread didn't come until after our entrees had already arrived. During that time, I watched another couple sit down across from us and get their drinks AND bread faster. My father ordered a salad with his burger and the dressing did not come with the salad, so we asked the server to bring it out and by the time she got it to us, everyone was practically done with their meals. Everything had to asked for twice from this server. She seemed to be more attentive with other tables and I don't understand why we had to go through so much trouble to get anything from her. In addition to this, when we put in our drink orders, I requested lemon slices with all the waters. The lemon slices also did not come until after we were done with our entrees. It was honestly just not an enjoyable experience and I had never been to a restaurant where I have had to request everything twice (or more) before. I will not be going back to this Cheesecake Factory, as I think the service really needs to be improved on."
J C.,"Butler, NJ",32,29,,4.0,11/16/2012,"I went to this location for the first time today. The food was very good, the services friendly and fast. The service was much quicker than at the Wayne location although the food is the same."
