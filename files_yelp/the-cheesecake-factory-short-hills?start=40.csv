Raquel A.,"Manhattan, NY",1326,166,903,4.0,3/31/2016,The portions are so big here I am always full by the appetizer. Love their vegetarian lettuce wraps. My fav thing on the menu is the avocado egg rolls with cashew cilantro dipping sauce. The falafel salad was good just needed more seasoning or a lemon dressing.  The cobb salad looked great and had a chipotle dressing that was very creamy. This is the place to indulge portions are humungous!
Bree Q.,"North Arlington, NJ",0,10,1,4.0,7/30/2017,"Just had my daughter's birthday lunch here.  It was moderately crowded for a Sunday afternoon and our wait for a table was fifteen minutes.  The atmosphere is lively and very loud.  The restaurant is clean and the food a bit pricey.  Our server got us our drinks super quick and bread came out shortly thereafter.   The food took a while to come out but we were all happy with our entrees.  The burgers were pretty good, the fried shrimp nice portion size and the gumbo also good.  The cheesecake was half price today - score!  The cheesecake was beautifully plated and tasted super fresh. Our server Quasheem was TOP NOTCH!  Attentive and very pleasant personality.  The staff sang happy birthday to my daughter and let's just say it was very enthusiastic!   We will be back!"
Tamago L.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,8,21,1.0,7/29/2017,"Will not come back. Waited for an hour for our food after numerous complaints. Pasta finally came but all dried and cold. Spoke to manager, he said they were ready 25 minutes ago but don't know why waitress didn't bring them out."
Bob S.,"Sayreville, NJ",7,25,1,3.0,7/16/2017,Wife and I had fish tacos for our meals and a Buffalo chicken blast app. Food and service was good an enjoyed eating on the patio. Took a slice of plain cheesecake home and wasn't impressed.
Samantha B.,"Santa Monica, CA",31,35,9,2.0,10/18/2016,"Let me preface this with the fact that I am a HUGE Cheesecake Factory fan, which is why our dining experience at this location today made me so sad. Overall, it felt like none of the people working there had any desire to be there which was reflected in the attitude towards customers and the overall vibe of the place.  When we arrived we were seated fairly quickly, but it took over 10 minutes for us to get a high chair brought over to our table. Placing our order took at least 15-20 minutes after sitting down (we had to flag someone down multiple times), and the waitress then proceeded to come back and ask a ton of questions that we had already answered about our order. She also forgot our side.  Food was good and fairly priced, but honestly the total lack of customer service made this such a distasteful experience that we are going to start trying some of the other eatery options at the Short Hills Mall."
Allan W.,"Succasunna, Roxbury Township, NJ",0,8,2,3.0,6/30/2017,"Very good food but extremely slow service. Waiter is very nice, seems that she has too many tables. It took way to long to get our food and desert"
Franco C.,"Scranton, PA",0,2,2,1.0,11/5/2016,"This place doesn't deserve ANY stars... what an aweful service. And the Mgr keeps a blind eye to the problems. I will make sure that none of my friends, business associates and clients will NEVER go there. Too much incompetence. it really Sucks. I was going to write what happened..but where do I start...  the service has been constantly bad... orders wrong or never placed.. wrong drinks.. even alcohol in a minors smoothy...  SUCKS BIG TIME"
Erskin B.,"Hillside, NJ",0,3,,4.0,1/10/2017,Vanessa is great! Great customer service!!! Every time I go in everyone is nice and welcoming and I get taken care of right away. Really representing their brand.
Katy S.,"Hopatcong, NJ",40,48,1,1.0,2/10/2017,"Absolutely terrible restaurant ! The service is slow, the staff is rude. The food is subpar at best. Steak is flavorless the cheese steak came out so tiny on a hard hoagie roll the size of a Taco Bell taco. Our drinks were never refilled one of our kids burgers came out 8 minutes after the rest of the tables food. The waitress never said thank you or please to anything and seemed bothered anytime we asked for anything. The hostess are too busy dancing and texting to acknowledge you. They buzz you 10 mins before your table is ready and leave you standing in everyone's way. It was our daughters birthday dinner and they brought everyone dessert but hers and waited over 5 minutes to come out singing with hers. I would never come back here."
Sharon P.,"Wilmington, DE",0,26,,2.0,11/26/2016,"Just bought $900 worth of gift cards to score the 2 free slices For every $25 spent and now my tale of woe.  We bought these cards at the Christiana Mall in Delaware and we travel to NJ to visit family after Thanksgiving and usually about once a month. I have to say that the Short Hills location PALES next to the Christiana Mall In Delaware in both food and especially in service. We eat out too much and we have tried a ton of menu items and know what is good. The service in Short Hills is not very good, servers do not seem well trained and it is a bit chaotic for no reason. Every time I ask them not to over cook the Miso Salmon. It comes out rock hard and I choke it down so I don't have to wait for another one. This is not a hard thing to do, Christiana Mall usually gets it right. Why have fresh salmon that comes out dry like canned tuna? It is just a few minutes less cook time, or an experienced line cook. The best Cheesecake Factory is in San Fran across from the St Francis hotel. The staff and the kitchen is top notch and cooks fish perfectly, so it CAN be done. Short Hills could do so much better with better training and staff!"
Nathaniel C.,"Elizabeth, NJ",3,14,,5.0,5/12/2017,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Although crowded all the time! The staff is amazing!!! The bar staff there rivals mixologist in NYC! Colin, Nadeem and Stacy are absolutely wonderful! I will not go there if I don't see at least one of them there! They take care of you like family which is what a restaurant experience should feel like. GREAT PLACE!"
Kara G.,"New Providence, NJ",0,3,,1.0,7/7/2017,My mom and I came for an early dinner and were ignored by the waitstaff for 15 minutes. Other parties that came in after us were being served bread already. No choice but to leave. Now seated at a nice booth at joes American bar and grill enjoying warm bread and wine. Looks like things worked out for the best!
Bevin M.,"Cranford, NJ",71,30,3,1.0,7/2/2016,"What started out as a nice family outing with my boyfriends family went bad really quickly!! We met the family at the restaurant from shopping in the mall. When we sat the rest of them had already gotten drinks. It's started with our waiter not asking for our drink options. I asked for a glass of wine. Then he left for about ten minutes and came back with water. I asked about my wine. 5 minutes later he came back but no wine. We said can we order ""please let us"". We all ordered and he finally brought my wine after.  Two people had to leave so it was 4 remaining. Another 30 minutes came and our entrees still had not come out. But we ate more and more bread. Finally, the food started to come. 2 plates, 4 minutes later another plate, finally 5 minutes later the last plates came and we asked one to be wrapped for the person who had to leave. It was time to eat. Well I got garlic pasta with shrimp. this was supposed to have asparagus, but no asparagus. So then I asked for asparagus from another waiter.  Then our actual waiter actually came back. I felt the pasta and it was cold, not a little warm , fully cold, so he took the pasta back. Then the missing asparagus came. I thought ok I can eat that. It was cold, refrigerator cold, and I was like I'm done. I grabbed the waiter and said to just cancel. It was enough incompetence for a night. When I asked the waiter to feel the asparagus he was embarrassed. He then walked away after I told him to cancel. He came back 10 minutes later and asked if the manager had come yet. She did not. Her name is Susan Luca. She did not come. Then the waiter asked if we wanted anything. I said yes, just get me wine. 10 minutes later it came.  Now if you are already mad, that sucks. The waiter came back again, We said we want menus to see about possible deserts, he left to get them. 10 minutes passed, and in that time I got a menu from the waiter station in front of our table. Then more time passed so we asked another waitress to get the manager.  She said ok and came right back and said Susan was with another table. So we asked her to get our check. Once we got it, guess what was still on it? My cold food I sent back and the glass of wine I wanted in its place. Now maybe not the wine, but as pissed as we were, take off the item we sent back. Nothing was offered to make up for it. So we waited longer.  The waiter came back ten minutes later with menus. We said we were done and why did it take him so long to get menus. We said forget desert we need the manager to take off the meal. He said under his breath, ""she didn't remove it yet"". I actually felt bad for this kid.  It was possibly the worst service & management I have seen. We asked asked for the manager Susan who never came before to come.  Then finally after everyone was boiling and no manager and no real check, we did the math and took the dish off ourselves and left cash. As we were walking out, the manager Susan finally graced us with her incompetent presence. She's the worst! Came over slowly, no hustle. At this point there was nothing to say. We already took the food off, we all wanted to leave and I was starving. I told her to take the check and we already took the dish off ourselves. That this place sucks and we will never return. She then turned to the waiter and said ""some people don't know how to talk to others"". Well you are right lady! After waiting over 40 minutes for you to come over and not eating, I don't want to talk to you. After meeting this woman, I don't blame the kitchen or the waiter I blame her. She runs the restaurant while managing and clearly doesn't know what she is doing. I have managed, waited and bartended at many places and I have never seen a more incompetent lazy manager in my life. We will never be back to this establishment and we will tell everyone we know!"
Victoria B.,"Mountainside, NJ",760,95,415,5.0,12/1/2015,"Perfect spot to grab a quick after shopping drink. I love to sit at the bar and order a blue cheese olive dirty martini. Went here last night after a long day of shopping and it really hit the spot. They have a ""skinny menu"" that makes it so easy to order healthy and guilt free. The service is always good here. And I love the warm bread they give you before your food comes out! I split the four cheese Pasta with shrimp with my friend and it was more than enough for 2. The best part was the giant pile of ricotta cheese on the middle! They also come around with fresh parmigiana cheese In case the 4 cheeses isn't enough! I will definitely be back after my next shopping trip"
William A.,"Hampton, GA",0,1,1,3.0,4/28/2017,"Management allows cold food to be served to tables . The compensation  to customer is an apology and the serving a replacement dish at the proper temperature. "" cold mash potatoes """
Veronica S.,"Union, NJ",17,67,26,1.0,2/16/2017,"After promising myself i would never return, I got inspired to come back but this time for takeout. My friend and i waited 45 minutes before mutually agreeing to leave. The waiter was extremely rude once he learned we were taking everything to go. Worst than any other time i have been there."
Amanda R.,"Manhattan, NY",184,241,74,4.0,1/3/2016,"I come here often and I like it everytime. FOOD & DRINKS I love their bread first and foremost. Its pumpernickel and delicious. I can get full just off of the bread but my favorite dish is the four cheese pasta I get this every time and never get tired of it. Every dish is pretty good from here so you cannot really go wrong and they guaranteed have something you're in the mood for because their menu is very long.  My favorite drinks are the strawberry-banana daiquiri and the georgia peach. They are so good! The georgia peach is my go to because it is s hard to find from other places.  SERVICE It varies on the waiter, but service is relatively good here. They can get pretty crowded so sometimes the wait is long as hell and there are too many tables to pay attention to- they're pretty good though.  I like to come here, definitely worth it! They aren't too expensive either and that is always a plus."
Sierra-katherine B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,19,5,3.0,3/17/2017,"They have good food, but are over priced in my opinion. Went in for dinner for two, and we each had a cocktail and the bill was over 100$. Service left much to be desired as well. Our waiter took almost 20 minutes when we asked for the check and even longer to come check and see if we needed refills."
Leslie B.,"Warren, NJ",0,26,18,2.0,8/24/2017,"Ok- do not like writing this review. This has been my go- to restaurant to meet friends for lunch since it opened. After today, crossed off our list. My friend ordered a cheeseburger with sautéed onions and mushrooms. It was not cooked the way she ordered it and, instead of sautéing the mushrooms and onions the chef grilled them- thereby burning them. We asked for the Manager, who never came. My Chinese chicken salad was your basic bag of salad ( too much lettuce) not enough chicken- it was hard to find; and I can't believe there was a whole chicken breast there. My friend had to ask 3 people for catsup and it took so long to come she had pretty much finished . Last note- our bill came , we paid and we did not receive the 48 cents change we were due. My friend said it's CF policy to round up or down. If this is true- it's awful! Last note- I used to come here so often many of the servers recognized me and we would exchange hellos. Completely new staff-not very customer friendly- maybe some training would be a good mgmt idea."
Hollei J.,"Pennsauken Township, NJ",618,330,152,4.0,11/14/2015,"I believe my servers name was Josh. He was very attentive, the food was the same at every other cheesecake factory I've been to... GOOD. I had a signature extra dirty martini, and it was made to perfection. I would definitely return to this location for food and drinks without hesitation. I likes the parking arrangements as well. Very close, and with the weather being somewhat chilly, it was a plus for me. we were seated right away on a Monday night."
