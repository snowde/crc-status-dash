Brittany Z.,"New York, NY",0,2,,2.0,4/17/2017,"I love cheesecake factory and  come to this location two to three times a month. The past few times I've come to this location I have not had the best experience. My last three visits consisted of having a piece of hair in my veggie burger, not having enough veggie burgers so I was served a ""mini"" veggie burger and charged for a skinny one in which the size did not compare, and then being told there were no more veggie burgers. Besides complaining about a veggie burger shortage, the cheesecake factory took off the veggie melt from their menu making my options slim to none. Another overall complaint, it's nearly impossible to get water refills. I prefer sitting near the bar because I can get up myself and get water when I need it instead of waiting until the next time my server drops something at the table.  My last visit started off bad as the host never set off my buzzer, so my 20 minute wait time turned into an hour, followed by staff not wanting to seat me in an area where I could elevate my broken leg when the restaurant was empty because it was 9PM on a weekday night. On top of being out of veggie burgers and not having a veggie melt on the menu, I settled for eggplant parm. I would never recommend this dish to an eggplant parm lover because you would be disappointed. There was absolutely no flavor!  It took a total of 15 minutes from the end of my meal to the dessert menu then an additional 10 from ordering dessert to getting my piece of cheesecake. Overall the service was horrible."
Helen K.,"Morristown, NJ",122,64,14,1.0,11/2/2015,Over the past week I've ordered a few times over the phone for pick up and the staff make it impossible to place an order. As soon as you call they put you on hold indefinitely! It take 3-4 calls to get someone to take your order and you have to  request a manager before your taken care of...the frustrating part is they are not busy! It's a Monday night and the mall is slow but cheese cake factory obviously doesn't care about their customer. I shouldn't have to ask for a manager every time I want to place a pick up!  Negatives stars if I could rate it
Jasmine W.,"New York, NY",583,155,555,5.0,12/13/2014,"I got the Pasta Da Vinci, which is hands down my favorite dish. I recommended it to my friends and 4 of them ended up getting it as well. The pasta is penne with a wine sauce, chicken, and mushroom. It's $16.95 and I always have enough to take home. Portions are huge! Definitely worth trying. We came here for my friends' birthdays and I told the waiter that it was their birthdays and he awkwardly said ""ok"" and didn't say anything else. So I thought he weren't going to do anything for my friends. After our meal, he didn't offer to get the check after he asked if we wanted cheesecake, which we didn't, and he and another waiter came out with small birthday sundaes in shot glasses for my two friends. Nice surprise for their birthdays. :) Yeah it's noisy, but I'm fine with that. It's a classy atmosphere in a nice mall with portions relative to the price (aka higher than normal).  I didn't get cheesecake this time but their cheesecakes are fabulous. Definitely recommend the tiramisu, pumpkin, and red velvet."
Robert S.,"Livingston, NJ",15,357,,4.0,1/6/2016,"It's the Cheesecake Factory.  Let me start off at the end.  The desserts are fantastic.  We all think the slice of cheesecake is smaller than we used to get.  But, the taste is great.  Linda's cake is also great. The food.  The food is good.  it is not bad and certainly isn't the best.  I try to stick with chicken marsala, jambalaya and a few other basics.  The bread is always hot and fresh.  The unlimited refills of great lemonades.  The price point is perfect. Now for the rocky part.  The service is hit or miss.  The wait is unbearable.   Excellent to go with the kids.  Do not think about going here with a large group.  They really do not have a fair amount of large tables."
Leslie B.,"Morristown, NJ",0,4,9,2.0,3/15/2017,"I come here often- usually enjoyable lunch. Today my friend and I ordered burgers and fries . We were specific about how we each like our burgers cooked. When our meals were brought to the table , both of our burgers were way over cooked and both of our fries were cold. A gentleman came to our table, I assume was the Manager. We nicely said how our food was not cooked as we ordered it. He took our fries, no apology ( how hard is it to cook a burger?); and returned with hot fries when we were halfway done eating. We understand it wasn't our servers fault and left a nice tip- but a gesture of apology would have been appreciated - maybe coffee on the house. This was my second time having lunch here this week and my meal Monday was very good. Today's chef was a disappointment ."
Asher H.,"Jersey City, NJ",4,76,,3.0,3/1/2016,"My first time at any Cheesecake Factory location and overall, a bit of a discordant experience. The food options and quality were a shade above your normal full-service chains, the prices right in line with other competitive offerings, and the decor/lighting very relaxed and inviting. My complaint however, resides solely in the customer service experience, which judging from previous reviews, is an all too common occurrence. After we were seated, our party was forced to wait an obscenely long time to place our orders and the service after our food arrived was similarly lackadaisical.  I understand that we dined during peak hours, and while not blaming the waitress who served our table, the blame must be accepted by the managers on location. The experience has not put me off entirely, but changes should be made to necessitate future visits."
Ann F.,"New Providence, NJ",1,10,,1.0,7/17/2017,Trying to order to go and no one will pick up the phone.  Pretty unprofessional.
Joan W.,"Wayne, NJ",0,5,2,1.0,9/18/2016,"I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory locations a few times and have generally enjoyed the experience. Today was an exception. After my 2 daughters and I waited about 30 minutes for a table, we ordered 2 appetizers and lunch entrees. After 30 minutes our appetizers  had not arrived. One finally arrived followed 15 minutes later by the second. 2 minutes later our entrees arrived and one was wrong. When I asked if I had someone else's meal or a mistake had been made in my order, the waiter checked his notes and said I had ordered what he delivered...which I know was incorrect. I ate what he brought because we had already been in the restaurant for an hour and a half. There are many other places to eat in this mall and doubt I will never eat in this Cheesecake Factory again."
Rick O.,"Berkeley Heights, NJ",0,20,,4.0,6/24/2017,I had not been to Cheesecake Factory in a long time mostly because it is not close.  In my recent visit I was pleasantly surprised.  While the food may not be gourmet it was fresh and very tasty.   We will go again. The fresh made guacomole was outstanding.  I also recommend the tex mex rolls.  Obviously ending with excellent cheesecake. Good food and large servings are a good combination.
Rachel A.,"Alexandria, VA",1,29,12,2.0,5/13/2016,"I should start by saying I usually love the Cheesecake Factory. My best friend came all the way from Virginia to New Jersey for my birthday and we chose to go to the Cheesecake Factory. We got there and they said it was a 20 min wait for 2 people. At least 20 minutes go by and we go to check how much longer only to find out that the wait is going to be at least another 20 min. When we eventually sit down we order our food right away. When we got our appetizers we asked for a dipping sauce it did not get it until we were completely down with the appetizers. Then I am told that they are all out of the Mac and cheese burger that I had been looking forward to all week. When I got my plain burger that I ordered medium, it was bleeding and raw. By the time my burger came back out it was soggy and watery. This was a devastating experience."
David C.,"Hoboken, NJ",255,266,250,4.0,6/20/2014,"This is a staple for all NJ eaters. If you want to get great value and also have one of the biggest menus to choose from, Cheesecake Factory is for you! Although the name can throw you off, their food is more than just dessert. Pasta and salad dishes are quite good as well as some asian fusion dishes. They really can do it all. It's not the most sophisticated food in the world but the flavor and portions are on point! We always order the spicy ahi tuna tempura app and are never disappointed. Kobe beef sliders were good as well. My father in law always gets the Chicken Fettucini, quite tasty. The ladies love the Cobb salad, tons of bacon and chicken! Come here to gorge but if it's busy be prepared to wait...."
Lina K.,"Edgewater, NJ",400,540,57,2.0,12/3/2014,"I used to enjoy going to the Cheesecake Factory and would often wait the ridiculously long times to get a table after shopping.  However, the food and service quality levels have plummeted over recent years.  It's like the staff knows that there are limited restaurant choices and they just don't give a damn. I got the lunch portion of the pasta carbonara and my companion got the salmon lunch special.   We asked repeatedly for knives through the meal ... finally got one at the end, yay!  I had to ask 3x for parmesan cheese and when I attempted to flag down a server .... any server, I got major eye avoidance.  Apparently, teamwork is not a principle here ... every waiter is out for himself. Food was mediocre and quite frankly, not worth the aggravation.  Carbonara sauce was too watery for my taste.   The only time I got any sort of decent service is when I asked for the check.  Surprise and totally cliche.  Wish my experience had been better."
Porshea M.,"Linden, NJ",0,1,,1.0,9/16/2017,Was here two weeks ago and got seated right away. Waitress came right away and my daughter and I ordered an appetizer and 2 grilled chicken salads. It went downhill from there. Appetizer took so long and just as I was wondering what happened to it the waitress showed up only to tell me they was out of the appetizer and asked did we just want to wait for our salads rather than order another appetizer. At that point we were so hungry we ordered another appetizer and thought we'd take it home as leftovers when the salads came. It took another 10-15 minutes for the new appetizer to come and over 20 more minutes before the salad came out. I asked to speak to the manager who came out with the salads following close behind him by the waitress. When I told him we had been there for quite a long time without food his response was 21 minutes... that's how long it took to prepare your salads because we were waiting for the grill to cook your chicken. At that point I paid for the appetizer and drinks and cancelled the salads. This place deserves 0 stars. Who goes to a restaurant only to go home hungry?? Shame on them!!!!
Alex V.,"Jersey City, NJ",279,267,453,4.0,11/10/2013,"Came here for a late lunch and got seated right away. Ordered  the meat loaf and fish and chips. Finished off with a strawberry cheesecake for dessert. Can't go wrong with the cheesecakes here! The meat loaf was pretty tasty, but I can make a much better one. I really liked the mushroom gravy that they topped the mashed potatoes with. The fish was damn good and crispy.  Also had the chicken sandwich recently, which was really crispy, delicious, and filling. At $12, it's a relatively good deal, and will probably be my go to lunch item whenever I come here from now on.  The waitress forgot to bring out my beer, and some of the silverware and napkins were a bit grimy. Had to knock this place down a star."
Klim K.,"Fort Lee, NJ",717,241,2087,3.0,10/3/2015,"Good food but way too long of a wait. Came in and waited over an hour for a table for 4. Probably on the smaller side compared to other cheesecake factories but still a large restaurant. By the way, I've never seen so many strollers by the exit. Is that a fire-hazard?"
Wei V.,"Jersey City, NJ",194,488,2568,4.0,11/10/2013,"Love the food and cheesecake selections. Yes, the menu is a book thick. ::Ambiance:: A normal Cheesecake Factory setup and there was no wait at all. ::Food:: Surprisingly they have pretty good fish and chips, minus the fries. Fish was very crispy. I just love the Fresh Strawberry cheesecake. ::Service:: The staff can put on a bit more of smile on their faces. Bases our waitress forgot to bring the beer, everything else was pretty good. ::Fun Fact:: They have a fire place in the back, which is very hard to find. Would have the cheesecake again. I really want to try all of their cheesecakes one day."
Bella F.,"Florham Park, NJ",30,17,,2.0,4/18/2016,"I've been here a few times. Everytime I come here for dinner, there's ALWAYS a wait for a table. The entrees come in a large serving dish.  For dessert, I recommend the s'mores pie...it's really delish :-)"
Abelle N.,"New York, NY",557,1097,516,3.0,10/1/2015,Do you know why I ADORE the Cheesecake Factory? Because they have the biggest portions Iv ever seen in a chain restaurant and it is honestly life changing....(*_*) My absolute favorite is there cheesecake cake of course... The strawberry cheesecake is very good....plane cheesecake topped with fresh strawberries! Sweetest strawberries ever!  My suggestion is for you to order one piece to share there... then get another flavor to take home..... The cheesecake will last for several days in the fridge....and (if you can control yourself!) you take just a few bites every night.....Just right!  As for food....the chicken madeira is pretty good... as well as the avocado spring rolls! Delish!  The menu is HUGE.... so I would suggest going to their website in advance and taking a look....It takes forever to decide on what to eat!  I would of gave this place four stars but due to the fact this location is smaller then the other cheesecake factor Iv been to by Menlo Park Drive...it felt somewhat cramped here....The seating are defiantly tighter! the wait to be seated is regardless...especially on the weekends... Oh.... one more thing! The table bread (the darker one) that they bring you is soft...only the brown ones though!! just Don't eat too much bread! enjoy and have a lovely meal! ;D!
Alex G.,"Broward, FL",39,950,374,2.0,7/11/2016,"I knew it would eventually happen, but this chain is no longer the gold standard for mall restaurants.  The service is fair, the food is fair, and the menu even more complicated.  The server forgot spoons, didn't refill sodas, etc.  A bit too casual - as if training has been overlooked.  As for the food, the quality just wasn't there.  Corn dogs tasted long frozen, lettuce wraps were pre-made (as opposed to letting you make it yourself as before), etc.  Desert was still very good, but you'd expect that.  Overall, this chain and location have lost a bunch of steps, and I doubt they'll reclaim them anytime soon."
Millie H.,"Hoboken, NJ",203,232,8,3.0,7/13/2016,"My first experience at Cheesecake Factory! The expectation might have been high, but the food is really just okay. The place is packed so i guess it's good for the business. We were really happy though they kept our credit card after us forgetting about it."
