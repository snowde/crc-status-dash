John G.,"Boca Raton, FL",67,194,22,1.0,10/14/2015,"Service was AWFUL!  We waited over 20 minutes to even be acknowledged by our server.  Finally, a lovely young lady, Chianti, noticed us sitting there and took our drink order.  We asked if she could be our server but the manager refused.  You can get better service at a Burger King drive through!  Our daughter fell on oil on her way to the ladies room.  We flew up from Florida to surprise our grandchildren for our grandson's birthday and it turned out to be a disaster.  We wrote corporate three times and they didn't even have the decency to respond.  Even though we WERE regulars we will NEVER return to this awful location again.  As a result of corporates unprofessionalism, we won't be going to any location.  Our only advice is run don't walk away from this restaurant!"
Alexander L.,"West Orange, NJ",0,5,,5.0,11/22/2015,"At the time of this review, this restaurant has an average of 3 stars from 121 reviewers. In my opinion, that is way too low. I was shocked that it isn't averaging 4.5-5 stars. It's got everything. Great atmosphere and lighting. Great food. Huge menu with lots of options. Portion sizes are huge - enough for two meals in some cases if you don't mind leftovers. Fast service. Decent prices. I literally can't think of anything to complain about.  We had the made-to-order guacamole. Which was a surprisingly large portion for just $11. Fish and chips, Shepard's pie and my favorite, Cobb salad. They were all excellent. Every Cheesecake Factory I have been to has been the same positive experience. These guys know what they're doing."
Art E.,"West Orange, NJ",0,16,,3.0,3/29/2017,"The food is delicious at The Cheesecake Factory in Short Hills Mall. The major con is that the service is very, very slow, and inattentive. The restaurant is extremely busy and noisy. There are other wonderful restaurants that have the key combination of delicious food and fantastic service."
Erick R.,"Summit, NJ",117,4,,4.0,11/3/2015,"This was a first time experience for myself, having never been to the cheesecake factory, have to say it was satisfying. Not fantastic, not bad at all. A busy friday night, service was normal. Our waitress attended to my needs as well as my gf's and was very polite with us, cant really say anything bad about service other than being sat very close in between two couples which was kinda annoying Food came out and for the most part was on point. Ordered the fettechini alfredo, fries, and strawberry cheesecake. You'll find the pasta is better at olive garden to be honest, the pasta was just soggy, maybe not cooked completely, but it wasnt as good as other restaurants. However as for the other two, the food was really good and filling."
Aileen R.,"Staten Island, NY",0,8,1,2.0,2/4/2017,"I've been a very big fan of the cheesecake factory for nearly a decade, if not more. I usually go to the one in Menlo Park mall, but I was in the Short Hills mall area, and was in the mood for cheesecake factory!  Server was exceptionally great for a Saturday night being seated at 7:40pm. Granted, I'm still sitting, waiting for the check, but I haven't had to wait too long for anything (my bf and I took awhile to figure out what we wanted). Buffalo blasts came out incredibly salty. Not only was the chicken and cheese filling seasoned (not complaining! It was great!) but the flour was heavily salted; adding the Buffalo sauce and blue cheese became very hard to do with all the existing salt.  Then we get our main courses: shrimp and sausage pasta, and the Cajun jambalaya pasta with shrimp. The shrimp and sausage pasta dishes was out of this world good! Pasta was a tad bit too al dente for the bf, but it was spot on for me. The Cajun jambalaya, on the other hand, was severely overcooked, had NO sauce/taste, and absolutely not to my recollection, not even close. But I was so hungry, I ate a bunch of it, while waiting for the waiter to pass by. He ended up coming back with extra sauce from the manager of the kitchen and it was everything the dish was missing. My poor waiter, Joseph, was so apologetic when it wasn't even his fault I felt bad.... I would give this review 5 stars just for Joseph, if I could, but unfortunately the food was sorely substandard. Consistency across meals and dishes in regards to salt and degree of spice is so lacking here."
Stephen T.,"Bernardsville, NJ",89,185,152,5.0,5/26/2016,We had the Ahi Tuna Salad. Very good and very tasty. Our server Joey was awesome.
Anna K.,"Newark, NJ",23,23,22,3.0,12/8/2015,"This was my first time in any Cheesecake factory, and I'm not planning on returning. Like everyone else says, the service is slow and it sucks. Walked in from cold outside, and first thing asked for coffee, it took no less than 15 minutes until I got it. Half way through waiting the waitress came to the table, saying she had to make fresh coffee. The place was mostly empty, a lot of staff was just standing around - nevertheless, inattentive, showing up sporadically. Asking if we want to see dessert menu in a tone like expecting that we'll say no. Usually, tipping 17-20% I'd have loved to leave 10% just to be polite, definitely felt like 15% was too much.  1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 cheesecake came to $64. For mediocre food & experience, it was not worth it. Left half a cheesecake on the plate - sounded good - nothing special. From 1 to 10, food was 7-8 - meaning it was just food, not ""good food"" or ""great food"". Mashed potatoes were good considering it is almost impossible to find them good tasting anywhere. Shrimp tasted like soap. Avocado spring rolls while good, I was saying at the table, I wouldn't order them again. Not going back."
Rae C.,"East Orange, NJ",141,123,53,3.0,8/15/2015,"Let me just say that I'm often coined a ""Ball-Buster"" by my wife because of my ""no-bull****"" approach to customer service and satisfaction guaranteed policy. As a consumer, I do not tolerate mediocre service and disrespect from ANY establishment and whenever I'm displeased, there should be some type of resolve that benefits both parties involved. My wife and I dined here last evening. Our food was amazingly good however, I was displeased with the drinks ordered. First, I ordered a Mojito. It was completely watered down with no hint of alcohol whatsoever. So when our waiter came, I asked him to take it back and I'll have a Cosmopolitan instead. Well, the Cosmo arrived and tasted just as crappy as the last disappointment. So, again, I told him that this wasn't acceptable and could he just bring red wine instead.  This dude decides to bring the manager on call instead. She politely came over to tell me that they're not taking the second drink off the tab. I replied: ""Well...I'm dissatisfied with your drink service. I ordered red wine as the absolute last resort and I doubt I'll send it back - as it is wine. I mean, you can't really screw up wine."" Annoyed, she takes my drink from the table and never says another word.  Ok. Fine. No drinks.  We're ready for the check now. It arrives with the Cosmo on it. I gave the check back and had it removed (it took a while to come back to the table. I guess she was pissed and had to contemplate it for a while). Whatever. The bill came back correct. We paid and left. If you ever visit the cheesecake factory, get plain alcohol with NO ice or just play it safe with wine. You can't go wrong with it."
Lisa P.,"Livingston, NJ",1,10,,5.0,2/20/2017,"This is one of my favorite restaurants of all time. Yes, the hour-long waits are ridiculous sometimes (the trick is to get in right as they open) but the food and service makes up for any inconvenience waiting might cost you. I always come here to celebrate special events because the menu is so large that there really is something for everyone. I haven't had a single dish that I dislike. I especially like the roll sampler for appetizer and the chicken bellagio. Their herb crusted salmon filet is also very tender (can you describe fish as tender?) and flavorful. You can't go wrong with the burgers. Calamari is perfect. I can get over my lactose intolerance for their cheesecakes. Be aware that the portion sizes are astronomical, so don't hesitate to get the smaller size if given the option."
James O.,"New York, NY",2,14,1,5.0,8/20/2016,"This is my 1st time coming to The Cheesecake Factory and it was a great experience. The hostesses we warm and friendly. They greeted us immediately. No awkward ""stand there in silence"" moment. The wait was short for a Saturday night. We were seated before our quoted time (15 minutes). Our server Jarid was fast friendly and attentive. Our food and drinks came quickly and delicious. Will definitely be back!"
Dina C.,"Essex County, NJ",39,179,107,5.0,5/31/2014,"Have recently discovered CF. Very pleasant staff, food choices are wide, my Cosmo was outstanding. I think the uniforms are not in keeping with the quality of the place, but who am to have an opinion? Have only had great experiences here."
Daynel O.,"Union, NJ",2,1,,1.0,7/28/2015,"Been to this location over 2 or 3 dozen times in the past 7 or 8 years. Had a horrible experience on a Monday night.  Not too busy but once seated it was downhill from there.  Our waitress made us feel very rushed, inattentive and basically avoided eye contact every time she spoke with us. 10 minutes after my wife's meal arrived we were still waiting for a knife. Totally ignored by the waitress who I guess forgot we asked for it.  While eating my order of Imperial Chicken and Shrimp I was totally grossed out.   I found a hair in the sauce. As gross as it sounds, I think i ate part of the hair as I had been slicing my food in the same area I found the hair within the sauce. We notified the waitress who said I'm sorry about that.  She took the plate away.  A few minutes later came back by the table and asked if I wanted another plate made.  Promptly the assistant manager stopped by the table.  She advised me she checked the kitchen and ensured that all employees were wearing the appropriate head coverings.  That response did nothing but make me feel as though I was responsible for the hair in the plate.   FYI: I am bald lol - so yea ok. After this, the waitress continued to be dismissive and uninterested in treating us like we were her customers. She never asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu (Isn't this the Cheesecake Factory?). Dropped off the check and blurted out, ""We took both orders off of the bill"". In a snarky tone once again displaying dismissive body language, not making eye contact and walking away briskly before I could say anything. I Still left a nice tip, because I like to give the benefit of the doubt.  Maybe she was having a bad day. Don't know if I can go back to this location any time soon. I was sick to my stomach the rest of the night."
Joan R.,"West Orange, NJ",0,8,1,1.0,8/6/2016,"Sadly, after having to attend a birthday dinner here, I definitely won't be coming back. The service really got all of us thinking that clearly they don't care much about customer service. 25 minutes after we ordered our food, our waitress comes to tell me that they are out of the steak tacos which I had ordered. I chose the Kobe style burger, which was a huge mistake. I ordered it medium rare and got a hard, chewy and gray colored burger.  at this point, I couldn't tell if it was really Kobe beef.. It took the waitress another 20 mins before we got the food. Then another 15 minutes to bring us ketchup. To top it all off, no one offered to fill our waters and sodas throughout dinner."
Todd T.,"Randolph, NJ",0,10,1,5.0,7/5/2016,"I'm not big on eating at chain restaurants, but, I love the Cheesecake Factory.  Kids roadhouse sliders are my kids favorite burgers (I'm always stealing bites...they are really good) appetizers are always good..especially Calamari  (another favorite of my kids, Asian lettuce tacos, corn tamale cakes, avocado egg rolls...all great...my wife ( also a food snob who doesn't like chains) always gets the tuna tataki salad, which she loves...I love the fish tacos, hut, I've really never had anything bad here."
Jen D.,"Summit, NJ",30,19,,1.0,7/25/2016,"What has the Cheesecake factory done to my beloved veggie burger? They are now using WHITE PASTA as a filler in the burger. The taste is somewhat similar, but the consistency is different. The problem with using the pasta is that they didn't list it as an ingredient on the menu! The manager tried to tell me that pasta is indeed an ingredient and when I showed him the menu, he admitted they were rolling out a new menu in a week and trying something new. I am so disappointed that a company's bottom line is more important than customer satisfaction! As another diner commented, this location is  ""The McDonald's of Short Hills."""
Pamela N.,"Jersey City, NJ",74,21,7,1.0,12/10/2016,"I went to Short Hills Mall to go to an Apple Store but the wait for my appointment was 1.5 hours long.  My husband and I decided that we can go to Cheesecake Factory and eat in. It was this past Monday night, Dec 5th and the place barely had any people and we got seated immediately.  My 3 year old had chicken fingers and mashed potato (chicken was a bit over cooked and chewy); Hubby had grilled salmon with mashed potato and broccoli crown (salmon a bit undercooked, no seasoning; broccoli well cooked and fresh); I had Steak Hibachi with mashed potatoes and mushroom. (That one was good and flavorful but the server did not bring the vegetable tempura that was supposed to come with it.) When I asked for it, she didn't even know if it came with it and later on said that she will ask the cook to make it. No surprise, we were already done eating and she came with a small sausedish with greasy fried beans??? That didn't at all resemble like a tempura.  We asked for two different kinds of tea, when my husband and I tasted each other's tea, they were the same. I asked if it's the green tea iced tea for me, she said ""Yes.""  We also ordered a dish which is grilled chicken and vegetables ""ToGo"" THE SAME TIME we placed our seat in order...IT WAS NOT ready for SUCH A LONG TIME. The buswoman had cleared our table and I went to the ladies room, my three year old was already miserable, NO ONE CAME. The server told us our take out order was ready before we paid, but the stores were already closing. Apple texted me so many times for my appointment but I couldn't make it because OUR FOOD took so long. The mall closed. I kept asking for a manager but no manager showed.  A receptionist came and told me that the server is standing by the kitchen waiting for my food (2 hours?). I paid. I paid my tip because I didn't want bad karma on me.... but by far, THE WORST CHEESECAKE FACTORY I've ever been."
Nikki G.,"Union, NJ",0,2,,2.0,1/13/2017,"Service was terrible. Went there on a Monday afternoon 230 and didn't leave until 4pm!!!! Everything took forever!!!! No apologies, no check in to see how we were doing. Also the restaurant itself was very hot it had to be at least 80 degrees in there.  I sadly will not go back to this one. I'll drive further to Menlo Park"
Stephanie Y.,"Berkeley, CA",4978,1554,2687,3.0,2/26/2014,"Oh my lordie, I'm reppin' chains hard lately. I went here yesterday with the future M.I.L before a bit of a shopping trip at Short Hills Mall. I haven't been to a Cheesecake in like a decade, so it's been a while. This one at Short Hills is BUSY! All the stay at home moms lunching with each other with some serious strollers clogging the passage ways.  This Cheesecake is no different than the million others. Yet this one lacked any sort of personal charm through great service. The hostess was kind of rude, we weren't offered any bread, which is fine, the waitress was alright, nothing special, pretty non existent.  My skinnylicious Asian Chicken Salad was HUGE, filling and at $13 wasn't too badly priced, but really didn't taste like anything. If you're at Short Hills Mall and don't mind chaos and looking for a filling meal, Cheesecake is most definitely your spot."
Ellen N.,"Livingston, NJ",54,255,17,3.0,3/13/2016,"Just another standard Cheesecake Factory.  I prefer the one in Willowbrook Mall...it is much bigger, and the wait staff is more attentive.  Unfortunately the wait time for Willowbrook Mall is always much worse than this on at Short Hills Mall..."
Chris W.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,30,8,1.0,5/5/2015,Take out service has diminished terribly since my last visit to this location.  The staff totally ignores you until it is time to take your payment.  Everyone seems to busy with their own life to acknowledge a takeout customer.
