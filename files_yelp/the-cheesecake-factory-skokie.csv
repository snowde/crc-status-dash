Lakshmi K.,"Evanston, IL",10,81,6,4.0,1/7/2018,"We went there about 2 yrs ago and didn't had a good experience. The food was Ok, but the waitress literally was pushy and inattentive. We were celebrating our family member's birthday and Cheesecake happens to be her fav restaurant. So when we asked where she like to go...we knew her choice. For a change the experience this time was very welcoming and warm. Our waiter was charming, informative and helpful and that changed everything. The food tasted more delicious and the place more familiar.  The Filet Mignon simply melted in mouth.My sister's Jambalaya and my husbands steak with teriyaki were outstanding too. Just the pineapple chicken was a let down, as it is just like orange chciken with few pineapple bits in there. The cocktail were great and since my sister's came in a chipped glass, the waiter happily got her another one. We were impressed by their option of low carb, no sugar cheesecake option! We have a suggestion to make, hopefully someone insider is listening. My son and i know many kids are allergic to eggs. So if your master cheff can work on a Eggless cheesecake option...you will see us much more often."
Tim W.,"Chicago, IL",4,67,253,5.0,12/14/2017,"Once again, not disappointed one bit. The food here always hits the spot. And the cheesecake at the end is a treat well worth waiting for and the end of a big meal.    Well again, another review I should have posted before. So please forgive me on that behalf. I visit here & other Cheesecake Factory locations when I can. Just because I know that I will always be satisfied with the service as well for the meals.    On this particular visit. I found myself venturing in to new taste. Such as the soup. I usually choose to have a salad before the main course. But this time I did the opposite, and went for their soup. And let me tel you, that must have been one of the best restaurant soups I have ever had in quite sometime. So FYI, don't pass up the soup if it's offered. You will not be disappointed.    Please forgive me on forgetting the names of the entrées. But I'm sure if you show the waitress or waiter the will know what it is.    My pasta with chicken was delicious. My wife's salad with fish was the same. We enjoyed them so much that we tried to hold back as much as possible so we would be able to take them home to have for the next day : )   So if you are reading this review to try and make a decision on where it is that you and a family member or friend would like to dine. Do not over look this place. The variety of different options they offer is great. And on top of that, let's not forget about the cheesecake. It is one of those delights you find yourself cheating on your diet for ; ) I know I do."
Theresa F.,"Gilberts, IL",19,208,57,5.0,12/9/2017,"Yum-o!  Came in here for lunch and my husband and I split the Ceasar and Margherita pizza.  Super yummy - better than I remembered from my last visit a few years ago.  Seems like they turned it up a notch with both service and quality.   I have to also mention that this place is definitely on our *new* list of go-tos since we now have a toddler to bring along our eating adventures.  Shout-out to the hostess, Rena for being accommodating AF considering that our little one was quite the hassle that day.  Needless to say, I definitely reco this spot for families!"
Denyce M.,"Chicago, IL",505,185,1140,3.0,10/11/2017,"Not much to say other than it is the Cheesecake Factory and it was opened late on Saturday.  Food is pretty standard, although my husband loved their white chili with rice.  I had the Chicken and Biscuits, which could have used some seasoning.  I took it home and had it the next day after adding some flavor to it...it was pretty good.  The biscuits were good, but it looked as it they were cooked in a muffin tin based on the shape and coloring on the bottom of the biscuits.  It didn't impact the taste, was just strange to see muffin shaped biscuits. For dessert we split the Celebration Cheesecake.  That was good as it had layers of Vanilla Cake, Cheesecake, Strawberry, Chocolate and Vanilla Mousse with Cream Cheese Frosting.  It was like eating birthday cake. Be prepared to spend some time reading the menu as it is extensive."
Christina B.,"Evanston, IL",64,73,116,3.0,10/29/2017,"I feel like the food here is either hit or miss. Their menu is big and has lots of different options but there's really only a handful of times I actually enjoyed what I was eating. The prices for the food are high but the dishes are pretty big and probably too much to finish in one sitting. Honestly my favorite things from here are a couple of the pasta dishes, especially the garlic noodles or the shrimp with angel hair pasta, and the chicken Madeira. The gumbo is also pretty good. If there's anything here you should get it's cheesecake. They're all rich and delicious, the slices are pretty big. I'd say avoid coming here on Sunday's, service can be verrrrryyyy slow. Otherwise an okay place to grab a bite."
Mike K.,"Evanston, IL",23,7,11,2.0,12/7/2017,"Every time I order food from here it's never as expected. I had to go factory nachos with chicken and that is not what I got. It was a bunch of stale chips with some cheese and hot sauce... no guac, no sour cream, no pico de gallo, not jalapeños, and no spicy chicken which I paid extra for! It was disgusting and disappointing. I paid $20+ for that? Not worth it."
Cara M.,"Chicago, IL",53,57,83,3.0,5/31/2017,"I've really been messing up going to Cheesecake Factory recently. I'm blaming it on just ordering poor items off the menu.  I ordered the key lime cheesecake to come out first, so I wouldn't be full by the end of the meal and I could eat it throughout the meal (genius idea, in my opinion). I also ordered the goat cheese and beet salad along with the crispy crab wontons. Clearly, I wasn't feeling in a healthy mood this fine lunch and tried to make myself feel better by ordering a salad along with dessert and a fried appetizer lol.  The goat cheese and beet salad - delicious. The only thing I take points off is for their plating style. It's so, ""meh."" I feel like they could plate it a little nicer.  Then, the crispy crab bites come out. At first I thought it was my mistake ordering, but no, I remembered adding in the ""wonton"" part in my order request and pointing to the words as I said them. The waiter was apologetic and that's not why I gave 3 stars. He was really nice about it, gave the table the bites no charge and went to go put in the wonton order. Since I tried the bites, I personally did not think they were good. He compared them to an appetizer favorite, alongside avocado egg rolls. They tasted fish-y to me and fell apart too easily.  But, back to the wontons that finally came out. Ugh, I was so disappointed. I've gotten these before at another location and they were delicious! These, though, the filling was neon yellow and it tasted very mustard-y, so I'm assuming that's what the yellow is from. I was so sad. I wanted to love them again.  One thing I didn't like about the waiter was that he took forever to come back to our table between each time. Don't get me wrong - he was really nice. It just took a while that we had our credit cards waiting when the check came, so we wouldn't have to wait for him to come back around again. Okay, well that's my Cheesecake Factory rant. This will not stop me from coming back. I've gotten delicious items from this menu, I've just been off my culinary game, I guess, for the past couple of times."
Marie K.,"Chicago, IL",45,113,621,4.0,4/5/2017,"Thanks always open late and something to eat from light to heavy. I got tired of Cheesecake here (sorry to say this), but I love to keep coming back for meals.  [LOVE]  + Super antioxidant salad (surprise you'll be very satisfied!)  + Thai lettuce wrap (not appetizer! It can be entree!!) + Pasta napoletana (good for left over lunch) + Grilled Salmon (not very special, but always good!) +BLT salad (please make your way baaaaackkk!!!!! Love you!!!) [Not Good] + Sweets including any cheesecake and tiramisu (I know it sounds ridiculous, but not for me. They are way to sweet and heavy. They need to work on more lighter sweets like soufflé, baked cheesecake, panna cotta, etc) + Espresso drinks & coffee (so sad) + Tacos (always cold... Why?) They have lots of varieties for meal choices. Americans, Mexicans, Italians, and Asians! At my recent visit for lunch, I finally got ahi tuna! I mean seared tuna tataki salad. I've been asking for it more than one year at dinner time, but they always said out of tuna today. I liked tataki tuna itself, but I wish they mixed tomatoes and avocados together with greens. I feel like they are left a part.  I wish BLT SALAD will come back to menu. I felt in love with it at my very first visit at the Cheesecake Factory. It was so memorable, delicious, and of course so fresh! Very clean and moody atmosphere, but good for family too! Service is always good :) Good for date night and special celebrations, but I just come here maybe once in a month or two months for varieties of food!  *Suggestions Besides BLT Salas's coming back to menu and working on new lighter desserts, I wish Sunday brunch would be available on Saturday, too! Make it Weekend brunch please!! Because I was looking at the brunch menu which was attractive and came on Saturday brunch and realized it was only for Sunday :("
Axiluj Z.,"West Rogers Park, Chicago, IL",6,16,10,5.0,12/30/2017,"Came on a Saturday evening around 6PM. There was what looked like a huge wait, but we were seated in less than two minutes. (there was only 2 of us) and our waitress was attentive, prompt, and nice. Our food took a little while, but it was packed so it was expected. I ordered a passion fruit mojito and it was surprisingly delicious . For two entrees (which are really big portions), a drink, and a soda pop- the bill was around $50. The pasta is really good for leftovers the next day too!"
Julia J.,"Columbus, OH",158,93,50,2.0,7/30/2017,"Our server was terrible. It took us about 20min since we were seated to receive our waters and drink orders. We ordered with her right away, but our food took another half hour.  We were seated in a booth and our server kept passing our food over the railing instead of coming around which I thought was very unprofessional. I understand cheesecake isnt the most upscale place, but I have never been to restaurant where the server is too lazy to come around to give us our food.  The experience with our server completely ruined our meal."
John A.,"Chicago, IL",0,2,,1.0,1/9/2018,This place is just horrible. And I can't believe how many people go there. Worst place ever. Crap food and crap service.
Julie S.,"Rogers Park, Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,12/27/2017,"I'm done with this restaurant.  I usually have problems with service but tonight was the food and after paying $109 for it, I am no longer a customer. We ordered to-go: -bread and butter.  Received no butter. -A tossed green salad with extra ranch.  No idea what dressing we got but sure wasn't ranch. -Pasta da Vinci.  They brag that this is their most liked chicken dish or something.  It was disgusting.  I had to add salt (which I never do) for it to taste like ANYTHING and even that was a bad move because all it did was bring out the horrible taste.  The pasta obviously tasted like the water it was cooked in and it tasted like the worst tap water you've ever had.  Then, each and every piece of chicken I bit into had some nasty cartilage or something hard in it and I had to spit it out.  I'm weird about meat so it took all I had in me not to throw up on my plate.   -2 Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp.  We've gotten this before and it's never had chicken in it.  Today there was chicken.  Probably to cut back on shrimp and save them a buck while charging customers shrimp prices. -Celebration Cheesecake.  Haven't tried this yet as I lost my appetite from dinner. The best part of tonights experience was the sweet sweet girl that brought our food out to me.  5 stars for her, zero for the food. Won't be returning."
Jim C.,"Moline, IL",0,38,28,4.0,12/24/2017,"Great food and drinks, but we paid for them. Long Islands and Shepard's Pie are fantastic."
Marta B.,"Chicago, IL",91,184,600,4.0,4/2/2017,"I really like Cheese Cake Factory, but this location is not my favorite due to the crowds.I usually get food to go afer shopping at Old Orchard. I dined in maybe twice, but it was years ago. I really love their cheesecakes so they get points  just for that. I absolutely love their Chicken Madeira. But the service is slow. It's gets crazy busy. But when I am in the area I will be stopping in again."
Jay B.,"Chicago, IL",97,87,98,4.0,8/20/2017,Well this is Cheesecake Factory. Plenty of menu options available. Service was quick and attentive. Would go back
Ramon B.,"Skokie, IL",1,13,1,1.0,12/7/2017,"I would love to give this place NEGATIVE stars. I'm not reviewing the in house restaurant service but more specifically the take out desk. The woman at the takeout desk was extremely rude, the service was extremely slow and disorganized. I always get take out from this location based on where i live and the food is ALWAYS late the service at the front is always chaotic and they clearly have no clear contact with their delivery drivers because it appears as they fall behind on orders regularly there is always drivers waiting by the take out. I usually try to be reasonable but this is at least ten times I experienced rude, slow, inconvenient service at this location. By far the worst of any cheesecake location. The manager who oversees the takeout desk should be ashamed how terribly they run it."
Kat D.,"Evanston, IL",140,409,38,3.0,10/25/2017,"I love coming to the Cheesecake Factory for drinks and appetizers...and cheesecake. They have a very extensive and diverse menu with large portions. I tend to order the same things because I love them so much - Buffalo blasts, avocado egg rolls, and a passion fruit margarita. Followed by one of each kind of Cheesecake. I kid, I kid. But I've never met a Cheesecake I didn't like there."
Bob Z.,"Grayslake, IL",25,211,927,3.0,2/11/2017,"I met someone here for a business lunch.  Lunch time is a zoo here. Very busy - folks actually lined up outside waiting for the doors to open at 11:30.  Even though it's really busy, the service was very good and we didn't feel forgotten, nor rushed.  For lunch I ordered a burger, medium rare and my friend ordered their Asian salad (I forget the exact name).   They came out pretty quickly. My burger was a bit more medium to medium well, but still juicy. It was a good amount of food.  My real complaint is that I ordered a side of cole slaw, which tasted great. It was served in a dish that must have just been taken out of a dish washer. It wasn't warm. It was hot to the touch. I was worried that the cole slaw wouldn't do well. After I tasted it and then felt the dish, I just had one more spoonful and didn't touch it again.  Because it was a business meal, I didn't want to derail our conversation, so I didn't say anything.  My friends salad was huge and he really enjoyed it. I think they did a decent job. I'd be careful about how they serve the cole slaw. That was a real miss."
Felecia R.,"Chicago, IL",1,2,2,1.0,9/10/2017,Old Orchard location manager very rude we had a used dirty fork on our supposed clean table. Manager came over and told me the fork was not dirty sometimes they pack the dishwasher too much and that happens....really so all your utensils are not properly cleaned cause this fork clearly on chocolate on it. Manager was so rude and didn't even apologize and got an attitude with us.
Lauren G.,"Chicago, IL",145,184,130,3.0,6/14/2016,"Average AF. Pretty much the equivalent to the most basic b***ch you can think of. It's cheesecake, what do you expect? Spotty service and overpriced decent food.  This is the closest cheesecake to my area. I'm not the biggest fan of stairs and they make you climb what seems like 5 flights but I'm not about to take the elevator; a good excuse to burn 1 extra calorie. Everyone that works there are either in their high school jobs or significantly older. There's hardly an in between. I come here mostly of their lemonade and the bread. They shiest the F out of you never filling up the 5.00 lemonade to the top so that's pretty shitty and you already know it's not free refills. Food is decent nothing special. They have lunch specials for half price. I guess that's a plus. Nothing special. Service can be hit or miss but they're mostly pretty shitty and have you waiting long periods of time to be waited on."
Anna D.,"Chicago, IL",27,61,1,4.0,10/29/2017,"This place always delivers! Good food, service and they have my favorite cheesecake ever - everyone needs to try this masterpiece (the mango key lime Cheesecake!!)"
Eric L.,"Lincolnwood, IL",206,28,45,4.0,12/22/2016,Came with my family and I had a firecracker salmon and Chinese Asian salad. The sauce was a bit salty on both but overall was very good. Came here for cheesecake of course and did not disappoint at all.  I forgot his name but the server was attentive and gave us great service. Will be back for sure
Selma L.,"Des Plaines, IL",11,121,19,5.0,8/5/2016,"Comparing this restaurant location to the one in Woodfield, I would say this one is far superior. We came at 6:00 on Friday, and we were immediately seated. In Schaumburg, the restaurant is smaller, and there is often wait times to get in. I believe the decor is classier, and feels much more upscale then the Schaumburg location housed within the mall. We were seated upstairs and had sole amount of space- not crammed into next to a ton of people. Our server was attentive and came by us multiple times to ask us how we were doing and if we needed anything. Since this is a chain, the food is pretty standardized... However the chicken Madeira that they boost about... It is truly phenomenal. The chicken is moist, and has very good flavor. My description wouldn't do it justice...It's something you just have to try for yourself.  All in all, a solid place for dinner  out within Old Orchard."
Ali C.,"Chicago, IL",49,477,1737,2.0,5/14/2017,"The chicken salad was good, but the Korean cauliflower was full of additives, tasted like chemicals, and completely unacceptable."
Claudy C.,"Chicago, IL",11,184,118,3.0,1/9/2017,"I only give them 3 stars for the service but the food is probably 2 stars this visit. I don't know what happened to the Cheesecake Factory but the food was not their best.  They served us bread right away but it was super tough. There were 6 of us and our jaws were hurting from chewing the tough bread. Our waitress was awesome, great service at this location.  4 of us got pasta dishes and 2 of us got burgers. The pasta was ok, it did not sit well in the end because a few of us went home with a stomach ache. One our burgers was served on a baguette and once again it was really tough bread to chew so the burger didn't get eaten. We didn't want to ask for a different kind of bun because we didn't want to bother our super nice waitress.  Overall, not the greatest food served this visit but we are not giving up on Cheesecake Factory."
Thalie L.,"Chicago, IL",88,294,310,4.0,10/27/2016,"I will never put a 5stars to a cheesecake factory place because their cheesecakes are gross. However the food is amazing there. Receipes are always bold comparing to what you can find in ""american restaurant"" and the food is always tasty and surprising. Menu is long so it can take you a while to find out what you want and sometimes I even think that it is a little bit expensive but the dishes are very well prepared and evrything is fresh. Portion are big.  Always a good address :)"
Dania M.,"Wisconsin Dells, WI",37,12,9,5.0,2/25/2017,"Lunch time we stop by and order a Bistro shrimp pasta love it , it has urugula and garlic sauce not heavy at all was tasty , fresh and creamy :) yummy Great flavor and fresh too .  We also order the HIBACHI STEAK , it comes with mash potatoes and green beans,  So if you are a steak eater or pasta eater this 2 plates are recommended."
Sam L.,"Chicago, IL",44,8,,1.0,9/23/2017,"After many years of enjoying either eating there or taking out, tonight was the third time this year of incredibly bad service and they misplaced my credit card on top of it. Thanks for all the good memories, but after three consecutive problem visits, I'm done."
Philet G.,"Chicago, IL",1,3,,1.0,10/29/2017,"The food was ok, the service was good. But we couldn't help but wonder if the hostess was racist towards Asians. We were seated in the very corner, almost hidden from view, even though there were plenty of tables available in the area. We asked to be reseated and the hostess even questioned if it was possible to be reseated a few tables away.  Afterwards, we noticed that another Asian family was seated in the same hidden corner, again with several empty tables around them. This was after another (non-Asian) group was seated at a nearby better table."
Carrie J.,"Mission District, San Francisco, CA",54,14,42,5.0,8/4/2017,Outstanding selection and atmosphere. Vegan dish was phenomenal. Coconut Lime chicken - sauce was delish and unique. Kept my 12 year old's palate excited (he's a cook in the making). Kids menu is superb.
Nina I.,"Chicago, IL",667,491,62,3.0,3/11/2017,"Came here for one of my birthday celebrations ( I had a few). I sat in the dungeon (literally all the way in the back and around the corner). Our server was nice but our table wasn't constantly bussed and taken care of. Food took a long time to come out (maybe because the food runners couldn't find our table haha). Will be back, but this place is rolling down hill."
Maria R.,"Chicago, IL",44,3,,1.0,3/5/2017,"Unbelievable. Completely unbelievable. We were sat at 3 and were not given water till 315.   Our waiter took out orders  (appetizer drinks and entree) and we waited till 415 for our entrees. We wanted a quick meal but to wait over 50 minutes for our entree?  The manager was so disrespectful and so unapologetic and when we told them forget the entree he just grabbed the bagged food and left. He didn't charge us the appetizer or the drinks but the way he said ""there's no bill, you can just go."" Unbelievable"
Heather B.,"Skokie, IL",45,21,32,4.0,7/11/2017,"We arrived later, about 9:30pm and the staff was clearing and setting up tables in the back. (We used the elevator).  I ordered the salmon in the wrap appetizer which tasted great, which was over a cabbage salad, and that was good too.  My mom had the porkchop and said it was fantastic. So was the lemon meringue cheesecake.  The waitress clearly was busy doing other things, trying to handle remaining customers while others were setting the tables. So, it took a while for her to return."
Bing N.,"Chicago, IL",6,65,301,4.0,4/23/2016,The place is great with food and staff and server were friendly even though we had more than an hour wait before we got seated.  Bought a whole cake for a surprise for my sister after we ate dinner  which would have been unfrozen after 3 hours but it's still frozen. Just could not help to think if they did remove the cake the time we told them to.
Ewelina M.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",1,16,2,1.0,8/20/2017,"Don't waste your money here unless you want a shitty attitude. Our waitress was Karla D, very slow service, didn't get a refill once, waited for check for about 20 minutes, when asked for a refill To-go she brought our drinks in glasses and separate plastic cups expecting us to pour it over ourselves, why not just pour it straight to the plastic cups from the fountain? Makes no sense."
Olivia R.,"Niles, IL",27,166,194,5.0,9/24/2016,"We come to this place often. I always try something different from the menu and it always delivers. I wouldn't say it's mind blowing good, but i couldn't complain about it either. And i really like that they have such a long menu. Lots of choices."
Ella B.,"Chicago, IL",6,59,8,1.0,8/13/2016,"I will never eat food from this location again! I ordered some loaded baked potato tots to go, they came with sour cream. When I got home to eat the food, I was completely disgusted! My cup of sour cream had a grilled onion and dozens of crumbs in it! I could not believe it! Apparently they are either using leftover sour cream from people's plates, or they are using dirty spoons to scoop the sour cream into the container! Sickening! The onion was in the middle of the sour cream until I moved it up top to see what it was. The crumbs were all through it!  Why would anyone use a spoon with grilled onions on it to scoop out sour cream, wouldn't you HAVE to see that beforehand? Because of the crumbs and where the onion was located, I am inclined to think this was used sour cream. How else would it get crumbs all throughout the container. If they are doing stuff like this, what ELSE are they doing? UGH! NASTY! FOUL!"
Courtney K.,"Wilmette, IL",519,341,46,4.0,1/11/2017,"Yes, this place is a chain restaraunt but they consistently deliver good food, massive portions, and BOMB cheesecake. My favorites are the traditional with strawberry, and the white and black cheesecake. The steak here is really great, as is the miso salmon. Next time I come, I will try one of the pastas because the table next to us got some and they looked divine"
Mateo W.,"Morton Grove, IL",96,69,485,2.0,6/13/2016,"To first start this place was moderately busy when my party of 7 arrived. We had to wait 10-15 minutes which myself and my party did not mind. We were eventually sat at a booth and the waiter came up to take our drink orders. I ordered an old fashion and it took a whole 30 minutes to get my drink while everyone else got their lemonade and all else of which they ordered. This was just the start of the downfall of service, my menu had a piece of chewed gum slapped between the pages. Wonderful. The table was covered in some greasy, oily substance that was not properly cleaned. The food took forever to come out. When the food did arrive it was very good but the overall experience was ruined. 2 stars. Won't return for a while."
Angela S.,"Highland Park, IL",2419,776,6568,4.0,10/24/2015,"I admit to this being my first time at The Cheesecake Factory.  On a girls night out, we met for an appetizer and glass of wine before heading to a play at Northlight Theatre. It was extremely crowded, but we still managed to get right in, and our server was right there ready to take our order.  Aiming for a light bite, and completely overwhelmed by the beyond ginormous menu, for some reason my eyes landed on the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders. I figured it would be fairly small, so I added fries for $1 for all of us to share.  Holy chicken! The appetizer portion was a legitimate meal. Take note, the portions are huge here, and I had no idea what to expect. I also expected my chicken to be pretty basic, but can I just tell you? I enjoyed every bite, and it was so good I fought hard to finish it. The plate came out with sliders piled high and a huge portion of fries. It was really pretty hilarious.  The chicken was tender and lightly crispy with a nice buttermilk batter. The buns were toasted with butter (yep, pretty rich), and the fries were perfectly crispy and seasoned just right. I fully admit that I'm craving the chicken right now. I eat a lot of chicken, and I have to say this was a memorable meal...and I mean meal.  Yep, I'd go back again, and it's an ideal location to stop before a show at the North Shore Center of The Performing Arts."
