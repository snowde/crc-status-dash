Nina C.,"Chicago, IL",1,21,,5.0,11/27/2013,"First of all, the food is consistently delicious. I have never had a bad meal here, or even an ""okay"" meal.   Second, the reason I am writing a review for this restaurant - the service.  Our server Benjamin M was great.  He came to the table to check on us at the right times, he didn't forget anything, he was very friendly and a pleasure to be served by. It was very apparent that he loves his job, and definitely made us want to go back!"
Nats A.,"Fort Worth, TX",34,133,13,4.0,4/30/2012,"I love the Cheesecake factory!  Every time I go I always get excellent service.  The chicken parm sandwich is to die for.  It is a little dry sometimes, which is why I always ask for extra sauce on the side.  Parking is somewhat limited since it is in old orchard.  Also, do they ever open the lower level?"
Jessica Y.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",9,314,2,3.0,12/13/2012,i used to not like cheesecake factory but i have learned to co exist with it. the issue i had with the establishment as a whole is that there are a lot of items on the menu not all of which are made well - it makes for an overwhelming task to figure out what to get/a crap shoot. on a side note i'm not sure why it's always packed/what's up with the twinkle palace decor...anyways i finally ordered some stuff that was pretty tasty. although i would not choose this as a place as a top contender when i have to come it is a-ok..it is what it is.  Some things i have had that were good: santorini farro salad mediterranean lettuce wraps roasted vegetable pizza fried zucchini appetizer with ranch (fyi the dressing is very garlicy) fries
Carry G.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,,1.0,11/17/2015,"I usually go there at least once a month to have lunch with my girlfriends . Food and service are usually good. Last two times  both were terrible. Few weeks ago we ordered guacamole which was almost black , waiter did exchange it. He forgot our egg rolls.. We had to wait for him each time,for more than few minutes for water and everything else... I went back yesterday and we ordered everything from skinnylicous menu. We were holding menus while ordering. We had two small appetizers and two salads one cheesecake. I gave waiter my card because we were in a rush . He brought back the charge but not itemized bill. Charge was for $70.00. On the way out I asked the manager to give us the detailed bill. Waiter charged us everything from regular menu. I explained to him that we ordered everything from skinnylicous menu, we were holding those long menus while ordering. He said just because you are holding the certain menu does not mean that we ordered from it.I argued and he said he would make an adjustment to our bill, after repeating the same nonsense and looking at me like I was someone who was looking for something for free. I didn't even bother to stay and get that $20 or $25 difference . I was so frustrated and insulted.It was not worth it after manager acted like total jerk! McDonald's has probably better service and attitude than them. Oh yes and by the way .. Dear manager Instead of being so rude to people who your waiter overcharged on purpose maybe you should take shower more often. Even food smell could not cover your body odor ."
Nichole F.,"Chicago, IL",259,449,219,4.0,12/5/2012,"I have been here a couple of times.  Every server I have ever had has been great and friendly.  I love the southwestern egg rolls and the Cobb salad.  They used to have a skirt steak that I drooled over but last time I was there, I noticed that it was no longer on the menu.  My favorite dessert also is no longer on the menu (it was chocolate cake).  The only bad thing I would say about this location is that the last time I was there, the bartender was talking so loud.  We were not right next to the bar either.  It was annoying."
Nick L.,"San Mateo, CA",82,1025,13,3.0,1/10/2013,"Is there a bigger menu selection at any restaurant? If so, that's just crazy. Whatever you are in the mood for, they'll have it here. That probably makes the quality suffer as they have to know so many things. The portion sizes are big and the place is usually packed, probably related! Food is average, subjective I know, and you have to be in the mood for this place, i.e. hungry and ready to eat!"
Marilyn K.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,6,,5.0,7/18/2013,Best bartender!!!!! Sitting at the bar with Jo Anne is the greatest!
Evangelia M.,"Somset, United Kingdom",0,5,,4.0,10/5/2015,Kind staff nice enviroment and great cheesecakes! The food is good but a little bit overpriced! I will go there again to eat their fabulous cheesecake with caramel!
Mark B.,"Chicago, IL",0,38,,2.0,3/9/2015,I used to like this place. But the service and food have slipped in a big way. My food was overcooked and bland. I won't be going back.
Mish G.,"Boston, MA",0,82,13,1.0,1/6/2014,"Normally I am not this harsh but this was an horrible dining experience.  We were there Friday night, December 27, 2013 and decided to sit downstairs in the Cafe versus waiting 20 minutes to eat upstairs.  It was a really bad decision.  The Cafe has a limited menu and according to our waiter that night, if I wanted an ice tea, he would have to go upstairs to get it (even though there is a full bar in the Cafe), they will not customize anything off the Cafe menu, I asked for dressing on the side for one of the salads and was told, they do not have the side dishes at the Cafe, so the dressing is tossed.  In addition, if we wanted a garnish, lemon/lime for our soda or water, he would have to go upstairs (even though there is a full bar in the Cafe).....Two tables next to us were there over 2 hours for just cheesecake and coffee, they both talked to the 2 women managers, nothing was done.  My father order a crown royal on the rocks, he did get it until after we were done eating, even after reminding the waiter 3 times.....yes there is a full bar in the Cafe......Our food sat on the counter, you can see the open kitchen from our booth for 30 minutes before it arrived.   The booth behind us commented, that perhaps we go get our food from the kitchen counter, self served, as it would have been faster and the food would have been hot.  It wasn't worth complaining to the 2 managers, as all they could clearly do was apologize......"
Jen P.,"Chicago, IL",3,32,,5.0,2/13/2013,"Stopped here for dessert after an abysmal dinner at maggianos... Eric was our server. He was extra friendly, helpful, and didn't seem to mind that we came in for a drink, a coffee, and a couple of amazing and delicious desserts, not a full meal.  Eric was friendly and professional and even though he was probably getting off work soon, didn't mind leaving us alone to gorge ourselves on cheesecake (fantastic) and carrot cake (best ever). I had the Georgia peach cocktail which I have been trying for a year to replicate in my magic bullet unsuccessfully. It's so good.  Thanks for redeeming a crappy date night, Cheesecake Factory."
Yesy D.,"Chicago, IL",93,176,28,2.0,1/23/2012,"I give this 2 stars because the cheesecake was super yummy. That is the only good thing about this place.  First they sit us down in a table that has food and napkins all over the floor. I left the restaurant with a french fry stuck under my shoe. The waiter was nice but he forgot our drinks. He didn't remember, we had to remind him. The server who actually brought us our food was rude. The weird part was that we got our food in sections. There were four of us and we got our meal in intervals. One person got theirs, five minutes later another person, and so on.  There was nothing spectacular about the food. My child who eats everything did not want to eat her food. I will not go back by choice."
Katrina N.,"Chicago, IL",17,2,5,1.0,9/10/2014,"It was the worst experience I ever had in my entire life. I always love cheese cake factory. But today I think it will be my last time. I went here with two other friends. We got sit down and ordered. While I ordered the pasta I request extra sauces. The waiter said ""it's will be extra charge"" I like""ok"" he said ""it's 3.99"". I didn't ask him the price. I found it very rude. The food was just ok today. When we finished the food I asked him to Togo my pasta and bring out the dessert. He did dat with the check. I meant what is such a rush. Then we just wanna show how bad the service was I didn't wanna tip him. Then we paid cash and each of us put in 31 dollars which is total 99 (the bill was 90.74). We went to washroom but the lady was chased after us and said we didn't pay enough money. I asked her to review the camera but she keeps saying yes we have camera but u didn't put enough money. I was in time crunch and didn't want bc of couple bucks ruin my day off. So whatever I paid the rest. I'm very sad with their services . Even thou the lady said our waiter been with them for 10 years that doesn't mean he should treat us like this and the missing money mystery."
Emily H.,"Des Plaines, IL",19,8,10,4.0,8/31/2013,I love the food here! Especially the pasta! The waiters and waitresses were so nice! The only bad thing about it is that it is always crowded here. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
Cola M.,"Chicago, IL",1,56,8,2.0,2/7/2013,"Food not that not that great . Manager in the  afternoon Monday ,have a bad service.Did not even meant to apologize for the mistake in the food they serve.Came and left like he is in a hurry."
John I.,"Chicago, IL",191,44,,2.0,7/12/2011,"OK i know I can be picky, but I am rating a visit from last night that is fresh in my mind. Took my roommate out for dinner and she loves TCF. So we arrive and there is the typical north shore, crowd, We stick out like a sore thumb, she is a very tall African American Beauty in a dress. I am dressed cool, Not hipster, just old school cool. ( I'm old I know it LOLOLOL) so we wait, and then get seated, I happened to get a phone call, in which I must take so I politely speak at the table the server comes up I motion for 2 minutes and he is annoyed. so I finish the call and order our drinks. then the bread comes and then we sit and wait... then he takes our order.  My Friend ordered the Salmon with I believe it was angel hair pasta. She loved it.  I ordered the lemon Herb Chicken, mash, some carrots and of course, Herbs. We are sitting eating bread, sitting drinking, sitting and I look down at when I took the last call. it has been 30 minutes I stop one of the management, and ask it has been a  while could you please check on our two entrees. Well that did it. with in 45 seconds the waiter is rushing them out to us. Strike two..... The chicken probably was cooked nicely sitting on a  warmer it dried out the white meat and I have to say the consistency in flavor was just NOT there. Some had a lemony flavor and others pieces( the breast meat) was simply flavorless.  After I stopped the manager she would check up on us. The atmosphere was fine. just the long wait for our entree that was obviously finished long before they brought it out would have been better."
Agnes P.,"Chicago, IL",2,64,,1.0,11/28/2011,The cheesecake was probably the only thing worth ordering... Do not let me get into the details of what happened the next morning in the bathroom because I decided to order some cheesy and tomato-ey mess that the fat waiter suggested.... At least the daiquiri's have a good kick of alcohol...
Vanessa A.,"Chicago, IL",0,19,,1.0,10/14/2011,The service was horrible... The waiter was rude and sat us in a noisy location. He got my order wrong and the waitresses were too busy socializing by the kitchen. The food was cold... NEVER going back to this one.
Lauren P.,"Bolingbrook, IL",373,252,18,4.0,4/24/2011,"I know this is a chain, but I can't help but go to this restaurant! Their service is excellent, and so is the food! My fave food from this place is the.... -brown bread -avocado egg rolls -thai lettuce wraps -orange chicken (supppper crunchy! - unlike the common chinese orange chicken... seriously) -miso salmon with brown rice!!! (its soooo good because there's sake butter in it oh yeahhhh baby) -luah salad (crispy tortillas in between the lettuce -  even though this is a salad be careful ...this is huuuuuge and packed with calories so portion yourself! haha) desserts... -white chocolate raspberry cheesecake -low carb cheesecake with splenda and a side of strawberries (honestly sometimes you just want the old fashion cheesecake - but still super good) -red velvet (i used to love this one a lot, however they seem to have added more white chocolate on the crust which isn't to my liking) -i tried their mango key lime pie or something and it was a bit tart but very different! anyway, check it out! especially the miso salmon :)"
Mallory G.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,,3.0,9/23/2012,"I have only been to a cheesecake factory twice, and it was this one. I love the booths that we got both times. The staff acts really nice and we had a great waitress and a great waiter this time.  This time I had chicken taquitos, they were OK, but nothing that I couldn't get out of a frozen food section, and they were kinds luke-cold; I hate that. I also had the fish tacos this time. What a downer, they were so dry I nearly choked to death. There was way too much slaw and the fish was teeny. It needed some sour cream to cut the dryness. Very unhappy. For dessert I had white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. So amazing! In June I had the same cheesecake. I also had southern chicken sliders that weren't very good. Didn't look like the photos I saw. I had buffalo blasts which were so yummy! The over the top meatloaf sandwich is OK if you don't eat too much. It starts to taste like strange meat. Veal?"
