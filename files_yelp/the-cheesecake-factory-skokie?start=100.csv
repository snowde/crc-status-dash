Evelyn P.,"Chicago, IL",0,22,5,4.0,11/16/2015,If your going there for steak think twice. The steak was flavorless and really chewy. There appetizers and drinks are phenomenal. Burgers are good as well. The chicken entrees are amazing.
Ha B.,"Skokie, IL",0,7,,1.0,3/18/2017,"Honestly the food has always been good here..this must be my 3rd time here just this year. So we all order our food and the food comes. While eating my food i saw my father in law shaking his head and giving his chicken plate to my wife and mother in law telling them it's too salty and does not taste good. This is where it all began..  I nicely asked one the waitress if they could make his food again for its very salty.. she said absolutely and she also mentioned to put the sauce on the side just in case.. very very nice.. and so she went on to find our waiter.. This guy came to our table and was the most unprofessional the most arrogant and waiter I have EVER dealt with.. the gentleman had a man bun and unfortunately I forgot to take down his name.  Standing on top of us he says.. ""Excuse me sir but this dish looks like it's been half way done! If you think it's too salty you should've noticed it from the beginning? But let me see what I can do""  WHAT???!!! ... If im not enjoying my food you are going to stand there and tell me that I should've told you before!?????????  My father in law gave it a chance and if it wasn't for me he would've just left his food there! The guy takes our plate and goes in the back! After 5 mins he comes back and says  ""Would you like a soup or salad while you wait?"" ""Actually maybe the soup is too salty for you too just stick with a salad!"" WHHHaAAaaT?????!!!! You gotta be kidding me!!  He was rude.. unprofessional.. and acted like he was gonna pay for our dinner!  Cheesecake.. please hire people who don't hate their jobs and can put a good image for the Resturant!  You lost about 6 customers last night. Because I'm taking my business somewhere that I can enjoy the food.. and if the chefs make a mistake and the food is too salty .. they won't talk down on me to fix it!"
Ty R.,"Chicago, IL",13,70,193,2.0,9/11/2015,I have been to the CF 2 dozen times and I am still not impressed. The menu is way to big and  the prices for the cheesecakes are high. I do love the bread baskets and the ambiance good place for a first date.
Maria G.,"Chicago, IL",3,140,172,5.0,11/29/2013,"Had buffalo blasts & thai lettuce wraps along with drinks. Now I have the ""itis"". LOL. Our server, John, was GREAT!!!  Just had to note: The servers are required to wear all white, but it only looks nice IF their white clothes are WHITE without dirt and food stains. It is soooooo unappetizing to be served by someone with dirty WHITE clothing. YUCKY!!!"
Foodie A.,"Mount Pleasant, WI",64,171,282,4.0,1/22/2016,I did take out with DOORDASH a delivery service in the area. I recommend them. It's an app for your iPhone. Cheesecake Factory delivery was great the food was really delicious and hot.
Jill D.,"Weare, NH",18,14,6,4.0,8/16/2016,"I got the Skinnylicious Steak Medallions and a Lagunitas IPA.  The food was delicious and a nice sized portion , I just wish your selection was a little more enhanced (the drop in a star).  The bartender, Jogi, Wes super friendly and attentive!  I'll be back!"
Lia V.,"Chicago, IL",146,29,1,1.0,5/30/2015,"My father came in to purchase four slices of cheesecake for my mother's birthday. He ordered and proceeded to wait 30 minutes for the slices to be packaged, while the teller completed orders for customers behind him in line.  After 30 min he inquired about the cheesecake, which he had already paid for. The girl scoffed and proceeded to package the four pieces laying down ON TOP OF EACH OTHER IN A SINGLE BOX AND SQUISH THE LID CLOSED, DESTROYING THE CAKE.  My father was obviously not ok with this and requested new slices. The girl threw a fit and got her manager, who after finding out what has happened all but ASKED MY FATHER, A PAYING CUSTOMER, TO LEAVE.  Absolutely ridiculous, unprofessional, disgusting behavior on my mom's birthday. Will never go to this place again and will warn others that the staff are incompetent, haughty and ridiculous."
Allison H.,"Madison, WI",3,5,,1.0,4/22/2015,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory with my boyfriend expecting an experience a little nicer than a regular chain restaurant (e.g., Applebee's). Should have just gone to said chain restaurant. After we were seated, it took roughly 10 minutes to be greeted. Our waitress (who I didn't realize was our waitress at the time) went to every single table around us to deliver food, take orders, etc. She even pushed our table a few inches to the side to get in to deliver a plate of food to the people next to us. All she had to do is acknowledge us, say she was slammed, and we would have understood. Instead, she chose to ignore us and leave us waiting. Eventually she came to us and asked for our drink orders. We gave our whole order at that time, since we had ample time to decide.  She dropped off the bread first, drinks a while later. Then when we finally got the food, it was so lackluster. I had the Mexican salad with ""avocados, corn, chicken, sour cream, and hard tortillas."" It was made with shredded lettuce, which is okay on a taco, and tasted like coleslaw. The ""hard tortillas"" we're on the bottom of the whole salad, covered in a black bean & chicken mix, and they were ridiculously soggy. I ate the chicken and called it a day.  My boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich, which was served with globs of coleslaw on it. He gets pulled pork sandwiches everywhere we go and I have never seen him so disappointed. I was going to ask the waitress for a different entree because I was so disappointed and starving, but she never came back except to drop off the check.  Terrible service. Sub-par food. Cramped atmosphere. I will never go back."
DorothySay B.,"Kalamazoo, MI",29,26,47,5.0,12/5/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is a chain with the sort of gargantuan menu that makes your head spin.  Then why the hell is everything there so off-the-hook delicious?  I've literally never had a bad meal at this place. Prices are good for the portions you receive, and the drinks are delicious, never watered down. Get the Thai Lettuce Wraps --they're in the appetizer section --but it's a massive plate of luscious vegetable-laden wonder with three dips, all of which entice. They plate it on large leaves of red cabbage ...which I always squirrel away in a napkin to take home, and add to my smoothies and slaw the next day. Why waste a hunk of gorgeous nutrition?  This trip I had the Shepherd's Pie for the first time which is sort of deconstructed in a pasta bowl. YUM!... excellent gravy, well-prepared meat and veg with a crackling potato topping ..served with a recommended Pinot noir ...heaven.  The one thing I don't usually have us the cheesecake, though I know it's delicious. Because I'm already too stuffed with delish. Mmmmmmm."
Grace Y.,"Bolingbrook, IL",60,131,25,5.0,4/1/2016,"I came here for dinner with my family and we all had a great time.  There is such an extensive menu that there is something for everyone.  I had the delicious pasta da vinci and others ordered the orange chicken, shepherd's pie, and shrimp scampi.  The portions were huge and we were too full for dessert.  My favorite dessert to get there is the red velvet cheesecake.  Can't wait to go back."
Steve H.,"Park Ridge, IL",0,41,,4.0,7/16/2016,"You would have gotten 5 stars Cheesecake Factory if your kitchen was a little faster. Came here for lunch, so it wasn't super crowded. We had the passion fruit ice tea, which was very good. My wife and I split the orange chicken dish so we could have room for cheesecake.  OMG!!!! Very good dish!!! Better than going to a real Chinese restaurant. We then split the Oreo cheesecake. Now I'm a big cheesecake and this was a real winner!  I guess that we'll be back very soon."
Stefanie B.,"Northbrook, IL",128,81,134,3.0,9/24/2014,"I never know what to order here... There is wayyy too many items on their mini novel they call a menu.  The food is over priced for food that is nothing special to me.  The portions are huge though, I'll give em that.  And the wait time can be a PAIN!  So I've been there many times and tried many dishes to have go to items that I'll order and not look through the menu.  If you're in the mood for appetizers then you can never go wrong with the Thai Lettuce Chicken Wraps.  They're just so fun! I also do love their brown bread they give you at the jump and fill up on that :/ Main courses, if you want a salad I always order the Luau Salad.  It's so different than any salad I've ever had.  It comes layered on these giant wontons that you crush up to mix together.  The green beans are so crispy and fresh and the mango gives it that nice sweet kick to it.  If you like sandwiches, the Shrimp Po' boy and pasta I get the Chicken Piccata with angel hair. The cheesecake... I'm not a big cheesecake fan so I usually get the Banana cheesecake. It's very light tasting, not too rich like some of the others.  I think I love the whipped cream the most, it's just perfect! Recently I saw a pic of their new cheesecake...The Toasted S'more!! So yeah, I totally had to try it...and YEP it was just as good as the picture looked!  But don't take my word for it and try it yourself...NOW!!"
Mousa K.,"Dearborn, MI",9,68,76,4.0,8/22/2015,"This place is very nice for a franchise. The smell of this place gets you excited for the delicious meals that your going to try. Our waitress was very useless for help. The shrimp bistro and summer sumo rolls were the best thing that i have tried there yet. Food is yet oily but very delicious. Our waitress forgot to give me my Garlic Noodles entree (which i have been waiting for a good 35 minutes and i would understand if it was busy, but it was a Wednesday afternoon. So even though the service sucked the food is very pleasant. Also I recommend the falafel garden salad"
Linda C.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,,4.0,1/10/2017,"I wish everyone the awesome experience I had at the Cheesecake Factory. Excellent service, delicious food ( and cheesecake), moderately priced. I can't wait to go back and try another entrée!"
Ms. S.,"Chicago, IL",160,89,11,3.0,7/22/2016,The foods were fairly decent and mouthwatering. The service we got was rather sluggish though the number of customers weren't that big that day. I believe we shelled out more because of the popularity of the restaurant and the elaborate garnishings that they used on their menu. It's a must-try to visit but it wasn't fully impressive.
Grace H.,"Evanston, IL",65,102,56,4.0,4/2/2015,"Fancy, affordable, and delicious food!  I have to give this place four stars because it made my mom really happy. She was delighted by the fancy feel of the restaurant- the mood lighting, the soft rock playlist, the booths, and the sweet and kind waitresses.  A lot of people were waiting to be seated, but our wait was only 15 minutes.  The hostess quickly seated us, and the waitress came with ice-cold water. We asked for bread, and the bread was very soft and delicious. We wanted to ask for more, but we refrained because we wanted to save our appetites for the main course.  The menu is a whole booklet, and it also comes with a ""skinnylicious"" menu as well. My brother ordered salmon and rice dish (~20$), and he was impressed by the juiciness of the salmon and its tasteful marriage to the rice.  My mom ordered a turkey avocado burger from the ""skinnylicious"" menu, and I ordered a vegetarian burger from the skinny menu as well. Apparently, these dishes are under 600 calories! (Cheesecake has a bad rep for having extremely caloric food).  I appreciated this menu, because I hate fattening foods. Hate! Now I can still come to these nice restaurants with my family and friends :).  There was quite a lot of turkey on my mom's burger. The burger was more like a sandwich, because there was no patty. However, my mom thoroughly enjoyed the turkey (an inch think) and the avocado slices and the bacon slices.  I, on the other-hand, did not like my veggie burger. The patty was made mostly out of rice and beans. The texture of the rice did not complement the softness of the bread. I took the bun off in the end.. The patty was disappointing. I think morning star offers better patties.  However, the cheesecake is soo goood. We were full by the time we grabbed our dessert forks, but the decadence and richness of the cheesecake made us forget about our bloated tummies for a minute.  -It's a good place to go when you want to treat yourself. But be kind to your body please. Some of these dishes are more than 1000 calories!   -share the cheesecake, please! for your health!"
Tuyen T.,"Chicago, IL",248,34,2,5.0,6/13/2016,I love this restaurant. I could never say no to this place. My bf and I come here very often. I feel like all of the food they've there are delicious and the tropical smoothie too.
Johnathan O.,"Cupertino, CA",0,5,7,3.0,6/9/2016,Service is alright. Sort of slow. Thankful for the bread :)  Seared Tuna Tataki tasted fine. The portion is just right.  The atmosphere was suitable for conversations.
Tricia D.,"Chicago, IL",523,1184,3681,1.0,1/20/2012,"When I come here and see the plethora of choices on the menu, I wonder why it's been so long since I came back (""ooh!  I want to try this next time!  No, I want to try THIS!"").  But the day after dining at CF, when I feel fat, bloated, and like I gorged on 2500 calories at my last meal (because I did), I know why I don't eat here more often. I suspect I may have gotten food poisoning from the fish tacos here last week*.  Whether that dish was the source of my 2 days of living hell won't be confirmed, but what I CAN say is that I was not impressed at the length of time it took for our food to arrive.  Thank goodness for wonderful company.  Once our dinners were placed in front of us, you could tell the plates had been heated under a lamp, as they were hot, but the food was lukewarm at best.  The tacos looked as if they had been prepared 2.7 days ago. Service was touch and go and quite unimpressive for the 20%+ we still ended up leaving. *and I lived to tell the story!"
Robert K.,"Chicago, IL",1,42,,1.0,8/20/2016,"Overall a bad experience and a bad branch of Cheesecake Factory.  At three in the afternoon the lower level was closed so you had to go upstairs to be seated.  We waited about 10 minutes even though there were empty tables.  We were seated at a booth where the bulb above it was strobing on and off making it unpleasant to read the menu and then eat.  Then my food came.  I ordered a Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad.  One problem they forgot the chicken.  When I told my waiter this, he doubted me and decided (without asking) to pick up a fork and dig through my salad to find there was in fact no chicken.  My salad was replaced with a new one that had a few meager pieces of chicken.  I've had this salad before at other Cheesecake Factories and the salad had a decent amount of chicken.  Not a good experience."
