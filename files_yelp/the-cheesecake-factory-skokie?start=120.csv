Julie T.,"Chicago, IL",42,52,2,5.0,8/28/2015,Awesome (not to mention overwhelming) menu! There is something here for everyone. The decor is also really cute.  Our server Isho was amazing too! I will def. be back :)
Nimesh G.,"Skokie, IL",1,8,30,3.0,2/21/2015,"Cheese Cake Factory is always good place to go, nice décor, drinks and food.  But, after dining there over the past 10 years, they really need to change the menu. If you have several vegetarians in your group, choices are very limited, you will end up ordering same dish due to lack of selection.  These dishes have also become under whelming over the years.  You would think as people become more health conscience that menu would reflect it!!! This is still good place to dine with friends, just avoid going with other vegetarians in the group if you can!"
Sara K.,"Niles, IL",1,8,,1.0,2/21/2016,"I hate this place, I hate it so damn much I will NEVER go back. The waitress was so rude to me when I asked her for a burger with no meat is it really that hard to just take the meat out?? And I wasn't being rude at all I swear because I know how difficult it is to work at a restaurant especially one that is busy. I ended up getting a stupid ass salad because she was like ""oh honey you have to eat something"" I hate it when people call me honey, are you my grandmother? Are you my husband? In the end I wrote IDFWU on the receipt to be childish and she called the manager, that was the best part of the night. Also I'm not the only one that thought she was being rude because my friend pointed it out first she was like ""why is she being such a bitch to you?"" It's prolly cuz of my hijab."
Chris Q.,"Chicago, IL",29,66,158,5.0,8/16/2015,"Literally I have been here like 10 times a month!! I always tired something new and loved it each time. All dishes are really delicious and bring good portion, either if you go on  lunch or dinner always get good quantity!. and our waiter was always nice to us. For a small group or big family thing, this place is great! also all cheesecake are so tasty!! loved this place.."
Dee W.,"Evanston, IL",187,1570,1299,4.0,12/19/2013,"I still love this place - definitely not much of a wait which is great when you have two hungry kids.  I wish that they had something for the kids to do such a coloring page while waiting for their food, but I do appreciate their kids menu with the side of fruit. As our first date back in 2002 was at this particular Cheesecake Factory, we returned to the scene last night in 2013 with the kids in tow.  Food was prepared well (love the size of their nachos where they don't skimp on the cheese) and brought out accordingly.  Portions are huge where we now have boxes in our fridge for perfect leftovers for the next day.  Service was great last night - loved our waiter.  Overall, I know that it's a chain but it's a solid one with large portions, good food and even better, friendly service."
Sara A.,"Glenview, IL",0,35,,1.0,5/2/2016,"OMG!!! Every time Ive eaten here they've screwed up our orders. Long story short, the food is not fresh, its frozen just microwaved. Its greasy and nasty! They've given us the wrong orders many times and they put way too much salt in their food. My shrimp had dirt on them! It was the nastiest food I've ever had. YUK!"
Janet M.,"Chicago, IL",0,29,8,3.0,3/1/2014,Long wait if you don't have reservation Food is ok but too expensive expect to pay $30 with out drinks service is bad they take to long to give your food. and the slice of cheesecake is more than $8 that is ridiculous!!!!! Oh and their chairs are horribly uncomfortable.
J H.,"Chicago, IL",0,12,,5.0,4/1/2016,Very beautiful place. I love their manu. clean place. Delicious food. Highly recommend.
Dorin L.,"Morton Grove, IL",0,6,,4.0,5/6/2015,"This is pretty close to my house and I usually come here on weekends with friends and family.  I have been here many times.  The interior is quite interesting and the seats are also comfortable.   I like to get the chicken madeira, steak, and the eggrolls.  The cheescake desert is very special and it is tasty.  One time we went for my sisters birthday on a Sunday.  It was cool when the waiters came over to our table and sand happy birthday and also brought a cake.  We enjoyed it and had a good experience that day."
John P.,"Chicago, IL",311,2,,5.0,11/17/2015,Did not have the cheesecake. The shepherds pie was outstanding. Our waiter was also very knowledgable of the menus and was very friendly.
Anisha E.,"Gainesville, FL",0,5,,1.0,6/8/2016,"I wish I could give 0 star. I had planned a baby shower months in advance with the manager, Lynn who said I could pick anything from the menu (including appetizers) to be served as meals for a lunch party. I was told we will also get the lower floor since we had estimated about 40-60 guests. I live in Florida. My best friend went to go look at the lower floor, where the party would be, and met with another manager, Michael who said that we have to cater from their brunch menu and that Lynn gave me the incorrect information. (This is more expensive). A week before the party, I went to the restaurant and met with the catering manager,Molly,  and was told that Lynn and Mike should have directly told me to contact Molly because they had given me the wrong information again. Lynn said that I could just directly work with either her or Michael. I was willing to pay more money to host the party again. A few days before the party, Molly called me and said that the bottom floor flooded and they have to give me a room that will hold 40 guests when our confirmed list was 58 and she would squeeze chairs into the room and have more seating extended in the hallway. This would look so awkward and the guests wouldn't be together. Imagine how upset I was that I was accommodating to their lack of communication again such last minute. I asked Molly to compensate something for their lack of professionalism. She knew they messed up and offered me 2 free appetizer. The next day she called me again and said that her boss didn't approve the appetizers so she has to retract them. That's something she should have discussed with her manager before offering to me. I talked to the general Manager, who was so rude, condescending  and sarcastic.  In the end, I canceled the party and held it at a different venue on 1 day notice. I would never host a party there and would advise anyone never to host their special event there.  Their staff is so unprofessional, irresponsible, inexperienced, and do not have any manners. They are just rude people and don't know what it means to be kind. I've never dealt with this much unprofessional in my life."
Bridget F.,"Wellesley, MA",6,77,32,3.0,11/29/2015,"Staff can be nice and some are conversational. Food was not impressive compared to other Cheesecake Factory locations. Croutons in the salad were stale. Fried Mac and Cheese was cold on the inside. It is one thing if all that happens on a slow night, but during an obvious busy night, seriously? Kitchen needs some help! Only reason it gets 3 stars is the server/bartender was nice. Will probably think twice before returning, because many other options in the area to try."
Jamie S.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,6,4.0,2/12/2016,"This was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory (I know, shocking) and I was really looking forward to it. Though, I have been to their sister restaurant the Grand Lux Cafe and food there was good. I had the Chicken Madeira as an entree and as dessert the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake! Both items were spectacular. Only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is their service. It was only two of us (boyfriend and I) and the waitress was sitting us in a table of four in the middle of everyone who had a booth. I questioned why she was sitting us here when there were booths available. I asked her if we could please sit at a booth and and hesitated and then said ""sure"". Then our waitress, was not cool. She talked to us with an attitude and she didn't bring us a bread basket how they are suppose to. I had to ask her and she didn't apologize for not bringing it beforehand she just said ""sure"". Despite that, food was amazing!!!"
Kristen L.,"Chicago, IL",31,124,57,1.0,11/6/2014,"Yikes. I've been here time and time again and yes, it is a chain restaurant, but I always like the food.  Last weekend, I went with a girlfriend and the food was still good, but it was the worst service I've had. When we first got there, our server came by quickly and asked we were ready.  We told her we needed a couple minutes and then she left....for 20 MINUTES.  We tried to flag her down, but never saw her.  When she finally did manage to come around, we ordered two dishes and an appetizer.  We waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, for a good 40 minutes before our appetizer came out (which was served by a different server).  Then literally two bites into our appetizer, our main dishes come out.  Once again, by a different server.  Umm..what. As we were eating, our server finally decides to come around and fill our drinks without being asked (the only perk we had all night).  Other than that, she was never to be seen, and when she came around to fill our drinks again, I quickly asked for the check, knowing she wouldn't be back for the rest of the night. Worst service.  Bar none.  If I want Cheesecake, I'll go to a different location."
John V.,"Northbrook, IL",7,18,64,5.0,1/10/2016,"Food is good, cheesecakes are awesome, and having to sit in our own little booths adds to the intimacy of eating together with my date, my wife. View of the sunny outside through a window seat on the second floor. Sweet!"
M B.,"Chicago, IL",117,6,,1.0,2/10/2016,"Management is very very rude. The waitress brought us the wrong coffee the first time, then the second time it was cold! We asked for it the third time and the manager came and told us he can't keep bringing us coffee. Well.. If you bring the right coffee we ordered and warm this wouldnt happen. We were there February 9th around 12:00 pm."
Dev S.,"Chicago, IL",34,109,52,5.0,9/18/2013,"Delicious avocado rolls, fried cheese macaroni balls, four cheese pasta, fried cheese  and yummy Red Velvet cheese cake."
Jessica L.,"Chicago, IL",3,3,29,4.0,2/6/2014,My boyfriend & I love coming here for a date night. We always try new dishes and have never been disappointed ;)  Waiting time always seems to be longer here than most places but the cheesecakes definitely make up for it. The most recent one that we've tried was the banana cream cheesecake and until this day I can't forget the taste! Mmm so yummy !
Michael N.,"Wheeling, IL",37,53,7,1.0,10/3/2014,"I think what's most upsetting about writing this review is that the Cheescake Factory of the 90's in the Chicago area is not what it is today.  Today it's like an old tired restaurant that stopped trying.  I was at the Skokie location twice in the last few months and one time it would have been on about a 3 star level in terms of food and service and the most recent really took a plummet. Mimosa's ordered for the table.  On the weak side and the strawberries in there looked as if they sat around for a week or so.  But hey, alcohol is alcohol so let's not base a 1 star review off of that...just a small contributing factor. My order of fish and fries was not good.  I would have expressed it to the waiter had he come around at some point to check in, but he didn't come around until the end.  At that time I was irritated and more or less had a full plate.  The fish was tiny and tasted burnt.  If you ask most folks, I'm not one to complain about food.  I might say it's so-so, but I'll usually still eat it and possibly give a place another shot. When the waiter returned and asked if I wanted the dish wrapped I said ""No thanks, the fish was overdone and not really edible if you can pass that to the kitchen.""  He said ""ok"" and left.  When he returned we were handed a check for all 3 of our meals.  So let's pause here for a moment...if I'm in some random grab'n go place, then my expectations are not that high.  When I'm being asked to spend $80 for lunch for 3, the expectation goes up a bit. The waiter (which I have been several times) doesn't buy the food, cook it, clean the dishes or the floors.  The waiter delivers the food and makes sure that the front of house interaction goes smoothly for the customers along with possibly wrapping silverware or marrying the ketchup.  So I would expect that when I handed back a pretty much full plate and expressed a concern, that the waiter would take some action.  He chose none of that and ignored the problem.  I still left a tip...why I'm not exactly sure, but it was just a couple bucks and well below the industry standard.  I even regret the amount I left but I basically subtracted the cost of the dish from his tip and left that. I realized from the two trips to the Skokie Cheescake Factory what they lack.  Standards.  The waiters clearly don't seem to care and it's not just from this experience.  The time prior to this visit I was with a group all I personally ordered was coffee and had to ask twice for cream, clearly a very complex ingredient.  It's the standards and attention to even to a basic service which are virtually non-existent.  It's almost painfully clear on several of the waiters faces just how much they can't wait to get out of there that day.  The only thing that could top the experience you're destined to have here is if you go home, open a frozen box of fish sticks, throw them into the fireplace for a few minutes and then have a 4 year old overloaded with muscle relaxers serve it to you.  Because at least the standards of the 4 year old would be higher."
Aunt T.,"Evanston, IL",2,21,,1.0,4/13/2016,"Bacon bits (alleged bacon bits) on the Cobb salad broke off a piece of my bridge. Not a weak or distressed tooth - a $3,000.00 bridge made of state of the art material able to withstand the pressure of an elephant standing on it (or so my dentist claims, lol). My companion had a pit of plastic wrap still adhered to his chicken (wtf?). We told the waitress about the plastic, and that something in the salad (bacon bits was the only ""hard"" item in it) broke my tooth; she just said, ""oh, would you like anything else?"". Uhm... no. No thanks. If their bacon bits (possibly mixed with parking lot gravel?) can chip a tooth, I'd rather not sample anything else from the menu that might cause bodily injury (carbolic acid soup? iced tea with ground glass in the crushed ice?). We didn't make a fuss - just got the check and said never again. NEVER again. Sorry - but I think this place is poorly run, probably has a filthy kitchen (what with broken teeth from salad and plastic stuck to the chicken not being of any surprise to the waitstaff), and their vast menu is nothing more than overpriced pre-made factory foods that anyone can microwave (ConAgra food service type stuff). There is no accountability at this place, and no real ""cooking"" being done. Unless you're so completely dead-arsed lazy you refuse to microwave a frozen entree at home, or thaw out the very same pre-made, frozen cheesecake that they do, save your $$ and ""dine"" elsewhere."
