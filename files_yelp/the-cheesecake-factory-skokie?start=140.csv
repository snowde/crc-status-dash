Paulina K.,"Evanston, IL",9,10,4,4.0,8/21/2015,"I liked the food here, this location is spacious and service is nice. Everything takes a little to long for my taste ( waiting for a service and bill is timely)."
Meghan D.,"Round Lake Beach, IL",18,28,4,1.0,3/22/2014,"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. Normally, I'm used to fast & excellent service. This was NOT the case tonight. I ordered the Chicken Costoletta & it came out cold. I asked for pasta instead of potatoes but got potatoes. Did not get my asparagus so I asked for some on the side & they gave me cold, hard asparagus. I asked for extra sauce, but none came. CLEARLY my food had been sitting in the window for quite some time.  In addition, my friend ordered the same food as me but the food was served on a dirty plate where there was spinach plastered to the plate..... yet there was no spinach anywhere in the dish.....?  The only response from the manager? He gave us one free slice of cheesecake & gave a discount on my friend's dish yet no offered of compensation for mine. As someone whose been working in restaurants for 8 years & the hotel industry, this is just NOT acceptable. SUPER disappointed in Cheesecake Factory & the management. What a poor representation of your brand & customer service!!!"
Sheryl K.,"Prospect Heights, IL",6,11,6,5.0,11/6/2014,"I love their food here! Haven't had a problem with the staff..all very attentive! When I come here, I always get the misu salmon. It is amazing! And for dessert, the Godiva cheesecake!"
Marie B.,"Chicago, IL",22,292,63,3.0,10/5/2015,"Huge menu, can be very overwhelming. A good go to chain. Good for large parties and last minute reservations since they have a large space. I love their Thai lettuce wraps, fresh & it sounds healthy. I'm not a big cheesecake girl so I didn't order it...too bad since it's a factory"
Randall K.,"Glenview, IL",52,181,18,2.0,4/17/2015,I had a group of 8 for a birthday.   Ended up here and as not really impressed.    The service was slow and the food was mediocre.   The price was not.    I do think they were understaffed for a Friday night.   Plus we had 4 little kids in the group.   There didn't seem to be a break in the cost fr the kids food.    Anyway I could try again with a smaller group of adults.    Btw.   The menu is extensive.
Amy L.,"Lindenhurst, IL",45,81,13,2.0,6/1/2015,"What happened? I use to LOVE Cheesecake Factory.  The food selection was amazing with all the variety.  The service was great. Fast forward several years.....this place is horrible now. The food quality is horrid.  Went today with my mom for a quick lunch.  I ordered an old favorite of mine - 4 cheese pasta with chicken.  It came out completely different.  It use to have chunks of fresh mozzarella, dabs of ricotta, and fresh basil sprinkled on top of the penne and marinara.  Not anymore.  For $17, I got about 1 cup of penne mixed with some nasty red sauce with hard chunks of onions and it was oddly seasoned - like  booze and spicy all in one.  The chicken, I am pretty sure was trimmed fat and yuck, because it was not even edible. My mom ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad.  She said it was okay, but nothing like the flavor it use to be. The server....where was he after we ordered??  No clue.  When he came by with the check, he asked if everything was ok?  Before we could answer is was walking away?!?! Whatever. Won't be back. Ironically when we were leaving....2 dishes were being walked back to the kitchen.... Hmmm...."
Cassie L.,"San Bernardino, CA",222,2,1,1.0,5/3/2015,This place needs to go out of business already! What should have been a nice quick mid shopping lunch turned into more than a hassle than it was worth.  Our server couldn't care less about our dining experience and messed up everything from  our drink order to our salads!  Mid meal he grabbed our iced teas to replace with the correct tropical iced teas we wanted and didn't return until well after we were done!  At that point he also brought us bread which was also very bizarre.  I followed up with management and they didn't seem to care either.  Do yourselves a favor and avoid this establishment at all costs! It doesn't even deserve 1 star!
Frank P.,"Arlington Heights, IL",0,2,,5.0,12/23/2015,Amazing service. Amazing food. Amazing atmosphere. 5 stars!!! Every time I bring my family in we get the same result. Just an overall wonderful experience.
Angelo C.,"Chicago, IL",79,240,136,3.0,10/4/2015,I chose a bistro shrimp dish that was supposed to come with a crispy battered shrimp. However I'm not a fan of fried shrimp or fried anything. I asked if I could substitute it for grilled shrimp and the waiter said sure! I just realized when I got home that there was no shrimp in my dish it was all chicken. We also have to to have the mojitos. The waiter said they come with almost two shots of rum. My friend tasted hers and said that she didn't taste any alcohol. I tasted mine and it was super strong I came to the conclusion that I might of got all the shots in mine lol. The weak drink was replaced.
Rayn P.,"Glenview, IL",1,17,,1.0,3/6/2015,"My coworkers and I placed an order for a lunch pick-up. They had us on hold for well over 10 minutes before finally getting some assistance. We decided not to make a big deal as it was lunch time and probably busy.  They said it would take 10 minutes so I left right then as we are 10 minutes away on a good day. While I took well over 10 minutes to get there due to lunch time traffic, the order was still not ready and I spent 20 minutes waiting at the restaurant.  The cashier was accommodating after the orders were put under the wrong names and they had to be refunded and re-charged. I understand that there were a couple separate checks, but that should not be difficult if you have been instructed correctly on how to take those complicated orders.  After finally getting all of the food for our orders I made it back to find some of the orders were not correct and it was cold from the time spent waiting. The lettuce in my salad was all wilted-gross. My sandwich looked like it was thrown into a to-go container. The hot food we were supposed to have fresh, was cold. There were veggies when there wasn't supposed to be veggies.  I now know to only go for the cheesecake. Which will always be scrumptious and worth every penny."
Robert S.,"Chicago, IL",162,1120,1196,3.0,3/17/2012,"They could slap a TGI Friday's sign on the front, and I'd never know the difference. If you're a country mouse, Cheesecake Factory counts as fine dining.  If you're a city mouse, the only reason you'll eat here is because you're probably desperate for something--ANYTHING--to be open late at Old Orchard Mall. Standard fried fare--typical 20 burger menu where they vary by a couple of ingredients.  Large salads, pizzas and a few halfway decent entrees for those of us of a certain age who have to worry about how much grease we want in our arteries. The schmaltzy bar downstairs is perfect for suburban cougars with their latest BoRics perm.  Upstairs, there's no place to escape the carnival-crazy paced atmosphere of servers running around desperately trying to keep up with the rapid table churn managers prefer."
Douglas B.,"Chicago, IL",91,108,92,4.0,2/25/2014,"This place has always been a place that we go to when we have no idea what I want to eat.  There really isn't a whole lot of critique here... Its a cheesecake factory and they have great service.  I've never had a bad experience here.  Usually there is a big crowd, but I think the size of the place helps to accommodate the amount of patrons that show up. Once there my wife and I typically get an Iced tea or a vodka lemonade..  depend on how sassy I feel that day.  It's usually for lunch.   we always always have to start off with the Avocado egg rolls... why you may ask.. because they are some of the most delicious things ever created by the Avocado gods.  The sweet pesto like sauce they serve with it on the side just goes so well with them... they are always on point and consistent with them.  do it!! get them! Then the entree either consists of the April special chicken salad sandwich with side salad and a soup.. . you cant go wrong... a little bit of it all.  Delicious sandwich a tasty soup and a light salad.  It fulfills lots of needs.  If I show up uber hungers... then I go for the Cuban sandwich.  I know, its not totally traditional.. but their version of it is mucho nice!   They use this slow roasted pork that is phenomenal.  The bread is crusty and toasted and has delicious goodness in between.  It is super filling.   That's usually as far as I take my cheesecake adventure.  The place is great and has not disappointed yet.  Give it a go when you cant make up your mind!  Oh and if you ever decide to sit at the bar upstairs to have a drink or lunch.. ask for GiGi!!! shell make it a great lunch, shes super cool!"
Lauren D.,"Chicago, IL",165,372,,2.0,1/31/2015,"They had several choices that were slightly under 500 calories. Prior to going here I went on-line to look at their nutritional menu. I was shocked how much sodium is in nearly every dish. I mean well over 800, and some dishes have over 1,000 or over 1,500 mg of sodium. I ordered from their Skinny-licious section, where items are under 500 calories. I had the Skinnylicious grilled turkey burger, and scraped off all the condiments on the burger. I didn't eat the bun either. The grilled turkey burger was seasoned nicely. It was moist and tender and perfectly cook. However, the black pepper overpowered the burger. For this reason, 3-stars. BTW, my turkey burger came with a small side salad with a variety of greens (no tomato, no cucumbers, nothing else) Basically, a plain and boring salad that was very, very soggy. I didn't eat the salad. However, if you order their ""regular"" Turkey Burger you will inhale 1,370 calories and 1,630 mg of sodium (salt). Definitely not a healthy choice! On the other hand, my husband ordered a double burger which was huge and a mess to eat. It was topped off with four crispy onion rings, loaded with caramelized onions, bacon, cheese and bar-b-q sauce. He said he really liked his burger and rated it with 4-stars. His burger was 1,580 calories and contained 2,990 mg of sodium. Wow, a heart attack waiting to happen! His burger came with fries. He shared a few with me, which were very good. We ended up ordering an extra side of fries without salt. The fries were the highlight of my meal.  We also ordered chicken samosas as our appetizer. Four were served, and they were very, very small and bland. The exterior was crispy, light and flaky. These samosas were served with a dipping sauce. I tasted the creamy white dipping sauce sprinkled with some tiny green specks. It was incredibly bland, and another disappointment. I was expecting these samosas to be similar to the ones we have eaten at Indian restaurants. They were not.  Here is what I walked away with when I counted 166 items on the menu with over 1,000 calories (not a typo) that made me think it must be a very unhealthy restaurant to eat. Too many calories, too much fat, too much refined carbs, too much sodium (salt).  The restaurant was not crowded or super busy considering it was Saturday. We went up the stairs to the second level and were seated immediately near large glass windows. Service was painfully slow. Our water glasses were left empty twice, so we had to keep asking our server for water (otherwise, we never would have gotten a refill on our water glasses). My husband ordered an Apple Crisp to go. I don't eat sweets, so no dessert for me. He said it was ""good"" but nothing spectacular.  This restaurant reminded me of the Rain Forest Cafe, because it is like a gimmick. The interior was gaudy and ornate. We used up our Gift Card and left our Server a generous tip (even though he was awful). Yeah, we tipped him 25%, because we didn't want to come back here again and use up the rest of our Gift Card. Lucky him!"
ray c.,"Chicago, IL",246,23,18,1.0,2/25/2015,"I typically like their food. However this location has poor customer service.  I made a reservation for a wedding rehearsal dinner months in advance.  When I called to confirm, Molly (manager) said they don't ever do reservations on Fridays after 6:00pm and that she did not mean to promise that.  I was stuck finding a venue with a private room at the very last minute.  Nothing was offered for the inconvenience she caused. I like CF, but not this location..."
Rahul G.,"Chicago, IL",22,166,,2.0,3/1/2015,"This place has gone way downhill IMO. Used to love it, but there are so many better options around. Heck, CPK in Old Orchard is better than this place. It's always a zoo here and I don't think it's justified in any way realistically. The menu is overwhelming and nothing stands out. Always hated the ads in the menu too. The last two times I went, I have not been impressed with the food I ordered. I got the enchiladas, and they were not good. This weekend, I got the Farmhouse omelette. It has potatoes in it and and they serve potatoes on the side. Too much, and I love potatoes! And the omelette itself was rubbery, not egg like at all. With so many other options in the area, I can't imagine why anyone would pick this place. Large? Prices? Meh. Good for groups? Come on now. Can do a lot better, and maybe I have been spoiled with places in the city."
Susan R.,"Pismo Beach, CA",19,13,5,1.0,8/16/2015,Came to Cheesecake Factory with 10 people. 4 out of the 10 orders was wrong. The manager brought out the replaced food without an apology. The bill came out wrong on top of that and still no apology. Oh... And we waited 45 minutes for our mediocre food before half had to be replaced. Ugh. Thank goodness for good company!
Azhar S.,"Bartlett, IL",30,90,85,5.0,7/23/2015,This is a super nice location.  It has two levels which I've never seen in a cheesecake factory. Always plenty of room and the staff is always nice.  It's always pretty chill environment.
Kristin C.,"Evanston, IL",0,7,,4.0,10/24/2015,"Initially the wait was a little long- about 15 minutes to be seated. Then, when we got to the table, it was several more minutes before we got waters of menus. Finally we got bread... Which is delicious :) Still, we were not asked if we wanted drinks or to order (appetizers, etc.) even with the bread delivery. When we were, Monica, our server, was very polite and apologetic- the place was packed and it was a little tough keeping up with it (perhaps having more wait staff is suggested). After we placed our drink and food orders, everything was delicious and ordered promptly.  My mom was visiting and it was her first time there. Despite the initial long wait, it was well worth it and the food was great. Thank you!"
Leslie N.,"Morton Grove, IL",10,2,,1.0,1/15/2016,called an order for pick up. 2 orders of chicken and biscuits and 2 slices of cheesecake. picked it up just now and the hostess days they ran out of biscuits. why didn't they tell us before we ordered? that's half the dish. didn't even offer us anything else or try to make up for it.
