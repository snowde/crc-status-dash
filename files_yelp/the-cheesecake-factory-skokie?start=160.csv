Ron A.,"Grayslake, IL",0,4,,1.0,5/14/2016,This place is pathetic. The server and manager have been dicking around a small group of high school girls since they were seated. The girls were very pleasant and having a good time and not bothering anybody yet the server and manager were intentionally being assholes. I travel for business 5 days a week and not chance will a Cheesecake Factory see me or my family in one of their restaurants again.
Margo R.,"Chicago, IL",0,9,,1.0,5/27/2016,Apparently on Saturdays they don't take reservations even for big parties because thats one of their busiest days of the week. So you mean to tell me you expect 20 people to just sit around for 2 hours and wait for like 6 tables to open up? Just stupid.
Freddy M.,"Irving Park, Chicago, IL",19,15,,4.0,4/18/2015,"Love the Pasta DaVinci and have never had a bad waiter, a nice place to go for a Friday Dinner but maybe not so much for an anniversary dinner, it can get pretty noisy"
Natasha R.,"Riverwoods, IL",158,211,686,4.0,9/11/2012,"Out of all the chain restaurants that are not LEYE, Cheesecake has to be my favorite one. Everything is always so delicious, either eating inside or carryout. This ends up being our default restaurant to order from when doing family dinners at home, though we order from the Lincolnshire location since it's closer. I recently dined here, and have to say that I like this location a whole lot more. Mainly two reasons why I like it more, since the quality and taste of the food is primarily the same. This location doesn't have the ""Lincolnshire vibe"" (I am sure some know what I am referring to when I say that) and I the interior is so beautiful and a lot more spacious. I haven't been to any other locations, so I am just judging between these two.  Food - LOVE both the dark and white bread that they give out, esp with butter. Mmm so good, but it fills you up before the real food is served! My favorite dish is the Chicken Madeira which is under their specialties. It's pricey, but it's a HUGE portion and the melted mozzarella cheese on the chicken is absolutely incredible. I've tried three or four of the salads, all are great! Basically, I've never experienced anything bad, nor has any of the people I've dined with. I try to stay away from the cheesecake, but I can admit to having tried it just a couple times and it's always unbelievably good and bad at the same time... can't even imagine how many calories are in once slice! The two I've tried are the red velvet and pumpkin - can't go wrong with those two flavors... EVER!  Regardless of the cheesecakes, the food is what I come here for, and I know I will  be back because I have yet to have a bad experience!"
Heather A.,"Chicago, IL",13,26,,5.0,4/6/2015,"I love cheesecake factory.  Many of my favorite memories have happened here.  Great drinks, perfectly cooked cuisines of all kinds and a very Greek/Egyptian themed decor just make this a suburban dining gem.  Yes, I may frequent the Old Orchard mall more than I should but it's the food that keeps me coming back.  Oh, and the cheesecake is the bomb."
Narmen Y.,"Sterling Heights, MI",0,10,,5.0,5/15/2016,"The best service the best food loved everything, the salmon was excellent cooked loved there drinks."
Natalie S.,"Des Plaines, IL",25,14,29,5.0,7/9/2014,"I really don't know where to start when it comes to the Cheesecake Factory. I tried it for the first time around 6 years ago and I couldn't believe what I had been missing. I am such a fan.  Important points: 1) This is a GREAT place for pasta lovers. Seriously, you don't know what you are missing. ~(The shining star dish is the Louisiana Pasta, which is divine. Crispy breaded chicken on top, bow-tie pasta with a spicy Cajun sauce and small bits of mushrooms and red peppers. They must put some type of drug in this dish because it is that addictive. Also, the Farfalle pasta is to die for. Bow-tie pasta in a roasted garlic-Parmesan cream sauce with a medley of peas, caramelized onions, tomatoes, and tender chicken pieces. My boyfriend and I always have a deeply internal conflict with choosing one over the other, haha. We always end up getting one for him and the other for myself, and then sharing them both. They are both that good. The Evelyn's pasta is also delicious (penne with broccoli, dried tomatoes, roasted eggplant, peppers, artichoke, Kalamata olives, garlic and pine nuts.) My mom is obsessed with that one.)~ 2) The portions are ENORMOUS. I am a distance runner and have the appetite of a horse, and twice I have made it my goal to finish my entree, but have yet to make it happen. Maybe because I pig out on so much bread beforehand? Also, the pasta tastes just as amazing the next day! 3) Going off of the second point, the bread is AMAZING! You get both sour dough and pumpernickel. It is so fresh and soft that it just melts in your mouth. The bread is almost as exciting as the meal itself. Also, they bring you as much as you want. The only thing I always find irritating is how difficult the butter is to spread because they take it straight from a fridge, but no complaints.  4) I know that I probably do not need to emphasize this...but the cheesecake is heaven on earth. I love cheesecake and this is the place to get it. I have tried so many different flavors, but my favorite is definitely the red velvet. It is enormous and so rich and delicious. The Godiva cheesecake is so deep and rich, great for lovers of rich cocoa. The oreo cheesecake is great, Reese's peanut butter cheesecake is amazing and huge, dulce de leche is smooth and creamy, banana cheesecake is heavenly. Can you tell I have been here a few times? Haha.  5) The prices at this restaurant make it somewhere to go more for a special occasion. I go here for birthdays (which they have always made special by decorating a plate with strawberry sauce and adorning it with a massive slice of cheesecake 0:]), graduations, anniversaries, that type of thing. Definitely not your casual, Friday night type of budget. When my boyfriend and I go, we get two entrees and a dessert to share (and sometimes a soda), and it is always right around $50. So totally worth it.  6) The food is ALWAYS a hit, but it is true that the service can SOMETIMES be a miss. We have definitely had more good experiences than bad, but if you do get a slow server (won't bring out the bread right when you get there), just ask for it. It has never been a big deal. The staff has always been friendly to us, and never slow enough to be aggravating.  *I think it is important to warn that I do not recommend this restaurant for much besides the pasta. The prices just do not justify their other options, in my opinion. My brother felt like being a king, so he ordered the $25 steak, and was not impressed. I am not a steak lover, but do admit that thing was tiny for what he paid. He received a side of fries with it. Just not worth 25 dollars. Go to Longhorn for that. For pasta though, I insist, you will not find better pasta in bigger portions anywhere else. Best place ever. I have also heard rave reviews about their fried mac n cheese, but have never tried it myself. I love this place! Please give it a try on your special day! And don't leave without getting cheesecake! So worth every penny!"
Mikey J.,"San Francisco, CA",360,324,19,3.0,8/20/2011,"Came here with a crew after eating Hecky's turkey legs.  Yes, we were foolish enough to have cheesecake after devouring enormous sticks of meat. Now, I've been here before and have always had a decent time.  I have also had the cheesecake before and was satisfied, but remembered that the slices were incredibly rich and filling. There were four of us, and, recalling the size of the slices, I recommended splitting 2 or 3 pieces at most between the three of us.  But no.  I was vetoed down.  Damn democracy does not work when the parties are uninformed! So we each ended up getting a slice.  Four slices total.  First through fifth bites were excellent.  Then it started to go downhill from there.  Of course, as expected, we reached our limit and began to struggle, I mean really struggle, to finish our slices.  Delicious as they were, by the end we were filled with only feelings of shame and ""Holy shit my stomach is too full, please no more.""  It's like in a crowded train, where two hefty riders are trying to squeeze into those tiny seats next to each other.  The riders are too big, the seats too small.  There is no room.  Now replace the train with your stomach, and the riders with a turkey leg and big ass cheesecake slice. Now you may be scolding us in your head thinking, ""Well it's your fault for eating a turkey leg, then going all crazy and getting cheesecake on top of that.""  Well, you're right.  But it's not an unimaginable situation, as many people eat dinner at the Factory first, then go on to dessert. In economic terms, what happened to us is called diminishing marginal returns.  Layman speak: You'd pay a lot to eat that first bite of cheesecake and boy is it worth it.  By the second or third bite, the amazingness begins to subside.  Keep going and soon enough, you'd actually pay to NOT eat another slice. So be warned!  Damn good cheesecake.  But split that richness with a friend. Or two."
Elly R.,"Chicago, IL",0,13,3,4.0,8/28/2015,"I went there a week ago for my first time and I liked it. Good service, nice place and  Cheesecakes look and taste AWESOME!"
Suby B.,"Northbrook, IL",105,22,,5.0,7/19/2014,"Super delicious food, service, amazing complimentary bread.   Amazing portions to be shared. I love the skinny miso glazed salmon meal under 600 calories and its so filling!!!!!!"
Sameer R.,"Schaumburg, IL",3,83,,3.0,6/6/2015,"I think for the price the food should taste better. Quantity means nothing if the dish tastes good one time and different a second visit. Service is awesome tho, nice staff."
Jesse M.,"Palatine, IL",104,117,244,4.0,3/13/2014,First time having dinner at cheese cake factory. I got the Spicy Chicken Sandwich with spicy mayo. I've always heard this place was ok. After my first bite I loved it! That spicy mayo tasted so good I wanted to get up and dance! No really it was by far the best spicy mayo I've ever had.
Edward R.,"Chicago, IL",7,41,28,5.0,5/9/2015,"This place has the best chicken belagio! The prices are reasonable, the dining area is very relaxing and the staff is very attentive to your needs. Not to mention they have an amazing cheesecake selection!"
Patti L.,"South Side, Chicago, IL",134,132,267,3.0,10/31/2013,Come for the dessert. The food is good but a bit pricey. Definitely can't go wrong with 2 pages of cheesecake. The Godiva Cheesecake it to die for!!!
Georgiana P.,"Chicago, IL",1,21,2,5.0,2/15/2015,I love this place and the environment!  The cheesecake is delicious! The waiters are always nice and have smiles on their face!
Gina K.,"Houston, TX",291,409,444,4.0,6/1/2011,"Their menu has more than 300 items on it so this review is just for the Sunday brunch service which is available only on Sunday till 2pm.  Darn it.  I wish it was an option on other days because really I see nothing wrong with a  little Lemon Ricotta Pancake on Tuesday.  Lemony and rich and sweet.  It's brilliant  Or a Baja Chicken Hash on a Wednesday! Though there were 2 generous mounds on 2 tortillas, one was all I needed.  Great balance of flavors and texture.  I don't even want to think of how many hours in the gym it'll cost me. Cheesecake Factory, all i'm saying is add one of  your Sunday brunch items as a daily special.  Would that be so terrible?  =D"

If you live in Chicago and are interested in driving a few minutes away. The Cheesecake Factory on old orchard is definitely a good place to check out!! The jambalaya is great, but my personal FAV is the bow tie pasta with meat sauce!!!  Also there children's menu for the kids gives a nice selection!"
