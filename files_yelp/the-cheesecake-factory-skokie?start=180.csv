t p.,"San Jose, CA",2,143,15,3.0,2/11/2016,Guac was a bit too spicy and corn cakes were just ok. Better off getting the arugula or asparagus salad and pasta.
Jessica K.,"Augusta, GA",366,1203,1284,3.0,3/24/2009,"This place has been consistently good since the first time I've been here at the tender age of 10. Ever since I was a small child, it's been a birthday tradition to get a very tall strawberry shortcake and have Oliver, an aspiring opera singer sing a ""Happy Birthday"" that shook the house down. Literally, people clapped. I come now many years after my very first ""Happy Birthday"" shortcake with sprinkles and I find comfort in this Cheesecake Factory-my first Cheesecake Factory. The food's the same, the servers look the same, the bakery with the exception of a number of missing spots in the bakery case looks the same. If they'd bring back the dumpling, I'd be frequently that case more often but that's another story all together. I love how the portions haven't changed, the same staples like the Jambalaya or the Fried Mac and Balls haven't changed a bit. Someday when I have kids, I can show them exactly what mommy grew up on and what exactly have her the infamous ""fat years."" Oh yes, those little suckers will eating at the Cheesecake Factory quite sparingly thank you very much. I notice it's gotten a lot quieter around those parts though. Case in point, at 8 p.m. on a Tuesday night during spring break there was NO wait. In fact there was quite a number of tables open. The bread was hard and not cut into at all and there were a number of servers running back and forth talking not about dressings or what a table needed but sidework.  The food was good, the bread could have been a little more fresh but overall, the service was mediocre and the dessert was not something to miss."
Aika C.,"Chicago, IL",16,5,,5.0,8/7/2014,All my friends in California and Illinois love The Cheesecake Factory restaurants. I'm a Muslim. Last week when we went to this spot everything was yummy as always. But the lady that was serving us took really good care of us!!! For the first time she has asked do we eat meal with alcohol. And of course not. And was helping us to choose meals with no alcohol. She is such an angel.
Chris C.,"Chicago, IL",6,36,13,4.0,12/31/2013,"Great place - very good food across the board, and great for kids. Staff is very accommodating.  And yes, the wait can get insane. In other news, Chicago is cold in the winter. Don't wait if you can't handle it..."
Jack S.,"Skokie, IL",2,6,13,1.0,2/7/2015,"I don't usually write reviews, but this place is just wayyyy to ridiculous. We wanted to celebrate my cousins bday here on a Sat., for a party of 17. So we called on Friday to make a reservation, and was told they don't take reservations on Saturdays. That's fine, so we arrived on Sat. And was told it will take about an hr and 10 mins while a bunch of parties of 3-5 get seated immediately. So I asked the server why does it take so long, has their party room been used? The server said, the room is not being used today.... And I'm like ugh this is not logical. So u don't take our reservation, making us to wait for more than hour, while the party room. Is empty........ I duno what to say but they really don't know how to run a business!"
Kris G.,"Skokie, IL",1,41,,2.0,6/15/2014,"Food is very good, but I am sick of the poor service -  consistently. They probably don't care because the place is always packed, but I am done.  Waiter was almost hostile, when he finally came 10 minutes after we were seated.  There are better places to eat and much better service elsewhere."
Andrea Nagle R.,"Des Plaines, IL",11,24,,4.0,1/24/2015,Wow the menu is so big!  Way to many choices.  Good food.  Reasonable prices. Nice atmosphere.
Kent B.,"Chicago, IL",11,198,34,3.0,2/21/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is located on the east side of Old Orchard Shopping Center. Parking is always an issue here, even though they have a lot of off-street parking. The restaurant is on the second floor and up two flights of stairs. There must be an elevator, but I didn't  notice one. Four of us came for dinner and we were seated in a room that would accommodate about 30-people. We had two female servers. They were polite, but a bit overly attentive and uncoordinated. The menu is a large, comb bound, full-color thing peppered with advertisements for other stores in the shopping center. Seemed a bit tacky to me even though I was eating in a mall restaurant. I ordered Chicken Bellagio ($14.95), which included two pieces of pounded and battered chicken covered in prosciutto and arugula. This was served on a bed of basil pesto spaghetti (smothered in olive oil). The food was delicious and served on a very hot plate. However, the oil soaked spaghetti made me nauseous for well into the next morning. I don't want to know how many calories I consumed. I've been to the Cheesecake Factory before, but it had been a few years. I'll probably be back--in a few years."
Kat L.,"Chicago, IL",381,351,494,3.0,7/5/2011,"I do like cheesecake factory, but I think this particular location gets a little too crowded and a little too snobby for my taste. My friend tried to make a reservation over the phone for her birthday dinner, which they did not accept. When I came with her early to place our party on the list, we were greeted with a whole ton of attitude; I overheard one of the hostesses saying, ""well they shouldn't have such a large party."" EXCUSE ME?!?!?! Yes, the food is good. But yes, the food is also overpriced with a ridiculously long wait. Waiters don't come by often enough and provide very good service. Kinda nonchalant, kinda 'too busy."" I really enjoy the hibachi steak for an entree... but of course, the cheesecake dessert varieties are the star"
Nina G.,"Chicago, IL",138,106,117,4.0,6/17/2011,"I hate that the menu is so big because it doesn't help when you're indecisive. This place is hit or miss. I noticed that alot of the dishes can be bland so I will make it easy and tell you whats good: Tex Mex egg rolls- Why do I love you so? I have to get these EVERY time. so good. Fried Mac & Cheese- Yummy and I don't even care for mac & cheese Chicken & biscuits-Very tasty if you are in a country lovin' mood Tamale-Melt in your mouth deliciousness Sante Fe Salad-The most delicious salad that I have ever eaten and this is probably because of the unusual dressing. Peanut Cilantro. It extremely good and I hate cilantro. Who knew? shrimp bacon club-meh, okay. too saucy. shrimp are smaller than expected. Small shrimp creep me out for some reason.  Thats about as far as I got with the menu. Try those you will like them. :)"
Carolyn H.,"Seattle, WA",19,143,37,3.0,7/8/2014,"I am a huuuuuuuuge fan of Cheesecake Factory. I appreciate everything from the phenomenal service to bread to entrees and obviously the cheesecake. However, this last experience kind of sucked. Our server was extremely inattentive. He said he would be back in two minutes to take our order, it took 12. After that he said he would be back with some bread, that took just over 15 minutes. The food we ordered came out less than 5 minutes after the server brought our bread. To top it all off, he said he would be back with more water and that just never even happened. He brought our bill before bringing water."
Olive R.,"Denver, CO",30,197,5,2.0,3/11/2014,"Rude staff, slow service, bad food."
J C.,"New York, NY",7,32,3,1.0,6/11/2012,"So, my friends are obsessed with this place. I have no idea why. It's weird because we usually dine at pretty upscale restaurants, and The CF is pretty much an amalgamation of all that we despise when it comes to dining. It really is a ""factory,"" serving mass-produced, bastardized versions of various cuisines and poorly executed American dishes. And yet, it tries to sell itself as some kind of ""fine dining"" experience, which really is quite delusional on their part. I went here for the first time in 10 years last week, and I was bluntly reminded as to why I had stayed away from this place for so long. First off, it took 20 minutes before a waiter even noticed us. Mind you, this was at 2 p.m. when the restaurant was two-thirds empty. When our server finally took our orders and got us water, she asked us if we wanted any bread. Um, we've been sitting here for over a half hour, and you ASK us if we wanted FREE bread? What did you think we were going to say? Too bad the bread was so dry I almost wish I had said ""No"" when she asked. I ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta lunch plate, which was described as what would be a ""normal portion at another restaurant."" It was huge, and I really wish it weren't. The chicken was dry, the sauce tasted like thousand island dressing and wasn't spicy enough, and the pasta was severely undercooked. Terrible food, questionable service, tacky decor. If you have any ounce of appreciation for good food, avoid this entire franchise like the plague."
Edward I.,"Chicago, IL",0,17,,5.0,1/1/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. I enjoy the food, the ambiance, and the constant hustle and bustle no matter what hour of the day you visit. We typically order a bunch of appetizers to try to save room for dessert. Even then we are not always successful since we like so many of the appetizers. The summer rolls and lettuce wraps are particularly good. For dessert, I am partial to the warm apple crisp."
Maria R.,"Streamwood, IL",173,77,441,4.0,4/4/2011,"Ahhhh Cheesecake Factory.....*sigh*  I love Cheesecake Factories as a whole, cheesecake notwithstanding. This particular location is built into the popular Westfield Old Orchard Shopping Center in Skokie, IL.  It's a bi-leveled restaurant that is nicely decorated in a art deco/egyptian style. I always like to bring my mom here for our mom-daughter lunch dates as they have a variety of dishes to choose from.  Oh, and when I say a VARIETY I mean a V-A-R-I-E-T-Y......ALL Cheesecake Factories....ALL of them have HUGE menus! It's like NOT a Cheesecake Factory if you don't have a huge menu. It's 20 appetizers that span like 2-3 pages of their menu, then they have the different sections which are about 1-2 pages each (ex: Pasta, Favorites, Salads/Soups, etc.). So, if you are bringing a large group, chances are, you'll find something for everyone at the Cheesecake Factory. As a whole, Cheesecake Factories (I've only been to the Old Orchard one and the Schaumburg one at least in Illinois.)  tend to be pretty consistent with their dishes.  Whomever they employ as chefs for their various restaurants, do not deviate from their standard.  This particular restaurant chain is based out of California and you can tell by a lot of its fairly healthy dishes.  They have dishes that aren't exactly healthy, but you know what I mean! :) The one thing I do not like about this Cheesecake Factory and not that I don't need it, is the stairs to the main dining area on the second floor.  Yes, yes, before you tell me, there IS a elevator at the back of the restaurant, but the intiial mode of transport to the upper level is the stairs.   Now, mind you, I am not the athletic type, far from it, but my mom had a time climbing those steps.  Whomever designed this was I guess going for aesthetically pleasing because the glass window that covers those stairs looks out onto the parking lot and DOES give this Cheesecake Factory a monolithic feel. BUT, I digress....it is minor. :) I just thought I'd mention it for this particular location. :)  Anyway, back to the food and service...the service is great.  Friendly and attentive staff.  We got seated pretty quickly during their lunch rush and our server was quick to take our order.  We got our yummy honey wheat and sourdough bread with butter right away. The one thing I love about Cheesecake Factories that even though they are a chain...they actually change their menus regularly.  They DO keep some of the more popular dishes, but they also add in some new and interesting ones. For an appetizer, we had the Crispy Artichoke Hearts, which my mom commented on enjoying quite a bit.   They came with a remolade, which gave it an added lemon taste to it.  I enjoyed the appetizer as it was tasty and the dip that came with it really added to it. My mom had the Tomato-Basil Pasta, while I kept it ""healthy"" with their Chinese Chicken Salad and their special soup of the day.  The soup was very delicious and the salad is as I remember it from having it many times before. (Consistency! WOO!) We skipped the cheesecake, but if you haven't had their cheesecake before....go get a piece!  My ABSOLUTE favorite is their Red Velvet Cheesecake as I am a total fan of red velvet cake, and pair it with cheesecake. O M G, you will like have a dessertgasm with this one!  My other favorites are the Banana Cheesecake and the sinfully dense, Reese Peanut Cup cheesecake. Heck, ANY cheesecake with chocolate and peanut butter will send you into an instant dessert-coma. :)  But...it's TOTALLY worth it!   Take it with you or eat it there....it's your choice! Overall, I like this location and afterward, you can walk around the mall to work off the cheesecake you just ate. ;)"
Ted C.,Hong Kong,367,1634,1705,2.0,3/1/2011,"My cousins wanted to eat here and since they're so cute I couldn't say no, even though I don't really like this place. A friend of mine put it succinctly it's 'Chili's' for people with too much money. Their menu has a huge range but nothing in it is really any good. A lot of the stuff they have can easily be found elsewhere for cheaper-e.g. the popcorn shrimp which we got as a starter. Okay, but nothing spectacular.  Likewise the green chili burger I got was actually pretty underwhelming. The burger was tough, and the chiles were rather bland. I would have asked for hot sauce but our waiter was hard to find. He stopped by 3 times and the rest of the time I asked whoever dropped off our food for anything else.  The cheesecake was okay, I went with the Snickers cheesecake but it was just meh that day."
Abdul Y.,"Chicago, IL",3,25,,5.0,4/27/2014,"Alright so I haven't ever sat down and ate here but a couple nights ago after eating at Papacito's, I decided to go with my friend because she wanted to get their cheesecake but I was told by my brother that Muslims can't eat their cakes because they contain gelatin. HOWEVER, they made my night when upon my friend's inquiry - the manager told us that the beef gelatin in their cakes is halal gelatin which is something they started doing once they opened up locations in other countries such as Dubai because they wanted the people their to be able to eat their cakes, so yay!!! This is a pretty big deal for me because cake is one my top 3 favorite foods (along with cookies and mitthai) and I try my best to eat only halal food. SO, I had the oreo cheesecake and it was awesome! My friend had her usual godiva cheesecake and loved it! The person working the register was nice enough to make two trips to the back to inquire from the manager and the manager was nice enough to come out and tell us."
Javier M.,"Evanston, IL",17,21,4,3.0,10/10/2014,Place is pricey. Meals are for two people. Also the restrooms are only in the front. Bad luck if your sitting all the way in the back.
Dan M.,"The Loop, Chicago, IL",0,22,,3.0,11/18/2015,"This review is based on one visit. We stopped by to have dinner on a Sunday night. This may explain why several dishes were not available. In addition, some of the dishes that did arrive missed ingredients. How can you forget to add guacamole when it is a major part of a dish?  In addition, the service was very slow. Still, I give it three stars because they have an assortment of cheese cakes, and I simply love cheesecakes. If you are not a cheese cake lover, better options are available"
Jamie H.,"Chicago, IL",7,11,13,4.0,10/3/2010,"I have always liked coming here. I find their pasta, shrimp and steak is really delicious. The chicken is too fatty for my tastes but my friend really enjoyed it. Of course you don't come here for the food, you come here for the cheesecake! Their cheesecakes are quite delicious with many interesting combinations and flavors. Each piece is big enough to feed two people! The place can get loud and crowded but the service remains great."

This is a pretty big deal for me because cake is one my top 3 favorite foods (along with cookies and mitthai) and I try my best to eat only halal food. SO, I had the oreo cheesecake and it was awesome! My friend had her usual godiva cheesecake and loved it! The person working the register was nice enough to make two trips to the back to inquire from the manager and the manager was nice enough to come out and tell us."

Dan M.,"The Loop, Chicago, United States",0,22,,3.0,18/11/2015,"This review is based on one visit. We stopped by to have dinner on a Sunday night. This may explain why several dishes were not available. In addition, some of the dishes that did arrive missed ingredients. How can you forget to add guacamole when it is a major part of a dish?  In addition, the service was very slow. Still, I give it three stars because they have an assortment of cheese cakes, and I simply love cheesecakes. If you are not a cheese cake lover, better options are available"
Jamie H.,"Chicago, United States",7,11,13,4.0,3/10/2010,"I have always liked coming here. I find their pasta, shrimp and steak is really delicious. The chicken is too fatty for my tastes but my friend really enjoyed it. Of course you don't come here for the food, you come here for the cheesecake! Their cheesecakes are quite delicious with many interesting combinations and flavors. Each piece is big enough to feed two people! The place can get loud and crowded but the service remains great."
