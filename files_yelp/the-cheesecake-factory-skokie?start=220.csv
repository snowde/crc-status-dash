Christina S.,"Mt Prospect, IL",31,70,14,4.0,3/2/2014,"The food is pretty good.I had a grilled chicken burrito with sour cream, guacamole, and black   wad delicious and huge ate half and was full so I got left overs for tomorrow lunch. The bread and butter is delicious. I had a strawberry daiquiri and it was really good. My cheesecake of choice was the snickers cheesecake and I absolutely loved it."
Kamil M.,"Chicago, IL",24,32,14,4.0,4/23/2014,Cesar salad as appetizer is a must. Main course grilled Salmon yummy
Mariam S.,"Highwood, IL",70,66,20,3.0,12/25/2013,The avocado rolls are my favorite. They  also have good salmon but this is not the best food place you can find in this price range. Customer service is also not very consistent but not a bad pick if you are tired of shopping and hungry.
Scott G.,"Wilmette, IL",0,4,,4.0,4/10/2015,"I think this place is pretty darn good!  I have things to do in the mall, and often sit at the small upstairs bar there, read the paper, have lunch and a cocktail.  Their Mushroom Burger is really tasty as the mushrooms are ""marsala"" style and have a sweetness to them. The burger itself is fresh and tasty, and I accompany it with a small caesar salad instead of fries.  A nice meal. I also am a fan of the chicken madeira, which is consistently good every time.  Staff is always nice and the food comes out in a timely fashion.  Compared to other available options which range from really good (Blaze Pizza) , to good (Maggianos) to poor (Uncle Julios), to vomit inducing (Buffalo Wild Wings) Cheesecake Factory is a good choice."
Lia O.,"Chicago, IL",0,22,,1.0,1/23/2016,"Ordered a cheesecake to go. Salesperson did not show me the cake (that's their policy). I got home, it had about a half inch of frost on it and was freezer burnt. Disgusting, never again. When I called to complain, the manager was not very helpful, seemed annoyed, she could offer a gift certificate, as if I would go back, or to replace it if I drove 40 minutes back to the restaurant. After some back and forth, she became more agreeable and apologetic and took my number, but not my name or card info to call me back to process the refund. She left a voicemail a half hour later saying a refund had been processed. Several days later, the transaction had not come off my card and was no longer pending. When I called the restaurant, another manager insisted it had been refunded and it would drop off. I explained that it was not pending anymore and that I work in financial services and understand authorization holds - this was not an authorization hold. He insisted it had been refunded, and read me the last 4 of the card refunded - not my card - they asked me repeatedly if I had used a different card. I had not. Turns out, goofball manager #1 had pulled up a receipt for the type of cheesecake I had ordered and refunded it, without confirming any info. Good job. Goofball manager #2 laughed about the fact that someone else got a freebie and promised to look into it. On the next call he was able to find my receipt and process a refund. Did I say never again? NEVER. AGAIN."
George J.,"Chicago, IL",66,148,49,3.0,11/23/2013,"I like Cheesecake Factory from time to time and this location is huge and pretty accommodating, friendly staff and clean. I think this place is great for appetizers but everything else in my opinion is a little overpriced for what it is, simple food. My personal favorites are the Avocado Egg Rolls and for pasta I love their Chicken Picata"
Laura P.,"Des Plaines, IL",0,12,3,2.0,7/27/2013,"This is a depressing review to write, because both my boyfriend and I love the food here, but we keep having weird things happen here and it's going to be a long time before I want to come back. Our first weird experience was having the fire alarm go off right after we had our dinner served. Granted, not their fault, but a sucky experience trying to pay for our food quickly and taking home fried fish and chips. Shortly after that, I had a nice chunk of plastic in my pulled pork sandwich. At least they comped it. Tonight we had a little booth next to the wall outside the kitchen. Shortly after we got our drinks, we noticed a little fruit fly darting around our table. A few minutes later, we noticed that there were about 8 of them on the wall right above our heads. Gross. It looked like there was something sticky on the wall. We probably should have just left, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt and we had already ordered our dinner and were really looking forward to dinner there. We moved to a booth on the other side of the aisle and were served our dinner. When we were about halfway done, someone went over to the original booth and started wiping down the wall - well guess what happens when you disturb the fruit flies? They fly around to other areas! The manager came over to offer us free desserts, but first, I don't eat dessert and second, I was done at that point. The manager came over literally 3 times to try to make us take the free desserts to the point that was annoying. When we were done, the waitress said she was working with the manager to get something off our bill, and then it took another 10 minutes sitting there before we ever got the bill and nothing was comped. We were so over it by that point, that we just paid it and left. Next time we'll go to CPK."
Tita P.,"Chicago, IL",146,252,,3.0,12/30/2010,"Living in Chicago affords you the opportunity to visit local bars and restaurants.  Prior to moving to the ""Big City"" I visited my share of chain restaurants.  The Cheesecake Factory continues to be one of my favorites.   Well, they are one of my favorites for their brunch on Sunday.   The coffee is strong, the eggs are fluffy and the atmosphere is great.  I don't get an opportunity to enjoy it as often as I like since I don't live in the burbs but each time I go its just plain ole yummy.   Hmmm...maybe a Sunday drive to the burbs is not a bad idea."
Shiungor V.,"Chicago, IL",0,14,,3.0,3/24/2015,"Used to get the avocado egg roll and Lettuce wrap. But both have tasted different the last few visits. The Cheesecake is decent obviously, but the price point for a slice is not worthy since Eli's is so closeby to me."
Lala S.,"Chicago, IL",187,212,12,4.0,6/9/2011,"My boyfriend was in shock when I revealed that I had never ate here before. I've drank here before but just never ate. This place is awesome. They have an extensive menu that is sure to please anyone with any particular craving. I was a little overwhelmed by the menu, but everything sounded tasty.  We started out with their Tex-Mex Eggrolls. These were delicious. They were much tastier than their counterparts at Chili's. The quality of the ingredients definitely shined through. For my entree, I got the Chicken Meidera and Shrimp Scampi. The Chicken was delicious. The Scampi was also good but wasn't exactly my idea of scampi."
Tony C.,"IL, IL",338,118,1,5.0,2/11/2013,"Well I was reading this article in the bathroom of a k Mart when I got a hankering for a nice soft smooth piece of mouth watering cheesecake so I finished my article and started this amazing journey to the cheesecake factory. I got on my bike with my Mickey mouse helmet and my care bear boots and I pedaled like a kid running for a ice cream truck. After 45 hard working minutes I arrived. Yes I was hot and sweaty ,but I got to the promise land. I asked my waiter buck for the turtle cheesecake and sat there and enjoyed the greatest gift to ever land on my tongue! Dreams do come true thank you cheesecake gods."
Chantal M.,"Chicago, IL",34,11,,2.0,2/7/2016,"Food is great and I'd give 5, customer service is superb  but it's the safety of the place which made me give 2 stars. We've been celebrating birthdays in this place and I'd always come back and be satisfied. But this weekend has been terrible for me and this coming week since I came here , I believe it's a n accident and none of their fault if they could have at least sturdy had stable chairs and not so slippery floors. Me and my baby 17 mos fell on the floor as I tried to sit down holding the baby to put his shoes and the chair ( rattan light ) slipped away me and my poor butt landed on the floor. It was hard to get up and painful back has limited me from every bit of mobility I have and plans this Sunday were all cancelled.The manager was nice to help , they had a nurse to help and all and willing to call paramedics but I just would like to increase awareness to everyone especially old people to be careful in the chairs( movable ones) I'm not sure if I can work this week and will be seeing my doctor tomorrow to make sure I didn't have fracture or hurt myself badly as in in pain to not be able to move comfortably. I'm just glad that mom wasn't sitting on the same chair I did. I hope they put some anti skid in the chairs or something to make it safer. I really pray I didn't hurt my back bad."
Malorie D.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,2.0,12/13/2013,I love the Cheesecake Factory but this service at this particular location BLOWS. Unless you enjoy 45 minutes for a salad
Jimmy J.,"Morton Grove, IL",20,366,98,1.0,3/21/2013,"Service here is the worst. Terrible hiring, training even worse. Waiter last time we went gave me so much attitude from the get go, i straight em told him get the fuck out of my face, or am gonna kick your ass in front of all these people. Managers here are weak. They have zero skill at distinguishing between valid legit criticisms about their staff from rational people and wack job bullshitters. AVOID"
Natalie B.,"Wilmette, IL",28,247,,2.0,11/16/2012,"This restaurant frustrates me every single time. But there are limited options at Old Orchard for sit down meals so we inevitably end up here once every couple of months.Although this is a family friendly restaurant they hardly know how to handle families with kids. A few hints: 1)  take order immediately, 2) when parent asks for the check as soon as meal is brought please honor that request and bring the bill, 3) then actually stop by and pick up the check that has had the credit card sticking out of it for the past 10 minutes. Added bonus-I always discover a sneaky charge on the bill that I am not in the mood to contest, This past week I was asked if I wanted milks with my children's meals, to which I replied, only if it comes with it, otherwise water is fine (bc my kids hardly drink milk with meals). Three milks came and I was charged 1.75 for two of those (my kids split one meal). I also requested a kids turkey sandwich (not on the menu) and was told no problem. The waitress brought a huge sandwich fit for a grown man, not a 27lb 3 year old and then was charged $9. Had the waitress told me that wasnt available but I could order the adult meal, I still would have done so, however I felt that was sneaky and was seriously annoyed. However given the lack of other choices at Old Orchard I'll most likely dine in yet again, and be irritated once more."
S P.,"Chicago, IL",1,48,1,1.0,7/31/2012,"If I wanted to pay to be sick I would eat insects in the jungles of Costa Rica...  I haven't been here in a while because somehow I forgot what happened the first time; I ordered spinach cheese dip and I thought they were trying to poison me... since the spinach tasted so old and spoiled. After the manager apologized, they brought a popcorn shrimp dish... nice try but that was gross as well. So after forgetting the disgust I felt years ago, I came back to try the cheesecake... I figured a place that had ""cheesecake"" in the name would have good cheesecake.  WRONG.  Not only did our waiter win the asshole of the month award by a long shot, but the cheesecake was enough to turn off even the more gluttonous stomach.  After waiting 15  minutes for the asshole waiter to get to our table, I told him we were ready to order and just having desserts... Which was my first mistake, because that's when his attitude started... God forbid anyone comes to the cheesecake factory wanting nothing more than cheesecake.  I asked him a normal question, ""Be honest, is your latte good"", his answer, ""It tastes like a latte""... thanks asshole I was imagining it tasted like orange juice. Then we waited another 15 minutes (apparently it's a whole ordeal to slice a piece of cake and throw some coffee in a cup)  Well I should have thrown the latte back in his face, because it tasted like hot garbage, which should be a crime since it cost more than it would at Starbucks.  Next came the cheesecake, which tasted like it sat around for a good week before we were served.  I think they should cut down their menu and focus on making good quality food, instead of offering an array of throw-up worthy, spoiled garbage.  They should also re-train their waiters.  This place is overpriced for the crap that it is, and I will never come back. You would have to pay me to eat there because my stomach felt like it was on fear factor.  So if you like feeling like someone is trying to kill you, and you want a waiter who is going to be highly unpleasant the whole time, then Cheesecake Factory is the place for you."
Eugene F.,"Chicago, IL",317,211,550,2.0,2/20/2014,The food was below mediocre and nothing was even remotely healthy or good. Very typical food - nothing special. Just feels like a very dated style of dining. The positives are that if you have kids it's great because it's crazy loud and they can yell their hearts out and it wont bother anyone. Besides that I would not come here again.
Derik P.,"Chicago, IL",81,6,,3.0,6/29/2011,"The food is a little over price. It's a pretty big restaurant and still there is a wait. The wait isn't long and their service are pretty good. I come here for of course,  1. Cheesecake  2. Chicken Teriyaki.  3. Unlimited bread. There are plenty of parking since it is right in the mall plaza."
Martin E.,"Niles, IL",7,4,,5.0,10/1/2013,"My friends and I just got back from cheesecake factory. Food was good. I had Shepherd's pie which was nice. The best part of our experience though, was with our waiter derrick. He was very kind, always checked up on us. Was very down to earth and got a couple laughs with us. Just because of him I'd definitely come back here."
