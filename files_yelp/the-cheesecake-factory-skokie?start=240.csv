Samir L.,"Skokie, IL",286,8,1,4.0,7/28/2013,The food is absolutely great! Sure it's pricey but it is delicious. The menu is a little overwhelming and often times the wait is longer than expected. But great food and a great time
Joy C.,"Skokie, IL",38,13,,5.0,1/5/2013,"Good food, great service, and awesome cheesecake! The menu is a bit overwhelming, but you get over that kinda quickly. Favorite cheesecake is the white chocolate raspberry truffle. Enjoy!"
Hyun R.,"Lincolnwood, IL",17,12,,3.0,2/17/2014,I like going to Cheesecake on a date night. It is a very big place. And their menu matches their size. Wish the menu was a bit smaller and concentrate on a smaller menu. The bread is good and no matter what you order on the menu you get what you pay for or even more. The portions are big and the flavors are good. Sometimes you might have to wait for 20-40 mins depending on date and time. Over all this is a good place for a date and to hangout. Great cheesecake
Amy G.,"Austin, TX",5,22,,2.0,3/7/2011,Why/how is this place always crowded and busy? I ordered the garlic noodles. The food was salty and boring. My friend's dishes didn't look appetizing to me. The cheesecake and service are good.
Laura C.,"Houston, TX",99,357,306,2.0,11/12/2012,"I'm slightly embarrassed to admit I ate at The Cheesecake Factory, but a recent trip to Old Orchard with hungry friends had me acquiescing to this chain restaurant despite my pleas to go somewhere else.   At an off peak 2 PM time slot on a Saturday, we entered to find the first floor completely empty and all business directed to the second floor.  As we climbed the steps, the loud buzz of customers gradually grew louder, and I was shocked at how busy the joint was.  We were seated close to the kitchen pass, where I could see food runners and cooks playing with the food, throwing stuff back and forth, letting food drop to the floor and not picking it up, scraping dirty plates and not bothering to wipe their hands before grabbing the next dish going out to the customers.  It was not a pretty sight.  But it's unfortunately more common than not; I just wish I couldn't see it.  I also witnessed three salads dying in the window, that just sat there the entire time we ate.  I feel bad for the poor soul who had to eat the limp greens. Service was slow; our meals took a good 20 minutes to come out of the kitchen.  With servers and food runners abound, it seemed as if a more efficient modus operandus was in desperate need.  Side note, the uniforms were white pants, white shirts, and white shoes, and I felt a little bit like I was in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" with the orderlies swarming the place.  I felt rushed and uneasy with all the activity and the noise in the room.  Twice throughout my meal, I had food dropped on me, once from a busboy cleaning the table next to me, and once from our server, who took my friend's leftovers into the kitchen (under our assumption that he was going to box the food), and he returned with said leftovers, a take home box, and my dirty plate.  Why he didn't drop the dirty plate off before coming back or why he didn't box up the leftovers in the back, or why he didn't just leave her leftovers at the table and bring out a box made no sense.     Anyhoo, foodwise, I chose the crispy artichokes, a deep fried plate of hearts accompanied by a gelatinous aioli.  Together with a cold beer, it wasn't bad, but certainly not something I would return for any time soon."
Rose O.,"Chicago, IL",363,92,1,3.0,7/24/2010,"This is a great lunch or brunch option for those who happen to be shopping at Old Orchard Shopping Center.  I typically support local restaurants, but what local restaurant is near Old Orchard? My favorite would have to be the sweet corn tamale cakes with lots of sour cream yum!  They give you three and they are reasonable portions. Add to that a a lunch portion of their Thai noodle salad and your good to go!  Even though this salad is listed as an appetizer salad the portion was large that I couldn't finish it. The downside is they are on the pricey side, but if you order appetizers and lunch-sized portions its not too bad."
Joanne L.,"Skokie, IL",22,47,,4.0,2/22/2011,"Back for More!  Taste tested 3 desserts, here are the results... #1 VANILLA BEAN!! (if you like light and fluffy cheesecake, great crust, subtle vanilla flavor.  this is for you!) #2 Red Velvet-good choice. more cakey cheesecake. huge portion!! # 3Christ's outrageous chocolate cake-had a german chocolate cake coconut filling.  great if you like RICH chocolate cakes.  it certainly RAGES chocolate.  dark and moist. Cheesecake factory does everything HUGE, so Share!=D"
shirley m.,"Chicago, IL",39,175,,2.0,6/13/2010,"2 stars for the service 3 stars for the food the food is usually pretty consistant -here is where they lost points -we were a party of 6 adults and 4 kids, we have been there before so we knew what we wanted to order esp with having children (ages 5-9) our server said she would only take our drink order then was gone for another 10-15 minutes before returning with beverages, got the order wrong and then she disappreared again before returning to take our order -we saw the assistant servers/runners more than we saw our own server -ordered a appetizer for carry out at the end of the meal, on a seperate bill, they charged us 18% tip  for the appetizer???I still don't get it -my meal was dry as if it had been sitting under the heat lamp I have had better service at other locations...this one might need to have the management review it's customer satisfaction"
Ur M.,"Peoria, AZ",60,9,4,2.0,11/8/2015,"I love going to the cheese cake factory but last night was just a disappointment. First there are no reservations, its first come first serve. I had a party of 16 and we had arrived at 630, they had told us it would be an hour wait... Our hour wait became 2 hours total till we finally got seated. After ordering our food took forever... When it finally came to the table orders were wrong... My sister-in-law is a vegetarian, ordered a salad with no chicken... As she was eatting she relized that there was chicken in her salad.. About 20 min after everyone recived their plates, i still hadent gotten mine... Our dinner finally ended at 1030.. I would like to mention that the waitress serving us did a great job and put up with the craziness. I dont blame her i blame management for not haveing a 2nd waiter for our table for such a large party, i'm sure service, time, and food would have been better and faster. After all mistakes that happend i would have expected the manager to come out and apologize but that was not the case. I was very disappointed because this place is my favorite place to go to and after that i dont think i will be going there anytime soon... I know i had a big party but maybe they should have reservations for larger parties... Or have more then one waiter for a large group. In the end i thank the waitress for her service but i'm putting the bad review for overall service from the restaurant."
Steve K.,"Chicago, IL",10,17,,3.0,11/8/2013,"I used to love this place. Cobb salad, chicken madeira ware my favorite dishes. But now, since I stopped eating meat, i wish they had a better variety  of see food. I don't eat farm raised fish and tired of salmon so  nothing for me in menu. But for meat lovers, I think this place is wonderful!"
William R.,"Chicago, IL",225,135,73,4.0,1/3/2013,"It's a classic. I love cheesecake.  Probably wont be having any for a while, since it's a ""New Years Resolution"" to be healthier, so I can't wait until my treat time when I will crave cheesecake factory pumpkin pie cheesecake"
Jenni Q.,"San Jose, CA",143,165,47,4.0,5/18/2010,"I love cheesecake factory!  So what if its a chain?  The food is always consistent, the prices are great and the best part:  CHEESECAKE! Tried and true dishes:  -  calamari -  thai lettuce chicken wraps -  steak diane (filet medallions) and shrimp -  bang bang chicken and shrimp (with rice in a light curry sauce)  Strawberry lemonade is definitely a must!   And so are any of their cheesecakes - my favorite is the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut.  the white chocolate and nuts are such a good contrast to the creaminess of the cheesecake.  not too heavy or sweet - just perfect!   Great place for big parties.  Menu is extensive, portions are huge,  and the service is excellent!"
Christine B.,"Evanston, IL",34,64,52,4.0,6/20/2014,"Always good food. Not sure if the food is processed or not or how quality is, but it sure is tasty and portions are huge. Never liked cheesecake, but their cheesecake turned my heart to REALLLY liking cheesecake--it's very tasty. Come here to splurge, not to eat healthy. Enjoy :)"
Edward W.,"Chicago, IL",119,684,410,4.0,10/11/2010,Yeah the cheesecake is great but the dinners are really good here too.  Believe it or not their chicken marsala is excellent.  Great place to eat while shopping at Old Orchard.
Yanyao N.,"Seattle, WA",849,595,157,4.0,9/29/2009,"I am such a sucker for the pasta selection from Cheesecake Factory. I know, I know, but they all go down so easy! My recent favorites are the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic, featuring many cloves of roasted garlic (YES!!!!), peas, pancetta, mushrooms..... I love all these things! This weekend I tried the garlic noodles with chicken. The chicken (additional) was basically fried chicken and I was so happy. The garlic sauce was lightish (compared to many of their cream-based sauces) and gave me such crazy delicious dragon breath that I couldn't help but fall in love.  With so many places to eat in this town, I really shouldn't end up here so much, BUT it seems to be a people pleaser (at least when out of towners come to visit) and I can always find something to enjoy here.  The selection of cheesecakes is bananas that I usually don't even end up getting any. They should offer a cheesecake bites platter or something (steal David Burke's lollipop tree perhaps?), so I can try many different kinds without becoming huge.  Bonus points for having great soups and iced green tea."
Dancing T.,"Skokie, IL",0,28,6,2.0,3/20/2013,"Expensive for what you get.  Just your typical chain.  There's so many other choice of places to eat, that this is not one I'd choose."
Demetrio P.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",45,290,2,4.0,12/13/2010,"Ahh...the Cheesecake Factory.  I pretty much like all the food I've tried here...Chicken and Biscuits, Bistro Shrimp Pasta, Fish Tacos, their various salads and appetizers.  Most of their food isn't for the Calorie Conscious, but who really cares when your full with tasty food!  They also have tasty drinks, one in particular, the Mango Smoothie with raspberry puree...delicious!  Don't forget to try their deserts, the Tiramisu is my fave. Overall, good food, okay service, okay prices."
April P.,"Chicago, IL",281,500,6,4.0,4/2/2010,"Yes, Cheesecake is a staple in most metropolitan cities, as well as our family.  You can never go wrong with their never ending menu, but the favorites I personally have are the lobster rolls, chicken lettuce wraps, miso salmon and the red velvet cheesecake. I would come here solely just to get red velvet cheesecake and some coffee.  They also have a pretty well priced lunch menu offered with extended hours up until 5 pm.  Now that's a steal Service is always fast (that doesn't include the wait times), and the staff are very attentive.  They do need some brushing up on their bathrooms, so one star off for that.  I don't care how busy you are CF, clean bathrooms are a must! Highly recommended before or after a movie, or for a feast after shopping"
Raquel D.,"Chicago, IL",192,289,2,3.0,11/9/2010,"This is a great last minute ""casual, yet occasiony"" spot or whenever I am in the area.  Last time we were here was for my Mommy dearest's bday - mainly b/c we wanted to shop as well.   The ahi tuna roll is amazing.  Deep fried and delish.  I personally LOVE the soutwest tex eggrolls.  They also pretty good pastas and usually have some good daily specials.  The portions are huge and the pricing is decent.  I feel like it's good for the portions given usually as entrees are big enough for two ppl or to pack for lunch the next day. It's a chain, but def better than most and used to be one of my favorites.  They lose one star for taking out my FAV pasta ever (penne with pine nuts, chicken and mushrooms).  And they also lose 1 1/2 for not better accomadating us when we lost a phone there.  It is our fault for having left in the booth, but when we came back to check, no one else was sitting there, which leads me to believe a staff member had to have picked it up...I dunno - makes sense to me...The mgr did take my info down, but seemed so in a hurry and gave off the impression that it really wasn't her problem...not cool."
Ellen S.,"Chicago, IL",19,52,,3.0,11/3/2009,"That this is my mom's favorite restaurant is pretty much all you need to know about this place. If you are or know a 60-year-old lady born and raised in the Midwest who still makes herself baloney sandwiches for lunch and ironically watches Fox News all day, then this is the place to be. The food is straightforward, there's a lot of it, and pretty much anything you can think of is on this menu somewhere, from nachos to fettuccine. The food is pretty bland, but I'd imagine if you really wanted spice you wouldn't be eating at a Cheesecake Factory at a suburban shopping mall. The wait can be more than an hour during peak times (6-7 on weeknights, 7-8 on weekends) but as long as you plan accordingly you shouldn't be standing around for more than 20 minutes."
