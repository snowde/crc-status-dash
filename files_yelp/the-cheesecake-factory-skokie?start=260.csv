James B.,"Evanston, IL",0,5,,2.0,11/25/2011,"Good dessert, ABYSMAL service.   Went in this afternoon for some dessert, and was truly disappointed with the service from the get go.  Our server smiled at first, however she seemed angered by the fact that we would just be ordering 2 slices of cheesecake today.  She stormed off, and 10 minutes later brought us our dessert.  Another 5 minutes went by before she tossed the check on our table and walked off without a word.  She then proceeded to circle the area until a credit card was placed in the folder.  Without a word again, she grabbed the folder, ran the card, and brought us back the receipt in silence, and left.  We signed the receipt (leaving a rather generous tip for the service received), and needless to say we never saw nor heard from the mysterious waitress again.   The dessert, like always, was great.   For a place called ""The Cheesecake Factory"", the employees shouldn't be so surprised to find customers seeking their dessert menu only."
Roxana N.,"Chicago, IL",19,39,6,2.0,3/17/2014,I went there with my  gay-friend and one of the waiters acted very rude towards my friend. He made him feel uncomfortable and unwanted there. I did not complain but I won't return .

I wasn't always gluten sensitive though, and even when I ate here before the food was pretty good, just nothing stupendous.  I think it's a little overrated.   They do have a huuuuge menu though, so kudos to that (:"

Brown rice tasted horrible, orange chicken was OK I guess. For 17 $ I could have went a block away and got 3 plates of better tasting. Only thing I liked really was the taste of their crab bites."
Numera Q.,"Niles, IL",4,14,1,3.0,2/28/2012,"I had my birthday dinner here on the 25th of February. The wait was excessive, I wish they let you make reservations for larger parties. The waiter didn't even attend to us for like 20 minutes after we had sat down. They were too busy waiting on high school kids, like really as if they are gonna leave you a big tip. They took a long time to bring the food and then they didn't even throw in a free dessert for my birthday. They could have been more attentive."
Annie Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",372,378,,4.0,5/8/2010,"I'm not embarrassed to admit I love the Cheesecake Factory. This one isn't my favourite location, but it's five minutes away from my house, so I always end up eating here with friends. The wait here is usually pretty long, though not as bad as the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove in Los Angeles that I also frequent. They almost always make up for it with good service once you're seated, though. They have a huge menu with a wide variety of dishes. I have go-to dishes for every category, depending on my mood: Appetizer - My favourites are the tex mex eggrolls and the thai chicken lettuce wraps. I wouldn't say the text mex eggrolls are worth the price, but they're SO good. And the thai chicken lettuce wraps come in an enormous plate -- definitely enough for a meal. Soup - Clam chowder! Their clam chowder is so chunky and creamy; I love it. Salad - BBQ chicken salad. Huge portions and really tasty, though there usually isn't that much chicken. I haven't tried any of the other salads, but they all sound really good. Pizza - BBQ chicken pizza. It's the only one I've ever tried, and I like it enough to stick with it. I wouldn't order the pizza here, though -- it's good, but there are better dishes on the menu. Seafood - Miso salmon. Honestly, you can't go wrong with this dish in any restaurant, but it's especially good here. My only qualm is that it's fairly expensive at $19.95. Pasta - Honestly, I've tried almost every pasta dish on their menu, and I don't really like any of them. They're all decent, but I can never finish more than half a dish. The Louisiana chicken pasta is probably my favourite, though the spicy chicken cajun pasta is also good if they don't make it too sweet as they tend to do. Specialties - The Cajun chicken littles are amazing when they're well done. Even if the chicken is dry or burnt, though, it's worth ordering the dish for the mashed potatoes alone. Mmm. The Shepherd's Pie (ground beef, carrots, peas, and onions topped with mashed potatoes) is my absolute favourite dish. If you make it here in time for lunch, order this -- it's only $9.95, and it's big enough that you'll bring home leftovers. Just ask them for minimal oil, otherwise it'll be swimming in grease. My most recent discovery is the shrimp and chicken gumbo. They're really generous with the meat, and the sauce is well seasoned. I find that it doesn't keep well in the fridge, though, so try not to bring home leftovers if you order that. As for the cheesecake part... well, surprisingly, I've only tried one of their cheesecakes (white chocolate raspberry) and I wasn't impressed. I always come into the restaurant and swear I'll order a slice of cheesecake, but I'm always too full after my meal to even look at the dessert menu. Next time I'll skip the meal and come here just for cheesecake."
Amanda A.,"Chicago, IL",1,11,5,4.0,4/9/2013,"Can't go wrong with my favorite Angel hair Shrimp. Big fancy restaurant with good portion size meal. I always have left overs for another meal. A little bit pricy, but that's expected.  Service is normal."
Arlene G.,"Oak Park, IL",93,905,,4.0,6/16/2012,an oldie but a goodie this restaurant is. my girl & i shared a ceasars salad & it was pretty good but ive had better. she ordered the bang bang chicken & shrimp which was delicious as usual. i got the shrimp tacos & they were yummy as well. didnt have enough room for dessert but maybe next time!
Alyssa A.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,2,1.0,1/27/2015,"Before my meal last night I would've given this location 4 stars. The waiter David comes to our table takes our drink order (water & coke). Comes back 10 min later to realize he forgot our drinks. We get our drinks  we order a burger, chicken & biscuits, a side of eggs, & mac & cheese. Food took a lil longer than usual. The main focus of complaint was the food & service. My boyfriend's burger was great, fortunately he noticed the inedible peel & outer skins of the grilled onions atop before he bit in. We just asked for the onions to be removed. Biggest disappointment was the chicken & biscuits. The chicken was tough as tho it was frozen. We tell our waiter who really didn't offer a solution, my boyfriend just asked for better chicken. I wanted to send the whole meal back it lacked in flavor. I've had this meal before & it was wonderful. I should've got my usual, chicken Madeira. The manager comes to our table, advises their chicken isn't frozen his solution was ""so u want more chicken?, we won't cook it so much."" We end up just taking the rest of the food to go. They didn't comp anything, they charged us for everything. I realize our waiter & manager didn't even apologize. The worst part is when I got home. I open up the chicken & biscuits. I try the chicken first which was an improvement. But i realized they added the hard bottoms of the biscuits to my meal which were completely inedible. Our meal was $50, which is a lot considering I barely enjoyed my meal. We've spent triple that amount in other restaurants & left satisfied, with no complaints. I honestly feel that my boyfriend & i weren't taken as serious customers. I guess our appearance made them think we wouldn't know good food & service from the bad. We probably won't be returning to any of the locations due to our experience yesterday."

Brent W.,"Chicago, IL",96,953,834,3.0,5/14/2009,"After grabbing some Mom's Day goods for the special ladies, I stopped off at Cheesecake Factory for some lunch.  I had been here a few times before, nothing spectacular but nothing too bad either iirc.   I started w. the Clam Chowder which would've been more aptly named potato chowder....it was at least a 10:1 potato to clam ratio.  It actually tasted quite good but I call false advertising nonetheless. For the main I had the blue cheese Cobb Salad which came drenched in its bacon and ranch salad dressing.  After several bites I made mention of it to the bartender/server (i was sat at the upstairs bar), he just said something to the effect of ""hmmm"" and went about his busy business.  It was pretty borderline as to whether or not I send it back but I was starving and in a rush so went with it.   This was prob a 2 star experience but I've done CF before with better results....in sum, a-ok."

Chris P.,"Evanston, IL",0,36,,5.0,7/8/2015,"The steak diane / salmon combo was perfect tonight (all the times I've come here, I almost always gravitate to the same choice, though I have to say some of the salads are pretty decent too--if you're into salads, that is. I like food that's hearty, tasty, hot and satisfying, and for me, all those chicken dishes on the menu don't quite hit the spot like a juicy piece of steak or fish--both of which were cooked perfectly--tender, juicy and tasty, with lovely sauces and mashed potatoes just the way I like em - a mix of rustic & creamy texture. I started off making a pig of myself with a bowl of rich/dark mushroom soup (there was something of a witch's brew of tasty veg & seasonings in there that did it no harm at all--yum), and some warm/crispy french bread. We don't go here a lot (it's become more of an occasional treat than something like a routine), but it's one that I have continued to look forward to (clearly others feel the same way, judging by the 15-20 minute wait, but the minutes trip by quite nicely when you spend it looking through the menu and browsing the cheesecake counter). I think the point is that there are very few places locally that offer that kind of value, and also come with nice service, easy parking, a location near home, and a relatively short wait (15-minutes).  Risking a post-meal heart attack, we shared a big slab of lemon meringue cheesecake too (not the lightest choice in the huge cheesecake selection, but very satisfying!). I must admit that one previous occasion, the salmon was a bit more 'done' than I'd like, but tonight, everything came together (except for self control), and I feel like a happy king after a banquet. A special mention too for our most gracious and charming waiter!"
Helen W.,"Murrieta, CA",1,375,4,2.0,7/17/2012,"Besides being big and a good place to meet, I dont know why people come here, if not just for cheesecake!  A burger, a very small flatbread pizza and 2 coffees ran to $30...what the heck?!?  Burger was really nothing special and the flatbread was about the size of a slice of regular pizza, hardly any ricotta cheese and the sausages were so tiny, I almost missed them as surely couldn't even taste them!  The food, like the cheesecakes are way overprices and overhyped....but it is a good casual gathering place."
Diana T.,"Chicago, IL",43,197,106,4.0,3/18/2012,"We came here couple times, and each time was very satisfying. The burgers are good. Fish and chips excellent..... and of course the cheesecake is delicious."

Ryan G.,"Arlington Heights, IL",9,18,52,2.0,6/20/2009,"I will start with  few facts about the Cheesecake factory (this location) 1 . Importantly, the manager is not caring for customers.  The waitstaff seems to know this, and has become apathetic towards customer service, knowing nothing will be done to resolve an issue if a customer complains. 2. The menu is too large for the price of the food.  (true of any Cheesecake Factory)  It is abundantly clear that the kitchen cannot keep enough fresh ingredients on hand to make 1-2 day's portions of every menu item X times - and then sell each item for a reasonable price.  What I'm saying is: they use a lot of frozen food to maintain the size of their menu.  Especially at this location, quality suffers terribly.  Their menu is the size of the Space Shuttle crawler transporter.   3. The kitchen here is not terribly concerned with the accuracy of orders.  This is an issue particularly because of point #1. 4. Fries are NEVER good, always dry, as though they were fried hours ago and left under a heat lamp. 5. This location is getting progressively getting worse, not better.   That said, the building is nice.  I used to be a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, and other locations may well still be acceptable.  Just be warned, the food is never GREAT, and you will very often have to wait for a table.  (Huge portions + mid-range prices + America = very very busy, all the time)  Truthfully, I would give more stars, but this location needs a few lowball reviews to bring the average down.  A-ok? Really? My god."
Sarah C.,"Chicago, IL",0,2,,1.0,4/28/2014,"Horrible place.  My husband and I decided to stop by Cheesecake factory for a late lunch: 2:30 pm on a Thursday so no they were not busy.  We gave our name to the hostess and waited to be seated during this time 3 more parties came up and put there names in - all of these parties were seated before us.  The only difference between the parties who entered after us and were seated before us was the color of their skin.  My husband is black the those that were seated before us were white.  Complete case of racial discrimination.  When we asked the hostess why we were being seated last she giggled and said ""I don't know"".  Needless to say we opted not to stay."

Importantly, the manager is not caring for customers.  The waitstaff seems to know this, and has become apathetic towards customer service, knowing nothing will be done to resolve an issue if a customer complains. 2. The menu is too large for the price of the food.  (true of any Cheesecake Factory)  It is abundantly clear that the kitchen cannot keep enough fresh ingredients on hand to make 1-2 day's portions of every menu item X times - and then sell each item for a reasonable price.  What I'm saying is: they use a lot of frozen food to maintain the size of their menu.  Especially at this location, quality suffers terribly.  Their menu is the size of the Space Shuttle crawler transporter.   3. The kitchen here is not terribly concerned with the accuracy of orders.  This is an issue particularly because of point #1. 4. Fries are NEVER good, always dry, as though they were fried hours ago and left under a heat lamp. 5. This location is getting progressively getting worse, not better.   That said, the building is nice.  I used to be a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, and other locations may well still be acceptable.  Just be warned, the food is never GREAT, and you will very often have to wait for a table.  (Huge portions + mid-range prices + America = very very busy, all the time)  Truthfully, I would give more stars, but this location needs a few lowball reviews to bring the average down.  A-ok? Really? My god."
Sarah C.,"Chicago, United States",0,2,,1.0,28/4/2014,"Horrible place.  My husband and I decided to stop by Cheesecake factory for a late lunch: 2:30 pm on a Thursday so no they were not busy.  We gave our name to the hostess and waited to be seated during this time 3 more parties came up and put there names in - all of these parties were seated before us.  The only difference between the parties who entered after us and were seated before us was the color of their skin.  My husband is black the those that were seated before us were white.  Complete case of racial discrimination.  When we asked the hostess why we were being seated last she giggled and said ""I don't know"".  Needless to say we opted not to stay."
