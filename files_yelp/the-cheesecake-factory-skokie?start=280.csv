Dan F.,"Chicago, IL",16,27,6,4.0,1/25/2012,"Food is always consistent (and lots of it), service is always good--just don't think you can go wrong with any Cheesecake Factory in their chain.  I have eaten at them all over the country and it is always consistently a good experience."
Melissa M.,"Wilmette, IL",1,34,,2.0,10/31/2014,"I have become very disappointed with Cheesecake Factory. My family and I have always enjoyed the food. We often pick up (at least twice a month) our dinner using the curbside service.  We did this last night and Cheesecake Factory messed up our order again for the 7th time in the row (in the past months). For spending over $50 for just 2 pasta dishes and 1 salad last night, one would expect better attention to details. We asked for extra sauce for one our our pasta dishes and the complimentary bread that comes with orders. Not only did they not pack the extra sauce but there was little sauce on the pasta to begin with. Also, they did not pack the bread. The last time we ordered something for pick up, they messed up 2 of the 4 orders. I had to drive all the way back from home just to get the correct orders. They were professional enough to apologize for this and offered complimentary dessert (which I turned down as we just wanted to eat our dinner....as that was delayed having to wait for our correct orders). I complained to the Manager about this (again) last night and he did listen and offered to personally pack my next pick up order himself. However, it is my opinion that a customer should not have to go to this level. The Manager of a good establishment should not have to personally get involved and the better focus is to get the crew focused on details. Beware....If you order for pick up or curbside, you better double and triple check your orders. Maybe this is a sign for us to save some money and stop ordering food from this restaurant......."
Matt P.,"Chicago, IL",118,312,,3.0,7/21/2011,"For a chain restaurant, I think Cheesecake Factory is pretty great ... I definitely like it better than their sister place, Grand Lux.  Their loaded baked potato soup is the bomb, and server Brandon was great as I assailed him with questions about the menu (which is mighty), and the specials."
Alicia F.,"Chicago, IL",26,80,8,2.0,3/13/2009,"For the love of god Cheesecake Factory please possibly consider MAKING A KIDS MENU!!!!!! And former employees, please don't send me angry emails about how you have pizza and grilled cheese there. Sorry, I don't feel like paying for my 3 year old to take three bites of a full sized entree. It boggles my mind that a chain restaurant doesn't offer anything specifically for kids. ( I think there is a brunch item, if you go for brunch, but that's it.) 2 stars for good cheesecake."
Food Junkie S.,"Chicago, IL",88,173,,1.0,4/30/2013,"Cheesecake Factory was never anything special, but the convenience factor got me in the door. They cater to such a wide array of customers that its impossible for everyone in your group to not find something worth ordering. But their service is downright sh*tty! We has a server (I think his name was Kent) who was the rudest they come. He never came to check on his and didn't even put in half our order. I guess his shift ended halfway through our meal, so he just left. No one took care of us. What the hell kind of service is that. I hear a lot of people complained about him. He is reason enough for my friends and I to never go back. This is the third CF that has terrible people working for them. I hope he get fired and I hope I never see him again.  Avoid this place on the off chance you'll get stuck with some idiot who doesn't want to work.  OO mall has a lot of new places, so you have a lot of options."
GeminiGal D.,"Chicago, IL",0,7,,1.0,5/15/2009,"BAD MANAGER, BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, BAD FOOD.  I had been eating at this Cheesecake Factory in Skokie for years; probably since 2000. Well as of May 7, 2009...I will no longer be eating at this location ever again. I ordered a cream of mushroom soup that tasted nearly rancid, and a barbeque ranch salad that had unfresh romaine lettuce (there were pink spots on the ends of the lettuce). When I told my waitress, Victoria about the food, she acted apathetic as she walked away to call the manager. Minutes later, the manager came over to our table and we explained about the soup and salad and he was very unapologetic. All he said was, ""What do you want instead?"" He didn't even want to admit that the salad looked a day or two old! He also looked and sounded like Peter Griffin from the cartoon, Family Guy and acted like him too!! Very rude and condescending!  I was totally disappointed. They just lost one of their most loyal customers."
Suha F.,"Morton Grove, IL",3,6,,3.0,9/14/2013,"I either love my food & experience here or I hate it. Their service and food is very inconsistent. Usually the biggest problem I have when I come here is undercooked salmon and/or poor service. On a bright note, their cookie dough cheesecake is sooo good!"
Renee C.,"Chicago, IL",5,15,,1.0,5/21/2008,"I used to like this location, but over the last couple of years the service has gotten terrible. The last time I was there, I went with 3 other people to celebrate someones birthday.  My entree was served first...then, 5 minutes later, another person's food arrived. Right after that, the third person's order arrived. 5 minutes after that we were still waiting for the last person to be served and there wasn't a waiter in sight. When I finally did catch our waitress, she seemed surprised that my friend hadn't been served...she hadn't even noticed. She asked what dish it was, and kind of implied that it must be something that takes a long time. It was a sandwich. A sandwich... The rest of us had ordered hot dinner entrees and while we were eating, my friend had to wait 15 minutes to be served a cold sandwich.  The staff wasn't apologetic at all and didn't seem to care a bit about the situation.  I also received very poor service on my two previous visits to this location. There are several other restaurants in or near Old Orchard, I recommend any of them over Cheesecake Factory."
Rob M.,"Forest Lake, MN",3,31,15,5.0,12/1/2010,"First visit to a Cheesecake Factory. Glad I went. Beautiful restaurant. Staff was super attentive and helpful. I sat at the bar since the place was packed. Matter of fact I got the last chair at the bar. The bartender was extremely attentive and courteous. She was also busy. She was running all around but I never had to wait for anything. I ordered a pasta meal (Chicken and Roasted Garlic) YUMMMO!!! It was awesome. I couldn't finish all of it. The portion was ample. I couldn't leave without having some....cheesecake. So I ordered a slice to go. They packed it all up for me so nice and neat with utensils and napkins to boot. Even though I still wasn't hungry later, I just had to dive into that succulent slice of goodness back at the hotel. MMM.....it was worth it. So good. If in the area you have to go."
J. T.,"Bloomington, IN",0,47,,2.0,8/12/2009,"Having visited several Cheesecakes all over the country, this is definitely in our top 10 for atmosphere and extremely helpful and friendly staff.   HOWEVER, at this CF, we are almost always seated in the same side-area with tiny booths for two (which, let's face, gets kinda boring) and are mostly disappointed with the food.  Last weekend was no exception.   I ordered the Baja Chicken Tacos - bland and dry.  Now, I've had these in Vegas (delish) and in Walnut Creek, CA (scrumptious), so WTH happened here?  Dry, tasteless, only a drizzle of cheese.  These are supposed to have some kick, boys and girls! Alas, the iced tea was also bleck; some sort of fruitified-tea that left an unpleasant aftertaste. The Darling's dish was okay - forget the name, some sort of Asian chicken over rice - but again, nothing spectacular.   Usually get a slice of cheesecake, which is always up to par, but not this time.  The bill, though, for less-than-excellent food, with tip, came to $42.   Took most of my meal and doctored it up royally for the next night, but decided we won't return to this CF.  Should have just gone to Hamburger Mary's for less cost and better eats."
Leticia R.,"Chicago, IL",49,111,3,5.0,8/13/2012,"I love this place!!!! I make it a point to come as often as I can, but really sometimes it's just for my or MIL's (mother-in-law's) birthday!!! Thing to ask for - Santa Fe Chicken Salad!!!!!! OMG - the portion size is insane, but you can ask for the lunch portion - depending on the time of day. Came here over the weekend with the boys and my lil sis and OMG did we enjoy our meal!!!! We started off with a Passion Fruit Mojito - YEEEEEEEEEEES I said it - Passion Fruit!!!! It's as delicious as it sounds!! The mint leaves are so fresh and  drinking the mojito definitely hits the STOP STRESSING button! LOL!! Anyway I ordered chicken fingers and fries for one boy, cheese pizza for the other, and pasta with Alfredo Sauce for the last child. Needless to say the boys ate and there was still left over for them to eat for dinner - SCORE (not having to cook dinner)!!!!!!!! My lil sis is now a TCF fan!"
Anne Marie J.,"Chicago, IL",58,182,2,4.0,5/11/2009,"Always a good go-to place when you run out of options.  Lots of variety and you're guaranteed to get what you're expecting (as what's described on the menu).   I'd give this place an extra 1/2 star for the service.  One of our diners didn't like her food because she felt it was too salty - they immediately checked if they could make it with less salt.  When they found that they couldn't change the recipe, the manager came extremely apologetic and provided different options that would be to her liking.  EXCELLENT customer service!"
Steve G.,"Evanston, IL",143,65,,1.0,2/11/2008,"This place should be called the Crapcake Craptory.  The wait to be seated is long.  The portions are enormous, but quantity does not a supper make.  It would appear that the this restaurant's motive is to make its patrons fat, and fill them with oily butter.  It is probably owned by some group of space aliens that's waiting to eat us. The menus are filled with advertisements.  I'm not sure who started this trend, but for me putting commercials in your menu is a big red flag that says, ""we're a piece of crap, we don't care how the food tastes, we just want to fatten you up, sell you fancy watches, and later, eat you.  Also, we're aliens."" How tacky is that?  And why do we flock to places like this in droves instead of slapping them on the wrist for pulling such a bogus and unfriendly move?  Could you even fathom pushing advertising to people that come to eat in your house? Eating at The Cheesecake Factory is like accepting a dinner invite from your local Avon lady. Aside from the 20 pages of advertisements, their menu contains about ten thousand dishes.  It's as if they stole a bunch of menus from a bunch of crappy poophouses, took them to Kinko's, and hung out by the velo-binding machine.  Yet somehow, each and every one of these dishes tastes exactly the same.  Like fat.  And butter.  And garlic. The one nice thing about The Cheesecake Factory is the brown bread they serve you when you sit down.  It's decent bread.  They did not mess that up.  But the brown bread is hardly worth the other indignities you'll be forced to endure by stepping foot in this crummy restaurant."
iddells E.,"Chicago, IL",131,328,17,3.0,8/22/2008,"Why'd I go to this.....chain?  Well, it was convenient since I had to shop at Old Orchard.  Anyways, I remember that I was here last year for dinner.  I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, which consisted of grilled shrimp, chicken, and a bunch of vegetables.  It was sooooo tasty and a little bit spicy...I was so excited that I ordered this entree and savored every bite. However, a year later, I come back and again order my beloved cajun jambalaya.  This time, it was not as how as I remembered it.  It was boring and I was bummed, which goes to tell you that this place isn't consistent.    On the plus side, the restarant was huge and service was friendly and attentive.  The only reason I would come back now would be for the cheesecake, the godiva chocolate cheesecake."
Toni D.,"Orlando, FL",607,534,615,5.0,2/3/2009,I love everything about the Cheesecake factory. I usually try not to eat at chain restaurants but this is one chain that I visit in almost every city.  The food and service is consistently good. I've never had a bad food experience.  I almost always order the Chicken Madeira  with a strawberry martini.  I'm usually too full for a slice of cheesecake...but I've had several kinds of cheesecake and recommend all of them!
Carol M.,"Chicago, IL",70,21,1,5.0,10/11/2010,"these days this restaurant is as good as they get.  At least in the bar area, ( I was flying solo and they did not want to give up their precious two top for a solo flyer) Good food, Attentive/Knowledgeable bartender/server...Wait staff that smile at you even when you are not their table and they speak....!!!!!  Managers admit fault...(disclaimer: did not have a problem but the bartender recognized the appetizers I order were coming out slow and he addressed. Proactive)  i could go on and on about my experience.  The  only regret I have on the service end is  PLEASE STOCK GUINNESS EXTRA STOUT...( then you would have me at HELLO)  Big ups is all I gotta say...big ups...the only detractor...the hostess stand...sorry they could use some work...otherwise i felt like they appreciated my business..."
Ren S.,"Des Plaines, IL",0,126,13,1.0,12/28/2013,"Over priced,  not so great food,  long wait time(over 45 minutes just to get a table and over 15 minutes just to get bread and water and over 15 minutes just to get the food.).  It was also extremely uncomfortable just to be there.  The restraint had their thermostat set to something like 80-90 F.  So for the time I was here. I've been here I was extremely uncomfortable and needed to drink a lot of water because I've became extremely dehydrated.  The server was sorta in hyper mode and serving like 12 other tables)(for more tip)  so service was bad.  Would I come here again? Never.... I've seen people leaving the restraint without eating because of the terrible service and the discomfort."
Paul R.,"Baton Rouge, LA",18,134,25,4.0,4/17/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory is fantastic.  The place has a menu the size of a textbook, and virtually everything is good.  Service is a hit-or-miss experience, unfortunately.  Don't forget to get some cheesecake while you're here! As a Louisianian, my only reasonable complaint is that the Louisiana Chicken Pasta doesn't even come close to being classified as a Louisiana Cajun dish.  It's not a bad dish, but it's on the rather bland side in my opinion. If you want some real Louisiana food, then come to New Orleans."
Chris W.,"Chicago, IL",347,512,42,3.0,3/4/2009,"Well I've been here for dinner, I've been here for lunch, I've had a very memorable cheeseburger that was HUGE and I come to the conclusion the only reason I would recommend coming here is the cheesecake. The food is overpriced for what it is, but then again, if you have picky eaters and want to go to someplace a little more fancy but still casual this is a nice spot to go to. There's something on the menu for everyone. As far as cheesecake goes, the chocolate chip cookie dough and Carmel pecan turtle are deliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiicious."
DR. S.,"Chicago, IL",6,30,2,1.0,3/14/2011,"This one star is particularly for the employee (Hispanic 5'4"" male with mustache) who didn't even try to help me in front of the building after I exited the restaurant(@10.15pm) through the side door as he was coming out from the building with 2 big bags (food containers inside) and holding a big clear plastic cup of smoothie. Since the restaurant front door was locked after 10 o'clock on Sunday, and we (my wife, 10 months old son, and I) just realized that we left something on the table, so I was trying to go back in to see if it was still there; however, as he walked out through the side door, he immediately told me that the restaurant is closed which I said to him ""i just walked out the building, and I left something on the table. Please let me go up and see if it was still there"" (the restaurant was still half full when we left). He apparently didn't not even try to help me and said ""you can't go back in there, the restaurant is closed"".  1st, the restaurant should never lock the front door without anyone attend at the front desk which in my case, I can't go back in just to check on the table. Can you imagine if someone left their car key?  2nd, he didn't try in anyway to help the customer who actually spend money in the establishment to keep your operation running. He didn't realize that his partial salary is from what I spent at the restaurant. Regardless how busy your establishment right now, you definitely lose around $250.00 business a month as of today Mar 13, 2011. We spent $101.00 today with tips and $135.00 2 weeks ago. That's $3000.00 business in a year. The situation would had been different if he tried to call his manager for me or someone to come help me. We have been trying a lot of restaurants(Renga Tai, Maggiano, outback, California Pizza, and Jolane's) as we like to eat out every Sunday.It's very hard to find the restaurant that you like, and I think for the restaurant is also very hard to find someone who would spend $100.00 a dinner with the economy we have right now.     In conclusion, my wife and I haven't been back to Cheese cake Factory for more than 8 years, and the foods were not as good as current. We just go back since 1 month ago because one of my friend recommended the ""Luna salad"", so we go tried and we loved it. As well as the miso salmon, lettuce wrap, and fettucini chicken. We felt sad because we just started love to go there once every other week, and this was how we were treated. We decided not to spend a dime ever again at this establishment."

Carol M.,"Chicago, United States",70,21,1,5.0,11/10/2010,"these days this restaurant is as good as they get.  At least in the bar area, ( I was flying solo and they did not want to give up their precious two top for a solo flyer) Good food, Attentive/Knowledgeable bartender/server...Wait staff that smile at you even when you are not their table and they speak....!!!!!  Managers admit fault...(disclaimer: did not have a problem but the bartender recognized the appetizers I order were coming out slow and he addressed. Proactive)  i could go on and on about my experience.  The  only regret I have on the service end is  PLEASE STOCK GUINNESS EXTRA STOUT...( then you would have me at HELLO)  Big ups is all I gotta say...big ups...the only detractor...the hostess stand...sorry they could use some work...otherwise i felt like they appreciated my business..."
Ren S.,"Des Plaines, United States",0,126,13,1.0,28/12/2013,"Over priced,  not so great food,  long wait time(over 45 minutes just to get a table and over 15 minutes just to get bread and water and over 15 minutes just to get the food.).  It was also extremely uncomfortable just to be there.  The restraint had their thermostat set to something like 80-90 F.  So for the time I was here. I've been here I was extremely uncomfortable and needed to drink a lot of water because I've became extremely dehydrated.  The server was sorta in hyper mode and serving like 12 other tables)(for more tip)  so service was bad.  Would I come here again? Never.... I've seen people leaving the restraint without eating because of the terrible service and the discomfort."
Paul R.,"Baton Rouge, United States",18,134,25,4.0,17/4/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory is fantastic.  The place has a menu the size of a textbook, and virtually everything is good.  Service is a hit-or-miss experience, unfortunately.  Don't forget to get some cheesecake while you're here! As a Louisianian, my only reasonable complaint is that the Louisiana Chicken Pasta doesn't even come close to being classified as a Louisiana Cajun dish.  It's not a bad dish, but it's on the rather bland side in my opinion. If you want some real Louisiana food, then come to New Orleans."
Chris W.,"Chicago, United States",347,512,42,3.0,4/3/2009,"Well I've been here for dinner, I've been here for lunch, I've had a very memorable cheeseburger that was HUGE and I come to the conclusion the only reason I would recommend coming here is the cheesecake. The food is overpriced for what it is, but then again, if you have picky eaters and want to go to someplace a little more fancy but still casual this is a nice spot to go to. There's something on the menu for everyone. As far as cheesecake goes, the chocolate chip cookie dough and Carmel pecan turtle are deliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiicious."
DR. S.,"Chicago, United States",6,30,2,1.0,14/3/2011,"This one star is particularly for the employee (Hispanic 5'4"" male with mustache) who didn't even try to help me in front of the building after I exited the restaurant(@10.15pm) through the side door as he was coming out from the building with 2 big bags (food containers inside) and holding a big clear plastic cup of smoothie. Since the restaurant front door was locked after 10 o'clock on Sunday, and we (my wife, 10 months old son, and I) just realized that we left something on the table, so I was trying to go back in to see if it was still there; however, as he walked out through the side door, he immediately told me that the restaurant is closed which I said to him ""i just walked out the building, and I left something on the table. Please let me go up and see if it was still there"" (the restaurant was still half full when we left). He apparently didn't not even try to help me and said ""you can't go back in there, the restaurant is closed"".  1st, the restaurant should never lock the front door without anyone attend at the front desk which in my case, I can't go back in just to check on the table. Can you imagine if someone left their car key?  2nd, he didn't try in anyway to help the customer who actually spend money in the establishment to keep your operation running. He didn't realize that his partial salary is from what I spent at the restaurant. Regardless how busy your establishment right now, you definitely lose around $250.00 business a month as of today Mar 13, 2011. We spent $101.00 today with tips and $135.00 2 weeks ago. That's $3000.00 business in a year. The situation would had been different if he tried to call his manager for me or someone to come help me. We have been trying a lot of restaurants(Renga Tai, Maggiano, outback, California Pizza, and Jolane's) as we like to eat out every Sunday.It's very hard to find the restaurant that you like, and I think for the restaurant is also very hard to find someone who would spend $100.00 a dinner with the economy we have right now.     In conclusion, my wife and I haven't been back to Cheese cake Factory for more than 8 years, and the foods were not as good as current. We just go back since 1 month ago because one of my friend recommended the ""Luna salad"", so we go tried and we loved it. As well as the miso salmon, lettuce wrap, and fettucini chicken. We felt sad because we just started love to go there once every other week, and this was how we were treated. We decided not to spend a dime ever again at this establishment."
