Maria h.,"Chicago, IL",2,18,,3.0,8/27/2011,"I went there with my girl friend, this is the first time I go to this cheese cake factory, I usually go to the one in Michigan ave in down town, and I like the one in down town better, the food and the service is good, but the main reason I go there is the cheese cake, but this cheese cake factory don't have much favor then the other one, I think I will go to down town one next time."
Dionna R.,"Chicago, IL",56,70,2,4.0,6/12/2007,"I was really expecting not to like this place but I was gladly mistaken. I had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and it was awesome. I didn't dare try the cheesecake since I had already put myself over the top with the taters and let's not forget the amount of yummy bread I ate with butter. They have this dark bread that's almost sweet tasting. Lord help me, it was warm and yummy.  I will say that it was a little expensive. There were 4 of us and the bill came to over 80 smackeroonies. I'm a cheap date so it was pricey to me. The only thing I spend good money on is sushi."
Jesster A.,"Evanston, IL",92,190,2,3.0,9/26/2006,"The food is good here. But  I can't escape that sense of disappointment that always affflicts me at virtually every ""chain"" restaurant - even the best of them - and this chain is decidedly among the best in it's catagory.  I can't quite put my finger on it - that evasive ""something's missing"" quality. Can someone help me out here, if you know what I'm trying to say.  It's kind of like the old Holiday Inn ad campaign: ""No Surprises"" - which works both ways. Maybe what I'm referring to is a certain PREDICTABILITY - even if it is predicitably good....  Then there is the menu SIZE. There CAN be such a thing as too much choice... Invariably when I go here (especially this location) I am meeting an old friend for lunch and perhaps a little shopping. Sure we're interested in enjoying good food - but  even more interested in unwinding and catching up - not spending half an hour perusing the menu and trying to make a decision about what you are in the mood for.   Plus the wait staff gets annoyed after the third time you say  ""Can you just give us like one more minute...""  I suppose I shouldn't complain since you can count on having a reliably  decent meal everytime. No surprises."
Carlee R.,"Chicago, IL",0,16,,5.0,6/24/2011,"Even though it's a chain, I really like the cheesecake factory. The prices are reasonable and you get large portions. Try: guacamole avocado egg rolls crispy taquitos beet and goat cheese salad"
Marion J.,"Northbrook, IL",6,51,,2.0,6/12/2007,"I had been to the cheesecake factory for the first time in Atlanta and loved it! So it was with great excitement that I dragged my husband there again. We went for lunch but were shocked by the fact that the menu is just covered with advertisements... No pictures at all but a whole bunch of advertisement (every pages half is advertisment, the other half is the menu), we just decided to get cheesecake to take out. I have to say that I am a great fan of cheesecake in general. We got the kahlua coffee cake and the raspberry /white chocolate but I basically stopped eating them since it was really NOt worth the calroies... It really tated too eggy or something but it was actually not good to taste. I have to give it 2 stars for the fact that the menu is comprehensive and the atmosphere is nice."
Joshua M.,"San Diego, CA",204,1480,170,3.0,10/24/2010,"*YAWN*  I'm reviewing another cheesecake factory.  A wait for lunch on a Friday was kinda lame, but otherwise I was happy to see they had a ""lunch"" portion for the orange chicken.  It was still enormous, but slightly less gluttonous.  Service was okay, our server looked like one of the Backstreet Boys."
Allen R.,"Vallejo, CA",12,163,,2.0,1/8/2008,"Too big for its own britches. Ambiguous Egyptian and neo-American decorating are your first clue that your culinary experience will be -- how shall I say -- conflicted? Bizarre? The menu has advertisements every other page, and takes so long to read that it's more like a magazine. Too many sections -- the fare varies from dinner salads to breakfast (served all day), to, of course, two pages of cheesecakes. The food was sub-par given the steep prices and -- all right, I'll say it -- pretentious clientele who (whom?) I am SURE expect 'quality' if they can afford to shop at any of the Old Orchard's high-end shops. Examples of this ""sub-par-ness"": my chopped salad consisted primarily of iceburg lettuce; our slice of cheesecake had been THAWED so recently that it was still icey in places; our waitress relentlessly said ""my pleasure"" instead of ""you're welcome"" so many times that any vestige of its uniqueness and authenticity as an alternative to the banality of ""you're welcome"" was lost long before we left the restaurant. If you've got $50 to spent on dinner, go elsewhere, or -- barring that -- buy a pair of jeans at Abercrombie and feel like a sex-crazed teen again!"
Gina C.,"Skokie, IL",0,2,,1.0,5/16/2013,"I went here today and received HORRIBLE customer service. The waitress took too long to bring out my drink, and take my order. It was also my sister's birthday, and we told the hostess about it, but she did not tell our waitress, so my sister did not receive her special treat and was very disappointed. Another disappointment was the fact that gratuity was already included for ONLY 6 people. Our server did not deserve the tip, and we did not like that fact. I am never returning to Cheesecake Factory ever again. This was the worst birthday dinner for my little sister by far. Thanks for ruining it, Cheesecake Factory."
Alex R.,"Evanston, IL",48,146,1,2.0,11/2/2009,"I hate to give this place a bad review as I've been a CF fan for a long time, but after coming here a lot since they opened this location,  this place has really gone downhill.  The quality of the food has really suffered, and it's just not worth the waiting time in line any more.  The past 3 or 4 times I've been here, I've gotten sick to my stomach with what I suspect has been food poisoning.  This is just not a coincidence anymore...1 or 2 times, sure, but 3 or 4??  I suspect something uncleanly is going on in the kitchen.  The wait staff is just not friendly or attentive.  I have had to sit there with an empty drink for a long time, and having to flag down another waiter for help.  I'm sure other locations are better, but I will discontinue coming to this one.  If anything, I will drop in for a quick cheesecake to go."
Kasia R.,"Chicago, IL",8,73,,4.0,7/8/2007,"It's been some time since I last visited this restaurant and the food was just okay.  I can't say I didn't enjoy the food that I had there, but I can't say that it was the best I've ever had.  From what I remember the service was good... we did wait for a table for some time, but happens at all restaurants.  I did enjoy their cheesecake though.. which we took to go."
Gina K.,"Chicago, IL",51,46,18,1.0,8/26/2009,"Was informed by the host that there are several dishes that are gluten free and that he would seat us in the section with the ""experienced"" waiter. Waiter told me of two dishes he knew to be GF. I have celiac so this is no joke for me. I understand that I eat at my own risk in restaurants and will definitely be more careful in the future. I don't know if the waiter sabotaged my food or the kitchen is just careless but the chicken stuffed tortillas were in no way or fashion GF. I was sick for 2 days AND developed mouth sores! All symptoms of being glutened. CF you are dead to me. I'm sorry I even gave you a chance."
Harlequin L.,"Chicago, IL",22,44,5,5.0,11/7/2008,"Since I was in high school senior year, my parents continued to take me here for my birthday dinners. Its a cozy spot, casual attire.  I always order my ribs here. I like this Cheese Cake factory better then the ones I have been to (Las Vegas strio, and the one in the John Hancock building)  Hey travel to the Old Orchard one  its worth your WILD AND PLUS its an out door mall all around the Cheese Caske Factory  so  go shopping and they will beer you on your pager when your table is ready!  Bring me along hahaha to EAT W YOU  JK"
Tara M.,"Des Plaines, IL",91,355,7,2.0,2/10/2007,"I guess I'm the odd woman out here... I just don't get all the hype around Cheesecake Factory.  The food is okay, the service is okay, but I don't know.  I guess, maybe I expected too much.  Everyone has talked this place up to me, so I finally decided to pop in to the one at Old Orchard and was irritated by the fact that I had to walk through and entirely vacant first floor and up a ridiculous stairwell to wait to be seated.  I'll agree, that wasn't a long wait... once we were seated, however, the menu kind of disappointed me. I was expecting more, but I cannot tell you what.  I got one of the salads and it was okay, but WAY too much food!  I don't do leftovers, so that was useless to me too. Then there's the fact that I have kids, and I'll be honest, this place is really disappointing if you have little ones, there's not much on the menu for them and the staff simply said, ""well we have pizza.""  Oh joy!  Yes, for the parents of small children, this is not a relief.. it's an irritant. If wouldn't say the experience sucked, but I can tell you that we're in no hurry to go back."
Jinhee S.,"Northbrook, IL",76,66,,5.0,6/28/2011,"one of my favorite restaurants ever. i love the atmosphere of this place, and they have lunch specials u can choose from and i love their bread! my favorite dish is their thai lettuce wrap with the peanut suace, and also their famous factory meatloaf is awesome with the mash potatoes and corn. their dishes may be a bit pricey but their foods tasty."
Melissa M.,"Chicago, IL",21,223,3,2.0,12/24/2006,"This place is great for groups because the menu has everything from potstickers to grilled cheese. The problem is that they specialize in cheesecake and the rest tends to be mediocre, bland, and overpriced.  On busy days the wait can be agonizing, but at least they give you a buzzer so you aren't completely tied down for an hour. The atmosphere inside is rather nice and the service is decent, but really I'd only go here for dessert.  Four stars for cheesecake, but the rest is two star material."
Victoria h.,"Berwyn, IL",92,296,3,3.0,7/14/2007,"The wait is incredibly long. They don't take reservations if you want to eat after 6. You just have to wait. The food isn't anything special, unless you're there just for desert.  The service is good and the food comes in huge amounts."
Caroline A.,"Fairfax, VA",1136,1178,22,4.0,10/19/2008,"I have a confession. I love The Cheesecake Factory. I've spent a lot of time at this location. My mother and I would go shopping at Old Orchard every weekend when I was a teenager, and this has always been our post shopping dinner spot.  I've said this before, but I am seriously obsessed with their brown bread. Like I've written to the company to ask for the recipe. For reals. I love their entree salads. In fact, I never get anything else (except the thai chicken wraps).  Their Cobb Salad, Chinese Chicken Salad, Ahi Tuna Salad and Salmon Salad are all fantastic.  I am always tempted to get a slice of chocolate cake after dinner, but I never do. I read somewhere that it has about 1600 calories per slice. I wish I had never read that, because now I never get it."
Tony A.,"Chicago, IL",499,116,62,5.0,8/16/2008,"Pomegranate Mojitos is God's gift to us in liquor form! So good! The service was good as my friend/host Natalie walked my entourage (11) and i in....We put together 3 tables so we could all sit together......this place looks fabulous.....extremely well put together..... inside huge restaurant and a nice size bar section.....our server was cool.....I didn't eat, just wanted to drink.....my friends ate and enjoyed there meals.....i did try Ashley's Crab Ragoon which was really tasty.......Natalie even sent me a free mojito which was awesome....."

Alexis s.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,,1.0,2/13/2012,To start off I came here with 6 others to have a good dinner they put us in a booth and sat me on the outside very uncomfortable then the racist manager didn't take my residents card as a id like Wat the hell definetly not coming back here again very rude manager specially just sitting there staring cuz I guess don't like Mexicans but definetly choosing more wisely like they accept my I'd  everywhere else including the casinos seriously very disappointed
