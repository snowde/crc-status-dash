Goc G.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,4.0,1/19/2012,"I really like their large menu. Great place if you are very hungry. Location is very cool and convenient, especialy for people who like to shop:) Bartender was very nice."
Jaz P.,"Chicago, IL",59,143,,3.0,2/15/2009,The chopped salad was really great. Nice portions. Good ambience.
Patrick W.,"Chicago, IL",138,416,,2.0,8/29/2007,"I spent a lot of money here for a light meal recently and I'm not sure how it added up so quickly. Oh, that's right, everything's mucho spendy here. I'm sure the service is typically very good; I'm a friend of someone who works at this location but she wasn't working on the one and only night we visited. Our waiter would disappear for long periods of time, and when we pointed out that the kitchen had sent out the wrong salad, he tried to tell us that this was the salad we had ordered. We had to read back to him the description of the desired spinach salad in order to convince him that the one on our table was not a spinach salad. I'm certainly not a culinary expert, but I tend to think that a spinach salad would be the easiest of all salads to distinguish.  The cheesecake was outstanding; don't write off the lo-carb version made with Splenda. It has a crust made from crushed walnuts, which give it a great, unique taste."
Paul E.,"Wheeling, IL",125,24,26,4.0,3/11/2009,"This place rocks! The menu has plenty of variety. Being a big fan of alfredo sauce, I highly recommend the chicken romano with alfredo sauce. This place gets plenty of business (which is a good thing, unless you need to eat right away), but it sucks that you can't reserve a table. I do like that you could dress up or dress down. The staff are friendly overall, though sometimes you'll get that snobby waiter on a busy night. Bring lots of money because the food is pricey!"
Vivian C.,"Morton Grove, IL",5,30,,2.0,1/19/2009,"There are better cheesecakes.  The service every time we've been there has been not too good.  Either waiting forever for bread or food or getting the wrong wine.  It's a pain. I know they are always busy, but they aren't the busiest one I have been to.  I go back, because we like cheesecake factory, I just wish there was a closer one."
Mark D.,"Decatur, GA",86,350,43,4.0,11/19/2008,"This is a pretty typical Cheesecake Factory.  Good food, good service.  Our food came out very fast.  Waitress forgot about my soup order, but left it off the bill.  It was like I never ordered it.  Whatever.  It's a pretty good place to eat if you don't mind spending a few bucks.  And quite large from what I could see.  The huge menu is what keeps me coming back.  And I've never had something I didn't like.  Get one of the pasta selections and you won't be disappointed."
Christopher B.,"Chicago, IL",2,14,,5.0,3/3/2011,"Awesome service, awesome food, and awesome cheesecake. Couldn't ask for more and I plan on going back very very soon."
Reem T.,"Madison, WI",1,12,2,4.0,8/31/2007,"oh my god, girl! you don't even know! see, my little brudder emil and i used to not eat for most of the day, saving up all our hunger, right? then we'd go over to the cheesecake factory and order like three appetizers and eat the entire things. oh god, its so good. so i hadn't been in awhile. and tonight, emil and i were looking for some good old ""american food."" emil suggested chili's, which i would sometimes be okay with, but tonight, i wasn't especially looking forward to loose bowels, you know? so we settled on the cheesecake factory. and thank goodness we did. because my cousin layla had mentioned it earlier this week, my eye caught the ""factory appetizer favorites,"" which includes 8 samples of the wonderful appetizers the cheesecake factory has to offer. oh my god. 8 different appetizers? for real. included are cheese quesadillas, corn cakes, chicken pot stickers, avocado eggrolls, calamari, spinach artichoke dip, buffalo chicken strips, and these asian noodle shrimp roll up things. damn. and to top it all off, emil had nachos on the brain, so we also got an order of nachos. oh, and emil's girlfriend was there, so there were three of us eating 9 types of appetizers, not just the 2 of us. so. my all-time favorite is the avocado eggrolls. its basically egg roll wrappers with an avocado mix inside, with some flavors of tomatos and some tangy green sauce. the chicken pot stickers are pretty regular, whilst absolutely delicious. the spinach artichoke dip is served hot, and totally didn't even congeal, even though it did kind of sit there for awhile. it comes with light , airy tortilla chips. that's right...i said ""light, airy."" eat me.  moving on. the shrimp things were okay...i took out the shrimp because, in my opinion, ew. shrimp is gross. but the rolls were alright, containing noodles, lettuce, scallions, and both peanut and soy sauce. i could have done without them. the quesadillas were good, but i pulled out the pepper looking things. they remind me of leaches for some reason. emil said the calamari was fine. the buffalo chicken strips were really good. the meat totally didn't have any funny bites, and the breading was light and crispy. the buffalo sauce was pretty spicy, but the bleu cheese cooled it right on down. what else did we even have? oh, the corn cakes. they were pretty damn good. our extremely handsome waiter, cleo, said they were his favorite thing at the restaurant. they are all he orders on his regular sunday afternoon cheesecake factory dining. and honestly, i gotta trust a man that handsome. i mean god, if you had seen him...damn.  okay, and the nachos were great. but when are nachos not great, really? go to the cheesecake factory. and even though i didn't do this, i would suggest getting a piece of cheesecake to go. eat it for breakfast tomorrow. you've fucked up your health enough at dinner already...may as well make a day of it."
Bryan S.,"Chicago, IL",4,58,,2.0,1/11/2009,"This place caters to the ultra brand conscious, mall shopping, suburban yuppie.  The whole experience was really strange.  I thought the restaurant was too loud and too crowded and the place was decorated like a museum.  The food wasn't the worst I've ever had but it was far from delicious and it was ridiculously overpriced.  It was sort of like eating in purgatory.  Maybe worse."
Foodie A.,"New York, NY",17,173,124,4.0,9/21/2006,"Everytime I come here, the food is always excellent. The portions are not skimpy and the service is fantastic. The salmon crisp, carpaccio, and the asian salad are delish! Drinks are equally good."
Ramon R.,"Evanston, IL",3,225,281,5.0,7/25/2005,"Not having to wait a long time to be seated (as you would at the Cheesecake Factory in downtown Chicago) is key.  But in addition to that, the food is terrific and the atmosphere is nice and dark, which is just the way I like my restaurants.  Find a nice booth and enjoy the... breaded steak with teryaki sauce, or whatever it's called."
Johnny S.,"Chicago, IL",7,125,,4.0,11/14/2005,"My girlfriend loves this place so much it is a little scary. I have waited here before for seating, but generally its pretty fast seating. Once I ordered a personal pizza, and the manager came out and said he was remaking it, because ""something about it didn't look right"", not sure what he meant,but I would say that's good service, and the pizza was good! Watch out for the decadent cheesecakes, one slice will feed two people."
Yahaa T.,"Chicago, IL",26,107,,4.0,3/19/2008,"I actually like Cheesecake Factory. They have a great menu selection and from the variety of dishes I have tasted from stealing bites of foods from my siblings so far they have all been good! I got the orange chicken last time and it was pretty good! My dad always gets the Chicken Marsala dish and it is so good!  We usually go in a big family group and get the table all the way in the back and its nice and secluded. We always ask for my cousin to be our waitress so our service is always phenomenal. Only thing that sucks is the wait, but it is a shorter wait at this location than woodfield."
Goody G.,"Chicago, IL",9,38,11,4.0,7/15/2005,"This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory.  For one, its not as crazy as the ones in ""the city"" so you don't have to wait forever.  It's typical cheescake fare and there's nothing like the tiramisu cake!!"
G G.,"Chicago, IL",14,233,330,4.0,12/29/2005,A little less busy with all the perks.  Good food and really good cheesecake (of course).
Linda T.,"Chicago, IL",82,90,3,3.0,2/11/2007,"I am a fan of The Cheesecake Factory. No doubt about that. I love the food, I love the ambiance. Their pastas are delicious. Their cheesecake is always the highlight of the meal!! But I can't really say the same about the service. I hate waiting excessively long to have orders taken, and even longer to ask for more water (not even any specialized drink, mind you). I'd still come back, though. I love their cheesecakes."
Michael H.,"Evanston, IL",0,7,,3.0,7/15/2008,"I've been to this place quite a lot since it's right inside the Old Orchard shopping mall. There is always a line during the weekend. But popularity doesn't mean excellence here. Everything at this place is okay, and they stops right there. The food is alright for an empty stomach, but it leaves you no impression afterward. Of course, they're well known for their cheesecake, and the selections are good enough. I would rather stop here for an afternoon cheesecake and ice-cream treat rather than for a full meal. The service is less than average, even though it's not too bad. You will have to wait for quite a bit to be served and the servers tend to forget special requests. For example, I often ask for no onion, less fat etc.., but they forgot half of the time. Sometimes they are nice enough to replace it, sometimes they just apologize and hope that you're ok with it. Oh well, I just don't really care, since I can't wait for another 20 mins until my food comes."
M L.,"Chicago, IL",0,8,,3.0,1/20/2011,"Okay place, nothing special. Ive been here many times when theres on those days where u cant think of another place to go too. Theres nothing really great to eat here, but the crab sandwich is good. The waiters here are alright, theres one waiter who thinks hes gods gift and that hes a model, he may be cute but he was rude and had no sense of humor, just took our order and left, didnt try to make a conversation with us at all. When we first sat down he didn't even give us bread, not till we ordered, my friend then ask if we could have bread and he just took it from another empty table and gave it to us and quickly left to put in our orders, so we had to ask another waiter for the butter. We got our food and ate, he ask us if we wanted dessert and we ask him which cheesecake is supposedly the best, his respond ""there all pretty good, just try one."" last time i ask a waiter which is the supposedly the best one he pointed to me the Godiva cheesecake (super chocolaty but great), this waiter didnt care what we order as long as we order something, he seem kind of in a rush also. over all its an a-okay place. sometimes its nice and sometimes its not. ehhhh."
Greg K.,"Chicago, IL",1,6,,3.0,1/30/2010,"This place is OK. Service is very slow(as always), our waiter would disappear for some time and we were like ""hello... we need some drinks, someone please help us:)"".  Great menu selection. Food is OK."
Martha Z.,"Chicago, IL",224,618,195,3.0,8/26/2007,"Ok a bit random, but stick with me on this one.  Long long ago there was this episode of saved by the bell.  Lisa Turtle went on a shopping spree with her dad's credit card, but she got scared he would find out, so she had a pseudo garage sale at her locker, to raise money to pay the credit card back.  When it came time to tell her dad about the hi-jinks he was rather understanding and felt that issue could be resolved by  ""LET'S go the the SIZZLER"".  That's how i feel about cheesecake factory.  You know you're down, or stressed out, you have some kind of confrontation or problem, it can simply be resolved by going to cheesecake factory.  You pretty much know what to expect.  There is something for everybody, and you know that you won't be able to finish your portion.  Although I am a bit baffled, I noticed they now serve water in regular tall glasses.  I could of sworn they used to provide plastic boot shaped glasses.  Am i just completely off my rocker?  You don't really have to answer that."
