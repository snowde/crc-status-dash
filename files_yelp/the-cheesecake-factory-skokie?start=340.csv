Renato P.,"Algonquin, IL",70,664,49,1.0,7/14/2007,"If I was rating this place on just the food , It would get much higher ratings, sadly , there is alot wrong here. It is a really nice space here, pretty classy. The pleasantries end there, I sat and waited for over 10 minutes for a server , we were just about to leave when she finally showed up. The older lady next to us had it alot worse , I'll get to her later. I ordered the salmon over spinach , and the Crab Wontons. The wife ordered the Fettichini chicken and the kid ordered the pepperoni pizza. Then we waited ... and waited ... and waited , 15 minutes in all for the appetizers.  The poor lady next to us was sitting there when we were seated , and she was sitting there with an empty place setting when we got our appetizers. She finally got her soup about 5 minutes into out wontons. We then proceeded to wait for our entrees , for 25 minutes after our wantons were long gone , 30 minutes in all. The poor woman next to us finally got her sandwich after sitting with an empty soup bowl for 20 minutes as well. The place was full , but not packed to the gills like the wait would lead us to believe. My wife said the chicken she got was ""alright"" but I could tell she was still really pissed at all the waiting. I actually really enjoyed everything I ate , I gotta admit. While we ate , the woman time forgot finally got her food , and finished it. She called for the manager and the manager calmly explained that they ""were just really busy"" and offered to give her a certificate for a free appetizer ... what a dick. I finished my food and proceeded to wait for the check for another 10 minutes. I contemplated getting dessert , but by the time the server finally got there I was sick of being there. The prices were really high for what we got , I've payed much less for better.  I usually judge restaurants 80% to 90% on the food , putting much less value on service , ambiance and cost. This place sucked so badly at those things , it just about ruined any chance at redeeming itself , ever."
Nicholle H.,"Sacramento, CA",29,108,,5.0,9/24/2006,A huge menu with spectacular food!  The cheesecake is great-many different kinds- and the wait staff is nice.
J L.,"Chicago, IL",21,138,4,4.0,11/18/2005,"yum yum yum. with over 15 varieties of cheesecake, this is a dessert lovers heaven, if you aren't full. the wait here is always long, but the food is great and worth the wait. it's hard to save room for dessert."
