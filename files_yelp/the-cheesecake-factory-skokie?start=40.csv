Harold S.,"Evanston, IL",2,4,,1.0,6/4/2017,"Cheesecake Factory left a bad taste in my mouth!! Two friends and I had a bridal shower at the Cheesecake Factory in Old Orchard Shopping  in Skokie. We were looking forward to spending time with our guests and the bride but instead we had to hunt down the wait staff throughout the entire shower.   I think I know the bus station better than the staff!  We had to ask for glasses for the punch, water glasses for the table, and dishes to be cleared.  Never once were the water or soft drink glasses refilled. The dessert was delayed with a lame excuse that they had to be completed (conflicting ""stories"" from wait staff and managers).  We were never greeted with even a hint of a smile. We seemed to be a major inconvenience to them.  We spent close to $500 and felt we were fools for doing so.  We discussed our unhappiness with 2 managers.  Wow, are they lame!  They must be on the defensive often because they both greeted us with huge attitudes and really didn't have any concern for our satisfaction at all!  The kicker is that they even fixed the tip after taxes.  No way were we going to spend 30% on a tip for service that we didn't receive! My advice is to STAY AWAY from the Cheesecake Factory if you are planning an event."
Howard H.,"Skokie, IL",0,65,,2.0,4/30/2017,"Huge Tried menu covering everything under the sun and ranks mediocre at best in taste, great for those who don't get out much to be overwhelmed with the size of the menu, decor and  People just want sweets and eat food to avoid looked bad."
Diana M.,"Morton Grove, IL",0,11,,2.0,10/1/2017,"Food  was delivered on time but food left an awful taste in my mouth and gave me an upset stomach . Their quality of food used to be way better . I ordered the chicken picatta and it was too buttery and oily , I had an upset stomach till the next day ."
Slappy P.,"Orland Park, IL",0,12,,1.0,10/14/2017,This place sucks we are wating like 30 minutes and we still aren't seated idk if it's a race thing but all the whit people get seated first
Rose N.,"Chicago, IL",115,53,62,4.0,2/5/2017,I have been to Cheesecake Factory tons of times. Mostly for dinner so this is my experience eating there during lunch hours. I've always enjoyed Eating here and nothing has changed that. Every time we had issues with something we were always taken care of. I've never experienced bad service here. The food is always tasty and the cheesecake is out of this world. My only criticism is that the wait can be pretty long at times (depending on when you go) and I hate the fact that they don't do reservations on weekends - that needs to change ! Other than that I will def always come back here.
Shannon W.,"Chicago, IL",0,18,9,5.0,3/29/2017,"It was the first time we had ever been here and it was very pleasant. We had a party of 6 and we were seated quickly and the waitress, Lashonda, was very sweet. Everything came out in a timely manner and was delicious. We had one little mishap with a burger that was undercooked, but the manager comped it and bought us dessert, too! The menu had a LOT to choose from and I can't wait to come back and try more!"
Allison B.,"Chicago, IL",89,32,,1.0,12/21/2016,"As others have mentioned, the food at this location has really slipped. I ordered the chicken piccata, and the pasta appeared to be reheated. It was dry to the point of being crunchy. There was also hardly any sauce on the plate to make it better. I've had this dish in the past, and it was delicious then. Nothing like the plate I received tonight. My boyfriends pasta was luckily better than mine.  It also took a full hour to get our food (the whole visit took over 2 hours without a wait... unacceptable). Our waitress apologized several times for the wait, and then offered to refill our round of drinks while we waited. It sounded like a round on the house, but we were disappointed that we were charged for the extra drinks that we didn't really want.  We were very annoyed to pay over $100 for a meal that was bad. Won't be back."
Anna O.,"Round Lake, IL",1,10,6,1.0,10/29/2017,"Wow! We have a party of 7. My father in-law is handicapt using a cane. The hostess took us to a booth for 6 and told us that he is to sit in the middle of an isle where all the waiters would be going thru delivering food to the near-by tables. When i pointed out that this is not the best option, the hostess actually told us of with an attitude. According to her, we should have told her that we need  spesial accommodations. Really? I thought that asking for a table for 7 and getting a table for 7 and not 6 with one in a hallway would be a normal expectation. At the end, the hostess was giving me an attitude! Wow! I get that its a chain, but basic human desency is expected!"
Krista S.,"Irving Park, Chicago, IL",98,72,31,5.0,4/20/2016,"Even after reading all the horrible reviews, tho I have been to cheesecake factories all over the US I was a bit worried, but me and my husband actually had great service and the food was even better.  You either like this place or you hate it...which I don't really understand how you could hate it. Their menu is a freaking book. They have everything...Mexican,American,Chinese, it's all over the place. I love that. I like options!  Our sever was so friendly and it's such a beautiful restaurant! Don't get why the reviews are so horrible but to each there own! I had the chicken Madeira! So so good! The sauce was yummy and the veggies were fresh! My husband had the spicy chicken sandwich and loved it, very spicy though! We started with shrimp appetizer and avocado egg rolls which are always amazing.  No complaints here!"
P S.,"Chicago, IL",3,17,17,2.0,7/31/2017,bullshit i got like 5 little pieces of chicken in my skinnylicious turkey and avocado sandwich
Jenn K.,"Glenview, IL",30,11,1,1.0,5/12/2017,Worst service ever and this was for a cheesecake that I ordered 3 days in advance for my friend's birthday.  I told them that I would pick it up at 2:30p. I went at 3:25 to give them extra time ...just in case. It wasn't ready and then they couldn't find the cake. I paid extra for a happy birthday on the cheesecake. Of course it wasn't done. Their excuse was that they had so many cakes in the freezer b/c it was Mother's Day (I ordered mine for a Friday and Mother's Day was not for 2 more days) They should have given me the extra happy birthday piece of chocolate free as a courtesy considering that I had to wait another 30minutes while they tried add the writing. I will never order from here again! This just shows poor management. The restaurant need to reevaluate their system and either re-train their employees or hire new ones. They need a new manager. The food and cake is not worth the poor service! To make my experience even worse- no apology and the they threw my cake at me and was really abrupt and annoyed. I should have asked for the manager ... my problem was that I was didn't get mad but waited patiently. I asked to see the happy birthday writing and then she said it's there in the bag... poor service and she needs a lesson in customer service.  I work in the service industry and would never put up with that type of service from my employees.
Anna T.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,29,44,3.0,1/6/2017,"We stopped by for a late lunch on a rainy Friday afternoon.  The restaurant was half empty due to the weather, but there were plenty of people around.  We started with Mojitos and Dynamite Shrimp.  The shrimp was crispy and flavorful, the dipping sauce was the perfect combination.  Our mojitos were refreshing and sweet, just as we ordered them.  For the main course, I ordered the Chicken Madeira, which was prepared perfectly.  The chicken was juicy and the potatoes were creamy, the perfect meal for a rainy day.  My husband ordered the Cajun Jambalaya, I wasn't a fan of his dish, the seasoning tasted off, in my opinion.  We ended our meal with a slice of cheesecake with fresh strawberries.  The cheesecake was delicious, the highlight of our meal."
Stephanie C.,"Summerville, SC",3,4,,2.0,7/21/2017,"Come when you have plenty of time to spare because even if they're not busy, and they rarely are, you'll spend plenty of time waiting in front for anyone to acknowledge you as the staff of millennials passive aggressively ignore you.  The food is pretty good, the cheesecake fattening and delicious. But the waitstaff keeps me away."
Jas C.,"Evanston, IL",2,5,,1.0,7/13/2017,"Thanks for making us wait half an hour at curbside service only for is to have to call again to remind them we were outside waiting.  Not only did we wait for half an hour, the food they brought us was cold!"
Latasha G.,"Avondale, Chicago, IL",53,13,12,2.0,12/21/2016,Decided to do curbside at 10pm. Called and was told the order would be ready in 25 minutes. When I called back the woman said hold on let me get your order and bring it out. 10 minutes later I called and she apologized saying they ran out of shrimp but found some. I'm confused because if they ran out where did they find the shrimp. It would have been nice to get a call informing me of this. Inconsiderate.
J K.,"Lincolnwood, IL",3,28,3,1.0,2/19/2017,"My wife says hey its Valentines day let's go to dinner. I say ok your choice baby where you wanna go she says Cheesecake factory, I say done let's go. I ask the server how is the fried zucchini app she said oh they are the best, I say better then Maggianos cause Maggianos has the best fried zucchini ever she said better. The Zucchini came and my wife can tell I was not happy but I ate them and told her how good they were. Next I was not able to decide if I wanted Italian, Mexican, classic American,  Irish, that's how big and out of order the dinner menu is. I decided on the Shrimp tacos and they were also terrible, no flavor what so ever. At the end my wife asked how did you like it and I said well I like that you liked it and left it at that. Will I be back oh hell no I'd rather go to a 7-11 or a gas station for dinner instead."
Joslyn A.,"Woodland Hills, CA",238,7,,1.0,7/15/2017,"I came here with friends to have a nice lunch and was very disappointed. First, I ordered seared ahi tuna and the waitress brung out tuna tar tar, the wrong dish. When the waiter asked what kind of rice I wanted I said white.  I had to wait an additional 15 minutes for my meal to come. When my dish came I had brown rice instead of white. I lost my appetite and sent the order back. Horrible service and very disappointed. Will not be returning"
Mandy Q.,"Chicago, IL",17,25,212,2.0,5/13/2017,", Well make sure you are not too hungry when you eat at this place. I and my kids were there Friday night about 7pm. Half hour waiting for our table and then another 1 hour waiting for our food to come. Finally my kids feel so tire and sleepy and end up I have to packed all the foods home."
August B.,"Chicago, IL",38,399,,2.0,8/20/2016,"It's been four hours and I have the worst gut rot of my life.  I came home running to the bathroom but still I'm not better.  I'll try to recreate the crime scene.  The free bread can't be the cause, neither could the water.  My entree was the shrimp scampi and julienne steak---bingo.  It seemed more warm than anything, I didn't complain because the food appeared fine. I had a bite of cheesecake which I could/would/will do again.........This is my take.  I'm in the minority as the entire restaurant was filled, so people like it......I just can't."
Erick V.,"Chicago, IL",39,6,,2.0,3/5/2017,"Our waiter seemed pissed off throughout our whole experience. Waited too long for mediocre experience. First, waiter brought me the wrong drink. Second they brought my girlfriends plate too cold, so we sent it back. Also when they finally brought my plate, it wasn't what I had ordered. Waited ten more minutes for both our plates to come to us."
