Lux O.,"Sarasota, FL",66,37,8,1.0,3/9/2017,I do love this cheesecake factory.  Unfortunately im basing this 1 star review mainly on my waitress who took more than 20% than what i put and charged my card more to get a better tip. Beware of what they charge
Shannon C.,"Des Plaines, IL",0,1,,1.0,8/24/2016,"Very weird lunch experience here today. Throughout our time ordering, the server would keep suggesting smaller portions, or simply not ordering what we wanted at all, to us instead of what we were actually wanting. I ordered two children's pasta plates for my two boys and a side a fries for everyone at our table to share, and the server tried to suggest the fries would be too big. I ordered a Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad for myself, and again the server suggested it is too big for lunch and would I maybe like something on the lite menu? Then, at the end of the meal, he brought us our check without asking if we wanted cheesecake and said we probably wouldn't want dessert because (again) it was lunch time, and we probably wouldn't want any. I informed him that yes, we did indeed want cheesecake (to take home) and had the check redone.  His behavior was borderline offensive and definitely annoying. I don't need a server offering his opinion on if a portion is too big for me or my family, if I want to order something on the lite menu instead (rude!), or simply assume I don't want cheesecake at The Cheesecake Factory. I won't be visiting this location again."
MoMo K.,"University Village, Chicago, IL",461,389,2173,3.0,12/1/2015,"Did you know the founders of Cheesecake factory created Grand Lux in Downtown Chicago? If you've been to both, you can tell there is some relations.  Most of their food is frozen if you weren't aware of that. We asked about a couple items on their menu and they said they couldn't change it anyway because it's ""ready made"" or something. The food is delicious though! I just feel kinda sad that I'm paying a lot for frozen food.  Service was above average. Our waiter did a great job of checking up on us and offering suggestions. She knew the menu very well because she knew what can and can't be modified to our liking. HUGE HUGE space! You can bring groups here and have a good time in their neat ambiance.  Yes I'd come back! But it wouldn't be on the top of my list."
Phil S.,"Sauganash, Chicago, IL",125,517,3626,3.0,3/31/2015,"Saturday we were invited to lunch by our friends to The Cheesecake Factory in Old Orchard.  It was good to spend time enjoying the company and the food.   The restaurant itself has a nice ambiance.  The food was pretty good.  I had the herb encrusted salmon w/mashed potatoes & asparagus spears.  Our friend also ordered a side dish for the table of pasta carbonara (delicious heart stopping food).  The cheesecakes looked very good too, but unfortunately I didn't leave any room for dessert.  Probably just as well as I don't need to gain more weight.   The herb encrusted salmon - 4 stars Mashed potatoes - 3 Stars Asparagus - was good, but only 4 asparagus spears (come on) - 2 Stars The food is decent the ambiance is nice."
J P.,"Aurora, IL",0,26,6,1.0,5/13/2017,"Our server Anna sucked!! Very mean! Worst server ever! Watch out for her! We ordered lemonade and she forgot to bring it. So I  told her u forgot my lemonade. She said, NO I DIDNT FORGET! OUT LOUD!! When she served us she always had a mean face that a server shouldn't have."
Brenda R.,"Winnetka, IL",0,35,,2.0,1/3/2017,"All these years of dining at Cheesecake but yesterday experienced a pathetic dinner: overpriced (the $17.50 seems the minimum for so-called entrees) and erratic service. The fish and chips was actually 4 small fish nuggets and a small handful of bland, overcooked, not fresh french fries.  The pasta w/chicken and shrimp--served to our an adult man--likewise overpriced but under-portioned--the chicken and shrimp, like my fish and chips, were in the shape of teeny nuggets. If they want to overcharge diners, then stick with adult portions to justify the policy. This was appalling and customers should be warned."
Tom K.,"Deerfield, IL",1,42,,1.0,4/6/2017,"Curbside to go at this location has messed up numerous orders in the past. After a long break from them, I gave this one another chance and they screwed up again.  I ordered a side and they passed it off that it was in the box and I had to show them that it wasn't for them to get it off my bill. They tried to charge me for something that wasn't in my bag. So this time I finally wrote on Yelp. Years ago, a cockroach crawled out of my date's dinner plate and a manager comp'd her dinner but not mine. With such bad customer service it's amazing how this location stays in business. There's a lot of people traffic at Old Orchard so they don't need to care. Avoid this location. Lincolnshire one does not screw up orders to go via DoorDash."
Rafi A.,"Northbrook, IL",223,150,1277,5.0,8/2/2015,"I must have eaten here ten times but never have I enjoyed the place so much. I asked the maitre de and two other servers whether they prefer the Tuscan Chicken over other entrees. All of them said to get the Tuscan Chicken; now I know why. It started with grilled, moist chicken which was covered with grilled cherry tomatoes, capers, broccoli, artichokes and fresh basil. The entire menagerie was doused in a balsamic vinaigrette. The dish was filling despite being under 600 calories. My sons could not finish their Cashew Chicken, so out of the goodness of my heart, I cleaned up after them. Their dishes were very well prepared, but much heavier. Nothing Lo-cal about them. As always, the environment was festive and fun. I love the high ceilings, ceiling frescos and colored, spiral sconces. The service was fairly good for a busy Sunday night, our waitress was a pleasure."
Christina G.,"Lincolnshire, IL",182,199,842,3.0,6/3/2016,"I decided to meet a gal pal here for dinner and, from the start, was not expecting a mind blowing meal. It was a Thursday night so we were seated briskly. I have to say, I love how open this restaurant is and all the warm colors. The lighting also provides a very romantic, relaxing feel. Our waitress had a very unfriendly demeanor and looked annoyed throughout our entire meal. I do not think I saw her smile once...seriously, why are you even in this business? Aside from that, the food was good. The menu offers a large variety so it's quite hard to decide. Both my guest and I decided to settle with salads. I ordered the Luau salad- it was seriously bigger than my head! Not to mention, it was pretty good! It's filled with so many mixings so this salad is super filling!- grilled chicken, pineapple, cucumbers, peppers, green beans, carrots, onions, crisp wontons, and peanuts! Like wow- talk about a salad! My other guest ordered the Santa Fe salad and said the dressing, the spicy peanut vinaigrette, was divine. Surprisingly, at the end of the meal, I was stuffed! I did not pass on the cheesecake though. I mean duh- it's the cheesecake factory. I know I will be back here because, besides LEYE restaurants, I think this is one of the better chains."
Sarah H.,"Farmington, MI",10,26,19,5.0,9/24/2016,The best dish! Chicken Madeira! Yummy! It's always great at Cheesecake Factory! Great food fade customer service! Love it!
Hannah H.,"Alexandria, VA",439,3672,27594,3.0,7/7/2015,"I know that Cheesecake Factory is a chain, but this particular location was minutes from my place and a convenient restaurant to choose after a day at the mall.  From the Pasta category, I usually get the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic (it contains bow-tie pasta, chicken, mushrooms, tomato, pancetta, peas, caramelized onions, all in a roasted garlic-parmesan cream sauce - the pasta is usually cooked al dente, and the sauce is very thick and creamy, and very savory with the pancetta cubes, peas, and the caramelized onions); Shrimp with Angel Hair (large shrimp sauteed with herbs, lemon, and garlic, combined with angel hair pasta, tomato, and basil - the shrimp is deveined and comes with tail on - they are succulent and great with the light side of angel hair pasta; the herb sauce is very nice and has a slight tang from the lemon); or their Luau Salad (grilled chicken breast, mixed greens, cucumbers, green onions, red and yellow peppers, green beans, carrots, mango and crisp wontons, macademia nuts, sesame seeds, all dressed in a vinaigrette - the salad is very fresh, and I love the combination of the crispy wontons with the mix of the green beans, carrots, and the chicken; this also comes in 1/2 portion during lunch).  My favorite cheesecake of all time is their Pumpkin Cheesecake - it is only available from October through the holidays - we always order it ahead of time so we can enjoy it during Thanksgiving - it is creamy, and has a wonderful pumpkin flavor throughout - not too sweet, but quite decadent and a great way to finish up the meal.  Service can be a hit-or-miss, as during the lunch and the dinner rushes can be a bit chaotic. +brown bread with soft butter (complimentary) +Luau Salad +Shrimp Scampi +Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic +Pumpkin Cheesecake"
Chatzy F.,"Chicago, IL",1,116,7,5.0,1/17/2017,We love Cheesecake factory.  We have been here a lot of times.  Food is always good!  We have never been disappointed. We get entrees and they are very good and tasty.
Hayley H.,"Evanston, IL",157,69,83,5.0,8/16/2015,"There is a long line but my friend and I almost have waited for no time before we got seated. That is probably because we only have two persons but most guests are waiting for larger tables. The complimentary bread is the best I have had in any restaurant, especially the dark one.  We ordered the pasta with shrimp and sausage and the red velvet cheesecake. We are really really full after we finished the shared pasta, but the cheesecake is so good with different layers! It is huge and I did feel very guilty after I finished it. I would definitely try the ""skinny menu"" next time."
Jennifer B.,"Chicago, IL",266,81,135,3.0,12/8/2015,"The wait for brunch on a Sunday was no problem for me and a gf. It is so spacious at this location and love it!!!  We put in my name and got called within 2 minutes of doing so. Our server gave us the complimentary bread and butter (so delish), and there is so much on the menu that it took forever for me to decide...so came the rescue of our server. He was so personable and funny, had to tip him well!!! I was debating between two salads and he suggested the BBQ salad. So that's what I did and could not be any happier!! I may add they need a bit more dressing though. Sangria was the only thing lacking here. It was by strong, tasted like a Virgin sangria. Not worth the $11 or $13 I spent."
Belinda A.,"Chicago, IL",62,44,107,3.0,1/10/2017,"Had a random craving for cheesecake the other day...so I decided to race to the Cheesecake Factory with my bf at old orchard mall before they closed. I called ahead and ordered two slices of cheesecake. We got the original strawberry cheesecake and the turtle cheesecake. I'm not a big fan of graham cracker crust sooooo i didn't really like the original. The turtle was good but I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like chocolate ganache as it has a giant piece garnishing the cake. All in all fast service, n good cheesecake..was kind of disappointed that they asked me to come inside to pick it up on the second floor since they have curbside pickup but I'll forgive them since it was 15 to close."
Lynn M.,"Aurora, IL",1,55,25,1.0,11/5/2016,"Saw a waiter picking a piece of lettuce, from a customers dish, and eat it before serving it! Disgusting!!"
Joseph G.,"Hopkins, MN",15,7,,1.0,10/31/2016,"Bad.  I've been to CCF in Edina, Minnesota and it's always been a great experience.  Here, I was like, ""is this the same chain?"".   We were a group of 8.  Food was really bad (dry pasta, poor pizza, questionable shrimp, etc). The server was overwhelmed, looked stressed and upset. Then, when we were leaving, the manager was publicly segueing with another guest.  Bad.   Really bad. I was so upset."
Chrissy S.,"Morton Grove, IL",189,55,93,5.0,7/6/2015,"Def love this restaurant...it never fails. I'm usually somewhat skeptical about large chain restaurants with ridiculously long menus, but every time I come to Cheesecake Factory and try something new it's always on point.  I started out looking through the cocktail portion of the menu. Everything sounded really good, but I went with the pineapple Moscow mule. It came with stoli vodka, pineapple juice, lime juice, topped off with ginger beer, and a fresh piece of pineapple as a garnish. It was delicious and I would definitely order it again.  I got the spin dip as an app (my go to appetizer). It came out hot with fresh tortilla chips, a side of sour cream, and a side of salsa. Also very delicious. The portion size was pretty big though so be careful when ordering apps here if you want a actual entrée bc it's going to be a lot of food.  I got an appetizer as my entree bc I wanted to save room for dessert. I got the corn masa tamale cakes and they are to die for. They are also a really good gluten free option.  I obviously ended the meal w a piece of cheesecake. They have a whole two pages on the menu and the only problem I had was choosing which one to get bc they all sounded amazing. I settled w the lemon meringue cheesecake, and it was another home run. It was not too heavy (which is my usual complaint about cheesecake) and was amazing.  Cheesecake Factory is a little pricey but totally worth it. The food, desserts, and drinks are amazing. Our server was also very good, checked on us a lot (but not in an annoying way), and we never had a problem trying to find him. I just wish they had a patio, but other than that I would recommend this restaurant to any of my friends."
Charnita R.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,4/8/2017,This location is horrible. I was put on hold 20 minutes to place a to go order. In the time I waited I drove the 40 minute commute. Get here and is asked to wait another 25 minutes for them to prepare my food. I ask the young lady to give me mu cheesecake when my food is ready and she sits it on the counter. This will be my LAST time doing business with this location.
Cindy T.,"Skokie, IL",2,26,19,3.0,4/4/2016,"Food can be average or decent at best. Been there several times and I live near Old Orchard. I remember the first time I tried this place, I think I ordered turkey club with fries. The fries were hard as hell, felt like it was burnt to crisp. The food portions are pretty big. I've tried other items on the menu such as pepperoni pizza, shrimp angel hair spaghetti, and shrimp tacos? They were pretty decent. Their desserts are pretty good, too. I remember trying their chocolate tower truffle cake, but I couldn't finish it because the portion was kind of big. I've also had their strawberry cheesecake which was so good. I love cheesecake!"
