Bethany A.,"Evanston, IL",312,315,50,2.0,2/16/2016,"I'm not the biggest fan of the Cheesecake Factory to begin with, but I stopped by with a friend for lunch earlier last week. We were seated upstairs and got our bread and water relatively fast, and I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which is usually pretty good (out of Cheesecake Factory offerings). Unfortunately, I was really surprised and unhappy with how salty the dish was. I couldn't decide whether I just misremembered how the sauce was supposed to taste, or they had oversalted my dish. Overall, not the best lunch experience in the world and will probably go back to avoiding the Cheesecake Factory for another year. My friend did seem to like her Oreo cheesecake though!"
D M.,"Evanston, IL",0,11,15,2.0,10/8/2016,"Its a bitter sweet review this time...let me explain,  the food was good but the service..not so much. Steven the (waiter) brought our drinks but soon after that like houdini..he disappeared and didn't come back to take our dinner order. I had to get the attention of another waiter to place our order (wow). Steven eventually returned with a not so friendly demeanor  ( worse than before)..im not sure if I will ever return to this location."
Bill H.,"Chicago, IL",17,31,2,3.0,12/7/2016,"Desserts on steroids. If they are ""known"" for cheesecake then I'm at a loss, our peanut butter n chocolate cheesecake had 5 superfluous layers and a super sweet over the top "" frosting"" . Waaaay to much much going on.  Of course the portions are too big but every one knows this .  Way too much dressing on my salad.  Chicken salad sandwich is served on grilled bread which was cold when I received it. Bland.  Wife had crusted shrimp pasta salad, good.  Waitress was excellent.  Decor was weird.  Bill for 2 parents , 2 kids , one cocktail and 2 desserts was over $100 with tip. Wow."
Jeffrey H.,"Skokie, IL",9,45,27,4.0,1/30/2016,"We took our 12 yr old to the cheesecake factory for dinner. It was her choice for her birthday dinner. What a really nice restaurant. It's a huge restaurant so I'm glad it wasn't rush hour. We may not have ever gotten our food. Not that it was slow, but when there is a rush it can be a long experience. That wasn't the case though. We had a wonderful dining evening. Our bartender was very funny and her drinks were tasteful, not watered down. She served us herself and was very personable. We had potstickers and chicken wontons for appetizers and both were very good. We were going to order another order of the wontons but wanted to save room for our entrees. And as for the entrees, big portions. I got the American burger, 13oz cooked medium, it was perfect. My wife ordered Beef medallions that were wonderfully cooked and my daughter got a pasta dish, both were off the skinny menu. Great concept, the skinny menu. It's for folks that are watching what they eat and calorie counting. My in laws also were very pleased with their entrees too. All in all we had a good time. ."
Diana E.,"Skokie, IL",0,7,,3.0,6/5/2017,"Really my rating is 2.5 stars.  We always get the same thing every time we come here and usually love it.  Today, everything was not prepared to standards.  Either the cooks were new or they changed how the items were prepared -- nothing was right.  We ordered six items amongst all of us and nothing looked or tasted right.  Service was also sub-par."
AJ M.,"Chicago, IL",89,488,1368,3.0,6/24/2015,"Alot of people want to hate on this place because it is a chain, but let's be honest it's prb one of the better chain restaurants out there. The menu pretty much has everything covered. From brunch to asian, pastas, steaks, salads, and burgers it's a pretty extensive menu. I love the bread they give you in the begining. The wait for food can be a drag though. With the menu being so big there are some misses, but for the most part it's pretty good. I love the tex mex egg rolls. Not a big cheesecake fan but they do have a flavor for everyone! But as others have said I must agree it is not what it used to be, but still worth a visit especially for lunch or brunch."
Jane W.,"Baltimore, MD",1155,635,1484,3.0,10/30/2013,"Overpriced, not-so-great food.  1. Setup of this place is bizarre. First floor is completely empty (almost eerily so) and you have to walk up a flight of stairs (or take the elevator) to the second floor. 2. Food is way overpriced for what you get. I dished out $13 for a bowl of chicken chili, and my food buddy paid almost $20 for a serving of fish and chips. Now don't get me wrong, I'm willing to dish out money for GOOD food. $60 for a hearty meal at Avec? Sure. $250 per person at Alinea? Glad to. But for what you get, definitely not worth the price. 3. Service is good and attentive. Sometimes a bit hard to flag down your waiter/waitress, but nothing to really complain about. 4. Their famed cheesecake (I mean, it IS called the CHEESECAKE factory) is mediocre as well. Overly sweet and almost tastes a bit processed. Tried the pumpkin pecan and was not particularly impressed.  Average all around."
Heidi B.,"Glenview, IL",420,94,492,5.0,11/22/2014,"I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory and I LOVE this location! My husband and I have tried many things on the menu and have never been disappointed. My favorites are the Luau Salad and the Oriental Chicken! It is all very filling, so it's smart to pick something from their appetizer page (of their novel of a menu), so you can save room for their namesake, the Cheesecake! They have a wide variety of cheesecake options, and while I can get adventurous, I'm all about the classic original. It's always good! The staff here is very friendly and helpful, I'm so surprised that people said negative things. I would recommend this place to anyone!"
Nick R.,"Skokie, IL",149,182,62,3.0,12/17/2014,Solid food and always enjoyable to come here. Huge menu with lots of delicious options. But after my last meal Id say they were losing their touch. The prices here seem to keep increasing to the point where they are now insulting.  I ordered the club sandwich which was $13.50. The chicken Madeira is 17.50 far to expensive for any chicken dish in a chain restaurant.  They got rid of the polenta fries which was one of our favorites.  We instead got the stuffed mushrooms which had no flavor.  The mashed potatoes were poorly made there were massive chunks of potatoes in there like they were hardly mashed.  Our server was unattentive and distracted and didn't bother to bring us bread until we asked for it.  Yes I would come back here because it's close and has a huge menu but I hope they take notice and step up their service and food quality to match their prices.
Hanch R.,"Chicago, IL",6,7,,1.0,9/2/2016,"Service was great but the food quality not. Medium rare steak was burnt on the outside Pasta was under cooked and the sauce wouldn't  mix well inside. Havent tasted the fly in the water, but I guess this happens.  Salmon was dry.  This is basic cooking. We expect more. Especially with your prices."
Sandra D.,"Lincoln Park, Chicago, IL",53,37,243,5.0,12/29/2015,"The main reason I come here is because of their ""Orio Dream Extreme cheesecake"" it so delicious!"
Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",950,833,616,3.0,11/17/2014,"It had been years since I visited this location, I used to dine here often when I worked nearby, but on a visit last week, I was pleasantly surprised by the great service and decent food here. I think this Old Orchard Cheesecake has consistently better food and service over its counterparts in downtown Chicago and other locations.  After perusing the menu, which looks more like a phone book than a menu (lots of food options and hasn't changed a bit in years!), my friend and I both ordered burgers, she got a regular and I got a mushroom with Swiss. The well done was good, not burnt, and my side salad was decent (though I should've ordered fries). Regular cheesecake for dessert was tasty. Our waiter was prompt and professional. Reminder that they don't take reservations. Overall, good experience."
Kym K.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,22,32,5.0,5/6/2016,"I am from Buffalo Grove, and I will travel all the way to the Skokie location just because of the layout. I'm all about the view and the beauty of where I am sitting. This Cheesecake Factory is unlike any of the others. I love the second floor dinning. I go here quite frequently, whether if it's for meeting a friend, a date, a family sit down or just a casual noshing session after walking thru the Old Orchard Mall. I'm pretty sure I've tried everything on the menu, (they have a large selection/variety of food). I would order these avocado egg-rolls, as an appetizer, you will not regret it. I will say EVERY TIME I sit down here, the service is nothing less than fantastic. The food is always to perfection."
Heather P.,"Chicago, IL",268,362,120,3.0,4/7/2015,"I went here for a girl's night and it was great! It was strange because you enter from downstairs, but then have to proceed up the stairs to the podium where the hosts are situated and it's the only area for seating as far as I know. This was a little bit confusing when I first got there, but once I figured it out everything went well. The hosts were really friendly and helpful when I was asking about whether where I parked was alright.  I hadn't seen the girls I was with in 13 years so we spent about four hours at our table, but never felt rushed and we were able to joke around with our server - he made the night that much more fun. All of us were able to find something to please our pallets and made sure to save room for the cheesecake dessert. The variety was nice since one of the girls was on a diet and was able to find something, another girl had dietary restrictions that the restaurant was able to accommodate and I just couldn't decide between three items. I ended up with a spicy chicken pasta that was well made and the portion was big enough that I had leftovers for lunch the next day. The only complaint is that everything looks and sounds so good, it's difficult to choose."
Channy F.,"Chicago, IL",24,43,20,4.0,9/12/2016,Service was awesome. My waitress was Tammy and she was very professional and nice. The food was good. We had 2 appetizers and i had strawberry martinis and my guy had beers. I had steak and he had steak and salmon. Food was good. Just always feel like the cheesecake factory is overpriced.
William C.,"Chicago, IL",0,13,,1.0,4/10/2017,How can you run out of orange chicken sauce. That's what a so-called manager told me. He was very rude and didn't seem to give a shit. So we will not be going back to the Skokie location anymore. It seems that all the Chicago and Chicagoland locations have gone a bit down hill. Food quality is hovering near the toilet. Been going to Cheesecake Factory since 1995. Probably my last time going to one. Plus waited 20 minutes to even see a sever.
Nishant N.,"Des Plaines, IL",37,6,1,5.0,10/24/2016,I have been going to this place for almost 2 years now and it always serves good food... my favourite is the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and Chicken Madeira.. try it and you will not regret..
Timothy S.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,2,,2.0,8/23/2015,"I've been here a few times for larger family dinners. I love the food especially the new menu options they just added. Unfortunately I can't say the same for the service we have received that last few times. Was just there last night and we started off the evening waiting 20 mins just for a glass of water. I've been a server before and can tell when a restaurant is short staffed on a busy night, but no apology the entire night is just plain ignorant. I also ordered a few apps before my meal and only got one of them. Another 20 mins go by and the server finally comes up and asks if I ever got my other app, when I say no he tells me they ran out... Everything else went fine for the most part till the end. We sat and waited again just to get dessert, I had to get up and walk to the front to get my own menu. When were ready to pay we were more than done playing the waiting game and asked another waiter to take our payment.  The issue that really put me over the edge is that it seemed that every server was more interested in closing and getting all their closing duties done than helping the customers that were there. Only reason I would ever go back is being forced to for family get togethers."
Aliona P.,"Chicago, IL",96,15,8,4.0,2/17/2016,"I had nice dinner with my husband, interior was really nice, it's very busy place. Only thing I didn't like, my dish that I ordered was too spicy."
Connie C.,"Elk Grove Village, IL",285,5,5,2.0,8/24/2016,"My past experiences have been pretty great here, but today, the hostess was pretty NOT on point. Julianna might be her name. I stood by the hostess table for a few minutes before she bothered to stop talking to her coworker to help me. After I had advised her that we would have a party of 8, she did tell me half of my party had to be here for us to be seated, which was totally understandable. However, after the whole party arrived, I went on to tell her that we were all here, and she told me it would be another 5-10 wait for them to prepare the tables. I had to wait another few minutes at the hostess table until she acknowledged me.  I'm fully aware that I do not deserve any special service nor do I feel entitled to it, but please do your job well. Especially when people are pouring in for dinner.  It really puts a bad taste in my mouth straight from the beginning. Also, my friend had a very similar experience with he same hostess.  Otherwise, food is great, servers are usually great, too."
