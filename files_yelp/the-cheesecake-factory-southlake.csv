Scott C.,"Flower Mound, TX",48,6,,4.0,1/6/2018,"Food is ok, pricey though. Their desserts are really good.   I'm only rating this specific location and service is sketchy."
Jaffar Y.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,8,1,1.0,11/25/2017,"If I could give no stars I would. My wife and I have been going to this location for several years now and we have had a couple of 'somewhat' bad experiences but nothing compares to today 11/25/17. Everything was going so well. Waitor greeted us and took pie drink orders,  no big deal. We got our appetizers and he seven came to tell us that it was ready of we wanted it and we told him 5 min. Well, needless to say that it was definitely not 5 minutes later. Approximately 15 minutes later the first manger came to inform us that the food was old and that a new one was needing made, awesome right? Nope. When it came out 2 of the 3 dishes came out horrible.  My wife's Black Jamaican Chicken and Shrimp was room temperature, if that. The extra broccoli she asked for was still cold!! My Evelyn's Favorite Pasta was so hard and it was missing 2 of the ingredients that it is supposed to have, zuchini and eggplant. To top this crappy night off, it was my wife's birthday dinner and they didn't even remember to come and sing to her. The second manager tried to help a little by offering 1 cheesecake. Not to mention she didn't even try to offer anything else.  After some time our original waitor showed back up asking for more drinks!! So disappointed Cheesecake Factory..... very bad taste left after that one. Maybe stick to the bar area next time."
Joel K.,"Keller, TX",164,55,42,1.0,11/15/2017,"Frequented this location a few times now, but the most recent dine-in experience is finally prompting me to write a review after coming in for  a birthday dinner. The Cheesecake Factory has always had quite a large and extensive menu with pretty reasonable servings on all the menu items. Food is always fair/decent. Nothing mind blowing and usually not too bad.  Salmon: The salmon here is always well seasoned and cooked properly. Never had too much issue here. Lemon Garlic-Shrimp: This item was on the Skinnylicious portion of the menu so it's to be expected that they'd likely skimp on some of the higher caloric aspects of the dish. Shrimp was just okay and the flavor was a bit meh. However, it seems in an attempt to mitigate caloric counts on this item, they pretty much omitted nearly all the sauce from this dish. You get a bit of the lemon garlic sauce on the bottom of the dish, but the noodles itself were practically dry and without taste. Which prompted us to ask for a bit more sauce on the side. Fish & Chips: The fish was tasty, but had quite a bit of breading on it. Still good, but some may prefer a little more meat. The fries came out lukewarm and dry. It seemed it may have been overcooked or could've just been sitting under a warmer a bit too long. The coleslaw that came with this dish had good flavor, but was completely drenched in dressing. It was a lot less like coleslaw and a lot more like coleslaw soup.  Pumpkin Cheesecake: Seasonal cheesecake that was very good. Creamy pumpkiny cheesecake with a wonderful crust. Whipped cream was tasty and we had no issues finishing this item. The food overall was just fair. The big issue here that I've come to see is the service. Hostesses at the front are friendly and got us seated immediately for a Sunday night dinner. Which was great considering they weren't too busy. However, what aggravated the evening was our server. He seemed very disinterested in helping us. Here are some of the issues: 1.When the complimentary bread came, it arrived cold. (Now I know it's complimentary, but I expected some consistency). I noticed others around us received bread baskets with an assortment of the white, brown, etc. Our table however, received what was a single white piece, just enough for a bite when split between 4 people and it almost seemed like it was just a leftover piece taken from another table.  2. We had asked for the Salmon dish to be split for two. It was not split. We had to ask another server, not our original one for an extra plate where we did this ourselves. (Now I know this was a request, but it was completely ignored). Not a huge deal. 3. Our server never cared to checked to see if we were happy with our food or bother to refill our drinks. Never asked how we were doing during the 1 1/2 hours that we were there. Correction... I did get a refill on my tea, AT THE END of the meal after we had waited 20 minutes for our check. Seemed like a pointless refill after we had already gotten our bill. 4. When we asked for some extra sauce for the pasta dish that really lacked any sauce/flavor, the server dropped it off at the table without making any eye contact or speaking to us. Literally just dropped the sauce at the table and walked away. 5. It was a birthday dinner and the factory was nice enough to write happy birthday on the plate of the cheesecake we ordered. Cheesecake came by fairly late after we had already waited a good deal of time after completing our meals, but we weren't in any hurry. However, when the server dropped by, he put the dessert down, lit the candle, and walked away. Again, didn't look at us, no verbal communication, and walked away. Didn't bring any new utensils, so we also had to reuse our entrée forks/spoons for the cheesecake. Overall, it was a pretty horrible experience. It seemed like he was courteous enough with all the other patrons in the restaurant, but just didn't care for us at all. It seemed like he had issues with us as soon as we arrived and we have no idea why as we have never met or spoke with him before that evening. It was not a busy evening, not all tables were filled, yet we were willfully ignored by our server. He obviously saw us when we needed something while he was helping another table, but decided not to come over and help us. We always had to flag down another server mid meal to get him to stop by. I can't fathom what was going on, actually I can, but I won't say it here. I enjoy the Cheesecake Factory, but this experience has soured my outlook on dining at this location."
Tina B.,"Southlake, TX",354,8,32,5.0,12/29/2017,Our favorite family neighborhood restaurant- we can always count on good service and delicious food!
Ted A.,"Flower Mound, TX",1,143,58,3.0,5/29/2017,"As we had a gift card, we gave this place a try for not just the cheesecake. As expected on a Saturday late afternoon we waited...and waited. Upside was that we had time to check out the massive menu so that when we did get seated we were able to quickly order. We had herb crusted salmon and steak diane for entrees and finished it off with 30th Anniversary and Key Lime Cheesecake. The entrees: as expected, large portions for roughly $20 each.  Salmon defintely rated a take home box. Steak was surprisingly better than expected and it was finished off very quickly, great pairing with the mashed potatoes. Of course you get cheesecake, and we took home large portions of both 30th Anniversary and Key Lime. 30th was very rich, definitely a chocolate lovers fix. Key Lime was perfect mix of creamy tartness, not the overly sweet taste top often presented as key lime. Overall, hard to beat their cheesecakes and the entrees, though a bit pricey, we're surprisingly better than expected. Now it is a place that is more about volume in the number of people they push through the doors (thus the overly large menu) so service sometimes is hit or miss, we experienced both. Miss: dirty silverware set set out on a ""ready"" table Miss: bits of food left on the ""ready"" table Miss: ordering coffee and having it arrive at the table completely cold  Miss: waiting and waiting and waiting to get a the cold coffee replaced with hot coffee. You want the coffee and cheesecake to be enjoyed together not as separate courses Hit: time it took from food order to seeing the entrees placed on our table Bottom line, if you have gift card, definitely go, as long as you are a patient and forgive person. Otherwise,  there lots of other places you can choose from."
Kyo W.,"Richardson, TX",0,17,41,5.0,1/9/2018,First time try burger. And it does not fail me. I should say it shocked me. Compared to steak I would prefer this burger. Much more better. But it does not mean that steak is not good. All dishes are delicious.
Lisa P.,"Flower Mound, TX",159,68,104,3.0,12/26/2017,Good food. We had appetizers and desert. The lettuce wraps were very good and the baked potato tots were delicious. Our server was super nice. I deducted a star because we had to wait a little longer than we hoped for a table and the food took a bit to come out. It was good when it came.
Rox R.,"Highland Village, TX",57,85,294,5.0,8/3/2017,"As always, food and service were superb! Came here for a birthday dinner and everything's perfect. Server very attentive and knowledgeable. Was able to help a few of us make decisions.  Food tasted fresh and oh so good! Mmmmmm. Of course, there's always room for dessert. Cheesecake anyone? Uh Yes Please :) Definitely on rotation."
Ashleigh C.,"Keller, TX",106,77,124,4.0,8/23/2017,"We came here because he wanted a veggie burger and I wanted fish... where else can you find both!!! Here! Cheesecake Factory is known for their vast menu and amazing options.  We are both watching what we eat so we ordered from the skinnylicious menu and ate for under 590 calories each. There is a major difference in calories from the skinnylicious menu. For example, the regular veggie burger plate had 1200+ calories but ordering it skinnylicious allowed for half of that!  The service was great! And here's a tip... if you decide to sit outside on the patio... you pass up the line. She didn't offer that but we asked.  Cody, our waiter, was busy out here on the patio but he did a great job management by the 5 tables including a 8 party table. We got our food fast and he was attentive and there when we needed him.  All in all, a good experience at this chain restaurant."
Eric B.,"Lewisville, TX",0,112,168,4.0,3/5/2017,"I love cheesecake, if it was a woman I would marry it.. if I was rich and did not need money, I would like to be the person that slices and plates cheesecake, think about it , you would be like the donut guy, no one hates on the donut guy, cause you make people happy first time in , I know hard to believe, but it is true  clean , service was great, food was good, price fair, etc. etc. like any other chain  selection of cheesecake was hard to choose from,  I spent 10 minutes staring at the cake case up front, like I do at the steak places that have in their cases we split the Cajun pasta which was enough for us , so we could have room for desert what would be cool is if this place either did a all you can eat cheesecake option for like $30 to $40 or a smaller slice sample plate that you could pick like 5 to 10 to sample next time I plan to walk in and skip the food and order the first 10 cheesecakes on the menu"
Eric S.,"Roanoke, TX",0,15,2,5.0,1/8/2018,"Ordered sweet corn tamales, avocado rolls and cashew chicken. No one can come anywhere close to Cheesecake Factory for these items. Taste good with excellent service."
Darin S.,"Dallas, TX",16,100,31,4.0,7/23/2017,"Service.   Delightful Menu. Immense  Food. Uneven but good recovery  Wait time. Ideal Cheesecake. Devine My family and I wanted to grab a slightly late dinner on Wednesday evening.   We stopped by Brio and found that they were running a 30-45 minute wait still.    That was going to be late for us, and so we called Cheesecake, found that they were not on a wait, and walked across the street  I've been to Cheesecake twice in 20 years and so the visit was as if I was new.     The menu is huge and so if you have a picky opinionated family like I do, it certainly provides something for everyone.  I'm glad they put the calorie count on the menu.  Our waiter was excellent, polite, patient and accommodating.    The food portions are insane.   If your party can agree to an entree I would encourage sharing Menu items were hit or miss.  They were out of a few things.  Potstickers were a little black on the pan side.   Salads were nice. Thai lime curry special was not lime nor Thai.  It was more of a Indian curry with surprising levels of turmeric and nearly no discernible amount of lime, lemongrass or coconut milk.   Chicken Marsala was perfectly fine.   They had a great kids menu and my son devoured his hamburger.  My daughter simply couldn't eat the curry and the waiter offered to replace it with another item.   They did and it was prepared at light speed.  Great recovery Final thoughts.  CF while an established franchise, is worth a relook.  I've been to Brio enough to say that there isn't really a reason for such a disparity of wait time."
Omar L.,"Euless, TX",31,11,67,4.0,11/22/2017,"Most likely my new hangout as I continue my journey to discover DFW's hidden & delicious eateries. Cheesecake is definetly not a hidden gem by any means but it's very comforting since it reminds me of home Cali. Was joined by my new friend, she ordered the Crusted Salmon and wasn't disappointed. Myself had the Chicken Romano, my favorite drink Jack & Coke. Our server (Alan) was on point. Afterwards went crazy and put down on a new Tesla model S  can't wait. God is good all the time."
Yoitzblakely ..,"Keller, TX",0,17,10,5.0,12/21/2017,"Late week night dinner. We were seated fairly quickly, service was very polite and attentive, food was delicious, overall great experience! The fried macaroni and cheese is super cheesy and so good, wish it came with more of the sauce! We had the factory burrito, biggest burrito I've ever seen, and the crusted chicken Romano. The pasta was ok, but the chicken was great! Took a strawberry cheesecake and carrot cake cheesecake to-go, of course they looked beautiful and tasted fantastic. Will be back!"
Nicole S.,"Keller, TX",194,224,301,4.0,11/30/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory!  I'm not a big fan of Cheesecake but I love their food. I ordered the stuffed mushrooms and the Farmers Omelette. I love the bread they bring out before your meal.  We got there during Happy Hour, which is Monday through Friday till 6:00pm. The staff was very friendly and professional. Love  the atmosphere. Definitely will come back!"
Eric Y.,"Houston, TX",68,177,35,5.0,7/29/2017,We enjoyed our stop at the CCF.  Went in specifically for a slice and a brew.  Both were good.  Our bar tender was more then helpful and very knowledgeable about the local beers.
Jessica T.,"Flower Mound, TX",89,84,37,1.0,9/13/2017,"Extremely disappointed with the service we received today. We came here as a last meal as husband and wife before our baby is born. We came for lunch around 1pm today.  Our server greeted us and took our drink order. Once drinks and bread were delivered, he disappeared for 10 minutes. By the time he returned, our drinks were already empty and so was our bread basket. I requested additional bread, and my husband also ordered the garlic cheese bread as an appetizer. The server asked if we wanted the appetizer before our meal, which we said we did. I could feel my blood sugar getting low and figured the garlic bread would at least come out quickly even if the free bread didn't.  Our server left to put our order in. 15 minutes later, someone comes by to offer me a refill on my drink that has been empty for over 25 minutes now, except he brought sweet, and I was drinking Unsweet. Our bread (garlic cheese bread and the complimentary bread) are still not out to our table 20 minutes minutes after we ordered. I am feeling physically ill at this point because my blood sugar is so low. I realize this is my fault for coming to a restaurant and expecting to actually get some food, but our server never even passed by our table, way in the back, for me to remind him that he had forgotten to bring us bread and drinks. Finally our entrees arrive ahead of our bread. The garlic bread comes minutes later with an apology that it took so long from the person running the food. Our server comes by when we are almost finished with our meal and says, ""Sorry your bread didn't come out when you asked. Is everything else ok?"" I had the Louisiana chicken pasta, my husband had the chicken Marsala. Both were well seasoned and tasty and came out warm.  We asked for the check. No comp was offered for the bread (still charged $10) and no apology for the terrible service.  We will not be returning here in the future. $60 for lunch for a meal with terrible service is completely unacceptable."
Bethany V.,"Grapevine, TX",177,3,,1.0,12/16/2017,"The only reason I'm giving them a star is because the server was great, honestly I have gone back and fourth on writing this review but having two managers stare you down when you had only been there for 20 minutes (when you waited an hour to sit) and then sending a hostess to ask if we were ready to go when we were clearing eating is just rude. Then continuing to stare at us until we paid our check and leave, this is an issue. I know we were not a large party but we deserve the same respect."
Shawnte J.,"Irving, TX",96,84,311,4.0,3/28/2017,The Cheesecake Factory is amazing.  A wide variety of menu options.  They have a great brunch menu on the weekends.  I love the wine menu and so can pass up on the selection of desserts offered.
Surapoj P.,"Leonia, NJ",182,10,3,3.0,10/15/2017,"Came here on a Sunday around 1:30pm. There was a lot of people so the wait time for us was about for 30 mins for two people. Once we order our food, the service took a while and we waited about another 30 mins. I ordered the pasta carbonara and it was a bit to salty. Dessert was tiramisu and it was delicious. I would recommend coming here when it's not too busy"
Sung I.,"Keller, TX",4,16,,1.0,12/31/2017,Just terribly slow.   Would not eat here again.   25 minutes plus after ordering for a monte cristo.   Basically drug here by my family.  Will be the last time.
Poppy L.,"Dallas, TX",63,140,209,5.0,4/29/2017,We don't usually eat here but was given a gift card. We decided to have drinks and a delicious cheesecake. We always enjoy sitting bar side instead of being seated in the dining section.
David C.,"Keller, TX",0,11,5,1.0,7/30/2017,"National Cheesecake Day DISASTER!!!! We came here for a birthday party for our daughter. We usually have great service but not tonight. Kitchen completely overwhelmed, most of our orders are wrong, overcooked, or burnt.  Manager is aloof and doesn't have a clue what his problems are. All he offers are excuses, not solutions.  Waitress is no help."
Sheri Michelle S.,"Houston, TX",63,95,35,4.0,7/27/2017,Really nice!  Had a beer on draft and a slice of cheesecake.  Enjoyed it very much.  Not a five star because the bathroom needed some attention and it was a bit pricey for a draft beer.  It may be the location was supposed to be upscale but still...it's beer.
Magnus L.,"Denton, TX",95,603,258,4.0,11/13/2016,"This is a good location of the Cheesecake Factory. I have always received good service here and the wait is typically not long either. We came here last time on a Friday night and we still didn't have to wait more than 20 mins. Their menu is pretty overwhelming unless you come here on a regular basis. One of my favorites is the hibachi steak which comes with Shiitake mushrooms and Wasabi mashed potatoes. It has really great flavor and I can't remember being served better mashed potatoes at any other restaurant. The grilled steak medallions from their Skinnylicous menu is also very good. If you can leave here without getting cheesecake, you have better character than I do. I like their original cheesecake with strawberries the best, simple yet full of flavor."
Elyse L.,"Euless, TX",599,677,1990,4.0,4/12/2016,"I know, I know. The Cheesecake Factory is a chain and Yelpers are supposed to focus on eating local, but there is nothing wrong with indulging in your favorite stand by every once in a while. The food is consistently good and of course their cheesecake is sublime. The menu is comically large too so picky and adventurous eaters alike can find something for them. I always order from their Skinny menu though since the normal portions could feed a small army.  My favorites include their flatbreads, Asian chicken lettuce wrap tacos, white chicken chili with steamed rice, the little house salad that has a delicious vinaigrette, and the skinny chopped salad sans blue cheese. They also make skinny cocktails and have really good soups. Be sure to ask your server what they are since they change daily.  As far as cheesecake goes, I'm not a big chocolate person so my favorites are Dulce de Leche, the original, strawberry, banana cream, tiramisu, pumpkin, and vanilla bean. I did try a bite of the Kahlua cheesecake once though, and chocolate aside that thing was pretty dang good. The complimentary bread is great too and we always seem to get awesome service. Definitely a fan of this location and plan to be back again soon."
Amanda M.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,12,1,3.0,7/29/2017,"This location just seems to have a few server issues that keep the experience from being very enjoyable.  We went on a Monday evening around 7pm so there was no wait, and not too many people in the restaurant. Yet we were sat at a table that shared a booth seat with 3 other tables, so there were four parties (us included) all smashed together in this little section. While I understand this makes it easier for the server, it was not exactly ideal.  Our server was pretty rude, and at first I tried to kinda excuse it away as just a personality thing. Some people just come across rude, but end up being the nicest people in the world. That was not the case here, sadly.  When we ordered dinner, I ordered a steak and a salad. I don't know why I ordered a steak at a Cheesecake Factory, it was a stupid choice and I'll take the blame for that. Yes, it was gross. No, it was not worth $30.  When he asked what dressing I would like, I hesitated, and thought out loud, ""oh, hmm, I can't remember if it was the ranch or Caesar I didn't really like here."" Which was really just a rhetorical statement to explain my hesitation while I decided. His response was a sigh, and ""I can't help you answer that."" Ooook.  I asked several times for sweet n low for my tea, but gave up on him bringing it after we received and finished eating our appetizer. Luckily, we were an arms reach from the table next to us and they were able to hand me one upon hearing me ask for the billionth time. (Nice Folks)  We ordered cheesecake at the end, and after we told him which kind he went on this long tangent for some coffee cheesecake and we told him ""ok yeah we will just stick with our original ones"", to which he said, ""yeah it's pretty gross, good call"". Um, what? Why did you just try to get us to order it then?  Overall it was fine, but just not a level of service we'd look forward to returning for. It pained me to leave that 20% ."
Jennifer M.,"Euless, TX",30,6,,2.0,7/25/2017,"This location has really gone downhill over the last two years, Most recent experience was using Door Dash. Ordered Thai Lettuce wraps toppings were skimpy portions, the noodles undercooked the cucumbers were old overly marinated. The lettuce leaves were old had brown spots. I was given bread but no butter, since I ordered at work had no choice to eat what I could.  Poor quality food."
T. W.,"Denton, TX",67,122,267,4.0,4/24/2016,"We dined here today and it was good as usual. I haven't been here in a while and have been wanted to go here for a while, but there isn't one in my area. This location is directly across the street from our church so on the way home, it was a must that we went here. It was a busy Sunday, but we were seated rather quickly. Once seated it took a while for our bread and drinks and even though we placed our order right away, it took a while for our meals to arrive. However, once our food arrived we were very satisfied. I had Louisiana Chicken Pasta. (It was really tasty with a nice kick, but not too spicy. I would have liked for my sauce to be a bit thicker). My youngest son had the kids pepperoni pizza (bigger than expected and he loved it. He even ate the crust, which he never does). Oldest son had the salmon ( he liked it but said it needed more seasoning or a sauce and for the price, I felt the portions could have been bigger). Hubby enjoyed the Macaroni burger. He said it was really good and he was so full that he gave the rest to the boys. The hibiscus lemonade was really good, but EXTREMELY sweet! Also I think it could have been a buck or 2 cheaper. We ordered cheesecake to go (original and salted caramel. I LOVE cheesecake, but I always go with my tried and true Original and it never disappoints.  I didn't catch our server's name, but he was good despite how busy the restaurant was."
Lauren R.,"Dallas, TX",82,54,26,2.0,2/17/2017,"Bleh. I was pumped to go here after having not been in about 5 years and after Drake's reference to Cheesecake Factory in his song 'Child's Play' - now I understand why Drake and his girl fight at Cheesecake. Or Drake lied and has never been.  My office chose Cheesecake Factory as our destination for a Friday team lunch. The menu is a novel, and not one that you want to read. So many options - I was overwhelmed. But, at least there's options for everyone. Prices were a bit high but I think that's a known fact of Cheesecake Factory.  I had the lunch portion of the cobb salad and was not a fan. Forewarning, I'm basically obsessed with cobb salad and appreciate most variations. The portion size was huge. The lettuce and egg were shredded which was off putting for me. The avocado was almost impossible to find. I was disappointed.  The service was good - no complaints here.  Some of my coworkers had burgers and pasta which looked good. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing - I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, but I left hungry and craving a (different) cobb salad."
Lexx B.,"Austin, TX",254,3,5,5.0,12/17/2016,"I was having a bad day   Decided to go to cheese cake factory with a friend and waited almost 30 min, no problem it was a busy day but I stayed cause I craved the jamacain black shrimp meal and a mimosa  Long story short ROSS omg made my night he is an incredible waiter great personality , made me laugh and smile thank you ROSS"
Tina V.,"Lubbock, TX",0,6,8,4.0,5/30/2017,"I wish the seating wait time had not been an hour but it was Saturday night.  We were just there for cheesecake so ended up ordering to go.  The Oreo and macadamia cheesecake were wonderful.  I'm not an Oreo fan but the chocolate  was so smooth!  The macadamia had plenty of nuts and great caramel. We also got a slide of the huge chocolate cake, it was enough to feed 3-4 people! Well worth the stop!!"
Sasha L.,"New York, NY",774,93,1805,3.0,1/18/2016,"This place is good if you come during a time when it isn't slammed. For example, lunch on a weekday is a good time to come. On the other hand, come here during Friday or Saturday and you'll be asked to 1+ hours. Come here with a big party and you'll be asked to wait 1+ hours and end up waiting double what they say. This has happened to me multiple times.  The food here is good even though it won't always come out as requested if it's a busy night. Service is a hit or miss depending on your waiters stress to experience ratio.  I recommend coming here, holding a spot in line, selling it to a starving party that doesn't want to wait 2 hours, and take the money you received from selling your place to go get a real dinner at Truluck's right down the block!"
Kenlyn J.,"Fort Worth, TX",76,21,10,3.0,9/10/2017,50 minutes and still waiting to eat... the place is almost dead. It's a Sunday night.
Bre J.,"Hurst, TX",0,13,9,3.0,5/17/2017,Very pretty interior design! Hibachi steak wasn't as flavorful as it usually is at other locations. Mashed potatoes had too much wasabi. My tummy was upset afterwards an they tasted strange. The waiter didn't bring back our change with our receipt. We were going to tip him but sense he didn't bring our change back we were just like ok then I guess that will be your tip. The white chocolate macadamia cheese cake. This place has alot of potential. I think a different dish would have made a world of difference.
Scott B.,"Big Spring, TX",13,410,303,4.0,8/15/2017,"Just wanted a dessert following our happy hour binge at Del Frisco's Grille. The ""Celebration Cheesecake"" was awesome. Maybe even worth the $7.95 for all that fat and calorie laden goodness. Nice counter to-go service."
Stephanie O.,"Dallas, TX",351,6,,5.0,7/29/2017,I got the chargrilled bone in New York steak and it was amazing!!! The manager Keith kept checking up on us to make sure we were doing alright. He was so sweet. Our server was Katlyn and she was also very attentive and funny. I wanted to give her a hug before we left she was so cute. Best experience at a Cheesecake Factory yet. (And I've been to many) I'll be back very soon to take advantage of their cheesecake promotion!
Leslie M.,"San Antonio, TX",236,156,106,4.0,11/13/2015,"SUMMARY: pretty overpriced for a lot of menu items and especially the wines/drinks (some are $12-$15/glass), but this is definitely worth the visit for the desserts (even the non-cheesecake ones!!) SERVICE: (5*s) our server was also the trainer for other servers and definitely paid great attention to our table. He could have suggested more expensive items but didn't, which I really appreciate. He also said his favorite dessert is the Tiramisu cake (not the cheesecake one). FOOD: (3.5*s) Gluten-free menu is built into the regular menu. Approximately 10 choices to choose from (including a Chocolate Godiva Cheesecake!!) I had the salmon with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. The salmon was grilled and was pretty dry, but fresh. Broccoli was pretty plain and boring. Mashed potatoes were a little too thick, but had decent flavor. Everything was hot. My aunt had two appetizers for her dinner: the grilled artichoke halves (she said it was VERY GOOD, but NOT gluten-free) and Ahi Tuna (she said it had too much marinade on it but was overall pretty good). TIP: artichoke quality varies by if they are in-season so be aware of that before ordering those.  We ordered three different cheesecakes: salted Caramel, red velvet and Godiva (very dense and THE BEST!!!) Red Velvet tasted more like frosting than cheesecake. Salted Caramel was pretty boring. Found out that every cheesecake they have is HANDMADE in a factory offsite (hence, Cheesecake Factory) and they have a giant refrigerator that holds 1,000 whole cheesecakes!! :O AMBIANCE: (3*s) Do NOT come here for a quiet evening--the noise level is very loud and booths are not comfortable. They need to get better cushions because my butt hurt by the end of an hour-long dinner."
Caroline B.,"Colleyville, TX",0,4,1,1.0,11/22/2017,Used to be my favorite restaurant... My daughter is 13 years old and she came here by herself with just some friends. When she asked for a kids menu they gave her lots of pushback about it because the menu says 10 and under. This doesn't make any sense because when we all go as a family they don't even ask and just give her a kids menu. She tried to explain to the server that she didn't want anything off the adult menu and that she couldn't finish that big of a portion. The server took it so far that they got the manager to come over. She said that they could do a side of chicken and a side of veggies. I just don't see the problem. They really just want money because by her eating off the kids menu it will not waste food. Usually very busy but they don't take reservations. Menu is so long it practically needs a table of contents. Do not waste your time or money!!
Blake E.,"Dallas, TX",4,43,,1.0,2/5/2017,"This is a terrible franchise to begin with--you need an hour to read through the overly extensive menu, for example--but this location is really bad. My work team actually requested this place. I ordered the lunch fish and chips, which I assumed was a specialty, because there are only a handful of items on the lunch menu. That was a mistake. The fish pieces were mostly small, and almost all breading. It came with fries and very, very mayonnaise-y slaw. Our group had appetizers, so I took part of lunch to go--my server packed the slaw with the rest...no container, right next to the fish and chips. Liquidy, mayonnaisse-y slaw...touching all the other food.  Avoid this franchise, and this location especially."
