B-Man D.,"Long Beach, CA",5,173,,4.0,2/24/2012,"I had lunch here, and ordered the pizza and salad lunch special. I got the house salad and vinagrette with the roast vegetable pizza. I must say I was pleased with the pizza as it was very good. The salad was average with too little dressing, and some of the lettuce was a bit wilted. Overall I was pleased as the service was excellent and the ambiance is nice, although not very private at some tables. I will come back when I am back in town as the menu is huge will something for everybody!"
Drew T.,"Rocklin, CA",285,879,3018,3.0,5/6/2011,"As much as I love the Cheesecake factory this one is getting a little loose. Came here on a weeknight with some friends and sat on the patio outside. Service was not as good as I've had at other locations and the food was a little off. I got the Jamaican black pepper chicken and my rice was undercooked and it took way too long to get the check and get my card back. On the plus side, the Asian Pear Martinis and Mojitos are good. The ambiance is right, although the music might be a little loud for a dinner conversation. Also, the CCF is tucked way in the back of this shopping center by the movie theater so it can be a little hard to find. At least there was lots of parking nearby. One of the better restaurants in this area, but there are a lot of other chain restaurants nearby that you might be interested in also."
Ryan B.,"Richardson, TX",222,395,202,2.0,1/14/2009,"This place (and its ilk) are what is wrong with American dining: First, it is mass-market food, designed in focus groups. There is nothing creative or original here. (""Oooh, tomatoes and basil on bread!"") The food takes no risks, has no appreciable level of spice, or any challenging combinations of herbs or textures. This is 'safe' food for adults who, as kids, would only eat hot dogs.  Next, I suspect C.F. was independently responsble for the Huge Portion trend that has taken over American dining. This gorge factor has contributed to rising Fat-abetes rates. Have you seen the trough of food they give you? I mean, really, this is obscene. Pass me my feed bag, I mean, to go box. I don't need the entire package of pasta! I don't want the entire head of lettuce for my salad. Now just about every restaurant is sacrificing quality for the Holy Grail of Quantity. Restaurants like C.F. strive for the review of, ""OMG, you get so much food for your money!"" Charge me more, give me less, but make it good.  And finally, it is ugly as hell and over-crowded. It looks like Liberace and Kimoro Simons had a contest to see who could design the most garish Las Vegas Casino. In the 1990s. Bright, disorganized, random, overly-flashy and way-to-polished.  Ok, but in all honesty, the cheesecake is really good. I would give CF one star for being the restaurnt Anti-Christ, but dammit if I don't like me some C.F. cheesecake . . . which I get at Costco. Zing!"
John B.,"Grand Prairie, TX",40,294,17,3.0,9/16/2011,"I can't recommend the Cheesecake Factory for lunch.  It simply takes too long, unless you have 2 solid hours to burn.  I certainly respect their extensive menu which features the widest assortment of flavor combinations that I have ever heard of.  That being said, I think the ""Jack of All Trades, Master of None"" label might apply here.  While I have certainly never had anything bad here, I think I would rather find a venue that offers less variety but is more of a specialist, as the variety here both pushes up the price point and causes slower service.  The size of the dining room might also have something to do with that as well.  I'm sure I'll return to the Cheesecake Factory, but I'll make sure I don't have any other plans before doing so."
Clint O.,"San Diego, CA",12,37,2,1.0,12/27/2011,Not going here again. Food doesn't have distinct flavor. The Vietnamese Summer Spring Rolls lacked flavor; not the real thing  and not worth getting. New Orleans Shrimp lacked cajun cuisine flavor but the shrimp was nicely prepped. The Godiva cheesecake was probably the best I've had but the price!
Amy P.,"Flower Mound, TX",9,55,6,3.0,1/9/2012,"It's cheesecake factory, you know the drill.  Huge menu.  A plethora of cheesecakes and other desserts.  We especially like the fried zucchini and for dessert, the carrot cake.  Entrees never seem to stand out for me."
Kyle M.,"Miami, FL",419,15,3,5.0,3/27/2014,was one of my favorite go to places w my family in highschool and today any time im back in town. amazing people amazing atmosphere and generous servings with great taste.
Michelle S.,"Keller, TX",160,52,,1.0,6/10/2013,Went there for lunch today . I have been a fan of cheesecake factory for years used to eat at the one in Frisco all the time.I  have always had a weakness for their cheesecakes . Now having said that it has been about 3 yrs since I had eaten at the Southlake one . Got there about 11:17 there were just a few people there . They are very friendly when you come in was taken to a table and as I sat down noticed the booth next to me was filthy.  On  the floor there was a bug he was dead or just playing possum:)   There were a lot of flies flying around so as I was not on a picnic this was a hugh turn off .The place also had a smell about it that was like really stale smell like it was dirty . My table was sticky . Now for being one of the first customers of the day this seemed unacceptable . I decided not to have lunch but just have my favorite vanilla bean cheesecake and some tea . The cheesecake did not taste like I remembered it was like a low calorie version of it like they scrimped on the ingredients . I could not eat it . They have really gone downhill in the 3 yrs since I ate at the Southlake one . Feel like I am writing  a obituary for them .
K L.,"Southlake, TX",12,67,,5.0,5/8/2011,"Love it here!  Great spot for Saturday lunchtime, people watching on the patio.  Good food, consistently high standards."
Chris A.,"Euless, TX",25,168,41,3.0,8/30/2012,"Never been to this place so I decided to give it a try.you pull open the big double doors in front then go in and look around and it's a pretty big place.we were seated very quickly and told our waitress would be with us   she promised she came to our table and brought us menus which looked more like books.she asked us what we wanted to drink and gave us some bread which was pretty good.she told us to take our time looking through the menu.after about 15 min of looking through the menu I decided to order the pecan crusted catfish.after about ten min and me eating alot of bread she brought my dinner out to me.the catfish came with mashed potatoes and some kind of mixed veggies.let's start off with the   me the pecans just overwhelmed the catfish.I love catfish!but with this plate I couldn't taste the fish.all I could taste was the pecans.next was the potatoes.they were mashed with the skin still in it which was pretty good.then the mixed veggies which I didn't care for too much.after I finished my meal which was not really that great,I decided to get some cheesecake to take home with me.I couldn't believe it was 7.50 for a piece of cheesecake.damn!that would buy you a meal at some places.ate the cheesecake when I got home and it was really good but not 7.50 good.the food was really not that great but the service was really good but I really doubt I'll be back anytime soon."
Beau F.,"Fort Worth, TX",74,71,7,2.0,8/11/2011,"The food wasn't a wow factor. and I hoped the cheese cake would have been better, but it was our waiter Donny who was a F***ing jerk. He made us feel as though we were bothering him by sitting in his section."
Caleb M.,"Hurst, TX",1,30,,5.0,11/18/2010,"I love this place.  Have dined here on several occasions w/ wife or small groups.  Service has always been exceptional; first time my wife and I took our 18 mth old, the waitress brought out a small plate of bread and fruit slices just for him, on her own.  I have yet to order anything on their huge menu that has been less than stellar.  Patio dining is great in the spring/fall.  I always look forward to any opportunity to have a meal here."
Jenn K.,"Coppell, TX",3,47,193,5.0,7/21/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is amazing! The menu is like a novel and it's always hard to choose something. But everything is so delicious, I have yet to be disappointed. Of course, the cheesecake is the main event. I've never had better cheesecake in my life. The Godiva Chocolate and White Chocolate Raspberry cheesecakes are my favorites. Every time I have one I expect to die from bliss. There is usually a bit of a wait, but it's understandable and worth it!"
Katherine S.,"Fort Worth, TX",2,23,9,2.0,9/9/2009,"Let me just break it down real simple like: Why you should go -  1. Best grilled-cheese sandwich ever!  Not on the kids meal but they will make it for you!  This is now what I order if I go there because the rest of the food is just average. 2. Arugula Salad - yummy! 3. Cheesecake - Now ... I am not a BIG cheesecake fan.  But, I do like PLAIN cheesecake and it is pretty good! 4.  Service is average.  Gets worse the busier they get. 5. Spacious full bar area! Why not to go - 1. Extremely expensive for what you get.  The cheesecake is good but not THAT good.  And the food is way over-priced for the quality. 2. Has that chain restaurant feel. 3. Usually so crowded that the wait isn't worth it. 4. Long wait for food to come out to table after ordering. 5. Expensive 6. Can get loud and if sitting at tables you are sitting VERY close to the next group.  Not very good for privacy. 7. Drinks are really expensive and average. 8. Not the best place for children. So ... looks like the winner is obvious.  It is probably worth a try but there are far better options out there.  Money would be better spent and stretch farther elsewhere."
Brenda S.,"Euless, TX",382,14,,4.0,7/18/2012,"Always lots of food enough for two meals or two people to share. The waitstaff smiled even though I had a friend with me that's older and she likes to make a lot of small talk. They humored her. My only complaint was the alcohol drinks were weak , I had long island iced tea, the champagne was very good and my teenager her green tea had a huge mint leaf in it  and it made it very strong mint flavored. I got the hamburger with cheddar and bacon and fries...did not like the fries they tasted like frozen food..my burger was great there..but when reheated the leftover at home it tasted bad and I threw it out. It's a very warm inviting place to sit for a long time and enjoy good company. Cheesecake we chose this time was brownie sundae....wonderful!!"
Gopi V.,"Fremont, CA",4,334,4,4.0,1/11/2011,"Just like any other cheesecake factory: great atmosphere and good food with a lot of varieties. My only gripe, a long wait for food. But the cheesecake (original flavor) easily made up for that."
Suzie L.,"Oceanside, CA",0,7,,5.0,11/11/2013,"I loved the cheesecake factory! My husband and I went a few weeks ago. It was our first visit.  (Waitress was Kim, she's very sweet) The inside interior is very beautifully decorated. I wish the staff didn't have to wear all white strange mental hospital looking uniforms. It kinda kills the whole restaurant.  My husband ordered the factory burrito, which was huge. (Comes with very good black beans, sour cream and guacamole) It was very tasteful. Full of flavor. Pretty good for a non mexican restaurant. I had the Chicken Madeira. This was so delicious. I would recommend it if you like sweet wine and asparagus. The chicken is smothered in melted cheese, and the side is normally mashed potatoes. If I ordered this again, I might try a different side if that's an option. Not that the potatoes were bad, they were very rich and creamy. I'm just not sure if that would be an appropriate side because the Chicken itself is very filling and mashed potatoes will really pack up some room in your stomach.  Now for the dessert. There's so much to choose from. We finally decided to get the Banana Cream Cheesecake. It was very very pleasing. The cheesecake is perfect. It's topped with whipped cream and fresh sliced banana. It reminded me of banana cream pie.  We would absolutely come back here. Food was amazing and the service was nothing but fast and friendly."
Preston B.,"Queens, NY",25,100,1,3.0,7/8/2007,"OK... I have also been to 4 different locations and I don't think this is 5 stars.... at all. The one here in SF is worse than the southlake one, Imagine it being in the middle of a million person town and in the center of the shopping/tourist section. Waits AVERAGE around 2 hours every single day. So in southlake here, when I went, it was about a 45 minute wait and my mom tells me on weekdays it is almost no wait. There is nothing AT ALL different between any of the locations except wait time. From what I have noticed they all seem to have terrible service and timing. I usually always get the bread about 20 minutes after being seated and they apologize EVERY single time saying that there is backup in the oven... okay.... let's correct this problem... since it ALWAYS happens at every single location. The Dinners are not grand... but they have grand prices... why? Why does a chicken dish need to be $19? No I can't afford cheescake... which is the reason I came in the first place. The service staff seems to always be disoriented and not caring. The ONLY amazing thing about this place is yes... their cheesecake. It really is worth 5 stars if I just went to get cheescake to go... which they should maket more than sitting down for a 30 dollar dinner... per person. I LOVE the apple streusel cheescake... it is to die for. And yes... obviously the cheescake is shiped in, but most deserts at resturants are, they just won't admit it. You can't taste it though. Wait Time... tick tick tick Dinner... ehh Service.... BLAHHH puke, Cheesecake... *changes underwear*"
Mike Z.,"Dallas, TX",386,155,4,2.0,4/20/2009,"I ate here 2 nights ago. I ended up meeting some of my family members that I have not seen in almost 16 years. I (like always) showed up 30min early and had a drink at the bar. I like how the bar is right next to the doors, so you can see everyone that walks in. And its an OK size bar area at that. Another plus, was they had Fat Tire on tap...which is always good in my book. I met up with the family and we still had to wait about 30-45 min for a table. When we got to our table, we sat and we all talked for a while. Our waiter came over very quickly and asked us for our drinks. Another Fat tire for me PLEASE. Well, it never came. I had to ask him a second time. This happened twice. So the service was not all that great. The food ...I had the Jamaican shrimp. Now, I like spicy food but this dish was just a tad bit to spicy for me. It was good just too much heat. I had to wash it down with Fat Tire...oh wait I didn't have one. RATS....but overall it was just OK. I have eaten at other CF in Vegas and the 2 in Dallas and this one was probably the worst one as far as service goes. The food is really the same at everyone. I would go back if I had to.  MZ  OH...and I did take 2 pieces of cheesecake home. I had the regular strawberry and i brought my wife the Carmel raspberry truffle. She really liked hers...but for some reason to me, theirs does not taste any better than any other that I've had. Maybe I guess I really don't eat it enough to remember whats good and whats not. Don't get me wrong...it was good, very good."
Chris F.,"Brooklyn, NY",55,246,13,3.0,7/13/2006,"The portions are huge, and the food is decent, although you're always very aware you're at yet another chain restaurant trying to pass itself off as something classy. The pulled pork sandwich is OK, although I've had better pretty much everywhere I've ever had one, so I can't recommend it.  Avoid the mojitos as well; they're made with the cheater's method of mint simple syrup rather than muddled mint leaves, and the sprinkling of dried mint on top doesn't do much to convey authenticity. The salads are the big winner here.  For one person, get a appetizer portion, and take a small amount home, or get an entree portion, and have enough left over for another full meal."
