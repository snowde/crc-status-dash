Jams B.,"Richardson, TX",0,8,2,5.0,7/23/2016,"They always have something I'll eat. I've gotten their Thai, their burgers, their chinese and of course you can't forget how great their cheesecake is. They're the reason I even like cheesecake. And they're a big and nice restaurant so there is room to take the kids and wander around and keep them occupied"
Nessa M.,"Grapevine, TX",32,4,3,5.0,8/24/2014,"I don't ever expect a whole ton when dining at chain restaurants, but our dinner tonight at cheesecake was awesome. Our server, Mikey was what made the evening. He was extremely outgoing and helpful. Everything an awesome server should be!  The crispy Cuban rolls were the  ! Def a must try!"
Nadia M.,"Novato, CA",7,43,317,5.0,6/14/2015,Amazing food and customer service. If you want to feel special give it a try. Great place to enjoy your evenings.
Natasha S.,"Fort Worth, TX",25,7,83,4.0,1/23/2015,"The genius of Cheesecake Factory is that they have an enormous selection of all cuisines.  If you have a picky buddy that's the place to take him.  Asian fusion, tex-mex, seafood, steaks, kids menu , salads, sandwiches.  You name it.   And of course their deserts. They also have very well stocked full bar  so :).  The wait staff is usually very professional and polite"
Dan D.,"North Richland Hills, TX",42,38,,1.0,10/8/2014,"I just first need to preface this 1-star review by saying, overall, our food and service was WORTHY of 4-5 stars on this very rare date night occasion for my wife and I last night, BUT, it was the lack of accountability and responsibility BY THE MANAGER himself that earns my 1-star review. Here's the rub: my wife found two 1""x1"" pieces of aluminum foil in her Shepherd's Pie and actually accidentally swallowed a third piece. I mentioned it to our server, who was very apologetic, and told him I didn't want to make a big deal out of it but to let him know so he can tell the cook to watch out next time so it doesn't happen to someone else.  The manager then came over a few minutes after and just apologized for it and walked off. I then leaned over to my wife and said to her, ""If this manager/boss truly cares about the customer's experience and not just about the bottom line, our ticket will have your meal comped."" The check arrives and low and behold: no comp and not even a free dessert NOR did they even offer to take the food away and bring her a fresh one!! Give me a break! I get that it was just 2 little pieces of aluminum foil (actually 3 since my wife accidentally ATE ONE) and in the grand scheme of things it wasn't that bad (like hair or bugs in food) but the sheer fact that the manager didn't do ANYTHING to show culpability or accountability is what really bothers me. It can't just be about the bottom-line when it comes to the restaurant business. You HAVE to care about the overall experience these days, or else you won't have any people in your restaurant to begin with. I still do really like their food and the patio atmosphere is still really appealing, but it's a sad state when a date night dinner includes Burgers, Shepherd's Pie, and aluminum foil."
Zabo F.,"Grapevine, TX",2,12,1,4.0,5/1/2016,We hardly ever go to chain restaurants but Cheesecake Factory is an exception. We came here on Saturday night and it was extremely busy. It only took 20 minutes for us to be seated. For a starter we got the crab bites and they were delicious!! Then for dinner I got chicken stuffed tortillas and they were amazing as well! I highly recommend this restaurant.
James Z.,"Keller, TX",3,19,16,2.0,2/27/2016,"Food is good, and cheese cakes are great at this chain store.  Unfortunately services is extremely lacking at this particular location.   We were seated at the patio area outside.  It was a bit cold outside when we were seated at about 7:30 PM.  The hostess assured us that the heaters on the patio would keep us warm.  However, they turned the heaters off after 8 PM, even though the patio was still fully seated.  We asked 2 different servers 3 different times to turn the heaters back on.  They turned on the heaters, except for the one directly above our table.  We finally had to ask for the manager about the situation.  He investigated and told us that the knob for our heater was broken off, and he had to put it back to turn it back on.  Well, it would not have happened if they did not turn it off in the first place.  In all, it took 45 minutes to turn a simple heater back on. I ordered the Pit Beef Dip sandwich.  They forgot to bring Au Jus with the sandwich.  A few minutes later, they brought me a cold cup of Au Jus.  Because service was so poor, I did not even bother complaining about it. Cheese Cake Factory is a great chain restaurant, but I would not recommend this location in Southlake."
Meredith W.,"Irving, TX",42,64,75,4.0,2/15/2015,"Great selection of food, something for everyone so it's a great place for groups.  The salads and small plates are great and usually enough for a meal.  The entrees are flavorful and the servings are generous so there is plenty to share.  Kids meals are great and come with a drink.  Brunch on Sundays starting at 10 and fills up fast.  Save room for dessert.  The cheesecake is deliciously sinful and well worth the calories."
Patty M.,"Keller, TX",0,1,,1.0,3/31/2017,"We have eaten at Cheesecake in Southlake since the restaurant opened. We just ordered food from them through Door Dash and it just wasn't prepared nor served in the same manor it is in the restaurant. I called to let the restaurant know we were disappointed and the person who answered the phone told me it wasn't their fault but I could talk to the manager. The manager came to the phone and also told me it wasn't their fault, that it was the Door Dash drivers fault the food was not prepared nor packed right and if I wasn't happy with the food to tell Door Dash. Both people were extremely argumentative. All I wanted was an I'm sorry you weren't satisfied with the quality of the food and we appreciate you letting us know, but instead I got an argument and finger pointing to Door Dash. We have ordered from Door Dash from many local restaurants and been very satisfied with what we received. I hate writing reviews, I never do it, but because the staff at Cheesecake was SOOOOO argumentative I joined Yelp just so I could give them a bad review. So, as the norm, I enjoy eating at Cheesecake because I enjoy the experience, but the manager(if he really was the manager) has dropped Cheesecake from my list of choices and, from the other reviews I read, I am not alone in how the manager has responded to a dissatisfied customer. Plenty of other excellent restaurants to eat at in Southlake."
Dee B.,"Grapevine, TX",117,77,102,4.0,7/14/2015,Great great food at this location!  We had a group of 8 and only a 15 min. Wait in a crowded restaurant. Everyone was happy with their orders! Of course we got cheesecake  ..but to go since we were so full.
Cassie M.,"Keller, TX",1,4,4,1.0,8/11/2015,Left my card here and came back for it as soon as I realized it I spoke to a manager and he told me the other manager left and took MY card with her HOME!? Why home ?
Kate R.,"Dallas, TX",80,421,62,3.0,6/11/2014,"So here's the thing.  Cheesecake Factory accidentally tried to kill me.  The boyfriend and I went there one Saturday to get the best soup ever (creamy chicken artichoke), ordered our soup and a meal to split, and waited. When our soup was delivered, the bf dug right in. I knew something was off the minute it was placed in front of me. I asked him if it tasted funny, and he said it was great and kept eating. I took one bite and knew that it was off. A second bite quickly told me this is definitely NOT creamy chicken artichoke, it was something with seafood. Holy shit, this is clam chowder. Oh my god.  Now, those of you that know me (or have read my reviews) know that I eat NOTHING FROM THE SEA.  Only after I said ""SEAFOOD!"" did my boyfriend realize he was eating clam chowder. He loves seafood and clam chowder (and he eats really quickly), so he didn't notice.  We called the server over and he was really non-chalant. ""Oh. Man. Sorry. I don't know how long we've been serving that. The kitchen is still telling everyone it's chicken."" As I run to the bathroom to try not to die, my boyfriend deals with it.  When I come back out, the manager is there and he is super super apologetic.  It was an awful experience and we didn't go back for about 5 months. When we did start to go back, the service was spotty at best. They had seen a LOT of turnover and the new servers were not up to par.  Now, the best waiter in the entire world, Lee, makes up for all of that mess. We always ask for him when we go in. They changed the chicken artichoke soup to Sundays (which sucks, but it is what it is), and Lee always quadruple checks that it's chicken before brings it to me. He was NOT the waiter on that night, but we mentioned it to him and he apologized to us for about 20 minutes. He is seriously one of the best in the entire business. He knows his customers, likes his regulars, jokes with us, and takes excellent EXCELLENT care of us every single time. Even if he's worked open til close for four days in a row, he's still on his game. I give Lee 6 stars because he really goes that much above and beyond.  If Lee isn't there, it's hit or miss. It's been better in the past couple of months (I know that Lee has been training a couple of new hires, so maybe that's the difference), but if Lee isn't around, we lower our expectations a little. It's kind of sad, but there you go.  Go on Sunday, eat the chicken artichoke soup, sit in Lee's section if he's there. You'll probably see us somewhere over there."
Sarala L.,"Grapevine, TX",2,6,,2.0,8/31/2015,"My husband and i had dinner there lastnigt. Our night there from start to finish was not very good. Starting off my husband wanted ice cffee, they said they dont make it. So he ordered regular coffiee and got a cup of ice....wow like that ws hard to do...well we orded our dinner after we got our coffee. Our waitress asked if we wanted bread, my husband said yes.....we waited and waited and never got our beard. Later someone else came out with our dinner. We ate, I got he meatloaf...it was a little salty from the gravy but it could have been perfect if not for that. My husband got the turkey burger, it was DRY....he aht half of it. He couldnt eat his fries because it was to salty. After we finished our dinner my hasband asked if we should have cake or smething. I said yes "" lets get the straberryshort cake and ice cream. Low and behold THEY RAN OUT OF VANILLA ICECREAM. hahahahahhahahah My husband and use to go there often and we have always enjoyed our time and food there but last night was ...well a two star night. We live just down the street frim there so i wont say i wont be going back but just not any time soon."
Harald L.,"Southern Pines, NC",0,5,,5.0,1/2/2016,"Service was great, food was excellent...I have NEVER had a bad experience here. My glass was always full, portions were Texas size and we all walked away happy."
Bridgette R.,"Cedar Hill, TX",46,4,4,5.0,2/2/2015,"I always enjoy eating at this location. Our waitress, was so friendly and even though Saturday was busy and lots of people, we were seated in the time they gave us. I don't mind a wait as long as it's around the time given. The food is always GREAT and there are a ton of selections. We go to church across the street and will definitely visit more often!"
K C.,"Bedford, TX",32,73,60,5.0,9/9/2015,LOVED EVERY BITE. waitress was so kind and adorable. She suggested food off the menu and I am so glad I went with it. Delicious.
Ciara U.,"North Richland Hills, TX",37,31,14,3.0,4/17/2015,"I am giving this location 3 stars for a few reasons. I would like to say first that I've been here several times so this is not a one time bad experience review. I would say out of the 10-12 times I have visited I have had 5 bad experiences but none of those times were food related. The food has always been top notch and delicious. While the prices are high, the portions are large and the food tastes fresh and delicious!  So here is where the loss of 2 stars comes for me. When I visit with only my husband or only a girlfriend I seem to have great service. If I'm there with a few friends they treat me like a teenager (I will be 30 this year and we do not act like teenagers in public so nothing warrants this) and if I bring my kid I might as well go back home. Once I was there with my husband and our son (he was 5 at the time and being very well behaved). We were around 3rd in line waiting for a table and we waited for 45 minutes before I asked the hostess when we would be seated. She told me she had called our name ""several times and we had not responded"". Well the problem with that theory is that I had been watching the hostess stand the entire time because it was loud in there. Our buzzer had also not gone off but she could not explain that. Instead of offering us the next table she put us back in line. After about 20 minutes she seated someone who had just arrived and was in the same size party, so I calmly informed them that we were leaving and I would like to speak with a manager. The manager could not be bothered with me and didn't care. So I contacted corporate and they sent me a gift card.  Another time when I sat down at my table I had completely dirty silverware but it had been set by someone. So someone set the table and didn't notice there was literally a bite of cheesecake still sitting on a fork (no exaggeration). However our service that day was otherwise good."
Lysette R.,"Costa Mesa, CA",319,3,,1.0,7/17/2016,"Tried ordering takeout and I waited at the curbside for 25 minutes after having called twice and being hung up on. Then when I went inside they had ""lost"" my order. Not worth the wait."
Chris G.,"Keller, TX",162,167,123,4.0,6/11/2012,"Went there Yesterday.  Cheryll had the chicken quesadillas, She said they were good.  Thai chicken wraps - Awesome I had the everything pizza for $12 with all kinds of toppings. - it was really the best.  We ordered the guacamole and chips for an appetizer. We asked for mild. This was really good guacamole. It comes with a side of Pico De Gallo, be sure to put that on your chip with the guacamole. It is awesome, We couldn't stop eating this stuff.  Top shelf margarita wasn't so good - it tasted like sweet and sour mix. I think top shelf means it tastes smooth because you are getting the higher quality liquor and liquer in the drink. Seems like the mix shouldn't ruin that.  Khalua Cheesecake is absolutely perfect. I love coffee so I loved this."
Garrett C.,"Euless, TX",0,2,,1.0,5/25/2015,"Let me start by saying, I have been a loyal customer to this location for 2 years now.  I called ahead for a curb side pickup today 5/25/15 at around 5 pm.  When i got home I checked my order and notice that the Thai Lettuce wraps came with very small butter lettuce pieces.  If i cut the pieces of chicken into 1/4's they still would not fit into the wraps, when in the past they would fit into the lettuce wrap without cutting them.  I have ordered these in the past and the lettuce that comes with it was 5 times larger than what I got.  It looks like they got to the end of the lettuce and didn't want to throw it away.  I ended up throwing away this part of the meal as you need the lettuce to enjoy it.  If you order to go please check your whole order."
