Ashleigh D.,"Fort Worth, TX",201,323,6,5.0,11/15/2012,"SO MANY CHOICES AND THEY ARE ALL GOOD! I CRAVE CHEESECAKE FACTORY DAY IN AND DAY OUT! The Renees special is perfect for lunch, and very affordable. It's the best place to meet up with your friends for any meal at any time of the day. They've got a full bar and wonderful service."
Yeah R.,"Grapevine, TX",31,10,2,2.0,4/18/2014,"While the food is always average or a little above, I have only been to cheesecake factory a few times at this location because their service is so incredibly slow. Today at 1pm was no exception.  We walked right in with no wait. Restaurant was probably not more than 50% full.  Items as simple as a salad, hamburger, and flatbread pizza took 45 minutes to be delivered to the table after the order was taken. This was only a table of four.  I wanted to eat lunch there, not spend the entire afternoon.  It will probably be at least another year before I give them another shot. I suggest you do the same unless you have an afternoon to kill. I can't even imagine what it would be like if they were busy!"
Ali G.,"North Richland Hills, TX",317,552,114,3.0,8/17/2012,"We had a good experience here last night. Our waiter was fantastic - personable, attentive, and welcoming. The bread was yummy and fresh. We got the avocado eggrolls. They were alright, but I wouldn't order them again. Didn't leave me with a good enough impression to want them again. I had the same experience with my entree (spicy chipotle chicken pasta) - it was pretty good, but I would try other things if I came back. Neither dish wowed me; they were just mediocre."
David B.,"Flower Mound, TX",184,83,96,4.0,4/8/2012,I was first exposed to the Cheesecake Factory in LA and had a great experience. Once I learned that there was a Cheesecake Factory close to home I gave it a try again. It has been consistently good from one location to another. I particularly like the Meso Salmon on a bed of steamed rice and for dessert just about any cheesecake but specifically the Godiva chocolate cheesecake.  During peak times expect a long wait as they don't take reservations. Eating outside is nice even when it's cold they have adequate outdoor heating.  Located on the back side of Southlake Town Center. They do have to go parking if you are picking up. It's located adjacent to the back side of the building. They are next door to the movie theaters.
Bryan R.,"Grapevine, TX",10,15,11,3.0,10/31/2015,"I like it here but my wife likes it a lot more then I do.  I don't understand why they place the silverware directly onto the table?  I watched a bus boy clean the table, he uses a white cloth, barely wiped the table with it, used the same cloth on the bench seats, goes back to wiping the table and walks off. A few mins later he returns and sets the silverware right on the table that he just half ass cleaned with this nasty looking rag.  Kinda gross if you ask me.  Hope my food is good."
Brad N.,"Frisco, TX",486,1053,234,3.0,7/29/2012,"As I mentioned to a co-worker when I learned that this venue had been chosen for a going-away luncheon: ""At least we'll have enough food for lunch and dinner"". His response: ""Yeah, for three days"". :) Such is the legend of Cheesecake Factory, with their classically huge portions. Unfortunately, my experience with the quality side of the equation has been less than stellar, but I was hopeful on this, my first visit to this location.  Inside, it looks like most of the other CF locations I've been to: Big, grandiose and fancy. We were seated quickly, as our group had made reservations. Drinks were ordered and served without delay, as was the pre-meal bread served along with butter; it was a decent loaf but not outstanding, somewhat of a mild sourdough.  Perusing the extensive menu, I had to chuckle when I found a dish that, in its description, read in part ""huge burrito"". If CF says it's ""huge"", how big is THAT? I decided to give it a miss in favor of the lunch portion of shepard's pie. It's a little unconventional, but all of the right ingredients are there: brown sauce, carrots (slivered, in this case), ground beef, peas and a nice mashed potato topping, but served in a bowl with the potatoes as a ""shmear"" on top, rather than baked together. It wasn't a bad dish, but it could have used more flavor. It tasted much like the sum of the ingredients, no more.  We decided to forego dessert as we were having snacks back at the office later, so no cheesecake this time. This was probably one of the better meals that I've had at this chain, but I prefer something with a little more taste ""character"" when I spend this much money."
David C.,"Austin, TX",63,1,,1.0,2/18/2015,Bad service and food was undercooked!  I asked for the burger to be well done and it came out red and cold. I told the waiter I could not eat it and he did not even care. I asked for it to be taken off the bill and again he did not care. Total waste of time and money in this sub par restaurant and I for one will not be back!
Michelle B.,"Borger, TX",41,68,8,5.0,7/20/2015,"I will say that when my mom, sister, and I ate here during a girls' weekend in June, I was a little overwhelmed by the menu at first. However, my sister gave us some tips from having dined there before. We split a chicken dish with basil pasta and a ricotta and chicken flatbread. Both were super tasty and more than enough food for the three of us. We split the red velvet cheesecake and key lime pie cheesecake between us as well, and it was delicious. We went on a Thursday evening and were seated immediately. Our service was also top notch with great wait staff. The restaurant is beautiful inside and has amazing atmosphere. It is definitely somewhere I would dine again!"
Mary B.,"Euless, TX",13,7,,5.0,8/16/2015,"Seriously my favorite place to go! I love the Orange Chicken, and I sub the rice for mashed potatoes.. So so good!! The red velvet cheesecake is one of the best, but my staple is the snickers."
Leslie N.,"Fort Worth, TX",14,6,1,2.0,6/1/2014,"Was told 5 minute wait... 45 minutes later we were still waiting. My unsweetened tea came, with no sweetener even after she asked. Sourdough bread was burned on the bottom, no wheat came out. When she came back to take our order, I had to ask for sweetener to drink my tea. The waitress was nice, the food and experience weren't good.  Will think twice before spending $40 for 2 people for 2 omelettes. No alcohol... #notgood"
Joe I.,"Argyle, TX",0,6,5,2.0,12/24/2014,"I know that it's Christmas Eve but you expect for a place like this to be prepared for a busy night.  We came early knowing that last year, there was a 3hr wait during peak time.  We came at 4pm and were told a 20 minute wait.  After 45 minutes, we were told that their buzzers were not working so they lost track of people's seating sequence.  Finally after being seated, it only got worse.  Ten minutes pass before our waitress shows up, takes our drinks and moves on.  Another 10 minutes pass by before water  is served. She leaves before we can get our appetizers ordered. After the ordering ordeal, my medium-well burger comes out charred.  My kid's bow tie pasta was like chewing on a rubber band. And the delay to get drinks was unbelievable.  I informed our waitress of my meal, she did take it off our tab but not until I pointed it out that I was still charged for it.  By this point, I had made up my mind that I would never be coming back again.  Then, an interesting chain of events took place.  The manager, Ellery, came over and deeply apologized for the mishap.  Not only did he not make any excuses but went on to tell me that he would make things right if we gave his establishment another try and to ensure that we would not have a repeat of our experience, he gave me his card and said to ask for him when we come back.  If he had to, he would personally service our table. This is the type of customer relations that you expect from these type of higher end restaurants.  I give this a 2 star experience but give Ellery 5 stars for handling the situation professionally.  We frequent this location quite often and we had decided to not come back but because of Ellery's decision to manage the situation with the utmost highest level of customer service, we will be giving this location another chance."
Steve K.,"Boston, MA",149,504,235,3.0,5/28/2013,"The same over-spiced, overly-salty, oversized portioned food you find at every other Cheesecake Factory in the country.  I remember maybe 15 years ago, Cheesecake Factory was the place to go on a date.  Like, it was the ""impressive"" place to go because of the over-the-top decor, as well as that bible-sized menu.  Now, it just seems like over-glazed, over-sauced, over-done food. I went here for lunch and had the lunch-sized portion of shepherd's pie.  It was good, and I cleaned my plate - it's just that the sauce or whatever they use on their food - it's just too ""much"".  Like, I couldn't actually taste the meal because the sauce was so overly-flavorfull - too many spices - like it's not real food.   And why do I never ever see anyone ever order the cheesecake!?  It's a nice place - big and it has that cool decor that is oh-so Cheesecake Factory.  Our waiter was certainly nice enough.  I'm just done with the food.  I'll go if I have to - but on my own I'll never choose to go there again."
Haley K.,"North Richland Hills, TX",67,530,71,3.0,1/17/2012,"Pros: Large portions; my mom, 4 year old and I usually split one plate and one of their small dishes/appetizer.  Variety of foods.  Desert: We've liked everything we've gotten from here. Cheesecake- I am not a big cheesecake fan but I like the various flavors from here. More than likely not made from scratch on site but I honestly having worked food service not very many restaurants make deserts from scratch.  They bring a bread & fruit appetizers for my kiddo when she comes with us; which I really appreciate!    Cons:  Price: While you certainly get the amount of food for the money in most cases, I can see how you can easily run a 40-50 tab for two people.  The food has never been really bad; but I have not been really knocked out of the park by anything I've gotten. The times we were; we ordered it again another visit and wasn't as impressed.  It can get REALLY busy here; so sometimes on date night we eat somewhere else in the town center & go there just for desserts & drinks or just pick it from their dessert bar. Even then if you sit down for drinks and desert we've been there for 45-hour just for dessert. While we've had great service and bad service the most interesting times have been when we do just do dessert. Even though it usually turns into a 15-20 tab depending on what you get; you usually get ignored for the most part for the tables ordering meals. I.E. drinks not being refilled, having to flag someone down for the check or Togo boxes when necessary, etc Which I understand your pushing for bigger tips on the bigger tickets but when most tickets are 40-50 I'd expect fairer treatment."
Stephanie A.,"Irving, TX",15,77,11,2.0,11/30/2014,"I keep trying to go back here as this used to be a family favorite. The service and food is rapidly getting worse. The last time I went in here a few weeks ago, I felt anxiety and disappointment from the start. First, I asked for two iced waters NO lemon. He comes back with water with lemon. He takes it back and takes the lemon out and gives me the water back. He sends someone to come get my order. The order was wrong and gross. He sends another person to have me pay my bill. Everyone rushed and was unkind. No one treated us with any respect. Finally I spoke to the manager who was new and he comped the entire thing. He said if I came back it our service would be way better."
Bianca S.,"Plano, TX",310,392,61,4.0,12/30/2013,"I would come here for a special treat lunch every so often with coworkers and we were never disappointed.  With the gargantuan menu everyone can find something they like.  The last two times I was here I had the same server, Diane.  She is very good and will take care of all your dining needs, whether its extra tartar sauce, split checks, or wrapping up your meal to go. Some of my lunchtime favorites are the Asian Chicken Salad and the Fish and CHips. Everything can be split and they now have these little snack appetizers that are perfect with a salad or soup.  I never have room for dessert but you already know it's pretty good!"
Tim K.,"Arlington, Jacksonville, FL",103,67,7,4.0,1/20/2014,"Chipolte chicken fried Mac n cheese is amazing! This location is notoriously busy so plan ahead, or walk next door to Borders and check out some books or grab some java while you wait. TCF menu is huge so you arent likely to not find something you like, for each course, even lighter calorie options on the SkinnyLicious® menu. TCF is known for high calorie meals, not to mention the delicious deserts, but you can choose lower cal options if desired. The Chinese Chicken Salad and the Sante Fe Salad are awesome."
Glenn V.,"Flower Mound, TX",105,45,1,4.0,6/8/2013,Although you have the word Cheesecake right in your name....I never get a slice! Not because I don't want one..but because I am just too dang full whenever I leave your place. The pros:  ** I love their Chicken and Biscuits.  Hands down...best dish on the menu!   ** I love their brown/wheat bread that they give out to every table.  Who wants that hard crusty white bread when you have that wonderful soft buttery tasting wheat bread. **The service is good here.  The servers are over-worked and are constantly double sat but they still do a good job.   Just a hint - make sure you order your entire meal as soon as you sit down.  The managers by the way are awesome! The cons: **The wait time is ridiculous.  If you go on a weekend..prepare to wait more than 1 hour.  If you have a huge group..prepare to wait more than 2 hours. I dont know why they don't do reservations....ugh (That's why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars) **Do they really need over 1000 items on the menu!  I swear..sometimes when Im reading the menu...its like I'm studying for a test.  When it comes time to order..I usually forget what I want and have to flip through 30 pages of ads to find the dish I wanted. All in all...CF is a good place to have a casual lunch/dinner and definitely the best option at Southlake Town Square.
Brandon T.,"Evansville, IN",17,42,32,4.0,1/3/2015,"Love the Cheesecake factory! It's been one of our favorite chains for a while. Good food, portions, usually good service, and great atmosphere. A great spot if you're wanting good, consistent food when you're feeling not so adventurous."
Mark H.,"Lantana, TX",0,3,,2.0,2/28/2016,Once again we went to this place and we were told it would only takes 20 minutes to get a table. It took 45 minutes. NICE JOB CHEESECAKE FACTORY! Every time we come here this is what happens! Of course we inquired about our table and they said your table is almost ready. That's BS! My food Thai salmon was tasteless. I will say our waiter Donald was awesome. I will NEVER come back though. I gave them a 2 because of Donald
Dirk N.,"Dallas, TX",0,637,144,5.0,7/22/2011,"Pretty pricey, but the best food overall at any restaurant I've been to. One of my favorites. As Jim Gaffigan once said, I like bread OK, but when I go to a restaurant I CRAVE bread. It's very good here, though I haven't had to cancel my entree because I ate too much of it :) I usually go for the Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya. Definitely one of the best pasta dishes I've had. I've tried other things as well and they've been good. Now, there is really no cheesecake like The Cheesecake Factory. I don't know if it's because there are so many calories in them or what, but they are literally to-die-for. I could see myself taking a bullet or two for a bite. Anyway, I've tried tons of them and think my favorite was the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. Only negative is these things are SO rich, so it's very tough to finish one after you've already filled up on food and bread. Service is usually good, but it can get very crowded sometimes and we've been forgotten about by the staff while waiting once or twice."
