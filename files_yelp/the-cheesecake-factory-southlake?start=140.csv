Cat N.,"Dallas, TX",1122,1401,1473,3.0,11/29/2010,"I'm so dissapointed in you cheesecake factory!!!! you failed me this time!!! I was here for dinner with a group of friends because one of them is leaving the US for India for a whole two months.  They had a special menu and I know better to order from special menu's because that's when restaurants test out their new dishes. but anyway, I saw that they had mushroom salsatory (sc) steak so I got it!!! The plate arrived and my friend goes, that looks like lean cuisine frozen dinner. I was like shut up, no it doesnt! so I took the first bite and it did taste like frozen dinner but I wasn't going to admit it to my friend. lol I ate the green beans and mash potato but took the steak home. Was gonna eat it for lunch today but I couldnt stand it so I threw it away.  the chocolate coconut cheesecake dessert was delicious though!"
Tiffany D.,"Arlington, TX",1767,869,756,4.0,12/8/2010,I came here for an appetizer with Paul H. :D  We came here for the ahi tartare. It's one of my favorite small plates because it's soo flavorful. Ahi tuna + avocados = om nom nom  There are only four wonton crisps so don't be shy and just pile it on!
Mark C.,"Southlake, TX",0,2,,5.0,3/10/2016,"Great place to eat, nice atmosphere, varied menu, professional servers - what more could you ask for?"
Jackie C.,"Chicago, IL",144,543,107,4.0,3/4/2013,"My Mom loves this place and so when we get together we always find ourselves at a Cheesecake Factory. This location is huge!! I love their patio, it makes for great people watching! I suggest the Skinny Mojito and the Lettuce Wrap Tacos! Both are low in calories and light but definitely filling."
Joe A.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,32,4,2.0,2/15/2015,"No real wine list. Always a wait. They said 10 minutes but it ended up being 20. Poor service when finally it arrived. The food was okay and quite well prepared and if it wasn't for the poor service and seating experience, it probably would have been 4 stars. I definitely will not return."
Roger G.,"Southlake, TX",4,27,32,4.0,1/18/2015,Excellent lunch and dinner and Sunday brunch. A large variety of menu items... all great food.
Sheila C.,"San Diego, CA",69,402,10,2.0,2/13/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory's menu is just too large to provide a great meal. I have eaten there a few times and it has been just decent. The cheesecakes are great, but for a healthy diet, they are just too big.  Last night's dinner was horrible. We ordered a new thing on the menu (yesterday was the first day serving it) Portabello, Zucchini and Avocado Fries. The waitress came back and tol use they are out of portabello mushrooms, they can serve the other two and it will be on the house. They did taste pretty good, but I missed the mushroom. The jambalaya pasta we ordered was very bland. It had no spice and was lacking something. I ordered off the Skinnylicious menu, and though the salad sounded good, the flavors did not complement each other at all. It was the Fresh Vegetable Salad. I am all about my veggies, but it was not a good  mixture.  The service was good, I can't complain. Overall I think if they cut down the menu and focused more on the cheesecakes, they might produce better quality food."
Sachin P.,"Grapevine, TX",0,13,,3.0,9/22/2014,"Superb ambience. The food was good as usual. we ordered some vegeterian pasta which was good. Then Jamaican Chicken+Shrimp+Beans+Rice combo was also good. Only downside is, the sauce used with Chicken is 'sweet'! Pineaple upside down cheesecake was superb! The service here is pathetic I would say. The server had forgotten to provide us the complimentary bread. Also they took hell lot of time for each of the requests and also to bring the check. It was very difficult to catch the sever also."
Nini N.,"Fort Worth, TX",16,209,607,3.0,12/8/2014,"This place used to be very good until they changed to the new chef. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad. It really depends on how the chef is feeling. They last time I went here, I couldn't even eat cause the food just didn't look appealing. The pasta was too hard, the meat was over cooked. Never order anything from their skinny menu, it's disgusting. The Fried squid was soggy. Disappointed experience, hopefully next time is better"
Rae C.,"Fort Worth, TX",92,308,31,4.0,12/24/2012,"My birthday was on a Thursday this year and being a sleepy little librarian I only had energy for going out for dinner to celebrate on a school night. I chose Cheesecake Factory (mostly to get away from the horrible Christmas traffic in Grapevine) and ended up having a ridiculously good time. They tried to sit us near a giant table of children who happened to be singing happy birthday to one of the kids and I was not about to have a six year old steal my birthday thunder. They were very nice when I asked if they would mind if we sat in the bar area instead. Our bartender/waiter was awesome. He was super friendly, was actually funny and not just please-give-me-a-good-tip funny, and rounded up another bartender to sing happy birthday to me, also getting my very shy husband in on the act. He also gave us free dessert. In exchange I left him my birthday button and all the birthday dollars that I had received that day as a tip. He was that good - he earned all of my good birthday karma. Also, somehow Cheesecake Factory manages to make every dish perfectly despite having 30,000 things on the menu. I had the eggplant sandwich and it was magical. My husband had enchiladas and loved them. How these two things exist in the same restaurant and are both cooked to perfection is beyond my understanding."
Kathryn A.,"Southlake, TX",22,90,76,3.0,11/29/2014,"First off let me say I generally like Cheesecake Factory, but over time it has definitely gone down hill. I usually pick it up if I decide to eat it BC the wait usually is over an hour and there are no reservations. Today I deemed it worthy to write about my take out experience simply because I'm frustrated with the lack of effort put into the the to go orders. Today they remembered everything.. Which is rare but they scorched my artichoke and gave my to go order of 6 entrees a total of 6 pieces of bread.:( boo now I have kids crying and yelling and fighting over a few pieces of bread that were actually quite hard /borderline stale. Any ways I really hope cheesecake picks up their game BC they do offer some great items like the  raspberry lemonade, Orange chicken, Asian Salad, white chicken chili, Thai chicken wraps and sliders to name a few. If u go prepare yourself with a good book or grab a friend who you need to catch up with while you wait in the lobby for your table."
James L.,"Hurst, TX",49,96,1,4.0,8/24/2012,"I love the Cheesecake Factory!  Always a great place to go with friends and also a nice night out with the wife.  In fact, this is the place we went to after we got engaged. I really like their Thai Chicken Pasta.  The pasta and peanut sauce is addicting.  Oddly enough, the chicken in the dish is nothing to write home about but I order it almost everytime. Another must try is their Fried Mac and Cheese.   Of course you can't go wrong with any of their cheesecakes.  I was not a fan of cheesecake until I tried it here.  I crave it now."
Stephanie R.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",59,142,952,4.0,10/12/2014,They offer lunch until 5 pm even on the weekends and Sunday brunch or breakfast until 2 pm. The only down side is there is no volume on the games when at the bar area.
Danielle B.,"Dallas, TX",93,145,6,4.0,11/19/2012,The guys were having a chili/UFC night. Of course...if I am there...I am always making fun of how UFC reminds me of gay porn...almost Mystery Science Theatre 3000 style. So in attempt to get the ladies out of the house and have fun with my girlfriends...we opted to go to Cheesecake.  It was my idea to go to Cheesecake versus Chilli's or On the Border. You can go to Cheesecake and there is something for everyone since the menu is as big as a phonebook. I thought this could satisfy the pickest of eaters. We arrive and put our names on the list for first available seating. We ended up on the patio. There was plenty of heat lamps to keep us warm. As the patio cleared...it started to get a little chilly...but not so cold where we would have to go back in. Our server was all over the place...since I have been a waitress before...I could understand. He was busy but he did come by to say hi and take our drink orders. He was very nice.  I ordered the chicken madera...which is one of their signature dishes. Blondie ordered sliders...and our other friends ordered chicken wraps and a pasta dish. I am not a huge cheesecake fan...and I was so full from my chicken madera that I didnt get dessert. I usually order Linda's Fudge Cake with tons of whip cream. Everyone enjoyed what they had.  I dont eat out as much as I used to....but this is a great first date place and nice place to eat period. It sucked that half of our group thought 1030pm was too late to be out....or we would have used my gift certificates the sales manager from The Gingerman gave me. Maybe next time!!
Eric I.,"Conroe, TX",7,99,77,1.0,8/5/2014,"Beautiful night, but no patio sitting because they have no servers out there???  Umm, get some maybe?"
Paul J.,"Southlake, TX",0,27,,2.0,12/18/2015,I will only go for cheesecake and happy hour. Way way overpriced.  Service is hit or miss. Food is extremely salty. I ordered steak once and it was horrible. Tough. No taste. It must have been in freezer for months.
Lauren L.,"Dallas, TX",0,26,,3.0,7/22/2013,"Atmosphere:  4 stars Food:  3 to 4 stars Service:  2 to 3 stars Typical Cheesecake Factory decor.  Its nice, but I wish they would do different themes for different locations.   They have a huge menu selection of foods, I've been to different locations and tried different foods and they are all pretty good and average.  Of all the foods, the only thing I don't recommend is the grilled artichoke hearts.  It has nothing but charcoaled flavor. Service was pretty spotty.  Kept asking for the same things and it would come when the meal was almost completed."
Steve S.,"Brentwood, TN",30,136,22,4.0,10/18/2012,"If you're hungry, but can't decide what type of cuisine you'd like, then the Cheesecake Factory might be able to help you.  Their menu is huge and diverse with offerings from nearly every different ethnicity.  It's so big that it can be difficult to choose. The atmosphere is great and the wait staff is eager to please.  They have many mixed drinks to choose from, but the beer menu is small and not nearly as diverse as the food menu.   If you're still hungry after your meal, I'd highly recommend trying some cheesecake.  They have a huge variety of different flavors and they are all good.  Even if you aren't hungry for desert, you can take some home for later. Overall, the cheesecake factory is a great restaurant.  Good food and great service with a clean and classy atmosphere."
Robert DeAnna C.,"Fort Worth, TX",6,23,8,2.0,12/14/2014,We waited an hour for a table for 6.  It took our waitress 10 minutes to do drink orders..  It took another 20 minutes for salads and another 20 for our meals.  I had the fried catfish and it wasnt very good.  As soon as i saw my plate i saw the fish was sitting in grease..  Nasty.  My husband got fish and chips.  The fish was so dry..  We wont be going back.  They werent prepared for the holiday/sunday crowd.  We used to go to one in Florida where it was always packed and it was awesome!!!  This manager has allot to learn..
David A.,"Southlake, TX",0,10,2,2.0,10/28/2014,"The food was good, but a little salty. The mojito was like drinking syrup. Really awful. The service was slow and it was not at all crowded. We had to ask to get our water filled every time. (the salty food had us drinking lots)  On the way out, the manager rattled off a quick, ""thanks, bye bye,"" and walked off before I could tell him we really were not thrilled. The server never asked if we liked the food or drink, or I would have told her about the mojito which we did not drink.  (so it was obvious we did not like it) Pretty sure the server was new, and I understand that, but in that case the manager needs to be checking. Service is lacking."
