Kim E.,"Keller, TX",0,7,,1.0,10/26/2014,"I ordered the 10"" strawberry cheesecake for our daughters' Sweet 16 birthday and when I got there to pick it up, I was told that all I had to do was put the strawberries on top because the cake was still frozen and if I would not be serving it the same day, then it will make the cake soggy once it defrosted. But when I opened up the box the next morning to add the strawberries, the cake was so plain and there was no whip cream or anything on it! I paid $50 for a cake that I am basically going to have to put together and design myself!!! I called and asked if I were to bring the cake back and have someone add the whip cream designs and they stated that they could not do that as the cake had already left the store. Not impressed and never again!!!"
Reena D.,"Euless, TX",516,808,939,4.0,2/10/2012,"I love this Cheesecake Factory location.  We usually go here when we're going to watch a movie as it is across the street from Harkins!  The wait is really long as this place is always busy.  Plan to come EARLY!  Their menu is huge and can get overwhelming.  I tend to order from the SkinnyLicious™ Menu.  The Skinny Mojito  is just so yummy!  I order the SAUSAGE AND RICOTTA flatbread all the time.  It is a small portion but its enough for me and I love it.  Its filled with flavor and I would of never guessed it would be on the ""SkinnyLicious"" Menu.  Service here is a hit or miss but we do enjoy our time here."
Anonymous A.,"The Colony, TX",16,37,,5.0,12/9/2013,Cheesiest of All...but love em! Need to gain weight - eat without guilt all they serve :) They will accommodate any changes in recipe you want-which is what I like the most !!! I used to visit this place often for omelets and desserts...craving days were the best!! Lately tried their avocado egg-rolls & felt guilty that I ate them all..& then couldn't order anything :P Go to this place...very hungry!
Don O.,"Roanoke, TX",25,43,11,4.0,8/2/2014,Great place. Good food and drinks.....except on friday and saturday nights.....way too busy. I dont even bother anymore on those days.
Kathryn D.,"Colleyville, TX",0,9,5,3.0,3/14/2015,"This is a review of the ""curbside to go"". I just waited on hold for the Cheesecake Factory Curbside-To-Go to place an order for ten minutes with hold music. Then on my other phone line, I decided to call and see if they just forgot about me, because no one had picked up the line to at least let me know to continue holding or inform me that they were busy? It's 8pm, so I didn't think it would be rush hour here. Anyways, a manager eventually came to the phone after another 3 minutes on hold to take my order. She told me they were really busy and that my order would be at least 30 minutes. I told her I was fine with that. When I asked her for suggestions on ""sushi like"" appetizers that she could suggest for the to go service (since they still cannot serve their ahi tartare on the to go menu because they do not have their sushi license), her response was I don't think we have anything else ""sushi or fish like on the appetizer menu for to go"" and then I asked if she was a manager and she said ""yes"" and then said ""I'm new and I don't have the menu memorized yet"". I realize this is a huge menu but WHHHAAATTTTT? A manager who doesn't know the menu of their own restaurant. Is this not restaurant management training 101?  Then after I told her ""I'm sure you have something fish like that's cooked and that I am in my car and don't have a menu"" she fumbled around and then suggested the shrimp spring rolls ... that was a good pull on her part - hopefully she picked up a menu to read at this point.  Not sure about this place any more. The last time I took food home from here one month ago (the miso salmon) it made my stomach sick. I didn't write a review last month when this happened but decided to try the same miso salmon again tonight to see if the food has changed from one month ago. Hopefully, when I get my food this time, it makes up for the lack of service on the curbside-to-go business. In the past this restaurant was spot on. I've been ordering miso salmon here for 6 years now ... Giving it another chance ... but making sure I write a review so that they can read it and make some improvements ..."
Andrew Y.,"Southlake, TX",2,79,60,3.0,6/18/2015,"Very pleasant surprise.  For a larger restaurant, the food and staff at the Southlake restaurant was top notch.  The value was good and portions were generous.  Definitely worth a return visit with the family."
Ken T.,"Arlington, TX",113,48,14,5.0,12/25/2011,Food and service is always 5 stars for me. My favorite is the seared Ahi Tuna and the Grilled shishito peppers appetizer. If you have the tuna be sure to tell your server to take care that the tuna doesn't hit the table moments after the salad or appetizer because it will. A minor distraction but for me Tuna is best right off the grill and I don't want mine untill I am done with salad and appetizers.  I wish they would serve this with a steak knife rather than a butter knife. (call me picky it's ok).  Delicious and a best choice
Brett I.,"Harrison, NJ",264,344,86,4.0,3/18/2012,"Cheesecake Factory--regardless if you like it or don't, you have to admire its consistency; the overall quality of the dining experience doesn't really change depending on location. The ambience, the quality of the wait staff, the large portions of food--it's all super consistent. I came here with a large group (about 12 of us), but our server was so attentive and cool with us--just so friendly, always checking up on us, refilling drinks, etc. I ordered the roasted vegetable pizza (roasted veggies consist of red bell pepper, artichoke, mushrooms, diced tomatoes). One friend around me ordered the chicken bellagio, another ordered the cajun jambalaya pasta, another ordered an old-fashioned ""glamburger,"" i can't remember what the rest ordered. Anyhow, I liked my pizza--the crust was well-done (not too thick, not too thin), the toppings were generous, and it tasted good overall. It was around $13, which I found to be worth it. My friend's chicken bellagio dish (chicken on top of pasta with a basil/oil sauce and an arugula salad) was really good; the waiter said it's one of the best items on the menu. The not-so good thing was my friend's jambalaya pasta. It sounded kind of cool, but i suppose pasta doesn't match as well with all the jambalaya ingredients as rice does; the dish was just kind of bland  overall. I don't know when they introduced the SkinnyLicious menu, but they had a ""light"" menu this time we went, which is good if that's your thing. In Cheesecake Factory fashion, it's a large menu for lighter fare. and lastly, it's called the cheesecake factory for a reason. Even though the entree portions are pretty huge, you should save room for dessert. Overall, good quality for the price you pay for, definitely recommended. And FYI: they don't take reservations on the weekends, so prepare to wait."
Caroline M.,"North Richland Hills, TX",1,7,,4.0,8/11/2014,Good food but the menu is HUGE! I always split something with someone because the portions are so large. Cheesecakes is very good and they have a wide selection from fruity to ultra chocolatey. Kind of pricy though.
Alexie M.,"Smyrna, TN",106,27,8,4.0,5/1/2014,Service isn't great but it's okay. The food and atmosphere makes up for that. I love going here for lunch or dinner. It doesn't matter the food is still good either way!
Adriana P.,"Lewisville, TX",0,2,,1.0,10/30/2013,"Disclaimer: If you easily disgusted please read at your own risk. Also this happened a few months ago on July 29th 2013 and I really wanted to have a cold head before writing this.  This was the first time I ever ate at a cheese cake factory and I made sure I went to the South Lake location because it's a really nice area and I wanted to treat my little sister who came to visit from another country. Our waiter was really great right from the start, very attentive. Kudos to him and I'm actually really mad at myself for not remembering his name to give him Kudos.  My sister order steak and I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp. When we got our food it looked great, we were so excited but it ended there. I usually don't inspect my food but when I looked down I saw what I thought was a shrimp leg and with my nail I pulled it out and to my surprise it was a cockroach, the whole insect. Having my sister there I really didn't want to make a scene, after all she was the one that was really exited about eating there. So I called the waiter and pointed to my food, poor guy looked so embarrassed and took my plate right away.  At that point my sister's excitement was gone. The manager came and apologize many times. He then asked me to write my name, address and number to later give me a call and he mentioned that they need to communicate this to the exterminator company. I never had this happened so I was very much disgusted and more worried about my sister's impression.  I didn't pay for my food but did for our drinks and my sister's food but we pretty much didn't eat anything afterwards. They also gave us cheese cakes and as much as I wanted I couldn't bear to eat them. Months after that happened I haven't received a call or anything. Looking back I would probably done things much different.  It's also safe to say that I won't be going to any other Cheese cake factory restaurant. I still can't believe that happened."
Govnor H.,"Southlake, TX",10,44,,4.0,8/9/2013,"This place is probably the cheesiest (no pun intended), silly place to eat.  It really looks like the inside of a Vegas casino!  Writing this for people who haven't been there of course.  Yes, it's busy...it's always busy.  Yes, they do need all of those options on the menu.  Yes, they will make anything off of the menu whenever they're open (except brunch).  Try the Sunday brunch which is awesome but only served until two (please update it to THREE cheesecake factory because I don't wake up that early on weekends). The Cheesecake Factory is one of the only places I've ever been that can pretty much satisfy any appetite.  If you have a group of picky eaters then this is your place!  I know it's known for ""bad"" food as in high calorie, high sodium, but it's anything BUT bad.  They even have a ""skinny"" menu for people looking out for calories.  One of the things on it is the miso glazed salmon which is really incredible.  I try to get something different every time I go and that's a difficult proposition with all of the choices.  I suggest looking at the menu online before you go.  It can be daunting when faced with the numerous choices and a wait person coming back asking if you're ready yet.   One thing I recommend are the small plates.  When I'm with friends we'll get two of these and they're really not that small.  White bean hummus, stuffed mushrooms with a wonderful sauce, even the fried cheese...yum! BEWARE:  The food is huge.  Don't think of this place as an appetizer, main course, dessert type of restaurant.  If you ate all of those on the scale they serve it on they would have to wheel you out in a cart.  This is not a bad thing since you will have leftovers to put in the oven the next day (or night after a few drinks).  During lunch they have smaller portions that are still pretty big.  For the price you're probably getting twice the food of most places. Service:  I've never had anything but exceptional service at this place.  The wait staff seems to enjoy their job even though they're super busy all the time.  Yes, I eat here often. The only reason I give four stars is because of the seating situation.  I hate it!  They try to pack in as many diners as possible into their extremely large restaurant.  That means if you're two up you might be sitting right next to a big family.  Do I put up with it...yes, because the food is that good."
Louis R.,"Fort Worth, TX",36,82,89,3.0,1/23/2014,"Although the food is usually uninspired and the mood music usually being too loud, I do love the cheesecake here. My go-to favorite has to be the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake."
Frederick S.,"Irving, TX",106,109,4,5.0,6/18/2011,"I've come back enough times and the service has been awesome every time I have come back. Food has always come out perfectly cooked... drinks mixed well... and service was perfect. Yes, I used the P word. Maybe their staff knows me so well (I've only been there 30+ times in the last year) that I get their best waiters, but it's been pretty en pointe the past few months. A+, Cheesecake Factory! If you request a waitress, Lauren D has been my waitress five times and has provided me with impeccable service each and every time! Some tips:  Come after 8:30. If you come here on a Friday or Saturday night expecting a short wait time between 6:30 and 8:30, you're funny. You deserve to wait.  Do not expect overly creative plates. The prices are more than reasonable for what you get.  If you don't want to pay $30 per person (for a specialty drink + entree) or $40 per person (app+entree+dessert) or $50 per person (specialty drink + app + entree + dessert) then this restaurant really isn't for you. There's more than enough flexibility for you to only spend $10 here or easily spend $50 per person. It's totally up to you as to how much it costs."
Lindsay H.,"North Richland Hills, TX",1,4,,5.0,6/7/2014,"My boyfriend and I enjoy Sun am brunch here.  We sit at the bar, drink yummy mimosas and veg out.  It's a great atmosphere before the Sunday lunch rush and their brunch food is always tasty no matter what we get.  The bartender, Frank is always attentive without being overbearing."
Tony M.,"Woodstock, GA",188,268,93,5.0,10/16/2011,"Kimberly R. was my server for this impromptu lunch in the middle of my work day.  If she keeps it up, they'll have to rename the place ""Kimberly's Cheesecake Factory"" !  She was on her game from greeting to farewell. I had the meatloaf and if that's a lunch-sized portion, the dinner-sized must feed a family of four all by itself.  The corn succotash was a perfect complement to the tasty entree.  I didn't leave any of either on the plate when I was done.  And the mashed potatoes were just as scarce when I was finished with them. The service was superb.  Not hovering but always there when she was needed.  I left satisfied and beaming with the slice of pumpkin cheesecake I took to-go.  I savored that for two days it was so rich, creamy and yummy. These people know how to do it right and take care of every guest like they're a welcomed V.I.P."
Chace D.,"Phoenix, AZ",34,34,4,4.0,5/2/2011,"Always decent food. Service is always pretty good. There is usually a long wait though, so don't go during a dinner rush if you don't have to!"
Juan V.,"Garland, TX",56,101,176,3.0,8/13/2013,"Family came to town and they have never been to TCF and they wanted to try it out. We showed up late due to prior engagements. We ate earlier but had enough room to enjoy a leftover macaroni cheese ball, one of my favorite things of this place. I'm not as impressed as maybe other people of this place. Noisy.  I don't like giant menus. Too many choices. The food is good. It's very Italian themed but that's not a bad thing. Everyone enjoyed the food. Our waiter was great. Very attentive to our requests. We did have red velvet cheese cake and coffee. I My wife and I didn't think the cheese cake was that great. She doesn't like cheese cakes and I like red velvet so she insisted on going got that one. It was pretty but nothing great in flavor. We like deserts but if this is what they normally taste like? Eh. Great place for big family gatherings but not very romantic. This location wasn't as busy as the Dallas location. That place is a mad house. It's not for me. But it might be for you."
Taylor M.,"Birmingham, AL",59,227,29,4.0,10/5/2013,"The food was consistent with other locations. Still love the fried mac and cheese, the cashew chicken, and the lemoncello cake. Our service (sat in the bar area) was excellent!"
Dave C.,"Keller, TX",0,9,,2.0,4/12/2015,Quite possibly the most overrated and over priced restaurant in the Metroplex.  The food is nothing special and is no better than any other lesser priced restaurant.  I asked for my hamburger to be 'medium' and it came back cremated.  We ordered the stuffed mushroom appetizers and the were the smallest if have every seen.  I actually thought someone was playing a joke on us. The service was sporadic and also very mediocre. It's hard to believe this place is as popular as it is.
