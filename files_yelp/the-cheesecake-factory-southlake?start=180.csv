Megan T.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,3,,1.0,3/29/2015,"Wrong choice of dining place tonight,  we came in and were told to wait 5-10 minutes. After 35 minutes I walked up to ask for the menu and found out they ""accidently"" gave the table to someone else, so we waited for 10 more minutes :( very unprofessional.  We also didn't have good dining experience with the waiter, he forgot the bread and poorly service.  So disappointed, made us feel like the whole night wasted."
Kart B.,"Irving, TX",0,3,,2.0,1/24/2015,One of the worst cheesecake factory ever!! Service was great but the cook is terrible!!
Scott N.,"Euless, TX",3,67,1,3.0,9/29/2013,"It's Cheesecake Factory, so typical large portions and good variety. But this is first time I had a server remove a glass a wine before I was finished. Not sure why the rush"
Adam G.,"Keller, TX",5,13,5,2.0,8/10/2013,"I want to clarify my rating by saying if you read my review you'll understand why only 2 stars.  The review reflects my personal bias, but some of the factors probably would affect another customer as negatively.  With that said, on to the review... After having seen the Chain represented in the Big Bang Theory, I always had a desire to give the place a try.  Finally tonight myself, my wife and a friend decided to visit the one located in Southlake, TX.  For starters the decor is pretty elaborate, the type of decorations you might find in a very fancy expensive restaurant.  Aesthetically it's not personally my taste but it's Nicely decorated.      The entryway was extremely crowded, most likely because it was a weekend evening.  The estimated wait was 30-40 minutes.  Here is one of the places where the restaurant lost the most favor with me.  With a wait that long you really need to have ample place for people to sit.  They didn't have anywhere near the accommodations to seat that many waiting patrons.  I have a personal issue with waiting for ANY restaurant that has a wait that is longer then 20 minutes.  It is my humble opinion that any restaurant that has a wait longer then that isn't worth going to.  Since the evening in that respect was out of my control, we waited it out. The food in my experience was average to mediocre, and a bit overpriced for what they gave you.  i think the menu overall while having a lot of diversity which is good, tries a little to hard, and is a bit pretentious.  I personally had the BBQ burger which IMHO was not as good as a Red Robin Whisky River burger as a comparison.  The seating I was very unhappy with as well.  The tables are WAY to close together, you are practically sitting on top of the people next to you and it's impossible to NOT hear their conversations, which I find uncomfortable.  The seats themselves, if you are a larger person like me are very poorly padded and become uncomfortable to sit in rather quickly. Their Desserts, namely cheesecake is excellent and I might even suggest if you are to eat anything there, I would suggest taking some of that to go if you're like me and don't want to dine in that particular place. Lastly the wait staff, I just want to say that even with my negative comments about this restaurant, I have to give credit to our Waitress, she was exceptional.  She was attentive, got our orders 100% correct, was on top of refills, updates on our food, and her personality was awesome.  Friendly and charming.  I personally wish she worked somewhere else because I would have loved to go back to a restaurant i could enjoy with her waiting on me. Also FYI, the restaurant does not accept reservations on the weekend."
Trinity G.,"San Francisco, CA",217,199,34,3.0,3/17/2011,"I lived in San Francisco, so when I think of Cheesecake Factory I think: Macy's 8th floor, dining al fresco on the Sky Terrace Patio overlooking Union Square.  It's just not the same elsewhere, but I can't ding Southlake for not being on prime real estate. Came here for a brunch date with one of my girlfriends and had a good time.  I ordered the pizza + salad lunch and a strawberry cheesecake for dessert.  Nothing spectacular, but still good and still pricey."
Jeff S.,"Houston, TX",230,615,212,3.0,7/20/2008,"My take on Cheesecake Factory is it is a cool-looking but over-priced chain.  We decided to have lunch here yesterday as nobody could agree on what we wanted.  And everyone knows that Cheesecake Factory has a little bit of everything on the menu! But here is the rub.  The food was OK, and the portions were very generous, another Cheesecake Factory trademark.  Soft drinks were $3 so we all had water.  We each ordered a slice of cheesecake to go (starting at $7.95) and our tab for our family of four, including tip, was $91.46!  For lunch!  With no alcohol! Cheesecake Factory is good, but not that good.  This will be nothing more than a very occasional diversion for us."
Ashleigh P.,"Grapevine, TX",12,36,6,3.0,3/26/2013,"This place is always hopping! I love being able to stop in, grab a slice of cheesecake and heading home! If you go on a Friday or Saturday night, go later! There is always a wait because of the popularity! Food is delicious as well :) I give it a 3 because we have had several times where the service is lacking. The last time we went, our waitress was bad mouthing other workers right in front of us which I thought was very unprofessional."
Jeff W.,"Conway, AR",11,46,,5.0,7/21/2013,Great as always.  I wish they would do something about all the noise.  Makes me feel tired when I leave.
Zac N.,"Saginaw, TX",6,14,9,3.0,9/16/2013,They have a lot of different foods to choose from. My mom is vegetarian and she likes coming to the Cheesecake. The Firefly margarita is really good!  My sweet potatoes fries came out cold but my Kobe mushroom and onion burger was really good. The cheesecake is definitely worth the trip!
Shelley E.,"Euless, TX",26,76,140,1.0,1/18/2011,The coffee drinks look nice but you can tell the beans are not fresh.
cynthia b.,"Southlake, TX",0,23,,2.0,12/15/2013,"I've eaten here a few times. The key is an ""off-hours"" meal.  Otherwise, expect a long wait....a very long wait.  And then - you'll wait some more. Ok, I am mad because the door host taking names told me it was a 20-25 minute wait for 2 people at 5pm on a Saturday.  It then turned into 45 minutes before we reached the table. During this time, I watched MANY people pour into the restaurant.  They were all told about THE SAME wait time as the people before them - 30 minutes. After awhile, it was really pretty ridiculous.  No way would it be 30 minutes for so many people arriving at the same time!!  I don't like being lied to.  I worked in restaurants during college and we could always predict the wait time fairly accurately.  Oh yes, my appetizer arrived when my meal was nearly half over. Whatever they tell you for the wait time, you'll want to add a half hour. My request to the restaurant: Just tell me the truth next time. I can spend the wait time shopping or browsing next door in Barnes & Noble and would be a much happier restaurant patron."
Tiffany L.,"Jefferson, WI",77,497,119,3.0,1/16/2011,"I LIKE Cheesecake Factory, while I'm not overly familiar with their entree menu, I love LOVE their small plate offerings.  The Vietnamese tacos are fantastic, LOVE THEM.   Their Greek salad, Ahi Tartare and little Pizzettes are all also very tasty. There was something that occurred on our most recent trip to this Cheesecake Factory that seriously left me scratching my head.  My niece, 9-years-old, ordered the kids sliders and fries and when the server brought out her plate he warned me that it was a little warm.  It was not just warm, it was hot.  A HOT plate filled with a KIDS meal was placed in front of a 9-year-old?  WTF?  I had to take a slider off her plate and put it on my bread plate because the plate was too hot for her to even maneuver around.  Not cool.  An adult plate, fine.  A kids plate, what the hell?  Service was fine enough, our server was slightly strange, but good enough.   Considering it was quite busy we were in and out pretty quickly.  I'll go back, but jeez, use your noggins and lets not give a 9-year-old a super hot plate."
Holly M.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,22,2,3.0,7/7/2013,Food is good. Not anything super spectacular taste wise for the price but portions are huge. I'm usually too full to order cheesecake! One problem is that the menu is a good 20 pages so it takes forever to look through it. I recommend splitting an entree with someone if possible!
Allison B.,"Hurst, TX",9,15,,4.0,1/19/2010,"I know most people get down on this place but I've gotta tell ya, I'm a fan! I've been to several different ones throughout my life and have been to the Southlake area one about three times. The latest being this past Saturday.  I think of this place like a nice steak place. It's something that you treat yourself to, not go to every week.  And yes, believe what they tell you, it is crowded. But, clearly a crowded restaurant means it's worth trying. It must be that good. We were told there would be about a 45 minute wait and we were seated before that time was up. (There was only two of us so I realize it's easier to get a table). Service was great, no complaints there. The food is what brings me back though. Every time I've ordered something new, it's met my expectations and beyond.  Boyfriend got the fish and chips which was ridiculously delicious (and I don't even like fish!) and I ordered the Spicy Meat Pizza. This pizza has given me a new look on life. I now am OBSESSED with carmelized onions. This pizza would have been good with just the meat, but with these, it elevated it to levels beyond our imagination.   Of course I got the cheesecake, took it home and ate it two days later! Definitely a restaurant to try if you haven't been. A little expensive but reserve it for a special day.  If you go with a group, make time to be there for a couple of hours but who doesn't want to spend a little more time with their friends anyway? PS If you haven't had the fried macaroni and cheese, GET THERE NOW! It will blow your socks off."
Glenn H.,"Pacifica, CA",149,660,557,5.0,8/13/2007,"Ahh what a difference a day and about 1,700 miles makes . Sunday Brunch at the Palo Alto, CA CF was stunted by hideous service and management. This place at Southlake, was pretty full for a Monday evening and I decided to see if I was wrong about my general impression of the CF.  Good news is that I was and this place redeemed itself mightily, yeah even I sayest unto you dear diner. I had the Factory Meatloaf: three thick slabs of good meatloaf (a bit on the sagey side but still  fantastic), with a 3 pepper, corn & squash saute that was perfect, two hot lengths of bread (sweet pumpernickel and white) and a small hill of mashed spuds with gravy. OMG, guys this was the redeemer. The service was SO good compared to the Palo Alto, that I got my Iced tea (unsweetened passion fruit MMmmm) and bread, had some, then went to tidy up in the men's room---when I returned, I thought I was in the Twilight Zone. (Neer neer NEER neer)--Repeat as you read this. For there, were my bread and tea used to be, was an EMPTY table devoid of butter, napkin too.  Huh? Wha happen to my stuff? Thank goodness another table saw my confusion and the 80 year old birthday boy said ""You were right there, Sonny boy."", pointing with his knife. ""You want some of my leftovers?"" (Holds up CF doggy bag) So the waiter (who rocked--Holla Aaron!) apologized and brought me out a whole new set of everything and then my order came PERFECTLY done. The difference could not have been more pronounced between Heaven and Hell (guess which CF was which). And I give this place a BIG 5 stars for pulling CF's bacon outta the fiery depths of Heck."
Jose D.,"Keller, TX",0,1,2,5.0,3/1/2013,"The best pasta and meat sauce I've had in ANY restaurant. The pasta is cooked perfectly, al dente, just the way I like it. And when I do order something else (very rarely) it is always hot and delicious. And, of course, there's their titular cheesecake. Extremely varied and equally delicious. My personal favorite is the tiramisu cheesecake.  I would say the only downside is the long wait on weekends due to heavy consumer traffic. But that can't be controlled and the wait is always worth it."
Joseph W.,"Saint Johns, FL",22,94,,3.0,10/30/2009,"Let me clarify something first:  Despite being totally anti-yelp to like chains, I'm a cheesecake factory fan, and I'm about to go to bat for this place.  My 3 star rating is really ""4 stars with some points off."" I think the food at the cheesecake factory is really good -- WAY better than what you get at your average chain restaurant.  I'm a huge fan of the orange chicken, the chicken piccata, the burrito, the fish tacos, and lots of other stuff on their extensive (to the point of being ridiculous) menu.  Until we tried it one day, we never realized that this was a place to get an excellent breakfast/order-off-the menu brunch.  Their French Toast Napoleon is maybe some of the best french toast that I've had anywhere, but maybe that's because it's so loaded up with strawberries and cream that it's unclear whether it is a breakfast or a dessert.  The cheesecake, or course, is also some of the best anywhere, but..... My biggest gripe is with the price.  I think it is impossible for 2 people to eat here and spend less than $40.  Even for lunch.  I sure don't have the time to go through their textbook-sized menu and add up all of the combinations, but I'm sure it's true.  $8 for a freaking piece of cheesecake?  Come on.  Granted, the portion sizes are so large that you are essentially buying two (or more) meals at once, but I'd rather buy my meals one at a time, thank you..... There can be a long wait at busy times, but the secret is just to avoid this place at those times (duh.)  I never wait.  I've never had any complaints about the service.  So, I'm a fan, but I always wonder if I'm being scammed when I end up spending $50 for two lunch entrees, drinks, and 2 pieces of cheesecake....."
Caitlyn B.,"Lewisville, TX",6,41,21,3.0,6/14/2014,"Well last night me and my boyfriend traveled about forty minutes to this location, seeking a lovely night out. First of all, the parking is scarce in this area, drove around for ten minutes attempting to park until the heavens shined down on an empty concrete opening. We walk in and the wait is about 15 minute, which was perfectly fine. Our buzzer goes off and we hand it in to the hostess. She put it down and instantly forgot we were there, and began sitting other patrons. After about five minutes she realized and she said us down. Our waitress was very nice but could have been a little more attentive. My main course was a little lack luster, but that is most likely because I ordered out of my comfort zone which is a fault on my behalf. The cheesecake was delicious of course. It's what they are known for. Overall I probley will return and next time I will order something different so I can change this review to four or five stars :)"
Chuck A.,"Grapevine, TX",5,21,,4.0,2/20/2010,"Just know the few things that will frustrate you before you go: very long wait, too many items on the menu, and way too large portions.  Also know that the food is consistently good, service is very friendly, and of course the desserts are a must. My wife and I went in for a date night this weekend and had some of the best entrees ever for this place.  They seem to be on a big shrimp kick right now, so I tried the Shrimp Scampi Pasta.  Shrimp was very lightly breaded and served on angel hair with a lemon-butter sauce.  Very good dish cooked just right. My wife had the Chicken Bellagio which is a flattened and breaded chicken breast served on top of basil pasta in a cream sauce.  The prosciutto and arugula on top made for an outstanding dish. We shared a piece of the Tuxedo Chocolate Cheesecake to finish and it was gone in about 2 minutes between both of us.  Service from Jasmine was top-notch and very friendly. Be very careful about trying to make a movie next door on a Friday or Saturday night.  Leave yourself plenty of time!  You can always kill a few minutes in between at Barnes&Noble if necessary."
Heather B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",124,200,33,3.0,5/24/2012,"Food was pretty good but the service STUNK. It wasn't even busy, and we had a hard time getting waited on."
