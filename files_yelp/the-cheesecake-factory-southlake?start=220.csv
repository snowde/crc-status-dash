Michael F.,"Washington, DC",39,157,14,3.0,7/14/2006,"************UPDATE**************  I went here last with a party of 5 on a THURSDAY!!...it took exactly 1 hour 19 minutes for us to be seated..(i looked over the hostess's shoulder and saw how long our party had been waiting) Then once seated it took 1 hour 3 minutes for all of our entress to arrive EXCEPT the chicken marsala, which took about 10 more minutes.  After everyone got their food the manager came over to our table to apologize saying...""We are so sorry about that guys, We were taking our time on that and we apologize for that..."" End Quote.  The Cheesecake is great but after youve had it more than 10 times it just gets old...  I shudder thinking of what the wait would be on a Saturday night...        Okokok whoa waaait a minute Chris...you did a review for the Cheesecake Factory and didnt even mention the cheesecake?! What?!  I agree about the portions and salads...and about their fake classy atmosphere...the food is good...definetely eatable...but the cheesecake is their main draw (as you can tell) Doused with gerenrously thick whipped cream and very thick...delishigasmic.  But they do very good at is pulling off that their cheesecakes are freshly made...let me bust this myth...they aren't.  If they were they would be 10x better, but for the amout they dish out daily, its finacially and physically impossible even with the enourmous amount of staff and square footage they have...  Man i would love to be their manager."
Karyn P.,"Crowley, TX",16,69,,2.0,6/30/2010,"This place is far to crowded to enjoy, and the one time I actually did get a table my food was cold, undercooked, and expensive. I will not be returning, not even for a 6$ piece of cheesecake."
Brandon S.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",0,11,,2.0,9/22/2012,Been to this location twice. First time was great service all the way around. However the second visit not so much. Was promptly greeted and estimated time was given to be seated. No issue front door staff was superb. However once seated it took them 10 min to come to my table and take my drink order. A table to the right of me had 2 parents and 4 kids with them and were greeted within 1 min. Then my waitress came over to me. Totally unacceptable. I asked for a manager and explained the situation and he agreed. The first half of dinner the manager took my order for food and drink. The waitress hid and stayed away. The 2nd half of dinner she was more involved however did not visit table very often. They did let me have my drink for free. Needless to say this was a huge fail at this location for Cheesecake Factory.
Louise D.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,4,,3.0,6/24/2012,Referencing my previous review (dis-satisfied/lousy service etc) I contacted the Cheesecake Factory online and sent them a synopsis of the events. I have to say the manager of the Soutlake location did send me an gift card and a letter of apology. I contacted the manager by telephone upon receipt and thanked her. She was very pleasant and said she hoped we would give the Southlake location another try but also wished us a great meal if we chose to use it at another location instead. This was a nice gesture and shows that the Cheesecake Factory genuinely are concerned about customer satisfaction albeit a little later than the actual event.
Kevin R.,"Grapevine, TX",0,6,,4.0,3/24/2014,"this is a nice place to go to and incite family and friends, there is a wide variety of foods and the service is usually good, I love there cheese and bread and love their desert, prices is slightly on the higher end but over all worth it."
Vincenzo K.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,157,12,2.0,8/22/2009,We were among the first 20 customers of this estab. when it opened in March of 2006. Not want to bitch about it but they did not even offer a complimentary soft drinks to any of the first customers who set foot there. Comp. soft drinks is a common tradition with many restaurants on their first hour of business. Is CF poor? Food is average. The simple to make bruschetta was a fake. I returned it. Not a good value for the money.
Solomon W.,"Austin, TX",514,2583,7,3.0,1/12/2009,"Though the eclectic cuisine offered at Cheesecake factory tastes pretty good to me, not specializing gets minus points in my book.  All the offerings here just seem to get magnified by the faux haute atmosphere, but prices are definitely affordable.  Pizzas are solid and reliable here, but nothing too special.  Omelets are big and alright here too.  Pasta bolognese tastes like something from Italian-American cooking.  Basically, anything you get here will taste like something from another middle-class restaurant, and for convenience sake, that is a mighty fine thing.  Offering a wide array of American/other classics in one location with a fake reason to get dressed up gets a thumbs up.  Overall, this one is great for parties and a reason to feel nice, but the food isn't the culprit in this situation."
Rick Y.,"Keller, TX",11,32,,3.0,2/14/2009,I go for the cheese cake.  Depending on what time you go it can be rather busy so be prepared to wait.  The food is good and varied.
Jack S.,"Dallas, TX",0,33,,4.0,12/30/2008,"Pretty consistent, whether in Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, FLV. Quality service, nice plates of various items to enjoy. HUGE portions -JFC how can you leave room for cheesecake with a sandwich as big as your face? Suggestion, pick out dessert first (DUH!) and split an entree -EZ. That way when you leave you won't be all torqued out because you didn't get your cheesecake. Unless you get it at home too, LOL!"
Diane T.,"Denver, CO",44,583,3,3.0,3/6/2008,"The best thing about Cheesecake Factory is its lengthy menu so there is something for everyone.  I've only been to this location for lunch and I found it comparable to most other CFs I've been to in California and Washington.  The food is OK, but nothing to write home about (I recently had the fish tacos - the fish was overcooked therefore too dry).  I think CF is like other upscale chain restaurants when they first opened years ago in that they filled a niche.  Now there is so much competition from other types of restaurants (especially in Southlake) that I can't really see why one would choose to go there unless your dining party can't agree on anyplace else."
P R.,"Arlington, TX",2,53,,4.0,6/18/2008,"Recently ate there and was pleasantly surprised with the service.  As prior reviewers have posted typical service at this particular restaurant was awful.  I would drive from Fort Worth to the one over near North Park in Dallas  rather than eat at this place.  The positive review is warranted because the quality of food was excellent and the staff was friendly.  The experience was what I have come to expect at other restaurants from this chain.  Maybe they hired a new cook, fired a manager or the time of day was right."
Amber H.,"Enid, OK",22,52,83,3.0,7/21/2009,"first time to ever eat here last oct.  showed up aroung 8:45. seated right away. was impressed with the food even though it took about 45 mins to cook after we ordered. only saw the waiter 8 times total, that included drink order, drink drop off, food order, food drop off, dessert order & drop off. we were so stuffed and tired that we only had one piece of tiramisu to share for the three of us. i know we didn't even have cheesecake! crazy!"
Angela M.,"Sevierville, TN",1,18,,2.0,12/13/2008,"We normally love the Cheesecake Factory.  Food and service is always good, predictable and reliable. Our last trip was less than satisfactory.  it was a very quiet Monday evening and we went in just for dessert.  Our waitress was very slow, forgetful and the coffee was cold on a couple of pours. If we want to go the Cheesecake Factory again, we will go to the store in Dallas.  The service has always been excellent there!"
