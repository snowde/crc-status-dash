Jt J.,"Irving, TX",21,14,8,5.0,11/5/2017,"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I have brunch here every Sunday!  Frank V the bartender is the best!  I've never had a bad experience here!  Lance is the GM @ this location, he is the bomb!  I've even seem him @ Sundance.  His detail to service & customer experience is what every restuarant should strive to be!  Been going on 5 years now, I ended up here because of a bad brunch experience @ Brios across the street!  I use to eat brunch there every Sat & Sun for 3 years!   Can't say the same about Sundance location.  Best service & food consistently for 3 years The Cheesecake Factory Southlake!"
Janette R.,"Dallas, TX",134,34,5,4.0,6/26/2017,Food is terrific. Service is pleasant. Kinda high in price. Atmosphere is delightful. Will come again
Misty T.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,9,,5.0,7/16/2017,This was the perfect place for date night. The steak Diane and shrimp scampi was amazing. We took our cheesecake home so we could enjoy it with a good scary movie at home
Crissy R.,"Fort Worth, TX",15,37,33,3.0,7/15/2017,"Better cheesecake factories I have been to, but for the food only. The waiter was inpatient, pushy, kinda just rude. It was Wednesday lunch few people but took extra long to just  get a waiter and a drink. The Burger was excellent and the cake fresh. It was my son's birthday and the waiter was annoyed that I asked for the birthday cake song, no candle and a clearly forced presentation."
Matt F.,"Hurst, TX",3,16,13,1.0,4/23/2017,"I'll start by saying I come to this Cheesecake Factory all the time and this is the first bad experience I've had. My wife and I were seated at a two top relatively quickly and it was busy so that was good. However as we're seated I can hear our waiter (Evan I think his name was. Sorry to name drop but you did a terrible job pal) telling the table next to us ""I'm so sorry again, and I hope this won't prevent you from coming back here.""  Obviously we weren't the only table Evan was screwing up that afternoon. He was very pleasant and had a good attitude but the kid couldn't keep his head on straight. We ordered and asked for sweet and low for my wife's tea...THREE times I asked for it until I finally asked another waitress who brought it to us. We ask for bread and 10 minutes later we can see him walking over with the bread to us then he turns another corner and he's gone  again...Same thing when we asked for a to-go container. Then all of a sudden Evan and some other waiter come up behind the other waitress as she gave us my wife's salad and sweet and low...Theme of the night because they did all of Evan's work for our table while he looked goofy and laughed with other waiters at the ordering computer. So Evan and another waiter are in our face saying ""That's not your salad, it has tomatoes in it."" She ordered a tossed salad. Evan says you can have that though if you want it. Ok, perfect so she eats it. Apparently Evan went back and charged us another $2 for the salad because it had 4 tiny tomato wedges in it and NEVER even told us. Apparently a tossed salad here is just greens and a few drops of salad dressing with no tomato's, croutons or anything else. I hate to complain so much but this was an awful trip and I doubt I'll be back any time soon. I hate to say that because I really like this place but it is what it is."
Melissa C.,"Bakersfield, CA",150,2,1,1.0,7/10/2017,If I could give no stars for phone service I would. Tried calling ahead the entire trip there and they don't answer the phones!
Haden L.,"Greenville, TX",0,27,1,1.0,4/2/2017,"Horrible parking, long wait, okay service, food was not the worst but not as hot and fresh as you are use to with cheese cake factory. Then add 30.06 and 30.07 signs up front and they will not be getting any more of my business."
Kyle B.,"Irving, TX",17,87,63,4.0,10/17/2016,"Went back again for lunch and drinks. My loyalty has been restored! The service was decent and the food was fabulous. I ordered a vegetarian option, I have some trouble remembering exactly what, and it was very flavorful."
Danny C.,"Fort Worth, TX",87,102,9,3.0,2/11/2017,For the price its overrated. The menu insanely large and overwhelming. I dont think ill ever be back. Now. The cheesecake was good.
Pam P.,"Arlington, TX",7,24,,3.0,5/1/2017,"It is a beautiful restaurant and can be a good place to bring tourist. Food is decent / cheese cake is ok. There are lot of items to choose from. Service needed to be improved. Our server is sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. However, she is gone after she got our orders and drink.  *There is no service charge for 6 or more guests. BUT we paid for 20% + tips for her sweetness."
Rosa J.,"Grapevine, TX",97,139,36,3.0,3/14/2017,"met up with the girls Sunday evening. we got there at 7pm, the hostess told us it would only be 15 minute wait for a party of 3. There were a lot of people waiting so we were a little confused and we double checked with her and she said they were mostly big parties. After almost 45 minute wait later we got seated. Our feet were hurting from standing. there were no seats available. 3 stars is for the service.. he was very attentive. The food is good as always.  but the hostess need to learn how to quote wait times. if they would of told us 45 minute from the beginning we would of sat at the bar and ordered drinks instead."
Kerry N.,"Keller, TX",170,271,818,1.0,1/18/2016,"Our food on Sunday was very late coming out and was not good either. Apparently, ""the side"" that does teriyaki chicken was behind and then they had to do the monte cristo over so it wasn't soggy. Still, our dishes did not come out at the same time. The table next to our party of two was a 4 top. They sat and ordered at least 10 minutes after us. They were almost halfway through their meal before our server even addressed that our food was late. Needless to say, we were full from bread when our food hit the table. The monte cristo was not good, soft (not crunchy) and lacked flavor. The strawberry ""preserves"", which is really jelly, was not on my plate and I had to ask for it. The entire experience was a sad waste of an hour, calories, and a Christmas gift card. Bummer."
Su Z.,"North Fort Lauderdale, Fort Lauderdale, FL",3,16,5,2.0,9/11/2017,"I have eaten here many times and regret it every time. The meal portions are huge, the calories are high and the quality is mediocre. They do great cheesecake though, that I cannot deny. The long wait is not worth it though."
Angelina G.,"Arlington, TX",8,13,,2.0,7/22/2016,"Not pleased at all. Usually I like the cheesecake factory ;but this location I would not recommend. Maybe it was the waitress, maybe it just is like that.. The waitress got only white bread bread for us,only after asking she finally bought out the tasty brown bread . As for drinking I asked water with lemons ( I never got the lemons..) I asked the waitress for a high chair ,she never bought one . so I asked a different waiter and he got me then one. I ordered a salad for me and for my baby a cheese cesadia ,which I promptly changed for the salmon with mashed potatoes from the kids menu. For my salad I asked dressing on the side and lemons .  The salad had some pretty bitter leaves of salad.. Only after repeated asking she bought my dressing on the side. A waiter came and bought the cheese casadia ( I canceled it before to get the salmon) ,so my waitress told him it's canceled and I'm supposed to get salmon .  Anyhow after finally getting the food for my  baby,I already finished my food.  It seemed like she forgot  that I also need more water .  Anyhow I wanted just to leave so I ordered a slice of cheesecake and asked for my check ,which took a while . after opening the check I see she tried charging me not only for the food I received but also for the cheese cesadia ,which I right away confronted her and she said she will fix it .  It was just a really unpleasant situation and I won't return to that specific location.  Very unhappy ."
Teresa B.,"Lewisville, TX",147,43,169,5.0,8/28/2016,"Came here after an early morning church service. No waiting which was great. Waitress was cool and food came quick. Ate the California omelette. It was fresh and hot. Fried potatoes were crunchy and lightly seasoned. I really wanted a pancake with my omelette but I had to remember this was not OPH or iHop, so I made it work with their English muffin bread option. I bought 2 cheesecakes to go because, well I couldn't decide which decadent dessert was going home. I pretended I was buying one for my husband to the waitress. Anyhoo, I went home with the red velvet and the peanut butter cream topped reese's cup flavors. I enjoyed them both much better after putting them in the freezer for a bit. Both were too soft for me initally. Maybe this Texas heat affected them on the car ride home."
Janel L.,"Newark, DE",0,11,1,2.0,7/19/2016,"Service - server was unattentive and when you ask for specific items, it was totally ignored. Server was no where to be found, waited 5-7 mins and need to ask to get a refill for water.  Food - over cooked, the sauce over power everything else. Never again will I order the special there. Setting - indoors is a bit chilly for summer clothing, outdoor has flies landing on your food. I love cheesecake factory and this time I brought along my love one to try it for the first time. His first experience was so negative that he never want to go back to another cheesecake factory again. SMH. Also should bring back the original oreo cheesecake."
Kyle S.,"Saginaw, TX",1,45,3,1.0,12/11/2016,"Consistently bad every time.  We end up here a few times a year due to friends and family visiting from out of town. People who've never experienced the Cheesecake Factory like to give it a try when possible. I'm now going to totally discourage this after yet another poor visit.   Service: 2/5. Always rushed but very, very slow. Last night was a perfect example of this when the server ran off without taking one of our orders! After us waiting 75 minutes to be sat, 15 minutes to be talked to the first time , 20 minutes to get our drinks that were all messed up and delivered staggered over the 20 minutes. Food delivery was just as screwed up.  Good: 1/5. Extremely disappointed again last night. Table of 6 so nothing too difficult to execute yet it was pathetic. Noodles severely undercooked, hamburger for our youngest rare/med-rare after asking for well done, Chicken Parmesan burnt on one side and what appeared to be a raw French Fry in the middle of all the others.  Atmosphere: 2/5. Loud. Not the restaurants fault but it wasn't good.  Price: 0/5. I expect to pay a premium for good service, good food and a good atmosphere so after paying my +$200 bill I felt robbed and truly underwhelmed.  Simply put, I won't be back again."
William B.,"Roanoke, TX",0,6,,5.0,4/17/2017,Kathryn is super generous and outgoing. She is a fantastic server she recommended the shrimp scampi and it was absolutely wonderful. I will definitely be returning here and looking forward to her service again.
Hallie I.,"Honolulu, HI",414,3,,1.0,3/9/2017,"Will not be returning to any cheesecake factory in the future. Tonight in particular was the most unfortunate encounter with this franchise: it was a birthday celebration and a party of six. To receive food it took well over an hour and one drink refill that had to be asked for. Our waitress was hard to find in general. Apparently now to get multiple servers to sing happy birthday...you must purchase a slice of cheesecake. Our veterans are not honored on veterans day...I know because I took my veteran there on that day to thank him for his service. Bottom line is don't recommend this franchise...for the amount of food, quality, price and service in my opinion does not make this place a favorable place to eat. I recommend spending your money elsewhere."
Amanda S.,"Irving, TX",68,35,24,3.0,5/28/2016,"This place most definitely needs to look into a more efficient process when it comes to the cheesecake to-go orders! I've come in a couple times just to get my favorite (Godiva chocolate) cheesecake to-go and each time I wait no less than 20 min. I mean, it's pre-made cheesecake that's sitting on display... you just scoop it out and place it in a to-go box!  Tonight I stood in line 15 people deep, only to cash out and stand in another line 10 people deep waiting on the single cheesecake order. It's honestly mind boggling.  I won't discount the deliciousness of the cheesecake... it's the only reason I keep coming back!"
