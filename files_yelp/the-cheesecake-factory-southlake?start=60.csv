Al R.,"Carrollton, TX",28,205,29,4.0,8/17/2015,"Stopped in for lunch. Was able to get a table pretty quickly which is always a bonus.  Tried the fried mac and cheese balls which were outstanding. Just the right amount of crunch and still soft and gooey inside. There are four of them to an order and are a two bite at least size.  I ordered the grilled salmon with the Thai sauce on the side. The salmon was cooked perfectly with great grilled flavor. The Thai sauce was a nice addition to dish and had the right mix of flavors. The mashed potatoes were real and not instant like many places. They have just the right amount of mash and the occasional little chunk of potato mixed in.  The server was OK and the only reason I dropped one star. She did follow up some but had no real personality and didn't try to make it a great dining experience. She was just going through the motions. So nothing rude or inappropriate just blah ..the five star experience has to have the wow factor on food, atmosphere, and service.  Still a great visit and good food. I would revisit the location again."
Ikhlas A.,"North Dallas, Dallas, TX",0,11,2,2.0,2/24/2017,Be ready to wait for 50 mins before u get seated. Another 20 mins before u get water  Not worth the wait
Ali P.,"Irving, TX",3,41,12,5.0,6/23/2016,As good as it gets!!! Huge portions. Almost everything on the menu tastes good. Service is impeccable. Only thing i hate about them is that they dont take reservations. Had to wait 45 minutes to be seated and 45 minutes is an eternity with 2 toddlers.
Carey W.,"Lewisville, TX",43,49,16,3.0,3/13/2016,"Because the manager and server were so respectful concerning our issues, I went ahead and rated it with three stars. However, the cooks and food runners need retraining. Our appetizer was good. But we had to wait for bread to be baked, and my husband's Marsala Chicken was just inedible. The pasta was dry and chewy from sitting in the window aka heat lamps too long and the wine was not cooked off properly.  In addition, our server though he was polite, did not refill our coffees, which were our main drinks, or our waters which we had to start drinking once our coffee got cold. My Skinnylicious Pear Flatbread which I ate for my entree was cooked to perfection.  Of course My husband say there frustrated with his yucky pasta. We had to ask for the manager. One we explained everything, he cryptically mentioned he would do something special for us. We thought oh cool, he'll take off the coffees and maybe even the desserts. He did the desserts (we ordered two cheesecakes to go, before we asked for him) but not the drinks. Really?? So I had to tell our server we refused to pay $3 each for something we didn't even enjoy or really get. That being said, the drinks were taken off and we received a apology from our server. We're not hard on people usually. We just want decent service and food. Why else would we want to spend the money? Lastly don't try to eat the Low Carb Splenda cheesecake, it's awful. So sweet it's bitter and is served with a measly six little slices of strawberry and runny whipped cream. Sorry, no picture."
Amy A.,"Grapevine, TX",0,41,1,1.0,10/4/2016,"It was a member of our party's BIRTHDAY. We sat outside like we always do, and Amber was our server. Amber was not a good server, only able to complete one task at a time. We watched her wait on another table for task after task while we just sat. This happened again and again. Both the bread basket and butter bowl came out dirty, but Amber was never available to bring this to her attention. An employee sat at the table next to us and started rolling silverware. It was not relaxing and extremely loud. Amber was not available to tell so I went over and explained it was loud and not relaxing and asked the employee to move. The employee made a snarky remark as she moved, ""I'm moving, Ma'am!"" She moved to the next table over! I'm not kidding! After hearing ten more minutes of rolling, I pulled Amber aside and asked her to have the employee move. Amber spent her time (when not waiting on her other tables) bossing other employees around. ""We don't have many plates over here."" ""These are soup spoons; you can't roll with them."" This wasn't relaxing either. We had empty glasses (both bar and water) and an empty appetizer plate when a six top was seated. They received their drinks, and their order was taken. Then Amber was sat a two top, and instead of checking on us, she went to them. After fifteen additional minutes of waiting with empty everything, we decided we wanted to speak to a manager. When Amber finally came over, we let her know we were unhappy and wanted to speak to a manager. So that we didn't interrupt the diners around us, I went inside to speak to the manager. The manager (Caucasian with brown hair) did not introduce himself or give his name. After explaining my frustration with waiting for service, the manager did not apologize. He was not professional and shrugged off my complaint. I said, ""If you don't believe me, let's go ask the rest of my party about the service we've received."" I literally had to walk the manager out to my party because he didn't believe me and/or care. After listening to my party, the manager said he could get us a new server inside. We explained we came because we wanted to sit outside. We were at a crossroads. No empathy from the manager. No apology. No viable solution. He didn't care at all so we left. There are plenty of places to eat where management cares about the customer's experience. This isn't one. UPDATE: Cheesecake commented on my review and said to go to their webpage and contact them directly. I did this BEFORE leaving my review. I have yet to hear from anyone."
Jason D.,"Bothell, WA",24,453,683,3.0,8/13/2015,Use to love this place but hadn't been here in a while. I was VERY disappointed to hear that they got rid of the Mint Green Tea which was AWESOME. WHY??? Then the food and service was just meh. They didn't even have chip and dip. It's not awful and certainly a solid C place but it use to be one of our favorites. What happen to this place?  BRING BACK THE MINT GREEN TEA!!!!
Josh S.,"Dallas, TX",55,91,62,4.0,10/29/2016,"Typical Cheesecake Factory experience. Vast menu of every cuisine imaginable. The meals are made to order, so they can be customized easily. The portions are typically on the large size, so leftovers are frequent. During peak hours on weekends, a large party could wait an hour or more."
Carol T.,"Watauga, TX",5,1,,5.0,12/25/2016,Went here Christmas Eve with my daughter and family. Go at least once a month but this time we had the best waiter ever!! His name is Vincent. He kept us laughing the whole time and had a great sense of humor. And he looks a lot like Nicholas Cage . Thank you Vincent for a wonderful time.  Food was good too
Nat S.,"Keller, TX",0,29,,1.0,11/1/2016,"Frequent diner here. Just walked out of this location, will not be able to eat here again due to the gun free zone signs (30.06, 30.07) newly placed by the front door. Management thought the concern was overblown, also confirmed that there is absolutely no armed security, no security at all whatsoever, at any time. It's a company policy (based in CA) that could have been handled better locally."
Rinny K.,"Irving, TX",392,181,1071,2.0,12/28/2014,Decided to come to South Lake .. Not impressed and will never returned here again .. The service at the bar was awful.  This location is not impressive.  Seems older white people received more  attention than regular people.  I told the bar tender I don't normally order the food that I got today and he was not attentive and walked off .. Wasn't concerned at all about the food and customer satisfaction. Because what I order tasted awful. They have no since of  humor .  I cracked jokes and they were really dry.  I'm better off on my side of town North Park .. 4 star restaurants had better people working there than this place .. Sad face .. So much for Sunday Funday !!! Ps get better bartenders who have a sense of humor ! It's a bar area and requires a different type of service . Aka friendliness !!!
Alyshia S.,"Fort Worth, TX",9,15,,1.0,4/23/2017,"I wish I could give this place zero stars. I regrettably took some ladies who were visiting from Mississippi to the Cheesecake Factory in Southlake, TX. Thinking they served a great variety of food, and neither of the ladies had been to Cheesecake Factory before. I thought the experience at the Cheesecake Factory would be great. I was wrong. We waited a 45 mins for a table which was to be expected on Saturday night. We ordered and the waitress brought out our food cold. The server who brought out the food offered to remake the food. We accepted the offer. There was an extra 15 to 20 min wait on our food. The food was brought out a second time and was still cold, there was no difference in temperature of the food. We went ahead and ate it cold out of fear that the staff would do something to the food due to the bad service we had already witnessed.  After our waitress brought the food out a second time, the waitress attitude got nasty. She rolled her eyes at us and glared at us, talked with an aggressive tone, threw the checks at us, and didn't refill our drinks. We had to ask a manager to refill our drinks. My friend asked her a question about changing her cheesecake order because she didn't like the Macadamia nuts on a cheesecake the waitress snapped back at her and told her the cheesecake was made already and she couldn't change her order. My friend didn't argue with the waitress out of fear she would spit on her food. The cheesecake wasn't on the table yet, why couldn't they give someone else that order, the cheesecakes are pre made. I don't think my friend knew the cheesecake was pre made since this was her first time at the Cheesecake Factory. After that everyone at the table wanted to leave and was disgusted at their experience, but we wanted to speak with manager and let him know about the poor service and food we received. We talked to manager and he didn't seem to care. He apologized but his body language and tone gave off an ""I don't care attitude"". We paid the bill and left. Regrettably the four of us spend more than $150 combined, but neither the waitress nor the manager cared about that so we left a tip that represented how we felt about the service. I personally had a bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory in Downtown Fort Worth about a year ago. Similar issue bad service and food and the manager had an ""I don't care attitude"". I won't eat at the Cheesecake Factory again. The service is always bad no matter the location. I was truly embarrassed and regretted my decision to bring my friends to the Cheesecake Factory. I didn't want my friends to think this is how restaurants in the Dallas/Fort Worth area treat their customers.  I'm not coming back there are too many other restaurant choices in the Dallas/Fort Worth area to choose from that treat their customers with respect."
David V.,"Keller, TX",113,347,861,5.0,4/15/2015,"Overrated. But pretty good. Will always come back. Big menu, so there's lots to try. Nice ambience, classy."
ChefTreana C.,"Dallas, TX",23,40,90,5.0,3/13/2015,"Lawd have mercy this was good eatting!  Of course the food was amazing.. AND THAT D&$@/ Cheesecake was The Bomb (dot) Com.  I've eaten at a lot of places and I actually had to put cheesecake factory on the top of my list.  When we walked I'm out was packed... since it was the Sunday after Valentine's... What really set the mood was the hosts they were really friendly .. And constantly updated everyone that tables were opening up. SIDE NOTE: I hate busy restaurants and I'm quick to go somewhere else.   The hosts were encouraging people to visit the bar... and when she did sit us... I hated the table ... and the host quickly had them prepare us an outside table Okay the ambiance was nice a little relaxing .. their were a mix of families and couples. The patio was covered and in a good location for people watching.  I was so ashamed of how quickly I are my half of the red velvet cheesecake.  The only downside was our server was sooooo boring his personality almost killed my vibe, but it didn't ruin my offer all prescription of the restaurants food and service."
Monica S.,"Grapevine, TX",0,2,,5.0,8/6/2016,"My husband took me to Cheesecake Factory for my birthday and all I can say is that this was the best experience we have ever had. The food was perfectly cooked, the service was amazing, and the General Manager clearly cares that his staff is trained in customer service. If you want an excellent dining experience I would seriously consider the Cheesecake Factory in Southlake! Superb!!"
Alyssa M.,"Austin, TX",0,4,,5.0,5/26/2017,"We were promised a 15 minute wait and were shocked when we were able to be seated in 10 at peak time on a Friday night. We were greeted quickly by our server, Brysson who was very helpful and upbeat. Even though it was busy, he was on top of everything, refills, to-go boxes, you name it. Everything we ordered was correct, quick, and delicious. Very impressed. We will definitely come back and ask for Brysson. If I were the President, I'd ask for Brysson. Hell, Brysson for President!!"
Matt S.,"Grapevine, TX",0,18,,5.0,5/15/2017,I like the food here alot. The pastas are my favorite as well as the desserts. The place gets super crowded so expect a long wait especially at lunch and dinner on weekends.  Ample parking in the mall.
Adam H.,"Coppell, TX",0,3,4,1.0,5/13/2017,Came here on a Saturday around 3:30 in the afternoon.  We were seated immediately and told that our server would be right with us.  Five minutes went by and no one ever came by or even acknowledged us.  I made eye contact with 3-4 different servers who walked by.  We got up and walked out.  Terrible service!
Robert B.,"Keller, TX",430,332,960,5.0,2/13/2014,"The decor is sublime, so much fun. Makes for an eating experience.  The menu is one of the most expansive selections I have ever seen. The price is high, but this is a place to go for a special occasion. The selection is amazing.  The bread they serve as a standard offering, rich and soft.  We ordered two appetizers, the firecracker Salmon and Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. I don't know what to say except both were delicious, unique, and worth trying at least once in your life. We choose the caramel turtle pecan Cheesecake, split in half so we could share it. Rich, nearly too rich, but thoroughly delicious.  We were full from the bread and appetizers, before we shared our desert.  The Cheesecake Factory was excellent in every way."
Ben G.,"Fort Worth, TX",106,34,4,4.0,1/6/2016,"Quick lunch with a bunch of co-workers brought us here today.  Place was clean, as usual, and the menu, well if you can't find anything here you can't find anything anywhere..... After 10 minutes I locked on to the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad and started with a cup of the fresh mushroom soup. Fresh mushroom soup- I dipped some of the fresh dark bread in it and then ate the rest without.  Great flavor and clearly not mass produced.  I would recommend it if you like mushrooms. Seared Tuna Tataki Salad- When I ordered it our waitress said, ""Oh that's the best one"", so my expectations aligned......  When she brought it and I tried the first bite, this is quite good for a non-sushi restaurant and I would DEFINITELY order it next time as well.  If you like Ahi try it.  Light lunch and both items were great. Bathrooms were VERY clean and in order.  Shows that they put emphasis on the little things and it is noticed. Great visit/lunch and I would definitely return.  Nice job everyone!"
V W.,"Keller, TX",0,4,4,1.0,4/27/2017,"Horrible experience. Party of 2.  Ordered American Hamburger.  Waited about 30 minutes to be served. Order came without lettuce and tomatoes af designated on the menu. When asked about whether it comes with garnish of lettuce and tomatoes, we were told sometimes..???  To add to this experience both servings of meat were totally raw on the inside. We have pictures to support this gross mess of meat.  Sent internet correspondence to corporate office. No response as of yet."
