Crystal E.,"Lewisville, TX",16,100,10,1.0,10/22/2015,Super slow service for two to go cheesecakes with 8 servers just hanging out. Numerous servers saw me standing there for 3-4 minutes before anyone even acknowledging me. Waited 10 minutes with no one in the restaurant.
Jewels R.,"Crowley, TX",0,10,3,3.0,10/2/2016,"Seated quickly,  food was very good.  Waitress left a LOT to be desired.  Took quite a while for her to come by for drink orders.  Then she offered to bring bread.  Runner brought our food out. ...very pleasant gentleman.  Didn't see waitress again until done with food and completely out of tea.  Then she brought the bread. Really?"
Matt R.,"Fort Worth, TX",12,15,,3.0,10/19/2016,"Went for Cathie's Birthday. Started with artichoke crab dip and toast. Very good! She had a chopped salad. She said she'd not get again.  I had parmesan crusted chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans. Pretty good, but not spectacular. We both had dessert. Hers was peanut butter CK. I had Pumpkin CK. Mine was great! The PBCK I would not get again.  Service was wonderful and attentive. Cost was way high for overall meal quality. $70..."
M M.,"Arlington, TX",0,18,,5.0,10/15/2016,"Returned to this Cheesecake Factory for a late lunch and dessert.  The server was prompt and very friendly.  We ordered from the regular menu and the choice was difficult since everything looked delicious.  Waiter immediately served water while we were deciding on what to order.  Food was perfect.  Dessert created a small problem.  I knew in advance which Cheesecake flavor I wanted.  When I got to the display area, they seemed to have  added a new flavor, Pecan Pumpkin Cheesecake. Fortunately they have take-out.  Keep up the good work"
Shannon S.,"Dallas, TX",315,297,199,4.0,1/4/2014,"Four stars for the cheesecake, three for the food. I always take strawberry cheesecake home with me. It's delicious, and easily the best cheesecake I've ever had. On the rare occasion that I try a more extravagant cheesecake, like dulce de leche or red velvet, I always regret it. You cannot beat the plain cheesecake with strawberries and whipped cream. For an appetizer, I enjoyed their white-bean hummus and pita bread. They always toast the pita bread perfectly, so that it's warm and crispy around the edges and soft in the center. My entree was a very fragrant orange chicken. The sauce is more of a sticky glaze which they toss with carrots and snap peas. I really like the consistency of the orange sauce. It's sweet, tart, and complements the veggies and chicken and rice. Even the lunch portion is enough for two meals, presuming you're having dessert. I've eaten this exact meal 3 times, now.  I had exceptional service today, too. The waitress was kind and accommodating and watched closely for my drink refills. She also made the perfect amount of small talk with me: personable and brief!"
Jen J.,"North East, MD",14,5,8,5.0,10/9/2016,"Enjoyed a wonderful dinner here today. We waited about 40 minutes for a party of 2. It was packed but seemed that service wasn't slowed down. The food was wonderful as usual.  We both got cheesecake, however I didn't like mine. I got the pumpkin pecan seasonal cheesecake. It is basically a pumpkin pie on top of a pecan pie. My boyfriend had Adams peanut butter, absolutely recommended. My go to meal is the grilled pork chop. Our service was great and we will definitely return."
Kevin H.,"Northlake, TX",4,79,5,4.0,12/19/2015,"Had a very nice meal. The foods good and the atmosphere is cool too. Waiter was on top of everything, letting everybody know about their food and when it was comin. I had a very enjoyable nite."
Paul K.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,18,,1.0,3/3/2017,Worst meal I've ever had there! Service was terrible. We sat almost ten minutes before the waitress greeted us and took our order. My grandkids ordered burgers and fries. The fries never came. The burgers were over cooked. I had to chase down the waitress to ask for the fries and she gave me attitude! They finally arrived. My sandwich was lacking half the usual ingredients and the lettuce in my salad was stale and old. Tonight was the worst!
Lori L.,"Dallas, TX",106,17,21,4.0,7/19/2015,"The food here is great. Their menu is huge and can be a bit overwhelming. I love the red velvet cheesecake. The service here is spot on, I never have a an empty drink."
Bruce B.,"Dallas, TX",11,30,,1.0,8/6/2015,"Bad night?  I have no clue why the service was so bad this evening, but our party of six, celebrating our son in law's new job, was destined to suffer delays throughout our visit.  The wait for a table wasn't bad, but it was downhill from there. Seated, wait, wait, wait, finally our server comes and takes drink orders. Wait, wait, wait, here comes the tea and water,  ""I'll be right back with the Margaritas; wait, wait.  MANY minutes after the adult beverages appeared, our assigned server reappeared and took our dinner order. LONG wait, finally plates, on the arms of unfamiliar waitstaff, begin to appear. Five-sixths of the meals, anyway. Ten minutes after the first five were delivered, our original server reappeared and feigned shock at the fact that one plate, an omelet, remained unserved. Five minutes later (she was first caught by another patron wondering about her meal) she delivered the omelet with little in the way of apology, but quick to note that the plate was still quite warm (thus, I can only assume, believing all is good, right?) Neither the omelet eater, nor any of the other five, was ever asked about how their food was, whether anything else (Tabasco, perhaps) might make the meals even better.  Dinner over, one of the diners asked for a to-go box, which, in almost every situation, would suggest to the waiter that things are winding down, and perhaps the final bill, or, before that (this is the Cheesecake Factory after all), desserts be suggested, but not our waiter. She somehow missed the class on understanding your customer's needs, and we waited another fifteen minutes! Another of the diners actually called the restaurant (there was no staff patrolling in any fashion) to ask that our bill be presented!  Bill in hand, we were finally able to exit this forgettable evening and find another way to celebrate the new job. We'll be going out for dessert, because The Cheesecake Factory failed to live up to its name, or to their pledge of customer satisfaction. As we left, I looked for two or three minutes to find a manager, but if there was one there, they were well hidden.  #NOTgoingBACK"
Susan A.,"Grapevine, TX",0,16,,5.0,3/10/2016,"I have been coming here for years and this review is long overdue.  Being in the restaurant business myself, I don't know how they can have such an expansive menu and execute flawlessly every time... But they do.  My friends and family have ordered quite an array of items over the years and we have never been disappointed.  Drinks, pasta, steak, seafood, desserts... All done to perfection. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food they ar serving.  I've had mostly great service save for a few times it wasn't that great but it won't deter from giving them a 5-star rating.  I'm there a few times a month.  Yes the line is long on peak times but we wait in the bar and it's no big deal."
Bob F.,"Keller, TX",41,59,,2.0,11/5/2016,"The experience: We sat down within five (5) minutes. Within another five (5) minutes the wait service person greeted and menus were presented, and order made.  Pit Deep Dip, and 2 Eggs w/bacon.  Then the wait over twenty-two (22) minutes, and food arrived. Pit Deep Sandwich with beef Au Jus Sauce on the side. Sandwich was cold and the Au Jus Sauce with cold.  The Eggs w/ bacon cold. The only thing served warm was the two little loaves bread on the table before the order taken. After action:  I spoke to the server who fault is it?  The food was cold. He got a little defensive. I told all as well, we are dealing with facts. Is it you or the cooks? He said, he served as soon as it was set up. He avoided a direct answer. This was my first time there. We won't be back unless it's just for the cheesecake.  Total tine sixty-two (62) minutes. They also out the suggested gratuity on the check 22%, 20%, 18% 15% on top of  the sales tax on it. I never like that and never will.  Note: you never tip on the sales tax. I tipped 15%, but the service was nothing special; it deserve 10%. Some times the best tip you can give it tell the wait person what they did wrong. The guy was observed visiting to much and not on his job with customers. Oh yes, also observed he blew it on another table order and failed to get the order right and after they were all finished came back with a similar apology and served the food to the poor left out person and offered a piece of free Cheesecake.  The place was not that busy... poor attention.  * I will not recommend it."
Marcus W.,"Queen Creek, AZ",339,444,37,3.0,6/30/2014,"After driving by this restaurant location a couple of times and seeing unusually long lines I was ready to give up on visiting this Southlake location. After noticing there were no lines, the family took a stab at dropping in, and were seated within minutes. The restaurant is large and can accommodate large groups when necessary. They have a covered patio area that I would imagine is more popular in less humid months. The menu is overwhelming. It's literally a 25-page bound ""book"" with small print to fit their seemingly endless list of dining/drinking options.  Give yourself time to digest what they have to offer, it's a lot.  Our server was friendly enough but rather absent minded. He switched drink orders upon first delivery, missed a couple of specific order requests (no tomatoes on one dish, dressing on the side, etc.)- things that could have easily been resolved by listening to the guests. He was quick to remedy most of the issues and delivered an apology as well, all good. The place is a little noisy, so be prepared to use your loud voice when you come with friends or family. I ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich while the wife got the low calorie turkey sandwich with green salad. Portions were plentiful on both dishes. The BBQ was decent, albeit a little dry. The coleslaw it was served with was very good (on the wetter side, but that's how I like mine). The fries were crisp and delicious! There's a decent kids menu to order from, co-listed in the normal adult menu. Of course, we split a slice of cheesecake at the end of our meal. We ordered the caramel turtle, and there was a huge dollop of chocolate frosting on the top, almost cemented to the cheesecake slice. It was a little too much and overwhelmed the rest of the dessert. Our daughter couldn't get enough. You'll pay a little more for Cheesecake Factory, but the food is pretty good and we always look forward to the dessert at the end."
Elly T.,"Colleyville, TX",228,44,48,4.0,7/10/2015,I like coming to this place with my family because there are many options in their menu for everyone. My family always get some desert too. It's really a great place with a great service.
Robert S.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,5,,1.0,1/30/2017,"Very disappointed.  Wanted to go for a birthday celebration. Had a party of 9. Their wed site says they take reservations, but when called they said they only take reservations Sunday through Friday.  No reservations on Saturdays. Even though I like their cheesecakes, I will never go again. They probably don't care."
Morgan D.,"New York, NY",79,138,203,3.0,12/5/2015,"Subpar. Got take out- think their sandwiches are better then their salads. LOTS of options which is always a plus.  Nice enough place, good location and lots of variety- pretty much a good spot if you're not sure what you want for dinner."
Sean T.,"Fort Worth, TX",275,52,40,5.0,7/12/2015,"Dessert first? Yes please...otherwise you won't have room for it because you'll be busting at the seams with their large portions. If don't have a Texas sized appetite, try one of their designated small plates. Feeling Chinese? Is your wife craving Italian? And your skinny friends want salads? Great, you don't have to compromise, The Cheesecake Factory has it all.  Recommended Dishes: Orange Chicken, it is delicious, and has a touch of spiciness. It's not on the menu but you can ask for it: Pecan crusted catfish. This is a chef favorite!"
Trudy H.,"Keller, TX",3,9,5,1.0,8/6/2016,The seats here are old and very uncomfortable. I have a bad back and cannot sit on a hard seat for long. Its makes my back ache for the rest of the day. The seats have cushions which go flat when u sit down. My husband was perturbed because our waiter kept disappearing. The waiter gave us the dessert menu and instead of asking if we needed a few minutes- walked away. We both knew what we wanted but needed the menu for the name. Then we waited for him to come back. We asked if they had a seat cushion when we first got there and he said no.
Jessie A.,"Dallas, TX",82,315,200,3.0,9/28/2014,"This place is known for its large variety, huge portions, and fantastic cheesecake. I've been here several times in Fashion Valley (San Diego, CA) and it's always pretty good for a chain. Today I had the Louisiana chicken pasta and my husband had a mushroom burger which he enjoyed. Kids had breakfast meals which they liked. Lunch portions are large."
Richard P.,"Ball, LA",0,1,,1.0,1/28/2017,After waiting almost 3 hours to be seated with a party of 7 including to small children. I was willing to split up the party. As we sat down at 2 booths. The big table that we were told earlier decided to get up. As I asked the supervisor to be seated at the big table. She told me to hold on and got the manager. The family I was with haven't seen each other in 3 years. The management and supervisor both refused to let us have the big table. Even though we were promised it earlier. The food was great. The waiter was great and kinda made up for it. But. I won't be coming back. Screw you management
