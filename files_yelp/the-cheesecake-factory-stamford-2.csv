Savannah T.,"Southampton, MA",65,7,,3.0,11/16/2017,"THIS was my first time visiting a Cheesecake Factory restaurant! First and foremost, outlet server Najera was wonderful! Charismatic and attentive, her service was wonderful! Beverages: I ordered the Raspberry lemonade and found it INCREDIBLY sugary! I didn't hate it, but I also couldn't finish it. Food: we ordered the fried zucchini appetizer, that was delish!!! I also ordered the lemon garlic shrimp, this too was very yummy. My issues with my dinner were needing to take the tails off the shrimp myself, not a huge issue but a little difficult doing that with a fork and knife while the shrimp slide around in the sauce! Also, one of the shrimp seemed to still be encased in its ""shell"" of sorts, having to pick bits of the shell/exoskeleton whatever it is, out of my mouth was just not okay. My father ordered the Mexican tortilla salad and had an issue with the severe lack of chicken in the salad, it was ordered from the ""skinny"" menu so maybe that's why the chicken was difficult to find, I'm not sure! I did bring the shell on the shrimp up to Najera and she apologized and said she would mention this to the cooks. Overall this was an okay experience, service like Najera's is what would bring me back to try the experience again despite some minor issues with the food!"
Paul A.,"New York, NY",239,391,443,2.0,12/15/2017,"Oh my sweet baby jeezers. What is America now? Who have we become? What does a 25 page menu say about the general state of our collective consciousness?  For some reason I had never had Cheesecake Factory before and, honestly, I feel kind of lucky after having dinner here. From the nachos to the namesake cheesecake everything was pretty gross. That said, this review is strictly about the food. The people working here were all great and super nice. But oh sweet pepper Jones I don't even know what to say about the stuff I ate here. It was almost like food you would get in an all-you-can-eat buffet on a post-apocalyptic budget airplane heading to Reno. It was just strange. But if you are still reading this, just know that I love you kind reader."
Mary K.,"Darien, CT",0,8,,1.0,12/1/2017,"My sisters and I had dinner at The Cheesecake Factory about two weeks ago.  I had never eaten there and was pleasantly surprised.  So I decided to try their takeout.  I ordered a half a roasted chicken to go last night. When I got home and open the dish there were plenty of mashed potatoes and carrots. The chicken part of the dish consisted of a wing, a leg, and two small thighs.  Needless to say I was very disappointed-enough so that I called today to tell the manager. She said she would take care of it by refunding the cost of the dish.  She asked me to hold on while she went to her computer.  When she came back on the line she said her co-worker said the menu didn't specify that I would get a breast. So in the world of the Cheesecake Factory half a chicken doesn't mean what it does in the real world.  If they were going to have any chance of me believing that I should have received two legs and two thighs.  The bottom half of the chicken. When I replied, ""you must be joking?"" The manager said she'd call me tomorrow.  Let's see if they come to their senses.  If they don't then we aren't having our company holiday party there and I won't be going there anytime soon. I suggest that you don't either. Update-  Two days later and still no callback."
Carol D.,"Stamford, CT",0,6,,1.0,11/22/2017,"""An uninvited guest""  On Wednesday, 11/22/17, my husband and I decided to grab a bite to eat prior to hosting Thanksgiving.  We were promptly seated and our server was attentive. We put in our order, received our drinks and bread and as we were sitting in our booth out crawls a roach on the back of the booth next to me... So we called over our server and she tried to catch it... She said she would move our table... We said no thanks and left.   For goodness sakes hire an exterminator.   My husband and I had an early dinner here yesterday, 11/9 at 4:00 pm, with another couple.  The restaurant was fairly empty at this time and now I know why.... We shared the Nacho appetizer, it would have been good but the chips were so over salted that three quarters of the appetizer sat uneaten.  I had the Bang Bang Shrimp entree which was much too salty, thank god for the rice which helped cut the salt.  My husband had a Classic Burger(no cheese) which he said was not very good and he may have eaten only three or four fries and has had an upset stomach since.   Our dining companions had the Salmon Special and the Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo which they also commented that their entrees would have been much more enjoyable if they were not over salted. The service was efficient and pleasant."
Ann P.,"Greenwich, CT",2,54,58,1.0,11/18/2017,"Oh man!  Not what I remember at all.  I used to LOVE the Bistro Shrimp pasta - the lemon, garlic, touch of cream...  (it was worth the hour long wait!).  Now it is not so lemony, not so garlicky, but still creamy, with a touch of red pepper flakes (not in the description of the dish) and worst of all it must have been cooked and sat in the window for awhile the pasta absorbed all of the liquid and was just thick.  Service is very slow. Why were we here?  Came for my son's birthday and he, the pizza connoisseur, ordered the pizza.  He said 'meh, pizza at CPK much better'.  He didn't even like the chocolate milk.  The best part for all of us was the table bread with butter. I don't think I will ever come back here again.  Ever."
Monica M.,"White Plains, NY",43,296,287,5.0,9/10/2017,"Came here the other day for lunch and had a fabulous server, didn't catch his name but he was hilarious and super chatty. He knew it was my lunch break so he said he would get us in and out pretty quickly. My boyfriend got the pizza chicken and unfortunately when they were making it, it fell apart so they had to remake it. The manager came over and apologized for the wait time. We got our food, it was phenomenal and 2 slices of cheesecake to go. Got our bill and the whole meal (2 entrees and 2 cheesecakes) was comped. I mean wow- the service here is unparalleled. Another reason why I come here like every other week. Amazing food, amazing service, favorite place in Stamford."
Tina P.,"Jamaica, NY",40,87,5,5.0,11/11/2017,"Came here because got a gift card. Did not expect anything to be tasty because of the rating. 3 of us are impressed by the service, atmosphere, food presentation, portions and variety here. Not sure why such a low rating on yelp... for the price of each entree...Its well worth the praise. We ordered "" fish tacos, with battered cod"" comes with cilantro rice and beans,"" sweet and sour chicken and shrimp over brown rice"", and ""bacon burgers with mashes potatos"". All are pretty good..the complimentry  fresh bread basket were a winner as well. Our waitress is got a great attitude as well."
Kev D.,"Stamford, CT",0,1,,1.0,12/30/2017,"1st time coming here it took forever to sit done 45+ minutes, hostess just kept saying 10 more minutes that's all, the food took forever to come.  2nd time here still waiting for a table while typing this 30+ minutes so far, another party walked in with the same size party as mine they didn't want to wait and said they would be going to another restaurant across. Floor manager grabs them and brings them back and promises them they will be sitting quickly. Within 5min they have a table!!!! I complain to manager but get the usual BS and promise to work some magic? What was he planing to kick people out table and sit us down? Another 15min finally sitting down.  If you want to eat here make the drive to WHITE PLAINS NY! the service and twisting time is perfect compare to here never had a issue!!"
Kaye V.,"Norwalk, CT",1,20,,2.0,11/23/2017,"Months go by, and this location improves only marginally. On my last takeout order, I was told 15 minutes but it took 30 minutes and, once again, getting bread is something you must request on a takeout order (plus, after years of ordering white chicken chili, I had never seen it prepared with so much spice and so many beans). My last sitdown experience was yesterday -- 6 minutes before we were greeted by a waiter, and 14 minutes before we received water/tea. The good news is that our meals arrived 21 minutes after the order was placed -- that's record time for this location. Still, there was no bread (still baking, we were told). My hope is that at some point, the apologies will stop and someone will come in to manage this location well."
Peggy M.,"Stamford, CT",0,35,3,3.0,10/17/2017,"So how does this restaurant not have prices on the menu? I thought prices were legally mandatory in CT? Enforced by the attorney General's office? Or Someone? Because it's annoying.  I asked for the price of something and I felt like the bartender thought I was a cheapskate. Yup. I am. So I ordered happy hour drinks *because they had a price* and didn't eat.  The bartender was pretty nice despite knowing I'm cheap AF tho. Lol The manager and some other officious guy not so much as they pulled her aside and quizzed her on something while she was in the middle of making my second drink therefore delaying it. Kinda rude. C'mon guys. So anyhoo- I'll probably go back when I forget how annoyed I am at the no prices situation- it's a very pretty restaurant and well situated in the mall. *RESPONSE TO CHEESECAKE GUEST SERVICES REPRESENTATIVE* So it's totally unclear what you want. There is a section in your corporate website to comment on my dining experience but I have to enter a huge amount of personal information. I thought about it because maybe you'd send me a coupon for free food or something but honestly just don't think it's worth it. Everything about your restaurant from the lack of prices, managers pulling bartenders away from their patrons, websites demanding personal information- indicates you think that diners have no other choices. Way too much work to get a piece of cheesecake."
Norena F.,"Yonkers, NY",0,10,13,1.0,9/22/2017,"This has to be the worst cheesecake location I have ever been to. I have included pictures of what my entree was supposed to be like, and the ridiculous margherita pizza I received where someone spent more time cutting one basil leaf and spreading it out on each slice than they spent on the whole pizza. Talk about cheap. I also included a picture of my fiancée entree. I have had this entree at other locations and again, seems like someone is trying to save money by downsizing their proportions which is ridiculous.  I had lunch with my fiancé on a lovely Saturday afternoon and honestly this place was a joke. This place was completely empty as you can see in the picture and yet they so happen to ""run out"" of the veggie burger on a Sunday? Not to mention that we had ordered the factory nachos which again is listed on the menu as an appetizer that includes pico de gallo, Guac, and etc. What we received? Tortilla chips, with melted cheese and jalapeños. When we told the waiter that was not what we ordered she responded with oh those are the ""regular nachos"".  FYI there are no ""regular nachos"" on the menu. I was so disappointed and after having her take the plate back so they could remake it, I had to tell her to cancel it cause we had received our entrees and it looks like she never even put the order for the ""nonregular nachos"" in!!!! Our waitress was Vanessa A. And after our horrendous experience, she seemed completely bothered and unapologetic. Never coming back here again. I could make my own ""regular nachos"" at home thank you very much."
Amanda V.,"Stamford, CT",29,137,29,4.0,3/19/2017,"I've eaten here a couple of times. The Chicken Bellagio was pretty good the first time I ordered it even though they forgot the pesto aspect of it. I ordered that again for take out and since it's pasta and fried chicken, it is very heavy and made my belly hurt. It was very good though. And ginormous, which is what The Cheesecake Factory is known for.  My husband ordered the California Cheese Steak and he loved it. He said he would order it again.  The orange chicken is not worth getting. Doesn't taste right and doesn't sit well.  The Cheesecake obviously is amazing. Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple Cheesecake is amazing. I usually get it to go since it is so sweet and it takes me about three sittings to finish a single slice. Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake is one of my favorites! Chocolate and coconut --need I say more?  My friend got the Carrot Cake (not the carrot cake Cheesecake -there is a difference!) and it was bleh. If you're getting dessert from here, get Cheesecake, after all it's in the name."
Debbie B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,27,39,4.0,10/11/2017,"Dynamite shrimp were perfectly crispy and flavorful. Would pay more for larger shrimp. The parmesan bread was delicious. Only negative (rare for me here) was the artichoke appetizer, in part as I expected the usual large globe-type artichoke. Smaller ones were fibrous and under-cooked.  May be personal preference so I will ask next time.  The sauce was tasty.  Looking forward to trying weekend brunch.   Update: I didn't have pizza and the manager removed the artichoke appetizer from my bill so no worries here."
Clarisa Y.,"Bethel, CT",15,47,25,1.0,8/30/2017,"I went on opening day for happy hour with a bunch of coworkers starting at 4pm. It looked like every server they had hired was there to work, yet service was definitely slow at the start of happy hour even though half the restaurant was not full. Everything took forever, our multiple servers were slow to come take orders, bring drinks and food. It was a process to plan everything you needed for when they came back. I went here again a month later to give it another shot and service was again horrible."
Miki K.,"Stamford, CT",0,28,3,2.0,12/5/2017,"I have yet to experience the Stamford location - so I'm just reviewing the food and you guessed it - over priced NonFresh food served in a hurried manner bc $$$ is the game - they've built their name and super chain is the game - customers don't matter as much anymore-they are - The Cheese Cake (Chain)?Factory!! Support your local Restaurant Not the chain that was dubbed ""the worst family restaurant in America"" for 2010 in Men's Health Magazine."
Erika D.,"Stamford, CT",3,21,8,3.0,10/27/2017,Went here for happy hour last night.  The bartender was great and super great service and our happy hour food was great. However the three stars goes for takeout...Ordered a bbq ranch chicken salad to go but with crispy chicken. When i got it i saw that it was grilled chicken and the bartender did a great job running to get me the crispy chicken. However when i got home i realized takeout didnt pack any dressing and the dressing is why i wanted the salad in the first place....
Matthew V.,"Greenwich, CT",20,87,22,4.0,8/16/2017,New Stamford location. Service was atrocious as is typical in lower Fairfield County and Westchester County. Food took over 1 hour and nothing special was ordered. Even the kids meal took that long. The food was surprisingly great and way better than White Plains. The parking is a hassle and a far walk if bad weather. The valet is $6 plus tip and they do not validate. The outside patio is very beautiful and the outdoor booths are super comfortable.
Katherine P.,"Stamford, CT",138,993,927,3.0,12/5/2016,"So, I wanted to show Lee the pinnacle of American Chain excess. A place where you get OK food, in ginormous quantities. He had never been to a Cheesecake Factory, so I suggested that now that this location has been open for a couple of months, they probably have their opening wrinkles ironed out. So. Friday night, quoted an hour wait. We don't mind, so we hung out and waited. We were seated after about 40 minutes, so that was a nice surprise. I was not expecting there to be much special beer wise, but I was actually surprised to find that they had 2 microbrew selections, one of which is from Stamford's local brewery, Half Full.  The server was super new and really seemed to be under stress with such a busy night, but she got our drink orders out promptly. She was suddenly replaced after that, which was a little unusual, but no matter. Lee wanted to try an appetizer, and I let him pick the buffalo blasts. This is the point where the quantity vs quality starts. These are basically deep fried chicken wing dip, encased in wonton wrappers. They weren't BAD, but there was enough on the plate for about 4-6 people.  I really wish they would allow half orders of things like this. I went for the Steak Diane and salmon combo, and Lee got the ribeye. These dishes are probably some of the best choices on the menu if you don't want to overeat. They were both cooked well, their medium is more like medium rare, and my rare was nicely rare. By this time we were rather stuffed, so we split a key lime cheesecake piece, because you can't really come here without having cheesecake. I probably wouldn't come back for dinner, not because it is bad -- it is what it is, and the service was efficient and pleasant. This place is a food factory, and it is definitely not a place you are going to be surprised by. It is going to be the same experience, whether you eat here, or in San Francisco, or Virginia, or any other place. I'd probably pick up takeout cheesecake, but I can think of more interesting and creative places I would rather have dinner at in town."
Rowe P.,"Milford, CT",1,6,4,4.0,11/10/2017,Good food! Great night. I had the celebration cheesecake. Can't wait for the peppermint bark cheesecake.
Elesi D.,"Westchase, FL",44,132,681,5.0,11/27/2016,"Based on the negative reviews and the fact that they just opened in Stamford besides being a part of a food chain, I would give this plce 5 stars instead of 4 as I originally planned. The service was very warming and too friendly for me as a New Yorker. The food was mediocre. Nothing stood out. I get the feel that this restaurant is trying to cut back on sodium and fat...unfortunately fatty foods are delicious. Other than that it was edible but not comparable to the best"
Robyn B.,"Norwalk, CT",283,16,,5.0,10/18/2017,Kyle has been the most amazing waiter I have ever had since coming to Cheesecake Factory in Stamford. He was extremely helpful and knew what to recommend from dinner to dessert. I most likely won't sit with anyone else when I come here. Thanks Kyle !
Wen L.,"Burbank, CA",0,9,7,1.0,7/24/2017,"I've been to this location about a handful of times since it opened. Usually the food is decent, though the wait and service is slow.  Today, however, has left me extremely disappointed.  I had a craving for the chicken and shrimp gumbo, which is my favorite dish, so I ordered one to go.  When I got home, the box I opened looked like I had instead received someone's leftovers. There was a small lump of rice, about four tiny pieces of shrimp, the chicken was little bigger than slivers, and it was all very watery.  The slice of banana cream cheesecake was delicious, but definitely only about half the size of a slice it used to be. Also, there were no sliced bananas on it.  I am very turned off by this most recent experience. If this place wants to stay open they cannot have such drastic differences in food quality."
Audrey C.,"Stamford, CT",3,42,4,3.0,7/14/2017,"So if eat here I recommend asking for Kyle because he's really great at being a server. He's entertaining and will go the extra mile to give you great service. The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because of my last visit after dining with him. The woman who served us didn't remember much of what we asked of her, she barely stopped by the table & it was relatively slow although she was nice. The food is pretty good."
Arun R.,"Stamford, CT",2,14,,4.0,9/24/2017,"Thus us the second time here. Went with the family this time around on a Saturday for lunch. We didn't have any waiting and Alex our waiter was very courteous and helpful .  The nachos and breaded zucchini were very good . The nachos plate was huge , so don't order it if you are planning individual entrees and dessert later . The California omelette was ok. We ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta which was quite good .. . Unfortunately we were already full and couldn't eat the cheesecake .  Overall , I docked a star as I thought the price was on the higher side for the value I get ."
John B.,"Newtown, CT",0,12,,1.0,9/30/2017,"I see why only 2.5 stars. I give it 1. Sat at bar.  Felt like I was a bother. More concerned with server drinks then the customers at bar unless you are a pretty young  girl.  Ask for bread when ordered and received half way through meal when asking  secomd time when food was delivered. Bartender excuse "" I put order in"".   I was asked if want second drink and said I wanted water.  Never got it .truely my first bad experience at a cheese cake factory after coming here for over 10 years.  First and last time at this location."
Drew M.,"Bronx, NY",1,23,3,4.0,3/29/2017,"Went last week friday night, was ready for an hour wait.. seated within 15 min.. Nice!! Food was great.. Cooked my steak they way i liked and thru in a extra side for free..  My daughters salmon was good.. She ate it all and wanted more..  Girlfriends chipotle pasta was a lil skempted.. Guess thats why the waitress gave us an extra side for free..  All in all.. This location seems to be getting better.."
Jenette P.,"Shelton, CT",10,11,3,2.0,3/5/2017,Very disappointed I have been to others and were pretty good.  I ordered the eggs Benedict and it came out like a boiled egg. If a cook doesn't know how to make a poached egg he shouldn't be a cook!  Wait staff was very nice however and were very apologetic but still the meal itself was a let down
Rachel S.,"Carmel, NY",51,248,1,4.0,4/13/2017,Ordered food (lunch) to go and when I arrived it was ready and as ordered.  Place was crowded so really glad I was not waiting for a table.  Our salads were perfect and I would have no issuing in returning.
KT S.,"New York, NY",1,16,1,4.0,9/29/2017,"This place is great. The food has improved so much since the last time I was there, around ten years ago (at the Providence location.) Although the menu is extensive (I love the options!), they do a very good job with making each dish taste delicious. I had the nachos and they were delicious-some of the best I've ever had, quite surprisingly.  I also ordered an entree, cashew chicken and it was exactly what I was hoping for. The portions allowed me to have leftovers ALL day! Instead of having cheesecake (shocker), I had the tiramisu and it was so tasty. The only bad thing I have to say about my experience is that the drinks we ordered tasted like they barely had any alcohol, a bummer since me and my husband never really go out anymore since we have an infant."
Jacob P.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,67,3,1.0,1/16/2017,"At this Cheesecake Factory, we were treated with disrespect and horrible service.  The disrespect and service from the waiter (whose name is SOPHY) was so bad, that I was unable to finish my dinner because I was made to feel uncomfortable eating in an establishment that I was paying for a descent meal. This place has succeeded to be the worse place that I've ever eaten.  I will explain exactly what type of service my colleague and I received here during our visit. A colleague and I decided to try this place after a business conference.  He's never been to The Cheesecake Factory before and he really wanted to give it a shot; so I agreed that we'd have dinner at this restaurant.  From the time we arrived to the moment we were out the door, we were given the worst service that I've ever experienced; and to make it worse, it was intentional by our waiter. We were called up to the front to be seated by the buzzing of the handheld pager.  As we arrived up front, there was an issue with the seating arrangements.  The host kept us waiting around the front seating area for several more minutes to find a table, and then asked if it was okay if we sit in the high chair tables near the bar.  After waiting so long after being paged, we agreed to sit at the high tables.  After being escorted to the table, it was filthy with crumbs.  We stood there and waited at the table for several more minutes for someone to clean up the table.  Finally, a guy arrived and wiped down the table. After being seated, my friend decided to order a beer.  The menu had no beer prices, he was curious as to the price of a Miller Lite.  When the waiter whose name is SOPHY came to our table, we asked her for the price of the beer.  She immediately gave us an attitude saying ""I don't know"" and then grunted.  She refused to give us a price then proceeded to say ""Just order something, ugh, I give up"" and walked off without taking our order.  This was the beginning of a bad experience. After she walked off, she returned several minutes later and my colleague asked her again for the price.  The response he received was a cold stare with her facial expression half cocked. Without getting an answer to his question, he opted for a water.  I decided to get a lemonade and then she made a snarky comment, ""Oh finally, someone is getting a drink.""  At this time, we ordered our food. After waiting a while, the bread and beverages arrive at the table but with no utensils.  We tried to wave down our waiter SOPHY again but we were ignored.  We waited for several more minutes and tried to capture her attention each time she walked past our table but still we were ignored. We started eating the bread and butter with our fingers and ended up asking another waiter for utensils. About 40 minutes pass by and we were near starving.  I was wondering what was taking so long, so the waiter saw me glancing at her and came over and said, ""Let me check on your food.""  After several more minutes pass by, she came to our table and she that she forgot to check to see if our dishes were ready.  At this time, I realize that we were intentionally getting bad service.  The waiter kept running around and went no one near the kitchen, she saw me glance over again and she gave me a rude hand gesture to wait. Shortly after, our dishes arrived and she commented that ""Hope, you didn't wait too long"" in an extremely sarcastic way. She ignored our table for the remainder of the meal and we never received any refills or checkups.  Finally, she stops by and my colleague ordered some cheesecake.  A few moments later, the cheesecake came back in a to-go bag along with our check.  I was only half way done eating and we were already getting a check?  I knew we were not welcome here and I no longer felt comfortable in this establishment.  I was begging to just checkout and leave.  I asked to get a to-go bag so I could finish my meal at home, and I also requested a slice of Dutch Apple Caramel Strudel.  The waiter got really upset and crumbled the receipt in her hand and left.  She returned and said, ""We're out of the Dutch Apple Caramel.""  I didn't want any other kind of dessert so she took the books with our credit cards.  I stopped her and asked her for a receipt because she crumbled up the last receipt in her hands.   She then said, I can't give you a receipt until after I charge it.  It felt shady to me but I agreed to go ahead and run my credit card without getting the price.  She returned with the bill and slapped the ink pen on the table with attitude and never bought back the to-go container.  I had to ask again to bring a to-go bag and she got really upset.  After she returned, I packed my food and was going to walk out but I felt this needed managerial attention on how the waiter treated us a patrons. I explained all this to the manager and he said he will address the situation.  The manager apologized and offered the same Dutch Apple Caramel that the waiter said was out."
Nicholas J.,"Norwalk, CT",1,15,25,1.0,8/28/2017,When I went to dine was expecting a great service. Instead we where forgot by staff. Never got bread. Server came after 15 minutes from the time we were accommodated at our table. Went more than ones and all times service was slow.  Food wasn't that good. Ordered guacamole and never came to our table. Serve apologize saying the avocados were frozen and couldn't defrost it  Never going back again!!
Laura D.,"Bronxville, NY",184,15,3,4.0,2/3/2017,"Went there on a Thursday around 5pm. Place was somewhat empty as they were getting ready for dinner rush. Very pleasant experience. Our waitress Aimee was very polite and attentive, came to our table often to check if everything was ok and it was, everything was great. We were surprised with the big happy hour menu and decided to take advantage of it. We ordered Buffalo Wings, Fried Mozzarella, Greek Salad, Beets and Arugula salad, and shrimp. Everything was very good, including the Strawberry lemonade that we had and to make it better it was free refills!! Was not impressed with the Oreo shake though, but I guess nobody is perfect. Will return whenever in the area!"
Zehra K.,"Yonkers, NY",0,7,,1.0,12/26/2016,"So apparently my first comment was removed, which admittedly had been about an experience that my friends had at this Cheesecake Factory.  Lemme break it down for everyone looking to come here. Don't. Run away and find ANY other place near the mall in Stamford. I PERSONALLY called in for lunch and ordered a small soup- they told me it would be 15 minutes (because it apparently takes that long to put it into a cup) and when I got there I waited another 40 minutes for soup I could've gotten at CVS and microwaved myself.  This place is terrible. Don't do it. Don't. Don't even think about it.  You'll thank me :D"
john m.,"Manhattan, NY",0,36,,2.0,8/6/2017,"Poor service,  mediocre food.    Very poor service,  it seemed that the staff did not want to work there at all.   I had to wait at least 15 minutes for the waitress to pass by to get my orders and the worst was that I had to go look for the waitress to get my bill.    Food was awful too,  the steak was overcooked.  The calamari appetizer was more like calamari bits."
Amber T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,,1.0,1/6/2017,"ALWAYS OUT OF FOOD! I've been there four times now, and every time I've ordered they don't have half the thing listed on the menu...including cheesecake! They also seated us once and told us it was an accident because they were already closed. Another time when they messed up the order, the manager was extremely rude and said it was basically our fault. Now we just ordered over the phone for curbside delivery and they said they couldn't come to our car because they are understaffed. Are you kidding me?! I thought this was a professional restaurant.  What a joke."
Brian F.,"Stamford, CT",0,80,21,2.0,7/13/2017,Been here three times now since it opened. All I have to say is NO.  On two occasions the waitstaff was arguing with the bar staff and I'm pretty sure neither of them knew what they were doing.     Literally just  overpriced mediocre food.  The only reason to enter through the dike would be to have some cheesecake.  Luckily their income is supplemented by the chain gang but I feel like this restaurant has less than 2 years left before stamford boycotts. I mean just read the reviews.     I had brunch there twice an both times was underwhelmed by the food and the corporate bar pours.  Bloody Mary and mimosa were ridiculously light and I accept that from restaurants who actually use TEAL EGGS!!' 20 dollar omelettes that are simply egg beater scrambled eggs with whatever ingredients placed inside.  It's pathetic.      This place is basically comparable to hotel food. Over priced and never worth it.    NEVR AGAIN
Jose C.,"Stamford, CT",11,230,332,2.0,11/13/2016,Bad experience starting with parking. We waited a long time  behind 4 cars who were waiting for Valet parking while we wanted to go to self parking. Entrees took a long time to get to table. My wife's dish was cold. I ordered pasta which I had ordered in other cheesecake restaurant and it wasn't great. Expected In a just opened restaurant. I only gave it the second Star because our waitress Adrian G was magnificent . I will re-evaluate my review on my second visit.
Carlos D.,"Mount Vernon, NY",20,58,89,5.0,11/20/2016,Service is amazing here and staff are very friendly. I suggest not making a reservation as you would have to still wait. Just go their at your own time. Love the dessert here and food is worth the price.
Kenny I.,"New York, NY",2,9,5,5.0,5/30/2017,Went here for Memorial Day and it was crowded. we sat at the bar and met another friendly couple from Out of town. The food was amazing although the bartender could've used some help but he made it all happen. Taking orders and handling drinks for the bar and the Restuarant so kudos to him. Had the smokehouse burger which was well fitted and so good for the holiday and they agreed to allow my friend have goat cheese in his burger which was amazing.
Gypsy G.,"Stamford, CT",2,10,,5.0,10/27/2016,"Finally made it into The Cheesecake Factory in Stamford for the first time. Initially skeptical about what to expect because I've heard varying reviews from friends and family.   We arrived at around 2:50pm and were greeted at the door by a friendly hostess and sat within two seconds at a booth for four.  We were then greeted right away by the server. The Mac and Cheese balls are the best at Cheesecake and we also tried the Tex Mex Eggrolls which were delicious. This time around for my entree I tried the Teriyaki Chicken. The chicken was really moist and flavorful and the pineapple and banana complimented it really well.  Shelly our server was friendly, genuine and attentive and it's service like that that will ensure return visits."
