James D.,"Stamford, CT",0,6,,2.0,11/10/2016,"Went last night (11/9) with one of my co workers. The food was great and didn't talk long to come out since the place wasn't crowded since we came around closing time. The service was absolutely awful. No lemons for waters. We ordered milkshakes, our server stepped back from the table, looked at the bar and said ""the bartender is going to be mad at me for putting these in."" Then she proceeded to come back 10 minutes later and tell us that they couldn't be made cause they didn't have milk. I work as a server as well, I'm pretty sure the bartender was just feeling too lazy and didn't want to make them as she was closing. Oh well. We were also seated next to a server station where the servers horses around there throughout our meal. They've been open for a month now so being new isn't an excuse anymore. Would probably go back just cause it's in a convenient location for me but definitely the worst service I ever had."
K R.,"Stamford, CT",0,3,,1.0,1/7/2017,"I used to love going to Cheesecake factory until I come to the one in Stamford. I was so excited that Cheesecake Factory opened in my home town...but it's truly a disappointment to everyone i talked to. 1st time - I went to get a cheesecake to go - it took them 20 mins to put the cheesecake in the box. 2nd time - Dine in - 2 of the dishes weren't available, waited 1 hour for the food, and one order was completely missed as our order was sent out to another table so we have to wait for another 30 mins for our food. 3rd time - Order take away - was told to pick up in 25-30 mins. Got there 30 mins after ordered (5 pm)......I could not get my food until 5.30 pm. The food was terrible, the rice wasn't even cooked properly (still hard). And the staff is very rude and standoffish..............WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE??? Can't they just get it right? Why I never experience anything like this at other cheesecake factory? Well if I can recommend the other people out there - Go somewhere else, Stamford has many options for everyone. Or go to White Plain and get your Cheesecake fix if you need to. Avoid this place."
Toya F.,"Norwalk, CT",16,2,,1.0,12/27/2016,"I was totally disappointed by the service and the lack of empathy from both server and management Sever( Ashley and Managers Andrew and Jen). First let me start off by saying that it was my daughters 16th birthday and decided to spend it there knowing the service and the food were awesome at the Trumbull location. Asheley started off as our sever then it switched over to another server ( who was amazing) because she went on break. Now let me just say that I have been in the food and beverage industry for over 20 years.  I started off as a server and got promoted to management.  OUr food was bland and under cooked and when I complained about it Ashley went and got the manager Andrew who just came to the table and said would you like another side, he did not even apologize.  I wanted 20 minutes for my mac and cheese side to arrive so it ruined my bland fish tacos. My daughters pasta had 2 peices of chicken and pasta was beyond al'dente.  Here is what really ruined our experience.  I previously bought a cake from them on Friday ( Chocolate Godiva Cheesecake) on Thursday because our original plan was to go to Hibachi. I should of kept my original plans. I asked Ashley if they can cut the cake for us, she came back with the cake uncut and said that the manager Jen said there is no one here to cut the cake and there would be a cake cutting fee. I could not believe that there was no one there to cut my daughters cake but they were going to charge me a cake cutting fee. Does this make any sense? So Jen comes over and says with an attitude is there a problem, I said not I will cut the cake myself. I did not want to start any drama and did not want to get loud because my daughter was already upset and did not want to make the situation worse. They didn't even bring us a knife to cut our cake.  I spend $30 on that cake and they told me they were going to charge me a fee but there was no one there to cut the cake. So if i was to pay the cake ;cutting fee, who was going to cut the cake? Makes no sense. I will never go back and i will take this complaint further. I am not done with this, my daughter left crying and her birthday was ruined. Ashley had the never to come over and say I was going to cut the cake for you after we were done eating our cake. Extremely upset. A little advice for the server if your table is upset you need not to ask me if i want to speak to a manager. It is your job to make sure that your table leaves happy. You are suppose to go to your manager and make it right before we head out the door. I can not believe out of all the bull shit about you guys having the best servers and only hire the best! Wh;y would I want to speak to a manager when they both had no care in the world to make things right. This is not over......"
