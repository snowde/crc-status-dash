Hakikat T.,"Stamford, CT",0,4,10,1.0,11/7/2016,One of the worst service ... still waiting .. over an hour. Don't go Staff bit ignorant  They don't care
Karly G.,"Niantic, CT",206,23,1,5.0,8/1/2017,Absolutely love this place. My boyfriend and I's go to spot for a quick and healthy meal. We always have the salmon and kale salad!! AMAZING.
Marie L.,"Greenwich, CT",8,2,,2.0,11/18/2016,Waiting time is way to long (1-2 hours for 2 people).  The waitress/waiter are not very nice.  Have the feeling that they don't even care about you.
Aybak G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,,1.0,3/12/2017,"I have had a few  poor experiences at the restaurant (yes I came back).  While the food taste good for the most part, it always takes very long and waiters bring dishes to the same table at different timing (today I got my food long after my kids had finished eating theirs); this makes the experience very frustrating. I recommend management train both chefs and waiters better so we all can have a more pleasant experience. A few months went by and I did come back again based on the management response to my original feedback. They did not change much: I order an avocado toast without onion (allergy); they took it back and said they would make a fresh new one. I was surprise to see the very same toast all messy with some few pieces of onions coming back to my table. I had a bad impression about their service and they topped it not with very poor hygiene."
Fernanda G.,"Greenwich, CT",0,2,2,2.0,9/30/2017,The service takes waaaaay too long (I waited 20 mins after ordering cheesecake over the phone).. the brownie was cold ‍but the cashier was nice.
Candice G.,"Stamford, CT",0,14,,3.0,6/1/2017,"Have been here a number of times, always prepared for at least hour wait which is always the case if not more.  Hostess are always nice and pleasant.  Waitstaff is always a mess.  Expect at least a good 20 minutes for a waiter to come to the table to greet you and drinks from the bar is an ungodly wait.  Waiters are the worst, basic hospitality skills are not there.  Wait on food time is insane.  And then to get your check and out the door is another wait.  Every time I order food something always comes out wrong.  We always spend at least two hour here while at the table for drinks and entrees (no apps, no dessert). I will say portions are large and food is good. If you can deal with bad service and long long waits prior to sitting down and also while at the table you will be ok."
Iammacmoney ..,"New Haven, CT",0,1,,2.0,9/16/2017,"Food portions were great, but food was just ok, neither of us finished our food, wait time on our drinks was ridiculous, along with an inattentive waitress who just didn't seem to want to be there or have us as guests. Received a desert menu from a busser since our waitress could not be found, then nearly 15 minutes later she appears. Having been a manager in the restaurant industry for several years now it is an utter shock to see such poor service being given in what's supposed to be a great restaurant. Won't be visiting this location again"
Grace G.,"Stamford, CT",2,22,,1.0,2/1/2017,"We went for a company outing of 8 people right before the holidays. Half of the orders were wrong and when the food did come out; it was freezing. When we asked to speak with a manager he told us how they don't take reservations and how he did us a favor. Really?! Why not apologize for being understaff and fix the issue. My family tried to go again last week so I called ahead so we could try and get a table as we have a 10 month old son. I was told no reservations and when I asked to speak with a manager no one ever picked up the phone. By the time we showed up the wait was 45 minutes. Any parent knows this is not going to happen with a hungry baby.  If cheesecake doesn't get their act together they will be out of there pretty fast. Try going to plan b next door, yummy food and very accommodating for kids!!!!"
Brandon S.,"Stamford, CT",1,5,2,2.0,1/13/2017,Gave it an extra star because the cheesecakes are good but I tried the ceased salad that tasted like seafood and the lemon chicken and it tasted like I was eating straight lemons. On top of that the service was so bad after our dinner we waited 30 minutes before ordering our cheesecakes to go to avoid an even longer wait.
Karin O.,"West Hartford, CT",7,1,,1.0,9/9/2017,Horrible curbside service. I guess the phone didn't work and then I was put on hold for over 5 minutes while they tried to figure it out. Bunch of employees just sitting around talking to each other when I went inside. The food not good either. This is a location that I would pass on.
Mike D.,"Stamford, CT",0,12,12,1.0,9/5/2017,Service and food was horrible. The server brought one item at a time. Literally one dish at a time ok maybe. 4 coffees one at a time the next trip cream the next trip sugar. The same with the drinks during the awful dinner. Not worth the money or the wait
C F.,"New Haven, CT",0,10,,1.0,12/14/2016,"I went to the Cheesecake factory last night 12-13-16 to give it a shot. Since it was a Tuesday, there wouldn't be a huge crowd and since they have been in business for a while I figured they would have everything ironed out.  I arrived there and the atmosphere was extremely nice. I get seated by an extremely nice hostess. At that point, is where the positive ended. I sit down and immediately the waiter comes to the table while my fiancé and I are still taking off our jackets and asked us what we wanted to drink and order. I told the waiter we haven't even sat down, but ordered two waters and a drink. A different person brings the drinks back (1 water and 1 drink). No big deal to me. Approximately 30 minutes later, the waiter comes back and asks us what we want to order. Well the male literally put his face next to my face, it wasn't even that loud but maybe he had hearing problems.. I get it.  Next our appetizer came out, The Spinach dip with artichokes. I would assume the food runner brought that food out quickly which he hit the drink and almost knocked it off and then walked away without saying a word. The food was barely warm which it was supposed to be hot. We waited about 5-10 minutes thinking our waiter would come back and ask how everything was. He didn't come back so my fiancé and I figured we would just eat some of it. The app was also bland but it wasn't too bad. Maybe it if it was hot, it would be better. After that our dinners came out, a Shrimp with Pasta dish and Salmon. Again, a food runner brought the food (my waiter still hasn't come). They gave me a piece of lemon but I would have liked another one for the Salmon. Problem is, still no waiter after 5-10 minutes. As well, they served tartar sauce with Salmon. I honestly have never seen that which was different. I finally just asked the waitress for the table next to me for some lemon. The waitress goes, ""Have you seen your waiter at all recently?"" I replied, No. I thought maybe that message would get to him, but it didn't. Regardless, I never got another piece of lemon. I tried the lemon and the broccoli. I ordered the Salmon Med-Rare which was over-cooked but the broccoli was good and so were the potatoes (if you like barely warm potatoes).  My fiancé dish with shrimp tasted actually really good. Her only knock was they gave 4 small shrimp on a huge pasta dish. But if it tasted good, I was looking for some positive to get out of there.  Now that she ate her dish and I ate about 5 bites of mine, I told myself well at least I saved room for desert. Well after 20 minutes of her dish being pretty much empty, and I haven't eaten no waiter still. I again asked the waitress for the next table if she could rap the dinner which she agreed and apologized for the waiter we had. I asked her for the desert menu which she came back with. Now with our food bagged up, the waiter FINALLY shows back up. He asked, ""What can I get you for desert?"" Not how was everything, sorry for not being here for the entire course or anything of that manner. At that point, I just said I will take the check. I have been a waiter for over 10 years of my life so I know the business. I understand we get busy although they really weren't that busy. But that was probably one of the worst servers, if not the worst, I have ever had. Maybe he was new I don't know. But I can assure you, I will never go to that restaurant again. I have told everyone I know the same thing and people were looking forward to trying it but they all pulled back.  I wish this restaurant the best of luck but I think the only thing that may keep it alive for the first go-around is the name of the restaurant being so popular. Once people try the food and see the service, unless the other waiters/waitresses are better, they will be another closed business in Stamford. On 12-15-16, they asked me to send this review to their corporate office which I proceeded to do shortly after. As of this writing on 12-22-16, I still have not had a response back. Good job on horrible customer service!"
Chester P.,"Darien, CT",0,9,,4.0,1/26/2017,"For such an arrogant name to put on the front of your restaurant - all I can say is WOW! The cheesecake really is fantastic. Glad to see such a humble mom and pop shop open in this area. We certainly don't need any of those chains taking away from the hard working people of this great city. It truly is the city that works - and this place goes to show exactly why. Also, try the Super Antioxidant Salad. While it sounds quite humorous, for someone like me with quite the attack of heartburn from time to time (making it quite tough to be such a food critic) I never have felt more deoxidized. This place checks all the boxes!! A+"
Ed G.,"Clintonville, Columbus, OH",0,34,1,1.0,7/29/2017,"I love eating at the Cheesecake Factory, but their business practices stink!  Today they have a sign in the window advertising a make believe holiday involving cheesecake.  The sign says ""Any Slice Half Price"".  As embarrassed as I am to have fallen for it, Wyatt, the manager, looked me in the eye and claimed he ""couldn't"" honor the advertisement because he ""didn't have the key on the register"".  In 2017 the General Manager of a national restaurant ""can't"" divide a price in half.  There were families with small children who went to that restaurant while I was there for the half price deserts.  They were guilted into buying those children full price cheesecake.  Stores around the world utilize abacuses, blackboards and adding machines to calculate what Wyatt can't do.  Sad."
Susu M.,"Old Greenwich, CT",0,3,2,5.0,10/29/2016,All the negative reviews are a bit harsh. They just opened!!!!!! They are working out the kinks with the staff!!!! I LOVE THIS PLACE Nothing is better than Cheesecake Factory. We used to drive to white plains to go to this restaurant AND we would wait for a table. The reason they are so crowded and have a wait list for tables is because the food is awesome!!!!! So to all you critical people I say go somewhere else and we Cheesecake Factory lovers will have less of a wait
Jaewon S.,"Greenwich, CT",18,5,,2.0,12/10/2016,Most disappointing cheesecake factory I ever been to.. I went here twice since the opening. So excited to order my favorite steak on the menu but somehow this place has different one. I asked for medium well but instead they gave burnt steak that was cooked like well done but extremely well done like it was so dry. Also the portion of the meat was so small that I thought I ordered something else. Aren't all the cheesecake factory menu/style the same? Or they vary by the location? My mom and sister ordered something else but I remember they were very blend in flavor (we didnt even take the leftovers) and so freaking salty that i had to refill my drink three times. I thought it was gonna be good because it was always packed with people...
Jillian G.,"Grand Rapids, MI",1,9,,5.0,11/28/2016,"I came to the Cheesecake Factory late on a Saturday night after a late dinner at the fez. It was around 10:30, and we sat at the bar. The bartender wasn't upset we were there late and was very helpful. I had a glass of wine, my boyfriend had a beer, and I ordered two slices of cheesecake because it was my birthday so why not! We ordered the vanilla bean and the Godiva chocolate. To die for! Mixing them was the best decision I've ever made. After we didn't finish them the bartender boxed them up for us and put them in a little bag. Great service, great wine choices, and excellent cheesecake! If I'm in Stamford again I will probably be back!"
Kellie R.,"Stamford, CT",9,116,197,4.0,1/14/2017,This location is particularly small compared to other locations. The service was memorably slow and we had to ask for menus. Our waitress was friendly and nice and was apologetic of a few minor things. The food was great (same as all of the other CCF locations). Would go here again but I would make reservations next time...such a small dining room.
Lana V.,"Stamford, CT",67,44,,3.0,8/3/2017,I will always love this place but the service here is not that good. Some of the waiters have social anxiety and sometimes they are low staffed during the week. I had to flag down a waiter a couple times last night. Dessert and all dishes are amazing though! Highly reccomend fried zucchini!! Go here after 9 PM during the week and weekends after 10 to not have a wait!
Adam S.,"Westport, CT",24,17,,1.0,6/12/2017,Very expensive for mediocre food. Don't bother.  Management gave lame excuse that my $20 salad was worth it because it had 5 thin pieces of tuna. It barely covers the plate. He was unapologetic and clearly uninterested in having a happy customer.
