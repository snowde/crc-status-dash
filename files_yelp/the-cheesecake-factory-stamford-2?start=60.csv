Jamie L.,"Washington, DC",0,23,40,1.0,10/22/2016,"Dreadful experience. The wait.. at 330pm on a Saturday, we were quoted 40 minutes. Took more like an hour and 15? And there were lots of empty tables the whole time. Both the menu & the table had hair. (Just gross) The food took ridiculously long. We didn't get our food until an hour later? Had to go to the register just to get the waitress to take our card so we could leave. That still took her another 10 minutes to figure it out. (With at least 4 people helping her at one point.) There were staff just hanging out/ crowding en masse. There were only 2 stalls in the bathroom for that many patrons?  Ok, so, the food.  It was fine.   Definitely wouldn't go back & would advise others to avoid it."
Doug K.,"Syracuse, NY",0,5,,1.0,11/6/2016,"After an hour and half our food never came. This was after an hour of waiting for a table. The waitress said she was ""waiting on our burgers"".  I wouldn't take two hours to make a burger.  It took half an hour for bread. No water refills. And an hour for our app to come. The waitress said she was going to get our food after we complained. Then we saw her standing around in the corner texting. Bull."
Roshan S.,"New Rochelle, NY",6,19,37,3.0,12/1/2016,"I've been to many different Cheesecake Factories all over the Eastern Seaboard. However excluding one in Maryland this establishment has had the worst service. My party of eight called ahead to make a reservation and the person who took our call said that they did not take reservations. Fun fact: Cheesecake Factories only do not take reservations on Weekends. I did not know that Thursday was part of the weekend.  I digress, we called several times after that and our call was either ended midway or the staff failed to pick up the phone. We spoke to the manager who obligingly provided us with seats (How gracious!) However once we had ordered the manager came around again and told us that we had to either break up our party or wait half an hour for a table we could stay at.  Once we managed to get a table our server was very helpful. Our food arrived promptly and was well cooked/prepared.  Overall, the wait and kitchen staff are great. The manager seemed generally overwhelmed and the service of the restaurant seriously suffered because of this."
Matt C.,"Stamford, CT",3,12,4,5.0,10/18/2016,The sour dough bread sucks but the service was very excellent and prompt and the bacon bacon burger is off the chain lots of bacon deff a must if your in Stamford
Alejandra S.,"Norwalk, CT",14,1,,5.0,1/15/2017,"I love the food and desserts!! But definitely love the service, the waiters made me feel at home, super attentive and willing to provide the best service!! My five starts is to waiters"
Rebekah C.,"Mamaroneck, NY",76,4,2,1.0,1/8/2017,"I have been here 3 times and never again will I go back. The first time they gave my table away after the buzzer went off and made me wait another half hour. The second time the waiter did not come over to our table a single time and then followed me out the restaurant to ask why I didn't tip him. The third time was by far the worst! We waited over an hour for our food and was served raw poached eggs not once but twice ( photo included). The manager admitted the eggs were raw but decided to serve them anyway since the chef ""rushed to make them"". Save your money and choose a different establishment to eat at."
Ali L.,"Greenwich, CT",0,42,7,3.0,7/10/2017,"We have been to this location few times.  The first time the service was excellent, the second time it was ok and yesterday it was awful.  We wanted to order quickly because we were dining with 2 toddlers but it took forever to get the waitress to come over.  The restaurant was not busy so that was not the reason. I ordered the factory burger which was served on a rock hard baguette. My husband cut his lip on the bread (same stale bread in the bread basket as the factory burger).  Such a disappointment,"
Renee G.,"Stamford, CT",30,3,,5.0,1/3/2017,"Fantastic meal! Amy did an amazing job, very sweet and attentive. Love the food here and had a great experience :)"
Debra M.,"Stamford, CT",0,32,77,4.0,6/24/2017,"Three of us had lunch today. We enjoyed the Classic Burger which was good as per my hubby. The Renee Special -Turkey sandwich, soup and salad was enjoyed by by father in law which he said was very good but too much food. It was a bowl of soup not a cup. I had the Asian Chicken Lettuce wraps and a side of sweet potato fries. It was delicious!!  Just enough for me. Service was good, friendly and 3 people carried out our food to us."
Yaneth S.,"Norwalk, CT",0,1,,1.0,6/21/2017,"I went to The Cheesecake Factory with some family after a graduation and they told us that they couldn't seat us because they had no room. Typically, I would understand this however there was a party that had a 15 people reservation, when clearly the Cheesecake Factory doesn't do reservations. I was also talked to with an attitude and told I needed to wait 3 hours to be seated (it was 8:30pm and the restaurant closes at 11pm). Waiting clearly wasn't an option. Overall I find it upsetting how my family and I were treated and the special treatment they gave the other party. If you take reservations you should take them from everyone!"
Terrell L.,"Stamford, CT",0,4,,5.0,10/21/2016,"All I can say is the food is excellent and the service is top notch.  The only thing was I had to wait about an hour to get seated,  but it was well worth it.  I really  enjoyed my self as so did my wife,  we had a blast and left stuff.  Thanks Stamford for having the Cheese  Cake Factory, it's  about time.  We will definitely be returning again,  real soon."
Brian G.,"East Hampton, CT",0,6,,2.0,3/5/2017,Good food but very bad service. They told us it would be a 20 minute wait which actually turned out to be more like 40. We ordered our food and the appetizer came quickly but then the main entrée didn't come for about another 30 minutes after. The whole ordeal for lunch on a Sunday took just over two hours. There are a lot of other good options in that I would recommend over this one.
Pedro L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,,4.0,12/2/2016,"Had the BBQ Chicken Salad and Oreo! Extreme Dream Cheesecake! Ordered for pickup. BBQ Chicken Salad - About what I expected. I got the dinner portion for lunch (savage right?!) and it was loaded to the max with Chicken, avocado, corn and black beans. I hate 3/4 of it because towards the end I was so full. Oreo! Extreme Dream Cheesecake - Oh lawdy that was rich. I hate like 1/2 of it and left the remainder by I95 for the hungry pedestrian. Delicious. 7/10 - filled me up and helped get over the fact that I work in Stamford."
Jack W.,"Stamford, CT",0,18,2,1.0,2/28/2017,"Let me start by saying, we love the one in Westchester. Having said that, I gave this one 3 tries before writing a review... I kept going back hoping I was wrong. I can confidently say that I will NEVER go back here again. What a cluster f**k of a mess this place is. Holy cow. I'm sorry, there's just no other word.  Every time I have been with my husband and my two kids (4 years and 1 year) - and they are incredibly well behaved, thank God... because this place has kept us waiting on various occasions.  First time- server never puts order in. By the time they realize it, they tried to cover it up and say that because I ordered my cheeseburger well-done it was holding up the order. I used to be a server, I know all the lies, and that one is bulls**t. Don't blame the customer for your screw up. You know how I know it was a lie? Because when I got the burger it was completely RAW inside. I almost threw up. I'm so mad writing this I don't even want to keep going... but I will. They apologized and didn't charge us for the burger, but at that point the whole experience was ruined.  Second time - Same thing! Can you believe it? Literally, the exact same thing happened. I ordered a sandwich (don't remember which one) and it never came. It just never came. On top of it, we ordered an appetizer and the server kept coming back saying they were out of ____. That happened 4 times. 4 times they were out of everything we ordered! Seriously? I would chalk it up to the fact that they were a new restaurant, but it had been open for a few months at this point. Plus, there are Cheesecake Factories all over the place, shouldn't they have this down to a science?! Third time- we got smart and ordered salads. No need to cook anything. They brought my daughters spaghetti within 20 seconds of ordering it... and then we waited 50 minutes for our salads.  50 minutes. They weren't even busy! We were there at like 4pm and it took them almost an hour to make two salads.  If you're at the Stamford Mall, go to Capital Grille. To be honest, it's not that much more expensive. Or go literally anywhere else!"
Doug C.,"Stamford, CT",44,16,5,5.0,12/26/2016,"After a horrible experience at their White Plains location, and walking out, we decided to try Stamford. TOTAL 180! The hostess was so friendly, and despite it being PACKED, was amazingly organized. Our server, Jake, was phenomenal! We never went without anything we wanted or needed. It was my fiancé's birthday, so it really needed to be special. This experience totally made up for the crappy experience earlier. Thank you to the awesome team, especially our new favorite server, and Whyatt, the general manager. He even came over to talk to us and wished Derrick a happy birthday!"
Tiffany W.,"New Canaan, CT",0,17,21,2.0,5/21/2017,"Disappointed is the word that comes to mind after dining here. I must preface this with the fact that we have been to several different Cheesecake establishments in various states and have come to rely on a level of customer service and quality. For starters we never did receive bread which is customary. We were told by our waiter it was coming but alas no bread. It took forever to get our drinks.  My hubby didn't get his salad that went with his meal. After trying unsuccessfully to get our waiters attention (literally walked right by us several times as we were saying, ""excuse me"") , he finally got his salad. He refilled our drinks after we asked several times. The food was good but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth. We will not frequenting this location again."
Alex M.,"Stamford, CT",0,6,,2.0,11/7/2016,"I do understand this a new place and will probably take some time to get up and running properly but the experience I had wasn't the most welcoming.  Our server, Carly, was great and he seemed new and maybe a bit nervous but delivered excellent service.  This rating isn't for him because if it was then he would get a 5.  He's the reason why this is getting a 2 star instead of a 0 or 1 rating.   We went in for brunch and ordered what we thought was a pretty simple plate but it took us about 45 - 50 mins to get our food.  One might say that it was busy and maybe that caused the delay but we went in when it opened and there weren't many people in there when we arrived.  There was actually a table who came in about 15-20 mins after us who ordered the SAME FOOD and yet they received theirs before we did.  The table right next to us came in after we did and ordered there food and got it before us.   Now, they did comp us a meal which we appreciated but I would give this place some time before it reaches the potential of other locations near by."
ASHLEY R.,"Stamford, CT",0,3,2,3.0,2/4/2017,"The food good, and mid week or mid day the service is decent. Don't even attempt to go here on the weekend. Waiters and waitresses struggle to keep up. Bread is served and butter is forgotten, waters are not refilled etc. however all of this I can understand because of how ridiculously busy it is. I don't blame them and do give them the benefit of the doubt. It's hard. I took 2 stars away because of the hostess. This girl had a terrible look on her face as she stomped her way to seat us at our table while chewing gum like a horse. She did not smile at all and had a horrible attitude and was extremely rude to us. It was not a nice way to start a meal. Very unprofessional. She should go to etiquette school."
Grisha B.,"Stamford, CT",0,4,,4.0,10/24/2016,I was so happy to see cheesecake open in Stamford. The staff was friendly. Our food took alittle long to come out. The staff was friendly about the mess my little guy was making. I agree with the bathrooms only two stalls bit enough for the Stamford crowds. We had lunch in the  afternoon so it wasn't so crowded and still somethings were delayed. The bread wasn't warm and little stale. Otherwise I wish lots of success to them.
Kyle C.,"Greenwich, CT",2,2,,4.0,10/24/2016,"Shrimp Scampi, great as usual. Steak Diane, great as usual. Chicken Madeira, great as usual. Service completely sub par. I always made the trip to the White Plains location, and was hoping the service would be better in Stamford.. Yet they are new, and I have the utmost confidence that they will figure it out. The managers actually reached out to me, and wanted to make things right! To me that says a lot! Mistakes will always happen, ticket times can hit 20 minutes, (like in any restaurant.) but order another drink and stop looking at your watch. I will be back. Also, a quick thank you to the Factory for reaching out!"
