Melissa T.,"Manhattan, NY",348,4,,1.0,12/18/2016,"SO slow, so inept and inefficient. They buzz 15 mins before a table is actually ready. The food (salads) took over 45 mins to arrive. The staff has no sense of urgency or customer service. The manager sounded like she read, ""How to Speak to Customers"" and parroted it back to unhappy diners."
Katie T.,"Fairfield, CT",0,1,,1.0,4/23/2017,"I wish I could review the food at the Cheesecake Debauchery, but my husband and I left when we were completely ignored for 20 minutes after being seated.  Both tables on either side of us had different waiters and neither one had the common sense to ask if anyone had helped us yet.  We attempted to get their attention and were being actively dismissed. Upon leaving we told the manager that this was our first trip to this location and it would be the last.  It was obvious this was not the first time he had heard this comment from dissatisfied customers."
Mike T.,"Stamford, CT",0,21,,2.0,4/23/2017,"I was there for dinner last night, at 6:00.  When I asked for seating for 2, I was told it'd be 20 minutes.  They buzzed me in about 15 so that was good.  I ordered the soft tacos, with rice & beans.  The tacos & beans were fine, albeit everything was luke warm.  The rice was cold, clumpy, not cooked enough (some was actually crunchy), dry & tasteless.  It was pretty much inedible.  Our server, Carol, was lovely - attentive & friendly!  She gets an A+"
Iris Q.,"Stamford, CT",0,9,3,4.0,10/20/2016,Had a great experience today. I went to eat for lunch with my husband. The customer service was great and welcoming I loved that everyone acknowledges you. Food was amazing well cooked served in a timely manner and server was knowledgeable too.
Kevin R.,"Norwalk, CT",0,7,4,1.0,4/13/2017,"Very bad experience. Not like the other Cheesecake Factories. Danbury even the Trumbull mall is better than Stamford. I went for an afternoon lunch on Monday. Service was horrible. The waitress was rude and took forever to take our order. The place wasn't even busy. Employees were at the bar eating and drinking. The food was average didn't even bother staying for dessert. Took cheesecake to go and confused my banana cheesecake for a strawberry classic. I don't know how you confuse the two. Avoid if possible, head towards any other than this one."
Jac D.,"Norwalk, CT",50,9,,2.0,12/27/2016,"What an eventful evening. I thought to take my girlfriend here to celebrate her birthday. To start the night out they said it would take 20-30 minutes for a table. Which is totally understandable. We waited a good 30 minutes or more. But once we started seeing people that came after us get seated I figured to ask what was going on. They told us they paged us a long time ago. Which in fact i promise you it did not buzz. I didn't eat much the whole day cause I was excited to try one of everything (yes I'm exaggerating). So with an appetite I held that pager and stared at it to the point I didn't blink and I had crazy dry eyes! But yet there was no apology on their behalf and they put the blame on us. Thankfully they put us to the next seat available. In my head I'm thinking this is just the beginning to a badddd night. But we were still hopeful. They offered us two different types of tasty but stale bread to hold us over which triggered my TMJ. As an appetizer we ordered the factory nachos. Surprisingly it was good. Big enough to have been our meals. I ordered a Philly cheese steak with fries. And she ordered the grilled chicken and avacodo with fries. Both sandwiches are exceptional, but you can get it at your nearest Italian spot for half the price. The fries were cold. And tasted like the fries from Wendy's. And to top it off my girlfriends birthday cheesecake had a piece of cardboard in it. The manager apologized and took both of our desserts off the receipt. And sent her with one to go home with.  I gave 2 stars. Mostly for the effort. Nothing more."
Stephanie V.,"New Rochelle, NY",0,10,,3.0,1/24/2017,"Food is great, service could be better I've been to the one in Stamford about 4 times and have had the same experience with the service being slow and wait staff not as attentive as they should be. This is the reason for the 3 rating."
Sarah Z.,"Greenwich, CT",0,13,,1.0,11/20/2016,"Worst Cheesecake Factory we have ever visited.  I was told the wait would be 40-45 minutes.  After waiting for 45 minutes, we were told it would be another 10 minutes.  We then waited another 20 minutes while watching three tables sit with no customers.  I also noticed two tables who had ordered and received no food for thirty minutes.  When I complained to the manager and used the word 'crap' in a sentence I was told that he doesn't like it when people swear at him and get upset.  At that point I walked out.  I was very excited for this Cheesecake Factory to open, but i will be continuing my travels to White Plains to eat at this restaurant."
Carly B.,"Stamford, CT",0,4,,1.0,12/27/2016,I recently went to Cheesecake Factory for the first time and was very disappointed. I will never go there again. To start off with we sat done and opened our silverware and there was food on it and it was very dirty which really disgusted me. The food was ok but  I stopped eating when I found multiple pieces of hair in my salad and could not bare to eat anymore. For the price you pay for this food I would have expected more.
Jose S.,"Stamford, CT",0,2,,1.0,11/6/2016,"Decided to visit this place with family, first the wait... 1 hour 15 minutes... second the waiter... didn't know her elbow from her butthole. Moved extremely slow , did not provide us with water , app came out 40 minutes after we ordered them meal came out another 40 after that. She Disappeared a lot at times, and to finish it off double charged my debt card !!!! I will NEVER come here again. And I suggest you don't either!!!!!"
Chelsea C.,"Stamford, CT",0,1,,1.0,2/4/2017,Food was good but horrible service! Very long wait. Waiter checked on our table ONE time for the hour and a half we were waiting. We were over hearing the wait staff arguing about drama going on between workers.  Very unprofessional.
Biglos C.,"Stamford, CT",0,1,,5.0,12/1/2016,Excellent food great service the waitress name Sophy was friendly and funny. I would recommend the place to friends and family
Carly P.,"Stamford, CT",248,5,,1.0,1/3/2017,"This restaurant is the living breathing embodiment of a night mare. If I could give it -1 stars I would. First of all, when we showed up to the host stand they told us it would be a half hour wait which somehow doubled over time. Then after that ridiculously long wait it took at least 10 minutes for the server to take our drink order and another 5 for the bread and butter to come. The drink came out flat and I paid about 14$ for it. Then when we ordered the appetizer and  it somehow came out about  only 10 minutes before the rest of our meal and was partially cold. Not to mention it took about 45 minutes for a simple mac+cheese burger and spicy Chipotle pasta. The busser staff was good. Then after all that the server forgot to sing happy birthday to my sister and keep in mind this was only a couple days before Christmas. Happy holidays. All in all the bill came out overpriced as always and the manager only comped one thing off the bill after they said we would also get a complimentary cheesecake. But we didn't and they just disappeared. All in all I felt neglected and the service was nothing short of awful and the food was no where near worth the cost. This is the worst cheesecake factory that I have been to ever. Why couldn't the Hard Rock Cafe haf moved to Stamford instead. If they keep up like this hopefully they will be replaced by the Hard Rock."
Liz L.,"New Canaan, CT",0,5,,1.0,1/2/2017,"Came in for an afternoon treat on a rainy day, but probably won't go back to this or any other Cheesecake Factory location anytime soon. Three servers in the bar area gradually sorted out whose high top table we were at over the course of about 30 minutes, nachos weren't even made with corn chips and I'm pretty sure the chicken samosa was in fact beef (tasty, but not chicken). Without the well-oiled operational chain restaurant machine in action, you realize the food really isn't worth it.  Skipped the cheesecake treat I came in for and just baked brownies at home."
Elenie S.,"Norwalk, CT",0,15,1,3.0,12/26/2016,"The staff is very nice. I waited 20 minutes for an appetizer which was only a beet and goat cheese salad. I ordered a burger cooked medium and it was very well done. However, I do believe the food was sitting under the heat lamps for about 20 minutes because when my friend got his chicken avocado club the bread was all mush and our fries were cold. They forgot the sweet potato fries and charged us for it. Anyways, this was my second time trying out the Stamford location. I am not impressed. I believe this could be a really good place if they speed up the cooking time and actually take a minute to give a sh** about the customers food that is sitting in the window. Pay attention to the food ready to go out and pay attention to cooking at the right temperature. No one likes to complain and wait an extra 20 minutes for food to be sent back when it was the kitchen or staffs mistake."
Mellisa B.,"Summit, NJ",0,5,,2.0,10/27/2016,"Not too impressed. I did not dine in, as I didn't want to deal with the wait- it was only their second day open so of course they were going to be busy. Not a problem- they offer curbside pick up! My first issue was with their lack of organization- other valet attendants at the Stamford town center told us we could not wait at the designated curbside pick up area because we were blocking the other valet areas- which we were not. Curbside was not ready once we arrived after our 45 minute wait. There was much confusion over who was actually retrieving our order. After waiting ten minutes, we finally got our food. Unfortunately, the food was not that good. Regular pasta with just plain tomato basil sauce and some mozzarella. The pasta and chicken were obviously not cooked in the sauce- making it flavorless. The mozzarella was low quality and not fully melted. The basil didn't taste fresh either. For the price, the food sucked. I would DEFINITELY choose their location in White Plains over this one in Stamford. Both their kitchen and FOH staff seem to have some work to do."
Kelly H.,"Stamford, CT",0,15,18,5.0,10/21/2016,"This restaurant was a mad house, but the manager Nikki made it seem like no big issues. We were worried about making a movie, told them upon check in and they made it happen. It's great to see good service in Stamford!"
Mick C.,"Stamford, CT",0,3,,1.0,5/27/2017,"I have been to plenty of cheesecake factory's around the United States. I have always left happy and wanting to return until last night. Our server (who's name I believe to be Maryam) was nothing but blatantly rude. Our food took alittle longer than expected, and that's completely fine because I'm fine with waiting for good food. The problem I had is every time we asked a question about our food or how long it would take, she had nothing but a list of excuses. She would talk about how the cooks weren't ""doing a good job"" or how the management was unprofessional. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe someone's would really bad mouth the company they work for the way she did. After trying to flag her down (impossible) and sitting and waiting for about an hour, a waitress brought our food out. (Cindy I think her name was) She was extremely polite. Even though we weren't her table she still brought us cheese, refills for our drinks and cleared our dirty plates!! She even came back to check on us! All around our food was good, but the service from our assigned waitress was extremely unprofessional. If I could give the restaurant 4 stars I would, our waitress however would get a zero"
M W.,"Stamford, CT",0,3,,3.0,11/8/2016,"The food and service were fine. I was there around 5:15pm, but it got busy quickly.  It's not fine dining. But if you're hungry after shopping at the mall all day, it will do.  The portions are too big. I'd rather normal sized portions and have the prices reflect that.  I will avoid the desserts going forward.  The cheesecake was mediocre. My husband ordered the chocolate fudge cake. It was like lead. I wanted the cheesecake to be the best I've ever had, but it was rather disappointing."
Kristine M.,"Stamford, CT",0,4,,1.0,10/27/2016,"Didn't have the best experience. Food took forever to come out, the manager came to apologize which was nice, but then it took forever for our dessert to come out and my mother was getting her cheesecake to go and it still took 45 minutes which her parking meter had expired and she asked to speak with the manager again and she never showed up. It was also my birthday and our server asked my mother to write my name down and they STILL spelled it wrong. Horrible experience."
