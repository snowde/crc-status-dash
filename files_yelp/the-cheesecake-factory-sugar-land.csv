Monique A.,"Pittsburg, TX",930,324,1175,5.0,9/14/2017,"I surprised this restaurant was not busy. We were seated right away at 7pm. Our server was great and attentive. She took our drink orders for immediately and was prompt I. Taking our dinner order. We ordered Fish Tacos, my friend said they were very good. I assume so because he left nothing behind on his plate. My husband ordered the Rib eye and he was very pleased that they got the temperature correct (MR). He also said his steak was tasty and perfect. My other friend ordered the Teriyaki Chicken and he said he also enjoyed his meal and had no complaints. I ordered the cashew chicken and it was good but I didn't like all the sauce they had on there. It was so much the Rice was saggy and mushy. I just ate pretty much the chicken and left everything else. I did order the Goat and Beet salad (smaller portion) it is one of my favorite must have when I come to any Cheesecake Factory, We ordered a slice of CARROT CAKE to go and plan on eating that tomorrow. Can't wait!!!"
William L.,"Katy, TX",0,4,,1.0,12/28/2017,"So upset! had to wait 20 mins for the waiter to see us and then told us ""Wait be patience"" then after he does see us I asked why so long to ask for drinks? ""do you want another waiter"" What???? lets go to another place to eat, mind you 30 mins and no drinks the manager said I will take  care of you guys, we said that's OK and we left, Cross OFF this place for  the future"
Tim D.,"Santa Fe, NM",0,16,,1.0,12/18/2017,"Twice we tried this restaurant. The first time we left because of the filthy floors and dirty restrooms.  On our second try our waitstaff was not only slow and generally inattentive but also the food, when served was not hot.  It was as if the food had sat in the kitchen for thirty minutes.  Our waitress did not seem like she enjoyed her job at all. Very unpleasant! Pre-occupied. Nothing. Glasses remained un-filled most of the dinner.  I would rate management 1/2-Star in this joint. We will not return."
Cher S.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,7,1,1.0,10/11/2017,WOW! MOD had no clue how to resolve an error in our food order. He explained the waitress rang up the wrong item which we already knew. The remake took 15 minutes.  No one followed up to see if her food was prepared to her liking. He offered us cheesecake - we said NO! After telling him we actually ate dinner separately he still did not get that their service was substandard.  He just did not get it - empty suit - lack of training - NOT a hospitality manager at all I won't be back.
H P.,"Sugar Land, TX",2,36,40,3.0,1/1/2018,great place for dessert because they are known for their cheesecakes. the whole-wheat bread with butter is a must try. over the year the menu keep on changing which is good and bad. they took away our favorite dish asian chicken over rice. we stop coming to eat. great decor and ambiance for dining
Jessica N.,"Houston, TX",30,47,205,3.0,7/5/2017,"I have always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory! The food. The dessert. You simply cannot go wrong, especially the CHEESECAKE. OMG THE CHEESECAKE! HELLOOO.. thats the freaking name of the restaurant!!  Lets start off with the cheesecake we ordered, hazelnut crunch cheesecake and holy moly this was so decadent and delicious in the most addicting way. Crunchy hazelnut throughout the cheesecake with the sweet rich Nutella on top of the cheesecake was just perfection.  My favorite dish here is the miso salmon, because its a simple light but super flavorful and yummy plate of food that will fill you up but will not make you feel heavy. I ordered brown rice instead of white to attempt to be healthy. Hahah!  We also ordered the herb crusted salmon and avocado, mango chicken salad. The herb crusted salmon could have used a bit more seasoning but it was laid on the most smooth and creamy mash potatoes! The salad was good, but they did forget one of the major ingredients which turned out the be the avocados! This was much needed since it added the creamy texture to the salad. Overall a decent, semi-light salad.  Be prepared to eat because the portions were huge!"
Ada L.,"Sugar Land, TX",422,484,3164,3.0,4/29/2017,"Foods seem to have improved; loved everything from the eggroll sampler, shepherd's pie, chicken alfredo to the miso salmon, blackened shrimp with black bean, penne paste, and last not be least, the cheesecake and the complimentary bread basket!   But, service was very slow and not attentive at all.  I had to ask the server 3 times for a high chair while my 9-month old was up in the air messing around with the menus, the silverware, the tableware, and anything that she could reach off of the table, which was just frustrating.  It took like 20-25 minutes to have a high chair finally brought over.....Glad that we did not break any plates or glasses."
Lisa K.,"The Woodlands, TX",231,965,2392,2.0,5/27/2017,"What to say, what to say about food.  First off, service was superb! Fast & friendly. Barely had to wait at 2pm, even though the place was getting crowded.  Got a seat at the perfect spot! Ordered: 2 small plates -Fried zucchini with ranch dressing (I can feel the oils layered on my skin).  -Chicken Potstickers- burnt bottoms and VERY salty. Need to drink a gallon of water to wash down all the sodium intake. I didn't even finish this dish. That's how bad it was.  Note to self: do not come back for the food.  Waiter Joshua was pretty awesome! He wasn't annoying and kept checking on me. He knew exactly the perfect pace to come back. Oh and if you're wearing black pants- do not put their napkin on your lap! Leaves white fuzz all over!"
Marebear P.,"Sugar Land, TX",16,207,14,1.0,11/18/2017,"Was eating my leftovers (chicken costoletta) at home because Cheesecake Factory portions are amazingly huge. But then as i was cutting up my chicken, i found a black hair in between the chicken and breading. Barf."
Will K.,"Arlington, TN",0,1,,5.0,11/29/2017,Great place to eat!!!! There are a lot of places round this area but I really enjoy coming here to eat with my friends and family. Never had a bad meal coming from this place and the chef is also great. Very nice people and great tasting food for all to enjoy.
Jon P.,"Rosenberg, TX",91,109,527,4.0,10/21/2017,"Sooo.....after a long time of debating, I decided t come here and have my birthday dinner here with my sister and my aunt and my cousin. My sister came in earlier to book us a table but it was so packed when we came in she had to come and lead us to the table. The entire we were there water would drip from the ceiling every now and then, which our server explained as the vents. Interesting....didn't know it was so hot in here, cuz I can't think of any other reason for drops of water hitting me every ten minutes. Anyway I ordered a J.W's sparkling lemonade on ice, fried Mac and cheese, and Romano chicken, while the rest of my party got an appetizer sampler and steak/meatloaf. I liked the firecracker salmon that was part of the sampler and my Mac, though I think they should have used cheddar too instead of what I think was just mozzarella. My lemonade had too much booze, I was expecting it to be a little sweeter. As for my pasta dish, the pasta and the sauce were great and the chicken was very crispy, however it was also bland. The dish also hardly tasted of cheese despite the menu stating there was Parmesan and Romano. Maybe it was just in the sauce? Hm. Bc it was my birthday, I also got a special birthday song, yay! For dessert we all got at least one cheesecake except Auntie....she was full. I got to try pumpkin spice cheesecake, the Godiva cheesecake, and my cheesecake, the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake! It was so luscious, and made even better by the fact that I got it a la mode (aka with vanilla ice cream). It appears they change their cheesecake flavors periodically, since the pineapple cheesecake my aunt wanted was no longer made. Our server was excellent, and the main reason I bump this to four stars, she did an excellent job despite having other customers to work with. Next time I come though I'll just get cheesecake, the factory has a way of making dishes that make people too full for dessert."
Ray S.,"Houston, TX",294,297,1985,1.0,11/20/2016,Crowded but not busy or noisy.  However still slow as I remembered. We sat down at 2:35p it is now 3:37p.  they finished taking our orders. And they started taking our order at 3:25p water came out at 3:05p. I ordered dessert first. The Dutch Apple Carmel Streusel. It was GOOOOOD.  One of my cousins  had the Oreo Cheeses cake . I ordered a  MISO Salmon. 15 minutes later I was asked again did I want it and for here or Togo ??? I want to say more but these fruit flies. Now what I hear from everyone here is that their food was good.  Too much wrong to get any higher score.
Ema E.,"Houston, TX",177,81,4,1.0,9/26/2017,"Ok. EVERY time I come here  (which I NEVER suggest),sooooomething gets Messed up. my order is NEVER correct...EVER...and the service is SUUUUPER slow. the manager ALLLLWAYS has to come rescue our table...and while I always appreciate him...it should never have to come to that."
Roman J.,"Sugar Land, TX",65,24,24,3.0,5/24/2017,"Dessert was delicious. Food here is okay,  the atmosphere is nice a bit chilly inside so bring a light jacket"
A D.,"Houston, TX",18,28,1,1.0,9/24/2017,The service was by far the worst I have experienced! We waited an hour and a half just to receive mediocre food. The food was nasty and bland. I was so hungry and afraid to send the food back in fear that it would take another hour that I settled on my nasty dish! The manager appeared when we were about to leave. Explained to her about the service and the mediocre food and she said that she would come back. Never saw here again. I can't believe we paid 113.00 for some nasty food. Sad day  Never going back!!!
Maria B.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,2,1,4.0,10/12/2017,I love this place! I always get the avocado egg rolls and they are delicious. The staff is very friendly and attentive.
Atifa C.,"Houston, TX",124,2,,1.0,11/21/2017,"Starving we came here hoping for good quick service but we were treated with terrible service. After ordering food we ended up waiting 50 minutes before the manager decided to come and apologize for the wait. Even the apology was not genuine because the manager showed us attitude. Overall terrible service, very disappointed."
Janice Z.,"Houston, TX",14,20,32,4.0,5/8/2017,It tastes soooo good and looks gorgeous. As a sweet tooth，for me，cheesecake factory is a real heaven. I like the macaroni best because it is cheesy and creamy. I chose the ice cream as the after meal dessert. a littble bit sweet.  good service as well. One thing I should concern about is the calories. yes...its toooo high to burn. but I will come again to try the so called cheesecake.
Richard W.,"Sugar Land, TX",224,42,78,3.0,1/7/2017,"For a cold January day, my friend and I wanted to catch up with some good food. We though, ""What better than good old Cheesecake Factory""  the ambiance is quite spectacular. The beautiful interior has a vibe that is warm and inviting with a touch of class. The location is perfect near theFirst Colony Mall and bySugar Land Town Square, except parking is a little bit tedious. In order to combat parking frustration ,  Cheesecake Factory has valet so I must say quite a great service. As for the food, I must say I do enjoy a nice lunch menu. Though still a little pricey they have a good portion for their lunches. I usually get the miso salmon which I find quite delectable. This time I decided to experiment and tried the Shrimp and Sausage Rigatoni pasta. The presentation was beautiful, there was so much pasta I could not be happier. But I was disheartened at the fact that the salt levels were much to high for me, especially the sausage and pepper. It was like someone was messing with the salt shaker and the lid fell off while pouring it. I did like the shrimp it was cooked quite nicely.  The rigatoni itself was cooked in the perfect form for pasta, Al Dente. Unfortunately I was too stuffed to order dessert, but I do have to mention the iconic cheesecake! I have been here previous and I must say there original Cheesecake is spectacular! It is creamy and rich just how a good dessert needs to be, plus the crust pairs a crumbly texture that matches perfectly. Cheesecake Factory knows how to make cheesecake, just maybe not so much in the sausage and one of the pasta sauce department."
Melanie S.,"Sugar Land, TX",72,5,,1.0,12/21/2017,"Cheesecake... I love you but sitting here over double the ""wait time"" when you keep saying I'm next yet I keep seeing parties of the same size being seated. Get it together"
Karmelo N.,"Houston, TX",207,110,29,2.0,7/30/2017,"Service was horrible, they forgot orders and components of orders completely, and tried to make excuses for everything. It's enough for attitude to be given, but there's absolutely no need for attitude and backpedaling with excuses.  But let's face it, the food is always good and the cheesecake is solid. I just wish the service matched."
S A.,"Houston, TX",0,42,,1.0,6/30/2017,"Nope.  Sat at the bar.  Not one person acknowledged us.  Not a smile, not a glimmer, not a 'we'll be right with you'.  Nothing.  Were we ghosts? It wasn't particularly busy that night.  Not surprised at this location's rating. With as many restaurants around a concentrated area, I would expect them to appreciate the traffic coming in. Disappointing to say the least."
Jason H.,"Richmond, TX",32,19,8,4.0,8/1/2017,"It's what you would expect from this place it's good and cheese cake is pretty good. It was super busy and our spot we sat at ,the floor had spilled food all over the place but other than that it was good."
Michelle R.,"Richmond, TX",46,19,23,2.0,7/21/2017,"Food was good service was OK but t9ok off 3 stars mainly for them charging me full price $4.50 for a cup of orange juice... I told the manager that the ac unit leaked water into my drink so I wanted to get my check and go, he did offer to move tables but I told no its fine I just wanna go food took 40 minutes for food to be served and I have plans but wanted to warn them about their AC leaking on the table..."
Anthony M.,"Houston, TX",384,193,1048,4.0,11/4/2016,"I don't know why I haven't written a review for this spot yet. My family and friends frequent this place quite often......it's in the immediate area and is always good for a quick bite and great deserts. Happy hour is alright here as well. My wife and sis-n-law stop here more often than I do and swear by the apple martinis. At any rate, on today my son and I both had the ""Smokehouse BBQ Burgers"", and my wife had the ""White Chicken Chilli"".   We ended our lunch by sharing a "" White Macadamia Carmel Cheesecake "". Everything was !!  Of course I had my Libation Tea! .   This place is great for family, Happy Hour, and a stop with friends before hitting the town on a weekend. You can probably find one near you cuz this is a chain restaurant.....like ya didn't already know. LOL  !!!!"
Kristin M.,"Missouri City, TX",0,9,,2.0,11/1/2017,"It's a Cheesecake Factory, and it tastes like a Cheesecake Factory. Everything I've ever ordered there has been delicious, but my favorite are their burgers--some of the best I've ever eaten. So I'll probably continue to visit occasionally, despite the negatives. And there are negatives. Specifically, the service. No matter when I visit or how busy the restaurant is, the waitstaff always look and act harried and overwhelmed. You seem to have a 60/40 of getting ""complimentary"" bread and not getting any. Sometimes the waitperson claims the kitchen is working on baking a fresh batch, only it never materializes. Sometimes they act like they've never heard of the concept. Since I'm pretty sure the cost of that bread is built into the menu prices, this is ridiculous. You'll also spend most of your meal waiting: waiting for someone to show up and take your order, waiting on a drink refill, waiting for the check, waiting to get your credit card back. During my last trip, the waitress said she'd be right back to refill my water and then disappeared for ten minutes. I started sucking on my ice cubes while I waited, and when she finally returned and saw me, she acted annoyed and muttered something about how I couldn't wait. Nice. Not sure if it's a problem with being chronically understaffed, poor training, or what, but I know that I--and I'm sure many others--would be visiting more often if the service was just as high-quality as their food."
Aisha M.,"Richmond, TX",105,124,129,3.0,12/18/2016,"Great service tonight at the Cheesecake Factory. Pop ordered the catfish and they were out. The server, manager and chef all came out to apologize and asked if there was anything they could do to make up for it. They gave a soup and Pop got a cheesecake. This has always been my favorite Cheesecake Factory location and they always give us great service!!!! The food is always great, the service is always fast and the servers are always very friendly!!!! The only reason I gave them 3 stars is because we waited 10 minutes to get our check and then another 5-10 minutes for her to come pick the check up. It's sad because she did a great job throughout dinner but seemed to forget about us after."
Christine R.,"Houston, TX",23,413,1391,1.0,10/31/2016,"Today service here really sucked today. They were short staffed on Halloween. The waitress and the food took forever to bring our dishes out. Normally the food here at this place comes out a lot quicker and the service is a lot better. Really bad service this time around. Someone at the Cheesecake Factory customer reached out to me and left me a message, saying I should have talked to a manager on duty. What they don't know is I did and still the service was awful and no apologies given. Booooo"
John A.,"Seabrook, TX",45,12,3,5.0,10/14/2017,"Some people may pick on this place but we love it. The staff is great and friendly and our waitress tonight, Elsa, was super nice. The menu is large and evolving constantly. We have celebrated many hi lights of our life here."
Mays A.,"Houston, TX",13,2,33,2.0,7/30/2017,"100% a good place to family food, celebration....variety choices and tasty seasons..no doubt about they are #1 in making delicious cheesecake..always not bad to go snd try their Caesar salad, today I tried a grilled salmon it comes with mashed potato..the bad point if go there around 5:30 pm  you will be waiting at least a 30 minutes to be seated ( we were 7people)..overall the food was awesome but long waiting and kind of noisy, smaller other locations"
Jamila M.,"Richmond, TX",1,9,1,3.0,10/1/2017,"I visited the Cheesecake Factory with a large group of people. They were fair in seating us as soon as everyone arrived, which I appreciated. The manager, was attentive and kind. Unfortunately, the service was quite slow. We had good waiters, but our food came out in spurts. Also, some of the dishes were incorrect and the shrimp in some of the dishes were so small, I couldn't believe we were paying full price. I ordered the Pasta Carbonara, which comes with green peas. I could count the few peas that was included in the dish. I'm torn if I will return as I feel the food is over priced. A restaurant shouldn't accept large parties if they can't properly accommodate a large party."
Rebecca B.,"Rosenberg, TX",0,12,3,1.0,2/13/2017,"This is probably the worst restaurant in Sugar Land. Every single time I've come in it is slow and some how it takes my server (always different but they ALL do the same thing) about 20 minutes to get to my table and ask if I want something to drink... i never get bread unless I ask and it takes another good 10 minutes to get that.  And then actually ordering the actual food takes at least 30 minutes from the initial time I sit down. I have never had a friendly server at this specific location and something always goes wrong with the food AND the managers are somehow worse than the servers!  I ordered Fettuccine Alfredo last time I came in, and they gave me Chicken Alfredo- I honestly didn't want to pay for the extra chicken so I waited about 15 minutes for our server to come back around and told him that he gave me the wrong food (I wasn't even rude about it!) he grabbed my plate and left and the manager comes by looks at me and says ""you didn't want chicken?"" And then grunts when I say no and leaves...... great customer service! I got my fettuccine after my boyfriend had finished eating.  Honestly avoid this place if you can, the food is subpar and the service is revolting. There's several other options in Sugar Land that are 100x better than this place."
SL S.,"Taos, NM",0,8,10,5.0,11/28/2017,Cheesecake did our Thanksgiving 2017 Catering and not a thing was amiss considering we had so many extra requirements like minus this and plus that and extra sauces on the side. Good Job!!!
Kesia M.,"Missouri City, TX",78,8,1,1.0,7/7/2017,"First of all, when someone orders a burger, why is the waiter asking how we want our meat? Hamburger meat should never be anything but well done. The waiters and hostess are subpar and need an attitude adjustment. No one is entitled to a tip. Their food was greasy and we waited almost an hour for our food to come on a slow 2 PM lunch hour.  Worst of all, my boyfriend's hamburger was completely PINK. I'm thankful I noticed and told him to put that burger down. We don't know how much of it he ate, but we're waiting and we will get compensation if he gets food poisoning. How is a burger not completely cooked when we waited that long? Also, my fries were cold, so thank you Miss Waitress for letting us know you let it sit there."
Rimmie J.,"Houston, TX",216,90,54,5.0,4/4/2017,"So...let me start by saying, out of all the locations in Houston, this location has to be the best. Well, atleast my experience was! I wish I asked for my server's name but we got here on a Saturday night and it was packed so I asked for outside seating and got seated right away with no wait time. Server came right away and was very helpful in choosing an appetizer since I was being indecisive lol. I've had such horrible customer service experience at other Cheesecake Factory locations so this one is definitely going to be my go-to. Even though I live 40 min away, it's worth the drive. Food taste better here too. Thumbs up!"
Veronica N.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,13,4,5.0,9/17/2017,"The food was really good , the service was awesome . The drive was just a little long for me . Love the salmon and the Lemon moraine pie"
Wilson C.,"Spring, TX",26,3,56,1.0,1/25/2017,"Tonight my wife and I came in to for dinner and drinks. We got our table very quickly they were not busy at all. I don't understand why it took them 15 minutes for the server to greet us and take our drink order. We had waited for so long that we were ready to order. We place the whole order drinks and appetizers. It was unbelievable that our drinks ( I ordered a beer) came after our food. I let the manager know how things happened and he had the courage to look me in the eyes and say that the drinks take a long time because they are made from the scratch!! I ordered a beer!!  Anyway, I go to the location in The Woodlands all the time and I have never had an issue. That's why we picked to have dinner before going to the concert st Cheesecake Factory. We did not want to have bad service or food.  My experience was very poor all around."
Jennifer S.,"Houston, TX",55,33,25,1.0,7/13/2016,"I use to love this place, but the service has gone way down. If you specifically ask for your meat to be cooked one way, it will come out another way. I got so sick from digesting the raw hamburger meat I don't think I have the stomach to go there again.  My daughter order the kid pasta and the noodles was not cooked all the way, very crunchy. There are such great restaurants around the mall area, take your money elsewhere."
Yury S.,"San Francisco, CA",4,1,,1.0,6/16/2017,"Is not that the food is awful, the drinks are good too,  But watch out for the service, the wait for the food, I waited for a good 40 min for 1 shepherds pie and a small salad. Is always something when we come, my daughter wanted a chocolate cheesecake, it never came but it was in the ticket, how convenient.....   someone gave us a gift card so we came and again, NO MORE."
Wendy T.,"Stafford, TX",269,293,844,2.0,8/28/2016,"Just recently had brunch several weeks back, and I had the chicken madeira which was a little disappointing. The presentation was ok, but the taste was lacking."
