Don C.,"Jersey Village, TX",124,547,278,3.0,3/13/2012,I've only eaten food at this place twice.  The cheesecake is to die for- I always get the White Chocolate Macadamia Caramel cheesecake- it is amazing. I knew from previous food experiences order small!  I got the little greek salad- oh man- delicious- I wish they could pull off a greek dressing rather than vinagrette but to their credit they described it on the menu.  I had the wild mushroom flatbread pizza- it was pretty good- and in the end I wasn't stuffed and could have dessert.  Waiter was same as last time we were in for just dessert- nice guy.  My big hint we came at about....1130 AM on a sunday which I thought would mean a line and us leaving like usual- no line- 1/2 empty but it was pouring out- note to self on that- I usually don't eat here because of the wait- the food just isn't that good to be waiting for.
Melissa M.,"Houston, TX",175,1388,4254,3.0,7/24/2009,"Well, we went to our usual Cheesecake Factory once again tonight, but we came away with a bad after taste this time. When we arrived, it was quite dark inside, darker than usual (and we've been there numerous times). We were seated immediately in the 'rotunda' area... the round area in the front corner of the restaurant.  In order to get there we were led over a wet area on the floor.  There was a sign and napkins on the floor, and weren't given an option to walk anywhere but through the mess. We didn't realize until after we had walked through there, that the floor had glass all over the floor (some of which is now stuck in my husband's shoe). Our waitress greeted us and we mentioned that it was darker in the restaurant than usual and she completely agreed.  She said she'd talk to the manager since (in her words) it's nice to be able to see what you are eating.  She came back much later and said that the mgr said ""this is the level it is supposed to be at"".  I didn't know Cheesecake had become some intimate wine bar.  The food... we ordered two diet cokes and we brought a coke and a root beer.  This was corrected after we had already had our food a while. We ordered and my 'Chicken Littles' were good as usual. My husband ordered the 'Crusted Chicken Romano'. He enjoyed it, BUT the pasta sauce for the spaghetti was covering the chicken, which means that crispy chicken ended up kind of soggy. I would have taken photos of my food, but it was far too dark with my camera phone. Will we still go back? sure.  Was it up to its usual standards? Nope."
Rob C.,"Central Southwest, Houston, TX",0,10,5,1.0,1/10/2014,"Yesterday was the second time I visit this restaurant and on both occasions service was poor, plates, tables, and booths were very unclean.   First time in chalked it up to a bad experience but twice bitten I will not ever come back.  I have visited the Cheesecake Factory at Memorial City mall and by far my experience was more pleasant and service was much better! For a place where $50 for a couple is not beyond reach, it should be a much better experience."
Amy V.,"Seaside, CA",32,2,,2.0,4/5/2015,"We went during Easter Brunch, we were in a hurry so to avoid wait, we ate at bar service, no waiter came for at least 10mins, I ordered french toast, and it was terrible, it was basically french bread, dry, with butter on top and powdered sugar.  It was suppose to be the Brulea French toast, but I thought french toast was dipped in milk/eggs mixture.  This was basically toast.  I told waiter, who told manager, and he took it off our bill.  Basically, do not order this if you are expecting French toast."
Ted T.,"Missouri City, TX",0,4,,1.0,7/16/2015,I love the food at Cheesecake Factory. The service at Sugarland location is the worst in the bar area. It's common to spend 1.5 hours to have lunch or dinner. It seems the service is better when the restaurant is busy but not good when they are slow
Ellen C.,"Houston, TX",506,824,1186,2.0,4/21/2011,"Meh, what can I say about The Cheesecake Factory.  It's big and generic and incredibly boring.  It can be analogized to that average girl, of average intelligence and attractiveness, who decides to enroll herself in some Ivy League-sponsored weekend seminar and shells out some major bucks for a total body makeover.  At the end of the day, she is still freaking average!  (This may or may not be based on semi-autobiographical events.) Anyway, the menu - it's extensive, it's an epic novel.  James Cameron once considered adapting into a major motion film, but didn't, etc. etc. etc.  I guess if you like being coaxed into believing you actually have a myriad of dining choices and this somehow makes you feel more important or more confident about receiving an excellent meal - more power to you.  Even before I befell to the no-animal-eating lifestyle, I was always underwhelmed with the menu.  Yawn you Cheesecake Factory and your widely available generic SYSCO food stuffs.  I recently had the white bean hummus here and it was passable, definitely not anything super duper.  Our waiter was a bit apathetic, but he somehow willed himself to follow through with his song and dance.  My friends were lukewarm about their food - a pizza and sandwich.  We only reluctantly came here after our first choice seemed to be overridden with a wedding party.   From what I understand the cheesecake is actually outstanding and serves to partially redeem the drab food options.  They certainly look pretty and I can see why they're a favorite gifting option during the holidays.   Anyway, yeah, I've experienced better."
Courtney W.,"Austin, TX",480,400,641,1.0,3/28/2013,"This place is so underwhelming it's ridiculous.  The food is bland and over-priced. Sure, the portions are huge, so you could make the argument that it's worth it since you're getting two meals, but who wants to eat a second serving of something that wasn't even good in the first place? No, thank you. I suppose if you live in white, surburban America and you have the tastebuds of a five year old child, you'll probably love Cheesecake Factory. (Not that every five year old child is opposed to food with flavor. Some kids are cool. I'm talking about those five year old kids who will only eat chicken nuggets, refusing to eat anything that doesn't resemble processed junk.) In fact, the only people I know who enjoy the Cheesecake Factory are the people who make the blandest food you've ever tasted and then pat themselves on the back for a job well done. No, your food tastes bad and you should feel bad. The crowning achievement, though, was when my brother and I found broken bits of plate in our jambalaya. My brother and I decided to just share an entree since the portions are so huge, and when everyone's food was brought out, we were informed that our plate had been dropped on the way out and they were getting us fresh food. Okay, no problem, we thought. Then our food arrives and we're eating and I bite down on something hard. What in the world? I pull the offending piece out of my mouth and find it is a piece of plate. What the fuck?? My brother and I then start searching through our food and we keep coming up with bits of plate. Did they scrape our food off the floor and replate it? Why would they serve us food with broken plate bits scattered throughout? The jambalaya wasn't even good enough to salvage the whole experience, either. Jambalaya should have spice and lots of flavor; that jambalaya was the most unremarkable I've ever had. No kick, no spice, nothing.  Their menu is huge, but it's as if they make all these dishes poorly instead of focusing on making a few dishes really well.  Their cheesecake is delicious, which I would hope they can at least get that right, given that they are called The Cheesecake Factory. Overall, though, you'd be better off going to BJ's just right across highway 6. Better food for similar prices and the desserts are pretty yummy, too."
Jen R.,"Sugar Land, TX",21,19,4,3.0,6/14/2015,Wide menu selection and friendly staff. Easy going atmosphere and a good spot with kids. Take out food is a bit hit and miss. Need more veggie friendly cheesecake.
Katherine A.,"Houston, TX",305,191,576,1.0,12/11/2013,I use to love this place and the food was good. I went tonight and the service was poor. The waitress said she was tired and made is wait a long time to even take our order when the section was not even busy. We ordered food Togo and wanted it ready when we were about to leave so we told her right when we sat down. When we asked her about our Togo when we were about to leave she lied to is and said she put it in. Then came back 5 mins later and said she forgot and will take another 8 mins. The ahi tuna appetizer use to be my favorite. Today I was not only not fresh but cut wrong and chewy. The sauce was super tart not like it use to be use. The cheesecake was good of course since it came from the factory but food quality and service got worse. The manager stop by but did not seem to care much so we paid the tab and just left. My old review would have given them a 4 star now it is down to one star.
Amanda B.,"Houston, TX",50,1,,1.0,3/18/2016,"Hate I had to give any stars! I usually leave a tip EVERYWHERE I go! Unfortunately, our server was extremely rude! Got my entire order wrong and then proceeded to argue with me about what I ordered!!!! Who does that?!?!?!?! Never came to our table to just check on us, only to take the orders and give us the check! Two days later, I check my bank statement and discover that the charge on my account is $10 more than my original amount! My friend calls and informs me that her's is $10 extra as well! At this point, I am fuming! Not only did I receive the worst customer service ever, an illegal tip was added to my bill! Call the restaurant to speak to a manager, placed on hold for 20 plus minutes, get told that someone wrote a $10 tip and totaled it out! So basically, they reprinted my receipt, added a tip, and forged my signature to make it look original! I honestly want to press charges for forgery and credit card fraud!"
Sherif L.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,4,,1.0,4/4/2014,"We drove there , for 25 min, on a beautiful sunny afternoon to sit and eat outside. There were several tables taken and several empty at the patio. We asked to sit outside but we were told that the manager is not allowing seating outside ""for the rest of the night"". I asked to speak to the manager who said that ""she does not have a waiter for the outside and can't assign one""!!! She was rude and not accommodating at all. She also implied that we should ""eat somewhere else"" if we want to sit outside. The service in that place is usually ok so it is unfortunate to have under qualified manager like that run the place!"
Amy M.,"Stafford, TX",31,28,3,5.0,12/10/2013,"Great service, great food. The Godiva Brownie is exquisite. Thank you Jonathon P and Michael for giving us the great service and attention!"
Amber S.,"Sugar Land, TX",244,311,44,4.0,1/1/2013,"We decided to have our NYE dinner here last night. We checked online to see if they would take reservations and they don't anymore. We decided to just go and crossed our finger in hopes that we won't have to wait too long to be seated. As expected, it was packed. We went up to the desk and told them we'd like a booth for two. We figured if we're going to wait, might as well wait a little longer and get a comfy booth :). She said the wait would be the same (30 minutes) so we were pleased. We managed to find a seat inside. 15 minutes later, our buzzer started vibrating and we were escorted to our booth. The waiter came to us about a minute later for our drink orders. I ended up getting the Georgia Peach. I had never had it before but it sounded delicious so I thought why not. It tasted good (VERY sweet though)..but I'm pretty sure there was little to no alcohol in it.  For an appetizer we went for the made-to-order guacamole. It was absolutely delicious! I'm not a big guac person but decided to get this on a whim. The hubby loves guacamole so naturally he went with the plan. The only downside to this is that the chips to guacamole ratio is not as even as I'd like. We had over half the bowl of guacamole left over when we were done with the chips and we were def piling on the guacamole, lol. Hubby made a good point though - you'd rather run out of chips than guac, right? Anyways. For our entrees I got the spicy cashew chicken and he got the fish and chips. We both loved our meals and took about half of it back home. The servings are HUGE.  The dessert menu is plentiful so we had a hard time deciding on this one. We went with the red velvet cheesecake because we both love red velvet. Unfortunately, this was a bad choice. The cheesecake overpowered the red velvet and it felt so heavy. The cake itself was very rich and we didn't enjoy it very much. We both ate like 1/4 of it and decided we were done with it. Overall, as far as service goes, it was pretty good. Food is great as well and I'd say it's worth the price. This restaurant is more on the pricey-end so we usually just come here for special occasions. I wouldn't make this a daily thing unless you're making the big bucks ;) PS: after 4pm they have ""happy hour"" where drinks & selected appetizers are half price off. We usually come for the factory nachos which is a HUGE serving for around $5. If you're in the area at that time, check it out!"
Nikoya J.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,2,,1.0,4/14/2015,"Worst location to enjoy the menu of Cheesecake Factory. The cooks do not season food. They will sit you and keep you waiting for service for 60 minutes. The ling wait for service happened on my 1st visit. The seasonless food was in my 2nd and 3rd visit at this location. The last time I went, I bought over $100 worth of what was actually seasonless, non tasty food!! Stay away and dont go to this location. Stay clear. If you seek a real CF experience stick to the Galleria at minimum."
Dave C.,"Sugar Land, TX",6,35,,3.0,12/29/2014,"One of our orders was messed up, but the manager did comp it, which we appreciated. Atmosphere is good; manager very friendly. Our service was pretty slow, but that is normal for CF. Portions are very large. For the money we spent, probably would have been better off going to the Outback or upgrading to Perrys Steakhouse."
Jonathan W.,"Richmond, TX",17,74,6,1.0,12/22/2013,absolutely terrible!!! food was gross and cold when it was served. On the other hand cheesecake was good. I will never go back to Cheesecake Factory again for food..... brought my pizza and forgot my fries didnt get them till 10 min later
Alfred B.,"Houston, TX",11,34,10,4.0,11/9/2012,"I've never really like the food at the Cheesecake Factory (very blah), but their cheesecake is incredible. They should just make a Cheesecake Factory that serves only cheesecake and coffee/tea/water. They will even bring your cheesecake to your car. After a long day of shopping with the wife, I wanted to treat myself for carry bags and crap all day. So I stopped in midday. My only gripes with this place are that it is terrible expensive and incredibly slow! I didn't even go eat food, I just ordered 3 slices of cheesecake that I could see in the glass. But it still took about 30 minutes. I feel like their ordering system is flawed because they take too many orders upfront and then fill them. Most of the people that were in there when I was, they were only ordering single slices. So to me, it seems like it would make more sense to take the order for say 2 slices, take the 90 seconds to get the cheesecake, give it to them, and then let them go. Instead, the cashier took about 5 orders and took 30 minutes to fill each."
Aaron K.,"Fort Hood, TX",31,21,1,5.0,11/7/2014,"To start off I gave it 5 stars, but if more stars were available to give I would!  03Nov14 was my daughters BIG 12 bday & I got off work & we went to CF.  My daughter loves that place so we sought it out & drove there.  Hands down greatest waiter I've ever had (& I've been to restaurants in Paris, Rome, GE, Vegas, hi end ones & mom & Pops) the guy was really nice very attentive & proactive.  Qualities that I always look for in people.  Anyways he was great went above & beyond to take care of us, wish I could remember his name to add in here but I cant.  Food was great too!"
B P.,"Houston, TX",1,33,7,2.0,6/29/2014,Went for coffee and desert. We sat on the patio which was nice. Our two coffee and one piece of cheesecake took at least 20 minutes. My coffee was cold even after I asked the waiter to make sure I get a hot coffee. Service is sub par at best. We noticed almost every table around us had trouble with their orders either being wrong or not on time.  No reason to go back!
Victor D.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,74,1,5.0,7/12/2014,"Great atmosphere, grey food.  Wanted to compliment the service of staff!  They actually messed up our order, we did not say anything and they realize and sent something.   More importantly the manager came by and apologized.  I love great service and for the absolutely 5 star!"
