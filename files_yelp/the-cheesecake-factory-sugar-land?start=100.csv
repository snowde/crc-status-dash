Jennifer B.,"Sugar Land, TX",46,192,47,1.0,2/18/2016,"Meh, is a good way to sum this place up.  Food is hit and miss but the service here tends to be varying levels of bad to worst ever.  If you sit in the bar, thats where you will find the "" worst"" service.  Their happy hour specials are usually pretty good for drinks, and it does include the "" skinny"" versions.  5$ is not bad at all. Most times I tend to avoid this cheesecake factory, as I've had one to many bad experiences over the course of 9 months.  Its not me, its you cheescake factory.  Its the fact that when I order strawberry shortcake, either you cant make it or you have some other issue.  And my fave is a 8$ half a slice of cake. Get over yourself with that."
C B.,"Missouri City, TX",0,35,10,1.0,10/2/2016,"I always order the chicken and biscuits, but today my entree was unacceptable. The biscuits were burnt and hard; the total opposite of the golden flaky biscuits I normally get. I also did not appreciate the manager making a joke about my biscuits being burnt."
Monica M.,"Sugar Land, TX",2,38,89,1.0,7/3/2016,"Ok, it's been a month since my son and I visited This CF. And here's why we will never return. I was and still am disappointed. Craving their Louisiana Cajun Pasta, we decided to go around lunch time. I decided to sit by the Bar, in a booth, where the clear glass divider is because we never sat in that section before. So I order a drinks, and of course, they brought out the Rock bread because It was hard as a rock. Told the server and she brought out more. No difference.  Anyway My Son and I were talking and I just happen to glance at the glass and there were like 9 Baby Flies, (Yes I counted Them) on the glass. It's like They were just sitting there watching us. Lolol. Then I told my son, there are things watching us. He looks, grins, and says ""Ummmm...Momma one landed on the bread, I thought you seen it."" Ummmmm No I didn't Son. I then look at the glass again, then the wall and there's a roach crawling on the wall. That's it, I'm done. So the Server comes back and I tell her we're leaving and why. She looks and see the flies and roach, she apologize, and go and tell the Head Manager, Dress shirt and Tie Man. He comes over and looks at the glass and wall and says,""Where are they?"" I laughed and shook my head. Then the server said, ""RIGHT THERE!"", while pointing at them. Then another manager comes and apologize, offering whatever on the menu for free. No Thanks. Told them to just fix problem and the restaurant is too beautiful to have these problems. If their friends are coming out of the kitchen to greet customers, they're having parties and meetings in the kitchen. My Son and I exited CF and have yet to return. Oh and when driving, out of the parking lot,  I noticed the back door, where the dumpster is, propped open. I really didn't want to leave this review but I felt guilty thinking about how people were eating there when we were leaving And people are still eating there without knowing.. Hopefully they've fixed the problems."
Gary G.,"Sugar Land, TX",7,4,,1.0,5/6/2017,"Where to start?  Service was awful; easily the worst I've had in a while.  Kid serving us basically forgot about us, never came back and then disappeared entirely.  Finally the manager noticed our drinks were empty and helped us out.  Steak I ordered was burnt to a crisp and all I tasted was char. My wife ordered fish and the batter was over spiced.  We left most of the food uneaten and the mgr comped most of the meal.  We paid using a gift card my sister gave me and still felt ripped off.  The only one trying to do the right thing was the manager and we left without tipping which is probably the second time I've ever done this in my entire life.  We ended up giving the gift card away and told the recipient to stick with either breakfast or brunch because it's hard to screw those up.  Not planning on going back again; total waste of a rare date night."
Hersh P.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",176,11,,4.0,1/19/2016,"I ordered a meat-filled omelette, my sister ordered a salad, and my wife ordered the chicken littles. We also got the tiramisu cheesecake.  Pros: huge portions, great area, and nice decor.  Cons: the food wasn't too flavorful."
Tina D.,"Houston, TX",16,31,5,1.0,12/9/2016,"I think when you walk into a franchise that you know and adore, you disregard any possible doubt of it being a completely horrible experience. I was COMPLETELY WRONG AND DECEIVED. This is not the first time I've been to this location, but it will be my last. THERE WERE FLIES, not just at our table, but the whole section we were seated at. My boyfriend and I tried to ignore it as we wave our hands around. I got fed up with it when I couldn't enjoy my salad without a fly moving around infront of me. We asked to be moved right before the entree came and as we stood up, we saw the lady one booth away doing the same hand movements we were. FLIES and she moved already because I saw her and her companion holding their drink and food to the new table near us. Once we got to the bar area, I thought everything was going to be fine, but no. MORE FLIES. The lady next to me was shooing them away too. This place needs to be inspected. I don't think I've ever been so upset at a restaurant before. My boyfriend and I got soup and salad, and two different pastas. Food was good, but borderline cold as we had to deal with this infectious place. We did not expect any compensation, but no manager apologized properly. The service was below acceptable to me. If we had to move our food and drinks, I expect that you give us everything we had on the old table, but no. We kept having to ask for things when we notice something was missing. The new table was never cleared of four settings, so it was just an unpleasant cluster and dining experience. I've been a server and this is the difference between a great tip and a poor tip, even though my bf still gave over 15%. I did not finish my meal nor did I enjoy it due to this issue and I contemplated on calling a food inspector to report this place, but I couldn't get out of there fast enough. WILL NEVER COME BACK and if I could give ZERO STARS, I would."
N P.,"New York, NY",0,16,11,2.0,9/19/2016,"Terribly slow service. We started out with one server and ended up asking another to check on our food because our actual server was too busy gossiping with another employee. Literally a half hour wait between our bread basket and getting our entrees and all we ordered were sandwiches. They also coat all their sandwich bread with butter before toasting and you're just left with an oily soggy mess. I know this place is just a glorified diner but for the upmarked food, service should be better."
Linda P.,"Houston, TX",0,11,6,1.0,10/17/2016,"If this had 0 Stars, I would give this place 0 stars Simple Review: FOOD POISIONING. HORRIBLE SERVICE. NEVER COMING BACK EVER! Detailed Review: I ate here on Saturday night around 8:30PM for a birthday party. First of all, I knew we would had a long wait for a table so I didn't mind the wait. After about 30 min, our party decided to stay in the patio area instead of waiting for a table inside the restaurant. Our waittress took our orders and everything looked fine at that time until... A few of us got our meals except for me and a couple of other people. We had to wait another 30 min again for our meals to arrive. I had ordered a medium rare classic burger with sweet potatoes fries (not knowing it would be the BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER!!!). Everything was too SALTY but I decided to eat it anyways since I didn't want to wait to order a different meal. So we left Cheesecake around 10:30PM... Everything seemed normal until I woke up in the middle of the night at 3AM feeling nauseous & had major stomach pains. I stayed up for 1 hr trying to vomit but instead, I went #2... I went back to bed & thought it was over... The very next morning, I went to use the restroom & I knew I had food poisoning due to the color & consistency of my diarrhea! I used my restroom more than 15 times that day (no joke, sorry for being too graphic here). I called Cheesecake factory to speak with the GM knowing that they probably wasn't there or was busy. I left them a message with my number and never had a call back. It's Monday night & I am still recovering from this food poisoning. Please whatever you do, DON'T COME HERE!!! BEWARE!!!"
Allyson L.,"Lufkin, TX",0,6,,2.0,3/19/2017,"So I didn't know there was such a thing as a bad Cheesecake Factory. We've eaten at about a dozen different locations and love that they are always consistent. But then SugarLand. Oh SugarLand. Food quality was sub par--worse than marginal. The normally delicious cauliflower/carrot/green salad that accompanies skinnylicious tacos consisted of three pieces of cauliflower, all of which were covered in brown spots. None of my children had more than two bites of their entrees, which they typically devour. Even my daughter's Shirley temple wasn't mixed right. Would have been better just to burn $60. The service was good--but that's the only good part of our experience at this location. We definitely will not return to this particular Cheesecake Factory."
Jess P.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,2.0,4/11/2017,"I visited here with a family member and the experience was sub par. In Regards to food: I ordered the factory burger which I received and before even taking a bite I noticed the bread they placed it on was hard as a rock and was poorly put together! As a prior server I was understanding so I asked for softer bread. They brought back the item, but I guess changed the burger all together because the cheese was not cheddar also cold and un melted. Needless to say I just requested they take it back all together.   In regards to the service: It was a slow night, but we waited for our waiter over 5 min just to take our drink order. Also throughout the experience we had to repeatedly ask him for refills and bread. Items of which he never brought. I spoke to a manager, who was not wearing a name tag, but said his name was Mike and he was very condescending and smug. I even asked him if he was alright because he seemed peeved at the fact that he had to talk to us.  In the end it was not a good experience at the Sugarland location. I posted it on the Cheesecake website as well, hopefully this will expedite some positive changes."
Anabel M.,"Richmond, TX",16,2,1,1.0,4/10/2017,"Service was really poor. I was changing my son on the baby changing station in the handicap stall. I put him down so that i could lift the station back up on the wall, i didn't know it was broken, it came back down and cracked my son on the head, knocking him flat on the bathroom floor. I got so scared because it's really heavy (stainless steel outside) and i only managed to catch it at the end. There was a hostess in the bathroom, i asked her for ice and a manager. She came back with only ice, and asked if i wanted to see the manager. Duh! I waited for a good while in the bathroom for the manager, finally my kid stopped crying and i told her to send the manager where the were sitting (she had sat us at the booth do i figured she knew, there wasn't a lot of people). When i got back to the booth, we still hadn't gotten our drinks. It had been close to 15  minutes of me being gone. My husband said to took them over 5 Minutes for someone to even acknowledge him. He ordered our lemonades from someone then a few minutes later our actual waitress comes by asks him what kind of drinks he was going to order. After that, that waitress was pretty good at attending us. Food was pretty bad. I ordered the steak tacos. Everything was freshly made but the cook went over board with the cumin on the rice, i couldn't eat it, i even tried to fix it with salt and lime but, no. The black beans looked really good but tasted like mud. Tacos were pretty terrible. Whatever sauce they put in them, throws everything off and red onions are over bearing. My husband ordered medium rare steak and shrimp. That came with mushrooms in something called Diane sauce. The sauce tasted like the smell of stinky feet. I've never had Diane sauce and i don't know what it should taste like but, that was different. His steak was more on the rare/blue rare side. He didn't like his mashed potatoes (idk why, i didn't taste them) his shrimp were extremely breaded, hardly any shrimp in there. We ordered cheese cake, it was good but too sweet for the both of us to keep eating. We didn't complain, we're really not people that would complain. This was his first time in over 10 years eating here. I've never been here. I Don't want to come back. P. S.  Manager never came by our table, i don't even think that the hostess even told her manager. I felt really bad for my son but in the end he was fine, just really fussy. We left without even remembering about seeing a manager about the accident. We were so focused on how much our food sucked."
Merlin V.,"Houston, TX",1,5,,1.0,3/12/2017,"Ah I love pasta, I used to love this location, but hey every damn time I visit with my friends it's ALWAYS something wrong. Well this weekends was the last chance I gave Cheesecake! Let me start with the service..... Geezz you HAVE to be looking out for your server because apparently they wouldn't come and check on you... the young lady we got. God, waited 10+ to be greeted. (Whatever) but hey we had to keep calling to tell her we wanna order appetizer, ok. She went lost another 40min ... then we stopped her again to tell her we were ready for our entrée. Never did she asked ""how's everything"" we finally asked for our checks , then realized that we got charge for something completely different from what we had ordered. (She never brought our plates) and I asked why is she charging more... her only response was ""oh I'm sorry, I must gotten wrong.. misunderstood what you said"" service is to the floor, then we get charged more?! Dang .. it's crazy. Then on the tab tells you how much you have to tip?! She didn't do crap but charge us more. Great. 85$+ in trash."
Eccentric E.,"Houston, TX",0,50,,1.0,8/1/2016,"Not a good location for a to-go order. Thank goodness that I did not dine in.  The service at the to go counter was not the greatest for my visit. I wanted to know the flavor of a particular cheesecake and the server seemed to get a bit upset that I asked. She did not know but asked someone else who told her and then she walked away to allow someone else to serve me (She was originally ringing up my order). I have not had cheesecake from the cheesecake factory in years so I was bit surprised when I realized that the quality has changed. I also ordered the Cajun Jumbalaya Pasta and this was a total waste of money. The noodles were hard, there was no pasta sauce and the shrimp and chicken were not good. Will not return nor will I recommend."
JQ S.,"Carrollton, TX",0,7,,1.0,8/20/2016,"So we have a party of 15. Came in at 830 and where told that we would be seated within the hour. Manager Richard Mills refuses to seat us. Outside and inside??? Decided he wanted us to wait. When a party gets up that and a table is available to accommodate, Richard Mills tells  us there is a party ahead of us. Only problem is, you entire reception staff says there is no party ahead of us. Really? Okay Dick!!! Yo PF  Changs we go. #IWillBeEmailingCorporateOnMonday"
Betsy R.,"Houston, TX",0,84,9,2.0,5/6/2016,"A group of former co-workers met at Cheesecake Factory in Sugar Land yesterday.  The host (white male, blonde-reddish hair and beard) attempted to seat us at a table near the bathroom.  I politely requested another location which he found.  He walked us to the table tossed the menus down and walked away.  My friend and I looked at each other and simultaneously commented ""rude.""   What a horrible attitude for a hospitality employee. We were waited on by 2 servers and were not clear who was actually responsible for our table. Despite 3 requests for more bread, it never materialized. A to go order was never placed with the kitchen nor was it charged on the bill which had to be updated.  The food was tasty.  I got the steak medallions.  They were cooked nicely and were hot upon arrival.   This was an early afternoon (5pm) dinner event and they didn't have it together.   The Galleria location does a much better job. So consider that as this location is cheeseFLAKE factory."
Taylor M.,"Missouri City, TX",0,16,,4.0,2/21/2017,"Rarely disappointed. We are regulars so it's sad to see there be poor reviews on here. We love the food and cannot recall a bad experience other than the occasional minor mistake that is quickly/easily fixed. The wait can be long sometimes, but that's understandable considering the turnout on a regular basis. They seem to stay busy."
Natalie H.,"Alvin, TX",0,6,1,1.0,1/21/2017,"No. Just no! Service was TERRIBLE!!!! Tried this location two times. Bad both times, not coming again."
Julianne Z.,"Minneapolis, MN",280,301,401,3.0,7/5/2013,"So I went to Cheesecake Factory for the first time in three years since I have been in Sugar Land. After 3 days of avocados, chicken and spinach in different ways, I decided to get some comfort food.  I got the Meatloaf sandwich which was covered in swiss cheese, caramelized onions, portabella mushrooms, and arugula. The entire sandwich was in between two thick slices of brioche with an aioli spread and served with this amazing tomato-bacon jam. As you can tell from the picture, the sandwich is huge! I didn't eat any breakfast and I still only ate half of it. The meatloaf was really flavorful and I liked the twist on ketchup (the tomato-bacon jam). Having not been to the Cheesecake Factory in years, I only went to have an average lunch, but I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, I also got a slice of red velvet cheesecake, and that ended the meal quite well :)"
Karson I.,"Newport Beach, CA",27,4,2,1.0,7/5/2016,Do not waste your time going to this location. You'll end up walking out. Worst customer service I've experienced with Cheesecake Factory.
Tezzie G.,"Pearland, TX",5,44,35,4.0,3/9/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my lunch favs! Service for this location is always on point no matter what time i pop in. I had a skinnylicious turkey burger and spicy chicken soup. Both were delicious and very filling.  My lunch date enjoyed a veggie omlete and said it was  yummy!  This will continue to be a favorite lunch spot for me for many reasons.  See you guys next week! Eat it, enjoy it and Yelp about it"
