Phung N.,"Houston, TX",53,217,242,2.0,6/16/2014,"lets just say this location cannot handle high volume of customers. Usually, when a meal goes wrong, we are given something free like a drink or even a meal. My family and I dined here a few weeks ago and lets say they made a mistake so the manager came to us and offered us soup. We said sure, but after 30 minutes we're like wait, where's the soup?  We got our food and it was great. I just did not appreciate being told by such a irresponsible manager that they would give us something and did not. A recent visit made me very upset. There were many people ordering food to-go. My order was just a frozen cake that you just get out of the fridge, nothing complicated. Was told the wait will be 8 minutes, well it turned into 15 so we talked to the manager. Manager says, he will get it right away. Now I've waited a total of 25 minutes and I see the same manager having a side chit chat with some customers. Been coming here for years and the service does not get any better but just get worse. They obviously do not care about how customers are being treated. Will not be coming back for a while..."
Hanna I.,"Newport Beach, CA",1,4,2,1.0,7/5/2016,"Where do I begin? We were seated right away but after 10 mins no waiter had come to see us, mind you we were seated in a booth right by the bar where waiters come and go to refill drinks and waters. Then finally our waiter came to get our orders and we ask for waters but 5 mins later still no water. So we left and I told the lady at the front how horrible their service are that we've been sitting for 15 mins and the water couldn't even get us a water."
Laura B.,"Pasadena, TX",0,3,,1.0,7/4/2016,Worst experience ever! 2nd couple to go in when they opened today. Got seated in a dirty booth with dirty silverware( had dish washing soap or something with and green all over it) Waited 10 min. No sign of a waiter. Manager was walking around with a sour look. Gave them a few more minutes and we left.
Kurllenne M.,"Fresno, TX",67,58,16,3.0,6/5/2016,"The food was great but the service was horrible. It wasn't everyone but our main waiter, Jay, was not great at all. We waited ten minutes for a menu. Jay asked us if we were rest to order and he still had not brought out menu. Took forever to get a to go box. The food was fantastic. Jay has to do better."
Chanel A.,"Houston, TX",151,77,34,5.0,7/11/2015,"**THIS REVIEW IS ONLY ON THE CHEESECAKE** I ordered the red velvet cheese cake to go. Lord, talk about a diet buster. I had long ago given up on this cheese cake after a few bad experiences with the one in the galleria due to the dryness of the red velvet. For the last year my go to had been the key lime cheesecake which is divine if your into that little sour kick.  Anyway, I ordered the red velvet cheesecake because it had been a while and just like an ex sometimes you have to call to see if things have changed. And man they definitely had!!! This was some of the best cheesecake ever. And as I have to always mention I am extremely picky so that says a lot.  It takes talent to pull off red velvet cake but to be able to do it with cheese cake and the red velvet still retain its moisture is like trying to dissect an ant. Very difficult. I nursed this cheese cake for 2 days because I wanted to eat it slow and savor every bite it was so good and so rich in flavor.  Great cheat dessert for dieter lol!! Worth every calorie."
Peter C.,"Missouri City, TX",0,19,2,1.0,5/30/2016,"Came in at open , not a lot of people there we still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated for a table of ten in an empty restaurant . It took us awhile to get our food and when it came out it was wrong . No problem if food takes awhile to come out but at least it could be right . We had to ask for refills and they didn't even bother to ask my mother if she wanted something other than coffee to drink with her lunch . Than to top it off they changed the size of the cheesecake they give you . It used to be a fair size for the price now they give you a sliver of cake for 8+ dollars . Place has went completely down hill use to enjoy coming here , now we won't be back ."
David K.,"Houston, TX",0,41,3,1.0,5/7/2016,This place is always dirty and anything that one touches is oily and disgusting. Customer service is hit or miss but mostly miss. Such poor management. Not recommended at all.
Heather B.,"Sugar Land, TX",2,69,1,5.0,9/6/2015,"It was my first time at this location and it was amazing! The menu is extensive...took me forever to decide what I wanted. I went on a Saturday for lunch and it was quite busy, but I only ended up waiting about 10 minutes. I will be back!!  Service (5 Stars): Wait staff was amazing. Drinks stayed full. Chicken Salad Sandwich (4 Stars): the chicken salad itself was amazing, but the bread could've  been a little thicker....the chicken salad was falling through the bread. Very delicious though.  Salad (5 Stars): I ordered this instead of fries. I chose the balsamic vinegarette and it was to die for -- it was a creamy version vs an oil-based version. The salad itself had different types of lettuce on it and nothing else (other than dressing) and it was still amazing.  Cheesecake with Strawberries (5 Stars): It's the cheesecake factory...so of course this was THE BEST!!  The only issues I had were decided what meal to order and what kind of cheesecake to order!!"
Cal D.,"Kapolei, HI",31,2,,2.0,8/1/2016,"Cleanliness and service need a lot of improvement. This place has declined so much, I think we will stop dining here and head to the Galleria location instead. Tables and seats are crummy, floors are greasy, bathrooms are rarely freshened. Servers are slow and have amnesia, can't remember a drink order or request for refill or additional service items such as napkins or missing flatware 5 mins after I ask. These servers must have never learned any manners from their parents as they don't even have the basics down, such as a standard greeting/salutation or even a 'thank you'. Corporate needs to overhaul this mess or shut it down. 2 stars 'cause I still like the menu/food and its central location with easy valet."
Richard C.,"Houston, TX",76,15,3,1.0,2/21/2016,"I'm writing a review because of my experience of the customer service with the Togo crew and manager of the Cheesecake Factory.  The food is very delicious and so are their deserts and drinks.  However, I recently placed a to-go order for Mexican Cobb salad and wheat bread.  The order came out as Cobb salad with the white bread.  In reality it was the Mexican tortilla salad, so partially that was my fault.  However the staff should have made a clarification when I ordered since they should know their menu very well.   When I called back to inform them about the order, Melody the manager was quick to take ownership of the mistake, which is a huge plus, and offered to get it right for no charge.  So why not 5 stars you ask?  Well I was informed to call and let them know I was on my way, and I said between 8 and 9, but I'll call as requested.  Keep in mind, I'm very, very pleased at this point.  I did call before heading that way, and was told by the receptionist on the phone that I need to speak to the cashier to verify the order was ready, so I waited, and waited.  13 minutes later I'm at Cheesecake Factory still on hold.  I walk in and no one was busy and there were 3 hostess just standing there with me waiting by myself.  I asked for Melody the manager to see about getting this handled.  While waiting, another call came in and someone accidentally picked up my line instead of the other call and hung up after I said I'm already here right behind them, which startled the waiter.  The hostess apologized and looked confused.  The manager came and I explained the situation and she didn't apologize or really acknowledge the poor customer service and that I waited on the phone for over 15 minutes.  It was just followed by her saying lovely in disappointment.  She offered to comp my salad with the correct bread order.  She then chimed in, ""be sure to order the right thing next time, it's Mexican tortilla salad, not Cobb salad"".  It's frustrating because she could have recovered from this whole hiccup.  Instead, I got poor service at best.  Now I'm waiting 25 minutes for my meal again.  Instead of 5 stars, they worked themselves down to one.  Its not wise insulting a paying customer that spends quite a bit of money here with friends and family annually.  I hope the district manager reads this and gets it right.  Until then, they won't get our business any mor at this location.   On a bright note, the cashier was very polite and respectful.  He had dreads, I wish That I caught his name to actually thank him for good service."
Darrell K.,"Katy, TX",85,74,124,4.0,7/12/2014,"If this place sucked, it wouldn't be so busy all the time so one must conclude it has to be good, right??? Food is always good and consistent. All Cheese Cake Factories are always busy because they like the food and of course the cheese cake! We always order the avocado egg rolls! They are the best!!! Creamy, crunchy, flavorful, sweet and delicious with the dipping sauce. If you like avocados and egg rolls you MUST order these!!! Tonight I tried the beef kabob appetizer. The meat was moist and good with the pita bread and Tzatziki sauce. Reminding me of a kafta kabob. I would order this again if in the mood.  Wife had the miso salmon.  Another hit! It was moist and had a clean fresh taste and NOT fishy at all! Not sure if it is always this good but if so I would order it again.  Okay enough about the food. Service is always okay to poor! I can promise you I don't come here for the service... Because of the lack of great service and the constant crowds during peak hours, we only come here on special occasions or when we just have to have the egg rolls! Other notable items here are the ahi dishes and the mojitos are pretty darn good. I try not to get started on those cause at $10 a pop, the mojitos can add up real quick.  I can go on and on about so many other items but don't want to bore you. If you haven't already eaten here, then Where have you been???"
Serena L.,"Houston, TX",75,14,43,1.0,5/13/2015,"Called to ask about reservations for my baby shower, and they told me not a problem. Even went over brunch menu for Sunday afternoon. Told me would be able to accommodate my party of 15 easily. I informed them I would call with a final count and that was the conversation. Well after ordering custom invitations and sending them out within a week, I called with my final head count and they proceed to tell me that they do not take reservations on the weekends.  Why would I order custom invitations if they wouldn't take reservations???? After speaking to a manager that insist that nobody would ever tell me that, he basically said nothing he can do.  Thanks a lot, guess I just made the whole conversation up. Won't be going there anymore."
Jason Y.,"Sugar Land, TX",46,137,29,3.0,7/21/2015,"The food is decent, the service is good. Not a whole lot to say, Cheesecake Factory is pretty much identical everywhere you go. I always feel like there about 90 pages to the menu that they give you here.  I feel like they are just all over the place and I often have a hard time choosing something to eat.  Maybe it's me."
Ayn N.,"Houston, TX",249,40,12,4.0,8/2/2015,"This is a popular place, and honestly the service is mediocre. Still, I do think this place is worthy of 4 stars, and here is why.  One, the menu is extensive. You would expect a place like The Cheesecake Factory to be out of the question for someone on a restricted eating plan, but it really is quite the opposite. They have an entire menu just for calorie-conscious folks. Also, it is the only place in town that makes a mean low carb cheesecake, do that is where I asked my friends to take me for my birthday. Also, it really is a large, pretty restaurant that has booths big enough for six people.  The problem is that it serves so many things to so many people. I have to remind my server of things repeatedly that other servers would provide without question (e.g. coffee refills, bringing the water I asked for when I ordered my meal). I don't blame the waiter; I blame the way the restaurant is set up. It has such an array of options and so many people to serve, I can imagine it would be difficult for any waiter to be detail-oriented. Also, it is so loud that it is hard for me to hear the person at my table directly across from me. All in all, you can't have everything, but The Cheesecake Factory does try hard to provide close to everything."
Lisa G.,"Richmond, TX",60,31,,1.0,5/30/2017,"I don't usually post negative reviews however this was the worst experience we have ever had at Cheesecake Factory. Considering we were seated immediately, I thought we were off to a good start. A waitress came by and asked about drinks, a few minutes later a gentleman came by and said he would be our waiter. We ordered an appetizer, I was also going to eat a couple of appetizers for my meal, I wanted the artichoke, he said he would check if they had it, came back and said yes. 10 minutes later another waitress says they don't have it, okay, I order a salad. My salad comes out and my husbands food doesn't. We wait and wait and finally are told his meal went to someone else but they would be making his now...we wait and wait and wait. He finally gets his food, we eat and wait for our waiter to come back so we can get boxes. We can see our waiter just standing there, we try to flag him down. Again considering we were seated right away, we should not have spent TWO HOURS for lunch in there. We didn't even eat dessert there because we were afraid that would take another hour. No apologies, nothing. Worst time ever."
Vy D.,"Houston, TX",7,40,88,3.0,7/8/2015,"Although most people love this place, but for me it's not that great of a place. The food are too expensive and it doesn't taste that good. I rather go somewhere else for a cheaper price that still taste better. I would only come back for the cheese cake. The only good thing for me."
Anna L.,"Houston, TX",0,65,5,2.0,5/18/2016,"Came here on a Sunday night and it wasn't even busy. Our waitress never asked us if we needed refills or came by to fill it (unless we asked). Our food took FOREVER to come out. Like I've never seen my food at Cheesecake Factory take that long to come out. By the time I got my food, my sandwich was soggy. They had all these workers and no one came by to check on us or give refills. It was unprofessional that some of the servers would be walking around swearing and stuff."
Judy S.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,4,1,4.0,11/21/2015,"Great Service! Our waitress Flo was polite, knowledgable, and attentive.  Great choices, prices are reasonable. Yummy!"
Ana Cristina F.,"Houston, TX",6,8,,3.0,5/13/2016,"Yes I know it's Friday, but Service was slow, sat in bar area, food was good, beers need to be COLD !!will come again but only for a special occasion.."
Sue P.,"Sugar Land, TX",196,207,254,1.0,12/12/2013,"ATTN:  ONE DUCHESSHOOD UP FOR GRABS We like to sit at the bar tables, especially when a football game is on for hubby to watch. The area was full of dirty tables.  Even the bar itself was covered in dirty dishes and napkins the bartender was finally clearing.  Fifteen minutes later, a bus boy finally cleaned our table & left the tray of dirty dishes in one of our empty chairs, then proceeded to go to the bar and watch the game for a few minutes, before coming back to collect it.  He cleared a few other dirty tables between game breaks, but left others dirty.  Clearly, he wasn't too concerned about his job. Our waiter arrived even later, with bread, but no water, set ups, or bread plates.  I asked for all three.  A good 10 minutes later, maybe more, he showed up again with the items, but by then, we had gotten our own water at the bar.  He took our order, and hubby wasn't sure which salad dressing it was he liked, so the waiter nicely offered to get a sample of the two Asian ones for him to try.  Another ten minutes later, he arrives with the two full boats of dressing and walks off again.  When he comes back another 10 min. later, we find out he hadn't placed our order yet because of the salad dressing question. As we find this out, two tables seated at the same time as we were are already getting their food! Grinding his teeth, hubby snaps for him to turn the order in!  As we sit and try to pretend we are having a good time, another 30 minutes or more passes.  The other two tables get their checks and doggy bags, while I still don't even have my starter salad.  Grrrrrrrrrlllll, goes my stomach and my throat. Meanwhile, we sit amongst even more dirty tables and a manager who comes into the bar area every 5 minutes, not to check on his customers, or even notice we are sitting there still sans food, but to, you guess it, watch the game.  And there's the real problem here.  The help thinks the TV in the bar is there for their entertainment, at the customer's expense.  And why shouldn't they when the manager himself sets such a stellar example?  Attention all restaurant personnel who work in a place with a TV...owners didn't put it there for YOUR entertainment! Every time we see you stop your duties and watch while we sit with empty water glasses, it costs you money and your boss business.  It gets you bad Yelp reviews.  But I digress... I bring our issue to the manager's attention.  He quickly hustles to the kitchen with the waiter in tow.  Several minutes go by, and I stand up to look into the kitchen and see him talking to the line cooks.  Clearly, the food isn't ready.  Who knows why?  Who cares?  Clearly not the staff.  So, this Cheesecake Factory Duchess walked. One hour there and no food folks! This restaurant has good food, but their watered down booze is just too weak to tolerate their awful service.  Like many Sugar Land chains, such as Pappadeaux, I suspect the high turnover is due to the fact they use the burbs as a training ground.  If the waiter or manager is any good they get promoted out of the burbs.   This Duchess is tired of this tedious kingdom, and gladly abdicates her title to the next unfortunate Yelper who wants it. Just don't say I didn't warn you."
