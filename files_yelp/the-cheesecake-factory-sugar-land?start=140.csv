Tiffany W.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",603,2,,1.0,8/15/2016,"I don't normally write reviews, but had such a bad experience here that I just had to. Never NEVER come to this Cheesecake Factory with a big party. Made a 12 person reservation for 7:30 on a Monday night for my family with the restaurant knowing they had a big party at 6:30 prior to us. Throughout our HOUR wait (again, with reservations), we were told that it would take 20 more minutes, then 30, then that they couldn't do anything. Then around the hour wait mark, we were informed that reservations can not be made here. Last weekend I was specifically told that no reservations could be made on weekends, BUT could be made on weekdays. The general manager kept insisting that no reservations can be made in general. If you look on this Yelp page though, it specially states that you can make reservations. Then we were informed by the hostess that they would seat us at another section, but we never were. I understand that you can't force a large party to leave, but don't tell us that no reservations could be made in the first place after we had already waited an hour. Excuse after excuse. Completely unacceptable. On another note, they also completely forgot about one of our orders. Wish I could rate them no stars."
Blanca T.,"Houston, TX",1,5,5,1.0,10/14/2016,"We used to love this place. We used to come to this location twice a week. We celebrated birthdays and anniversaries. My kids loved it here. But this past year has been just disappointing. When manager Mike was here the service was awesome. We have literally waited almost 30 minutes for someone to come and get our drinks order. We had an incident here once with my daughters food. It had a piece of metal in one of her chicken tender. Luckily I saw it before she had a chance to eat it. We told manager Mike and he apologized and took care of the bill. We kept coming to this location after all because we knew he took care of it and he appreciated us coming back. We have left several times because the service is just horrible. They take long to bring the drinks and the food, specially the bread. They always have excuses for it. It's in the oven, it's coming ,  and when it does comes its all hard and cold. Two weeks ago I went with my daughters and it took them 30 min to come and get my drinks. I was still waiting to order so we got up and left. Then we went back a week later with my husband and 30 min later and there was no bread. We were getting anxious and the kids were hungry. An hour past and we only had our drinks no bread no food. So we called some worker passing by and asked her that what was going on and she said that there was a fight and that our server was involved that she was gonna call the manager to come and talk to us. We kept waiting 15 more minutes and just decided to leave. Yes there was a fight we saw the cops outside and the people involved in the fight were been interrogated by the police. I saw our server hiding in the kitchen all this time. He didn't sent someone to check on us. I know the manager could of been busy and all but the fight was at the bar and they took it outside it wasn't in the kitchen where the food is made. This is our last time coming here. It's really disappointing. I just hope they do something about it because this used to be a nice place."
Yunan Y.,"Houston, TX",34,24,79,1.0,3/23/2016,"Very bad service for to go. There are two names in front of the cakes, you don't know which one for the front or back. She said you can read the name for me. Then I read the name to her, she said, ok, that's for the front. So the left name for the front, right name for the back. Then I ordered the second one, read the second name to her, she said no, that's for the back one. Then I asked her, can I just show you where are they, I need to order 6. She said no, I need you read the name to me. After read all of the names to her, she said Can you repeat again? She never smile all the time, just ask you the question."
Lizzie H.,"Friendswood, TX",53,58,1231,1.0,6/7/2015,"Really not coming here again except to get cheesecake to go. This place has seriously fallen in all aspects. I have always loved coming here but it's just too disappointing. The wait staff was completely inattentive. We had to wait over five minutes as our food got cold to ask for something. I watched tons of waitresses and a manager walk by and no one would even acknowledge us. Talk about in need of training. Pay attention to your clients!!!  Drinks were extremely overpriced especially when I was wondering if there was actually any alcohol in them. For appetizer we had zucchini avocado mushroom fries. They came in a much smaller bowl with less than normal. Also the sauce container is now the size of my thumb. This gives me about enough sauce for one piece of zucchini. I hope they are saving tons of money as they are definitely losing customers. Also the delicious soft sourdough bread was replaced with basically a rock. Can you call this bread? It definitely cut up my boyfriend's mouth. Is this another money saving technique? Terrible bread so we don't ask for seconds. To my boyfriend's disappointment his sandwich also came on this ""bread"". Ridiculous. I ordered chicken and biscuits which online has a picture with white country gravy. Nope. More like deconstructed chicken pot pie. Mediocre at best.  So disappointing. I really wanted to just return everything."
Chris H.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,109,10,1.0,1/15/2016,"Went here tonight for dinner and truly wish we would have went somewhere else. The food wasn't very good and our server Maurice was HORRIBLE. We were a party of four, our appetizer took so long to arrive that one entree was served two minutes after the appetizer. The rest of the table waited about 10 more minutes to receive food. Never once did Maurice check on us or see why our food was taking so long. We ordered cheesecake to go - they gave us the smallest sliver of cheesecake I have ever seen, but certainly charged the full $7.95 for it. Based on tonight's experience I highly doubt I will ever give this establishment my money again"
Jason S.,"Houston, TX",39,76,,5.0,4/24/2015,"(From the Delivery Guy Chronicles, vol. MCMXC...) Even though I showed up with a giant piece of kitchen machinery, Lyle was just as cool as could be, in spite of the fact that it was lunch hour, the company execs were in town and the kitchen was slammed. As a delivery guy, I've learned that if the back of the house has their act together, the front of the house will follow along. I'll definitely be back, but as a paying guest!"
Kim A.,"Rosenberg, TX",0,119,39,1.0,3/22/2015,Never never again.....3 people ate with only water to drink and the bill was $58. The service was horrible we almost walked out because he took so long to reach our table. He spoke so fast and softly we could not understand him. He failed to bring silverware and never asked if our food was OK or right. No refills on our water and I had to flag him down for the bill. Then he waited for my husband to pull out his wallet before leaving the table. I then orders 2 slices of cheesecake to go. $16 for 2 tiny slivers of crap. The plain cheesecake was very wet and tasted like the instant box crap from the grocery....and that you get more and its cheaper! Stupid move on our part to throw away that kind of money on shit! Next time I will cook my own meal when I think about going to the cheesecake factory.
Karry B.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,17,,1.0,5/22/2016,"This was one of my favorite restaurants in Sugarland until today. The server Jonathan S was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!  It took 13 minutes to get WATER, then the  appetizers came to our table with our main course. No one came to refill our drinks and I had to go to the bar for a refill on my strawberry lemonade. When we finished our meal, Jonathan could not be found (never around) so I stopped Steven King who was more than happy to assist us. After waiting an additional 10 minutes, Jonathan finally appears asking if we wanted dessert. I gave him our ticket and credit card to be checked out. My experience was not desirable at all. The food industry is based on customer service which we did not receive today. Please provide refresher courses for servers that have placed customer service in the back of their minds. I would appreciate your cooperate office to contact me."
Joe R.,"Sugar Land, TX",10,3,,1.0,3/20/2016,Only because there's not a mark for zero stars. The worst service we've ever experienced in a restaurant...half the staff walking around with frowns on their faces. Our food was not brought out together there was five in our party we each got our food different times the last person was served 20 minutes later. Our drinks took 20 minutes to get to us. Our undercooked hamburgers were rare. A huge menu they can't even execute this concept needs a face and menu lift!
Tiffany C.,"Houston, TX",301,286,601,4.0,12/22/2013,"This is one restaurant that always gets overlooked in my mind for some reason. I leave almost every time thinking ""why don't I come here more often?"" The novel-worthy menu has enough options to satisfy even the pickiest eater at the table. I've tried a good handful of the items already and the Lemon-Herb Roasted Chicken, Da Vinci Pasta, Factory Burger and Santa Fe Salad are my typical go-to orders. I'm actually not too big a fan of their cheesecakes since they are overly rich, but I would never oppose to sharing one to sneak a couple bites (especially if it is the Red Velvet)."
Libby R.,"Katy, TX",28,11,5,1.0,3/14/2016,"Terrible service. Floor was dirty. Had to ask for floor to be swept and mopped under our table. The omelet is okay, but pricey. Asked for bread .. never got it. Will not go back to this location. The waiter had an attitude, had to ask host for Tabasco and butter.  Terrible."
Sydney H.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",103,4,6,1.0,2/3/2015,"Will not ever eat here again.  Took 1 hour 45 minutes from time we were seated to the time we left.... at 7:30 on a Tuesday night-- for a party of four. It wasnt busy at all.  Our server got our order wrong, the kitchen made my husbands dinner wrong, the manager never came over when we complained about the errors.   To top it all off... the use MSG in their food.   There are a lot of choice of places to eat in Sugar Land-- all within a stone's throw of the Cheesecake Factory."
Rene F.,"Houston, TX",37,19,9,2.0,3/20/2016,"Had such a nice waiter, but overall the good was nasty. My sweet potato fries had the taste of old burnt oil and my chicken / avocado club sandwich was dry and no flavor. The waiter got me regular fries but sadly they tasted the same as the sweet potato ones. So disappointed in the food.  Only thing I enjoyed was the cheesecakes and hibiscus lemonade."
Chyna G.,"Katy, TX",31,77,109,4.0,1/12/2014,"I've always been a cheesecake factory fan.... so, no surprise that I enjoyed this one as well. Hubby and I came here for brunch..and I must say I enjoyed my plate. Eggs Benedict with a side of hash brown potatoes. Hubby had Belize French toast (so light and airy)  A side of bacon and scrambled eggs. The food was really good. I started out with a Bloody Mary (I'd never had one ). It was what I expected...lol .and therefore I gave it to my hubby and I ordered a raspberry martini (Delish ). I'll be returning for brunch at the cheesecake factory !"
Lasairiona M.,"Missouri City, TX",110,707,393,3.0,2/25/2014,"The service we had here today was excellent!!! She was attentive but not intrusive, remembered our ""adjustments"" and gave us refills as we needed them. Food wise i'm still not sold.  We started with the pot stickers and they were nice, but not blow my mind nice, same for the chicken samosas we ordered.  They were tasty, but not omg nice. The tater tots were disappointing.  They don't mean loaded tater tots, they mean STUFFED tater tots.  So instead of tots smothered/loaded with cheese and bacon etc like a loaded baked potato, they are STUFFED, so have that stuff on the inside, and it has a weird texture  disappointing! One of the girls ordered the fried zucchini and it was DELISH.  The key lime cheesecake DID blow my mind!  So it's going up in my estimation, still not worth $30 for lunch mind you!!"
Jay L.,"Houston, TX",2,11,,1.0,1/11/2016,"Went here because we had gift cards to burn. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait but it was really a 30 minute wait for a table, followed by another 10 minute wait for the waiter to arrive. They ran out of the wheat bread. It took 50 minutes to get our food after ordering. I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken. The sauce was good, but the outer layer of chicken had the texture and consistency of beef jerky as if it had been set out for a while and the moisture was sapped out of it. When I told the waiter about it, he said that it was supposed to be that way and offered to bring out more sauce to offset the dryness. I'm pretty sure the dish isn't supposed to be this way. We had free cheesecakes that came along with buying the gift cards, so we decided to get some on the way out. After receiving our cakes, I noticed a lady wearing a microphone poking at the cakes in the storage fridge with her bare finger to test their firmness. Gross."
Kristin M.,"Austin, TX",22,53,8,4.0,10/2/2013,"I know a lot of people have issues with The Cheesecake Factory because of its extensive menu. I agree...the menu is a bit too long, but the food is tasty. Service is always great, drinks are good (I've had sangria and a cosmo -- both hit the spot), dessert is ohmygoddelicious and the main items are good too. I usually order the tomato, basil and cheese flatbread. The crust is crispy and the toppings intermingle in a pleasant way. There is just enough cheese (not too much, not too little -- it's like a goldilocks portion of cheese), the tomatoes have a nice warmth and sweetness to them that helps cut through the saltiness of the cheese and the basil adds a great herbal quality. Get it the next time you go. The last time I went to TCF, I was with my parents. My mother ordered the chicken enchiladas, which she loved and my father ordered the Cuban sandwich. He left nothing on the plate, so it's safe to say he enjoyed it. I didn't get to taste either this time, but perhaps on another visit..."
Mariah D.,"Houston, TX",409,483,261,4.0,9/13/2013,"My mindset surrounding The Cheesecake Factory is that it's an excellent dessert bar. They serve entrees and food, but for the most part I'll ignore that, and you should too. We went for early dinner on National Cheesecake Day because we wanted half price cheesecake. Saving ourself for cheesecake, we decided to order a few small plates or appetizers off the happy hour menu to share, and our wonderful waiter honored happy hour prices even though we were in the dining area.  The appetizers we ordered were not memorable. The entire menu is just too busy.  When it came to the main event (cheesecake), I couldn't decide between 2 different flavors, and though it was supposed to only be one slice at 50% off per person, our waiter once again fudged the rules a little and let me get 2 slices at half price! I love this waiter. He looked like he was about 19 years old and kept giving this 25 year old little smiles that made me blush. He knew how to get a good tip outta me, thats for sure.  My husband enjoyed the pineapple upside down cheesecake, though I thought it was really gross and way too sweet. I tried the new s'mores cheesecake and it was amazing when it was fresh, but not as good the next day. The mango lime cheesecake was THE BEST. Mango gelee topping, mango and key lime cheesecake on a coconut macaroon crust. This is my go-to cheesecake for the rest of my life.  4 stars because our waiter was superb and because I really don't know of anywhere else in town to get better cheesecake. Certainly nowhere else has such a wide selection.  Oh, and I'll drive to Sugar Land to avoid the Galleria madness. Yep. Sure will."
Magda B.,"Rosenberg, TX",0,5,3,2.0,4/12/2016,"Their service is horrible, I was going to place an order togo. This lady working there was at the togo area on her phone, I called her attention and she said, ""I'm not a cashier"" and continue on her phone. I waited 10 minutes. Decided to leave, not worth my time if they're rude."
Cathy W.,"Stafford, TX",3,7,18,1.0,6/14/2016,"I have been a patron of The Cheesecake Factory for a long time so it is very disappointing that I am giving a very bad review for a bad customer service experience. I had brunch at the Sugarland location last Sunday 6/12/16 and the customer service was so awful! If zero star was an option, I will actually give that score! Anyways, here's my review. As usual, my best friend and I ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles Benedict. Like I always do, I specifically told our server (Gabrielle) that I wanted fried eggs instead of the Eggs Benedict that it comes with because I am not a fan of the hollandaise sauce. Waited for a while and when our food order came, the fried egg was still topped with the sauce. I brought it to the attention of our server and to my surprise, she got very defensive and argued that ""you only substituted the fried egg for the poached egg"" and the chef will still top it with hollandaise sauce!"" I explained to our server that this was not the first time I have ordered this chicken & waffles this way and my order has always come out right! I explained that I ordered fried eggs versus the eggs Benedict (not just poached eggs) because I don't want the poached egg & the sauce at all! Then the rudest manager came to our table with such an attitude trying to explain and rectify what had happened. He then proceeded to tell me again that even if I asked for fried eggs, the kitchen will still top it it with the sauce.  At this time, I was already pissed off because he is making a liar out of me! I told him that I have ordered this before in this location and the order always came out right! Then he tried to apologize and asked me at this point if I want him to fix the order? I declined and told him that all I wanted to do was to make management aware. I also refused the offer to fix my order because I did not want to wait any longer than we have at this point! I really felt that his apologies was not sincere, pretentious and we felt like he just wanted show his face do the manager thing and slap us with a free dessert to make us feel better! no thank you!!! It will be a very long time before I return to this establishment! I'm also suggesting for the employees in this location to take a trip to any Chick Fil A and learn great customer service skills!"
