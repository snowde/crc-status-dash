Ellen H.,"Richmond, TX",101,8,,3.0,4/1/2016,"They have a great happy hour , 4/6 during the week, you get the same portion appetizer for half the price, and $5 drinks, but you have to sit in the bar area. I recommend sitting at the actual bar because the bartenders have given great service, but anytime I sit at a bar table the service has ALWAYS been bad. (I've been going bi-weekly for months , I now leave if a bar seat isn't open because thats how bad the bar area service is)They must have too big of a section because they rarely acknowledge you(see you for order, and maybe 10 minutes after you've gotten food) and are very slow to greeting you, I don't understand how they haven't fixed this ongoing issue. The bread here is great, prices for a main course are $15 plus but I can say the portions are huge , I never eat more than half my meal, I think the chicken and pasta dishes are the best!"
Natasha S.,"Sugar Land, TX",41,17,2,3.0,12/4/2014,"My go to dishes were the Miso Salmon and Habachi Steak with the Wasabi mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The roasted artichoke was my all-time favorite appetizer! Every time I dined there, there was truly a party going on in my mouth. This used to be my favorite spot for Happy Hour and dinner. Did I mention the blueberry mojito was to die for?  Sadly, I had to stop going because I was tired of swatting gnats off my food.  They have a serious gnat infestation and it is no longer worth the visit."
Samantha M.,"Richmond, TX",0,35,10,5.0,2/21/2016,"Great service, friendly staff, amazing mojitos, and great food. Love the fried mac and cheese balls and chicken marsala."
Adt M.,"Houston, TX",0,6,2,1.0,3/14/2017,"Worst dining experience of my life. I will never spend my money at this establishment. It took over 40 minutes to get an appetizer. We ordered drinks and never got an opportunity to order another. Spoke with a manager and told her i just wanted to pay for what we had so far and leave. She asked us to stay and she would take care of us. We ordered another drink and 12 minutes later nothing. I had enough and walked to the bar and spoke with the manager and told them we would be leaving and i needed to pay for what we had. 10 minutes later no ticket. I'm pissed at this point and go to the person that was supposed to be preparing our ticket and told him that if he didnt have a check for me in 30 seconds i was leaving. I began the countdown, and he said that if we left he would have to press charges WTH. Another manager came and said dont worry about the bill and then asked us what we had. I said one cocktail a beer and an appetizer. He said oh well in that case let me get your bill. Cheesecake Factory at First Colony is HORRIBLE!"
Eliza L.,"Sugar Land, TX",2,71,76,5.0,2/12/2016,"Service is always great here. We always try to get here early before the actual prime time starts during lunch or dinner. One of favorite drink is the strawberry lemonade. I like to order Shrimp scampi, Pasta da Vinci, Chicken Bellagio, & Bar B Q chicken are all delicious. My favorite cheesecake is the red velvet & snicker cheesecake....."
Colby S.,"Houston, TX",4,10,,4.0,2/8/2016,"If you are indecisive and are really hungry, come to this place as they literally have everything from burgers, steaks, Chinese and Italian. Beautiful scenery and not that bad of service. Reminds me of Vegas!!"
Sydney C.,"78704 (South Austin), Austin, TX",0,4,,5.0,8/1/2016,"It was so difficult to decide from this diverse menu! We had sandwiches for lunch (and a Margarita!) and everything was prepared perfectly. All employees were professional, attentive & truly welcoming. We'll be back!"
Lisha S.,"Sugar Land, TX",20,1,,1.0,8/29/2016,"Seriously worst customer service EVER!!! I came here before and ate at the bar, the bartender was rude and showed me attitude, so that day I decided not to tip, but instead decided to leave him a note on my receipt telling him that he was rude and to try improving on his manners. Just because of that one bad experience I decided to not let it get to me, so I decided to give it a second chance. I came here today and sat down at a seat at the bar, I ordered a small loaf of brown bread, and buffalo blasts. When I received my food, they gave me HALF A FUCKING LOAF!!!! Like seriously WTF!?!! Another waiter stopped by the bar with 2 loaves of brown bread and 1 loaf of white bread, in their little loaf container. I asked the guy at the bar why I got half a loaf and he gave me some cockameme excuse and didn't even apologize for the bread. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!! NEVER AGAIN COMING HERE!!!!!"
Alfredo F.,"Houston, TX",2,17,,1.0,11/22/2015,They served our cheeseburgers with no fries. They said fries will be in 5 minutes. Half an our later they brought them but we had already finished eating.  Manager said we will get us free cheesecake for the inconvenience but they put it on our check anyway.
Jimmy R.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,36,10,4.0,12/6/2015,My favorite breakfast joint now. Their egg benedict and french toast rock house. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because they are only available on Sunday brunch menu. These should be available every day.
Diana B.,"Richmond, TX",0,3,,1.0,8/7/2016,"I will never come back here ever!!! We were seated and waited nearly 20 minutes and no one even came and when we got up to leave and complained to the manager he was brushing the situation off, poor poor service or no service for that matter. I definitely will write to their corporate as well, too bad one star is the lowest"
Vivian H.,"Euless, TX",203,54,13,5.0,8/28/2014,"Michael Ellison, our server was the nicest, the most professional and energetic server I have ever met! He was a pleasure to talk to!! You should request him if possible!!! From the beginning he kept a smile, he checked up on us, gave us suggestions...you almost wanted him to check up on you or better yet sit at your table! Sir, you had a great attitude and an amazing spirit! Ill be back again and again and I will be referring people to sit in your section!!! Food is amazing as always but Michael made my visit an experience!"
Christina G.,"Tampa, FL",1322,988,1475,4.0,12/30/2012,"I have always appreciated the Cheesecake Factory.  Yes, I know it is not high dining, but there is a certain satisfaction about getting a huge amount of food for a reasonable price.  Add that the food is pretty good and I am a happy camper. I always enjoy the bread that they bring before the meal.  I enjoy the brown bread over the sourdough bread, as did my entire table, and we quickly devoured it.  They brought two baskets for five people, which was good.  Next time I think I'll request double the brown bread and none of the sourdough since the sourdough always goes to waste. I really enjoy their new Skinnylicious menu.  I always try to eat healthy and this makes it extremely easy.  What's even better is that there is a plethora of choices, it is not just a couple.  I got the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad.  I would suggest getting the dressing on the side.  I usually do, but since this was on the Skinnylicious menu I figured they would go light on the dressing.  I was wrong and my salad was left mainly untouched.  The tuna was perfectly seared.  I did not expect it to be that good from the Cheesecake Factory, but it rivaled great sushi places I've been to.   I would also suggest the Reeses Cheesecake.  I get it every time I go to the Cheesecake Factory.  It is big enough to share or eat with your next one or two meals.  If it is just for yourself, get a take out box, because you will definitely be taking some to go.  The fatty inside me always enjoys some of the menu items they think up.  My new favorite is their mac and cheese burger.  They put some of their fried mac and cheese balls on a burger.  My dad had it and thought it was great.  This is definitely something I want to try when I am not eating healthy for a New Years Eve dress."
Meticulously p.,"Pasadena, CA",1,120,4,5.0,10/24/2015,Perfect for a party of two and a half.  We sat outside on a Friday evening about 6pm and enjoyed a peaceful dinner. 2 year old was able to hang out outside her high chair to check out the scene. Hubby and I were able to enjoy a meal without hassle. Till
Rachel R.,"Missouri City, TX",0,6,,1.0,6/27/2016,"If I could give this location zero stars I would!!! Went here on my birthday and the device was terrible. My daughters chicken was raw I waited 10 mins for salad dressing. We never got refills on our drinks. When I finally flagged down the manager to tell him, he basically mumbled something and walked away. They have lost a customer forever! I will never go to this horrible location again, they weren't busy and they have gone significantly down hill!! Manager did absolutely nothing!!"
Ayesha A.,"Houston, TX",129,100,22,3.0,9/14/2015,"Solid place for birthday celebrations and such..where everyone can find something to eat and the service is good. None of the food is what I would call amazing, but none of it it bad. Everything tastes acceptable and they have pig portions (reflective of the price ). Pretty decor and friendly service. I have been here several times."
Marvin O.,"Houston, TX",36,192,910,2.0,5/25/2014,"I'm used to going to the location off of Katy Freeway but we ended up here for a family member's birthday party. They were not very busy at all but we had a large party of over 13 so we ended up waiting about an hour to two hours because everyone in my party didn't show on time ""family...gotta love em"" our meal took quite a while and I'm assuming it's because of such a large party.  I ordered the breakfast omelette which left much to be desired. It was so bad I could've made the same thing in one of those omelette maker machines they sell at Walmart. My wife got the chicken and biscuits and had noticed that they have changed the recipe recently to be more like chicken broth instead of gravy within the meal and she ended up taking it back and getting something else. I am not a fan of cheesecake factory or their sister restaurant the grand Lux. But I guess for the ambience this is a popular spot for all of the ""cool kids"" of Houston. I didn't pick this restaurant so I really couldn't complain to anyone but Yelp"
Dave B.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,3,,2.0,1/6/2016,"Disappointed. Took a large group to dinner and every other utensil was dirty with baked on food. I ordered ""shepards pie"" that was just a bowl of half ground meat with mash potatoes spooned on top. Very oily too. If it was meant to be de-constructed it could have been presented better. But for sure, it wasn't shepards pie. Wait person was nice but over-stretched with too many tables."
Ann J.,"Sugar Land, TX",5,19,9,3.0,6/2/2015,Just your average American food provided at the restaurant. Cheese cake is good but other than that not that great.
Monica B.,"Houston, TX",58,2,,5.0,7/5/2016,"My niece and I went in today for lunch and had the best service! It always seems to be really cold for my niece (shes 6 years old) at any restaurant we go to so I know they wont turn up the A/C to be warmer. Anyway, I noticed the outside patio and I asked the hostess if we could be seated outside. I did realize it was about 90 degrees outside and they probably weren't seating outside due to the heat, but it would make my niece more comfortable to eat so I thought I would try. After the hostess consulted with her manager, she said it was fine. I realize that the outside patio was in fact closed and didn't seem to be anyones section since we were the only ones sitting outside. The manager made my niece feel very special and most of all she wasn't cold anymore. I forgot to get her name but she very nice and attentive with getting our drinks and food. After that Joseph was the server that took care of us and he had a great spirit despite having to go outside and service our table in the heat wearing those long sleeve button up shirts! I really do appreciate the managers approval with us seating outside and Josephs positive attitude and consistent service. No one made us feel like we were an inconvenience and everyone was always smiling and very friendly."
