Annie B.,"Houston, TX",55,41,12,1.0,7/29/2015,"Had to wait exactly 16 minutes to just order food at 4:50 p.m. on a Wednesday.  This location is in Sugar Land. Never had to wait this long in big city, Houston. I've eaten here before. Not the best by any means."
Gammie L.,"Katy, TX",440,145,255,3.0,5/21/2014,"Not the most great tasting restaurant but if you're here, do try their mango smoothie! Is the  !! And one more thing, FRIED MACARONI AND CHEESE! It's amaze balls! That's if you want clogged arteries, heart attack and high cholesterol! lol but so worth it! :)"
Murietta F.,"Houston, TX",174,5,,2.0,5/1/2014,"Just walked out because it took them an hour to not bring us our order. We went in at 9, got our drinks at 9:20, and at 10:00 we still hadn't gotten our food. Our server didn't seem to really care about us and was having a lot of trouble doing her basic responsibilities. The manager was polite enough but he never really tried to fix our problem.  We usually go to the Galleria location which is an A+ compared to this one. I expected the same smiling faces but instead got a bunch of young ladies and gentlemen on their phones and a bartender that was constantly running to the kitchen.  Probably won't go back unless I absolutely have to."
Shevonne L.,"Sugar Land, TX",8,34,12,5.0,7/19/2015,I love this place and my kids ask to come here all the time.  I hear people always saying it to busy but when a place is busy all the time they usually have fresher food.  We always get good service and the food is always consistently good.  Yummy!!!
Joe Z.,"Stafford, TX",0,16,11,4.0,12/5/2015,"This is an interesting chain. My wife loves tiramisu, and we're always trying to find one that is as good as the cake we used to get at a place called sweet life patisserie in Eugene, Oregon. There are two types of tiramisu at the cheesecake factory - cheesecake tiramisu and traditional. We got a whole tiramisu cake for $50 and everyone seemed to love it. It wasn't as good as sweet life's but it is a good substitute. One drawback was that they freeze the cakes. It had to thaw before we ate it, which seemed to effect the consistency and texture. Overall, well probably go back"
Teri P.,"Sugar Land, TX",114,44,101,1.0,4/26/2015,"Today, we sat unattended for ten minutes.  No one bothered to come by the table and ask for a drink order or to let us know that they would be with us.  Sadly, the restaurant was not busy."
Aliza R.,"Katy, TX",0,8,,1.0,12/23/2016,"Yup... yet another disappointment in Houston.  I have heard raves about the Cheesecake Factory and had meant to try it for years.  I went here for lunch with a friend at about 2:00 PM and we were told there would be a 10 minute wait.  We had a smiling waiter who seemed to want to provide good service; he just didn't know how.  No water refills at all, no follow-up after the food was served, which the kitchen got wrong.  Pizza with no onions?  NO!  You'll have the onions and like it!  How many french fries are included with the $13 (seriously) burger?  Approximately 6.  You expect ketchup for the burger you ordered medium but arrived well done?  You'll get exactly .025 oz. in the world's tiniest plastic ramekin that looked like it came out of Barbie's Dream Kitchen.  Dessert?  It may have required a second mortgage, plus the meal didn't exactly scream ""Yeah!  Try the cheesecake!""  Overall, a never-ever-going-there-again experience."
Pooja T.,"Houston, TX",3,67,38,5.0,6/12/2015,Family night out? Date night? Gno? love this place for all of the above! Skinny sangria is a must-try!!! If you're into ahi tuna- their salad has the best ginger dressing in town. Did i mention the Kobe beef burger? Absolutely tender and delish!
Fabby M.,"Missouri City, TX",10,13,4,2.0,7/13/2015,"Sugarland location is the worst service!  The more crowded it is the better the service.  It's empty and the staff are busy cleaning chairs and tables instead of ""waiting"" on the few of us that are here.  2stars; A/C working."
Jonathan D.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,11,1,3.0,8/17/2015,"Average food, sometimes a long wait. Good service though. Cheesecake are a bit over sized and it becomes nauseating at the end. The decor seems unrelated to the type of restaurant too in my opinion."
Ayeshah A.,"Syosset, NY",159,36,4,4.0,6/9/2015,What an awesome experience. Jasmine is the server I got and she is amazing. Cheerful professional and someone who inspires tips for sure! I love their skinnylicious summer rolls !!!
Ed S.,"Houston, TX",11,22,,1.0,3/22/2016,"It is so freaking annoying when the server asks you if you want boxes when you're still apparently eating, but much more frustrating is when he asks twice more a few minutes later. There were no customers waiting for tables and we weren't taking an exorbitant amount of time to eat our meals. I understand that you want turnaround but I paid for my meal and expect some common decency to not be pushed to scarf it down."
Sh S.,"Houston, TX",2,10,,5.0,1/21/2014,"Today, we'll be reviewing the  Cheesecake Factory.  We'll have to see how that's going.  How about this one here in the First Colony Mall?  As you can see, it's a Cheesecake Factory but it's in Sugarland.  They really provide a decent amount of sauce to their foods, something to add the flavor.  But, many of their foods glisten with the grease.  But their foods look very nice, their sauces look nice.  I'm expecting a lot of good things out of this Cheesecake factory. Let's give it a shot.   It's very good.  Some of the food is a little cheesey but I don't mind it.  If you like Cheesecake factory food, you're going to really like this Cheesecake factory.  Their flavors here combine really well.  Their food is very well done, not undercooked not overcooked.  It's very good food.  Let's try the food in reverse here.  Let's try the Cheesecake.  Believe it or not, the dessert can be a little burnt but you don't get that flavor.  Not a burnt flavor at all. They did a good job with the Cheesecake.  Very good.  In my opinion this Cheesecake factory is better than the Houston Cheesecake factory. A big thing here.  But I think they did a very good job here.  Very good flavor. The flavors combine very well.  Cheesey but very good.  That's what I'm saying."
Kristen G.,"Sugar Land, TX",66,15,6,1.0,4/23/2015,Service sucks been there last 3 times in two weeks in hopes of getting better service but no the food is good though that's always 5 stars except for the bread I always have to ask for warm bread and it tasted as if it were microwaved last time
Axel T.,"Ceres, CA",1,15,,2.0,6/12/2015,"I went in and right of the bat an asain waitress looked at me and said ""Looks like u never been to a resturant like.."" then switched it to "" first time being in a resturant with over 20 items in a menu"" wtf?! I brushed it off oh by the way the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the manager noticed my drink was empty and was very friendly and filled it. Yes my asain waitress ignored me idk if its because she assumed I wouldn't tip. Crazy what a wrinkled Ralph lauren polo  will make people assume lol...."
Brian T.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,1.0,9/12/2015,"My parents wanted to take me out for my birthday last night so I suggested this place as it's not too expensive but still has a nice atmosphere. We were greeted nicely by the hostess and had a short wait before being seated... from there on, it was downhill. Our server came by our table and without introducing herself or greeting us just asked what we wanted to drink... to which we all replied that we'd just start with water.  The water came in cheap short plastic mugs which was odd because all the tables around us were drinking water out of nice tall glasses... but whatever.  I finished my water quickly and she got me a refill but her hand was placed directly on the lip of the mug... I don't like to drink out of straws so I found this pretty gross.  I would have asked for a different glass but when I looked up she was already gone... I didn't drink again until I got home. When she came back to the table all she said was 'are you ready to order?'  I had originally wanted a beer but after the hand on the glass incident and given the fact that she seemed to be in a rush I just ordered my food... even though my parent's said 'don't you want a beer?' she didn't pick up on it. When we ordered, she didn't write any of it down... spoilers: she got it wrong.  My mom's crab cakes didn't come out with the food.  Now I used to wait tables so I can tell when I'm being lied to and this one was blatant... she said 'they didn't want the crab cakes sitting in the window while you waited for the rest of the food so I'll go get them now.'... it took 10 minutes for them to eventually come out.  I don't mind if you mess up... even if you clearly didn't write the order down... BUT DON'T LIE TO ME! At this point I was pretty irritated. I ordered the enchiladas which were bland and the rice was stale... I didn't bother finishing and wasn't in the mood to order anything else.  I had them boxed up and then threw them away when I got home. We had originally intended on ordering dessert but I just wanted to get out of there so we skipped it. Of course no manager's came by the table and the whole evening was forgettable. Will not be returning."
Joe S.,"Pearland, TX",1164,15,126,5.0,11/5/2013,The food is always awesome and that one Hispanic waitress with that amazing body! I thinks she's J-lo's long lost relative or something. JESUS CHRIST she's fine!  I know I know Jenny from the block is Rican
Sara I.,"Sugar Land, TX",220,240,475,4.0,4/30/2010,"Always a great spot to take a group of friends. It`s the place to be when you all are indecisive, and want a variety of foods. I have always enjoyed the flavourful and unique appetizers. I recently tried the avocado egg rolls. Whoa, they are good! A fusion palette bomb in my mouth! Also, you can`t go wrong with the cheesy artichoke and spinach dip, which is served with thick and crunchy tortilla chips.  Now comes the excitable sweet tooth. I get all frenzy and wide ~ eyed when going through their huge dessert selection. All of their cheesecakes are great. I`ve tried many of the flavours. The chocolate cake and brownie a la mode is scrumptious as well. This cute charming restaurant can never let you down. The only downturn perhaps, is when it gets overly crowded on weekend nights. Do expect some time for your food to arrive."
John S.,"Houston, TX",0,9,4,1.0,7/2/2015,Just unacceptable!  Had to find a server to take our drink order.  Finally took our order but it came in multiple drops.  15 minutes to receive the final drink. Most were non alcoholic.  Our food came at different times.  The first 2 were almost done with their meal before everyone else received their food. My daughters boyfriend ordered a medium rare burger.  It was a good med well to well done.  My cous cous was like little hard pellets topped with over cooked and hard salmon.  Just terrible kitchen service.
Brett G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",19,60,137,4.0,11/26/2013,"What can be said of the Cheesecake Factory that hasn't already been said? I don't live here in Sugar Land so I won't be back very often to evaluate the service. I suppose the most I could do is tell of the atmosphere and how this store compares to the other Cheesecake Factories around the country. Layout: Extremely open. The store is one large, open room. There are not walls separating different dining sections. There are partitions that have the booths attached to them, but not floor to ceiling walls. The booths chairs are connected to the booth behind you, so I could feel the people getting up and moving around as the whole seat moved. Noise: I went on a Monday night, so it wasn't full. The tall ceiling does good to 'take away' the sound that bounces off the hard, tiled floor. The booth directly behind me was occupied but the height of the booth seats did good to keep their conversation away from ours. Overall sound was acceptable, I didn't have to strain to listen to my lovely wife sitting across from me. Food: Good, of course. Service: Poor, we were held hostage for over 10 minutes after we were done eating our cheesecake dessert. However, I can't make a reliable assessment of the service because of that since I've never been there before to make a comparison against. I'd go back."
