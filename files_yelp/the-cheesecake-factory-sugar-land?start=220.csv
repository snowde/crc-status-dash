C C.,"Houston, TX",3,73,,5.0,10/9/2015,"My husband and I arrived early for Sunday brunch. The weather was absolutely beautiful. Sunny, a little breeze, and low 80's. If you live in Houston, which my sisters says is hot as hell, you can appreciate how rare it is to have a non humid & 80's temperature in the middle of summer. So we decided to sit outside, which we rarely do during summertime. I requested a table with shade and we got the perfect table. Our waiter came and was very good and prompt during the entire meal. I love love their brunch. In fact, I know this might sound shocking, but Cheesecake Factory has one of the best brunches ever. We always order the freshly squeezed OJ. I love fresh squeeze juice, especially orange juice. Of course I was a pig and ordered two glasses during the duration of our meal. I just wished they sell a carafe of it. If the manager is reading this, please sell the OJ in carafe size. I could drink the whole thing by myself. I ordered the giant Belgian waffle as always. My hubby ordered the brunch combo but substituted the pancakes for waffles. Why? Because their waffles are so freaking yummy!! They literally make the best waffle ever. I have no idea how they do it. It was so flaky on the outside, yet so airy. You know what I am talking about. You know you have ordered waffles that taste like they used the same mixture as pancakes and it comes out so heavy and dense. If you are waffle obsessed like me, you gotta order their Belgian waffle. Ok enuf with the waffle talk. We finished our meal and got the check pretty quickly. An amazing brunch with great companionship and the best weather ever. Can't get better that that.  Cheesecake Factory - oh please sell your OJ in carafe size. And never change your waffle recipe. I come here only to eat your waffles and drink your OJ once a month. It is awesome....."
Josh J.,"Richmond, TX",0,1,,5.0,1/25/2016,"Came in on a sunday night questioning if we should be here, it was kinda dead. My server maurice was awsome though ,food was mediocre but definitely will be going back. Thanks maurice!"
Rj M.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,3,,5.0,2/15/2015,"Didn't try the lemonade but the food was amazing, I got the Philly cheesesteak and my girlfriend got the chicken Alfredo, both were cooked perfectly and tasted amazing, service was fast and good, no complaints"
Shawn P.,"Houston, TX",60,257,18,2.0,5/21/2014,"I have been disappointed with this location many times; mainly because of the service. These guys start off good, but lose their mojo midstream. I asked my server for a straw 6 times before he finally brought one. He apologized, but I just wonder why the heck would it take so long to grant such a simple request. Another issue I had was with the food...it was just ok. I had a pasta dish and the noodles were actually dry! Very disappointing to say the least. I think they need new mgmt or something. Typically this chain does not disappoint, but this location leaves a lot to be desired."
Greta V.,"Austin, TX",24,8,,3.0,10/13/2014," mom and I have gone to the cheesecake factory for years. I go home to Sugar Land pretty often and c.f. is familiar and comfortable and the food is usually ok and reasonably priced. For the most part the appeal is nostalgic though, because my mom and I have been going there for years and we have had so many good conversations in there over a bottle of Chard. However, my issue was with the cheesecake itself, which is usually the object of praise in reviews of the restaurant. Ok, it wasn't the taste, but....the size! We ordered a piece to go, to take home, and when it arrived, and I looked in the box, it was super small. My mom and I used to share a piece of the same cheesecake for dessert and we would rarely be able to finish it. The manager came over when we remarked to our waiter that it looked rather small compared to what we were used to getting and he said 'they all come in Pre-sliced from corporate'. Ugh! He looked at us like we were crazy. HIs condescending attitude was unnecessary. I never complain about portions sizes either... Anyway, we have been back since, but haven't ordered the cheesecake."
Daniel L.,"Houston, TX",4999,1312,2725,2.0,10/13/2010,"What makes this one better than the Galleria one is that it is newer, flashier design, and the better parking situation. The one thing I like about the Cheesecake Factory is how impressively consistent they are in every location. The food is not the best in the world, but it's good enough to draw you in, make you order a real meal, and then get your cheesecake. I was here on a date so I couldn't do what I wanted to do by ordering a whole cheesecake and digging in without a fork. I was on my best behavior that night. The alcohol service is slow. I have no idea why on each drink order it takes so long to get alcohol, but the same waitress can get you a glass of water in two seconds. Do they have a lousy bartender or do they frown on drinking because this is the suburbs? Weird. I know that on dates I am not going to get beer goggles based on how long it takes to get a drink though. There are also a lot more kids at this one than the Galleria one. Welcome to the suburbs. It is busy but they move around quickly. I waited more than I wanted, but less than the estimated time.  Come here for the cheesecake - that is why everyone does. Accept the bad parts with that awesome part and you should be a fan of the Factory as well."
Sarah P.,"Katy, TX",21,13,14,1.0,5/30/2014,One star because we ate the food but the waitress never came back after we ordered and we had to flag her down yo pay. We had to share our drinks!!!
Mitch T.,"Roseville, CA",3,20,11,1.0,5/26/2014,"Can't rate the food because we walked out after 30 minutes of being ignored, terrible service.  Flagged down a waiter and was told to hold on a while they were figure it out, we all walked out after another 10 minutes.  Can't believe how bad the service has gotten at this chain"
Trish D.,"Houston, TX",0,10,1,1.0,6/28/2016,"I came in after a great day of shopping and sat in the bar area. it was very busy. my waiter greeted me in about ten minutes or so, i wasn't bothered by the wait time. like i said, they was extremely busy and i was reading a book. Moving on, D'Angelo, my waiter, informed me about the happy hour specials as well as brought me the menu. i ordered. Ate and really enjoyed my food and service. Afterwards, he brought me the check and i just handed him my card to pay the bill. when he returned i notice that i was not charged the happy hour prices! I informed him, he apologize and went to get his manager. When the manager returned, she did not introduce herself, all she said was ""hi, your sever put your food in at 6:22pm, happy hour ended at 6. There's nothing we can do.:""  Really? no apology? This is how you treat your guess?? I've been coming to cheesecake factory for over 10 years and never had to make a complaint until now and the way i was treated was down right distasteful especially because i am a manger in food service myself. unfortunately i will not be returning back to this location and i also will be calling corporate."
Yvette A.,"Houston, TX",272,123,601,3.0,2/25/2010,"Cheesecake is an Oldie but ""semi"" goodie. Many people say that the food is overpriced.. I agree to an extent but who doesn't go home with leftovers? Well I always do. It seems to me that their prices are equal to 2 dinners. The crispy artichoke hearts (""Small dish appetizer"" for only $3.95) were scrumptious. The batter was tasty & well seasoned, the artichoke had a perfect hot crunchy bite.. I dipped them in their creamy lemon-garlic concoction and I was in artichoke heaven. For entree, I ordered the Pan Seared Salmon served with Angel Hair pasta, capers and lemon-butter sauce. It was like eating a Chicken Piccata, except with Salmon.. perfect for me since I gave up all meat for Lent.. It met my seafood craving & I'd definitely order it again. My friend ordered Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna. Again, the portion was huge! The ahi tuna steak was served on a bed of white rice and topped with wasabi crust. With all the layers on fork and a touch of Miso sauce, it all blended well. We ordered the 30th Anniversary cheesecake and Craig's chocolate cake. Both were OK but I'm not big on desserts so after a few bites, I was over it. The 30th Anniv. cheesecake was layered in this order: brownie, chocolate cake, cheesecake, chocolate cake, brownie, cheesecake. Save yourself an extra $8 and share dessert. SHARING is caring. Overall, all my ""Cheesecake"" experiences have been just A-OK. Nothing has ever had me craving to come back for more.. maybe the artichoke hearts but they look simple enough for me to make at home. Maybe it's the pretty casino-affect ambiance that has people coming back.. A good workout may be needed after a meal at this Factory.. (After this, I'm heading to my kitchen to dive into my leftovers ;o) )"
Athenapex C.,"Houston, TX",41,671,574,4.0,10/22/2012,I love the fact that they have fifty million types of cheesecake but I must admit the prices are starting to get a little ridiculous.  Most are from 6.50 and up.  We had the adam's peanut butter cup fudge etc etc and the seasonal pumpkin pecan cheesecake both were delicious but very expensive as far as desserts go.  Also is it just me or are the slices getting smaller too?  I do like the fresh whipped cream it is a nice touch.
NowIamaMrs. B.,"Houston, TX",1,22,14,1.0,2/12/2012,"Very dissapointed at my visit to this location tonight. Came for a girlfriend's birthday dinner and  that had to have been the WORST wait, food, and service every recieved from The Cheesecake factory. Scenerio My friend arrived at 7 to reserve a table for 20-30 people if possible to be available by 8pm. Apparently she was told it would be a 2 1/2 hour wait. She waited since she really loved the restaraunt and had already made plans to have her dinner at this location. While waiting for service the front door staff ""greeters"" stared at us as if we were at the wrong place? VERY WEIRD. Anyway after waiting and waiting we were seated at 10:30. Keep in mind there were other large parties coming in that were being seated ahead of us, even though we were there prior to their arrival. You would say maybe they booked there reservation earlier, but that is just the thing, we were told reservations were not avilable, and that tables were reserved on a first come, first serve basis...interesting. Finally Seated We were greated by a server named Robert, whom may i express was WONDERFUL. He was very apologetic, accomodating, and attentative to our table. He introduced himself as well as another server named Adam. Adam did not introduce himself. Robert did it for him.Throughout the night orders, once received were unappetizing. Noodles were dry for the Fettucini, the rice was cold for the gumbo, and more sauce was needed for the basil pasta. The only good thing was the Chocolate Martini. Robert made sure to take care of orders that came back incorrect and did everything needed to accomodate us. Adam on the other hand....where was he again? Bill Arrived Of course gratuity was included in the bill. In one situation my sister ordered the angel hair pasta with shrimp. The menu said the order was 16.95. When the bill arrived it was priced at 20.45.We asked why was it priced like this and we were told that was ""just"" how it rung up. I advised unless it was on the menu for that price there would have to be a better way to justify this amount. Needles to say it was miracously corrected. We mentioned the fact we had been waiting over 3 hours for a table and was quickly told by Adam, ""You were told there was a 2 1/2 hour wait anyway"". Seriously? That is the attitude receieved after poor unapologetic service. Great. Final Call Had it been my event I wouldn't have gave Cheesecake factory a dime of my money. I do not like unappreciative service. I asked how were the tips split between the 2 waiters and spoke with a manager Mike that myself and a few others wanted our already included tip to go to Robert. A few people did not tip at all regardless of the tip being included because the service was just that BAD. The manager came out and gave an apology statement but from all the feedbackwe recieved from the manager as to ""What the manager said"" I doubt it was genuine. Needless to say I WILL NOT BE BACK. I choose Mark's over them anyday. It was a waste of money and downright rude rude rude service from the beginning to the end. Our thin grace of light was Robert and I thank him for doing what he could by himself."
Craig W.,"Angleton, TX",6,50,30,5.0,7/2/2014,We had great service! I thought the food was a little pricey but this was for my sons birthday. He wanted Cheesecake Factory. Naturally we had to have cheesecake. We all tried each other's choice and WOW! I'm a chocoholic and overdosed. Come here for the dessert.
A G.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,4,,2.0,11/8/2015,"The service was pretty good, but I would highly suggest not ordering any ""normal"" food. Such as pizza, sandwiches, etc; and I don't normally order just a sandwich and fries. I ordered the chicken parm sandwich and I regretted it immediately after one bite. It looks appetizing, but sure had me fooled. It was lacking a lot of flavor and the only tasty thing I had was the fries. My date ordered pizza, (note we're eating lunch, so we didn't think fancy food was necessary) and I took a bite, it seriously reminded me of a dollar pizza you would buy at the grocery store. Nothing against the Cheesecake Factory but I would defiantly suggest a new/better chef."
Mariana R.,"Calgary, Canada",44,630,31,3.0,8/31/2012,This cheesecake factory is beautiful.. And the service was good. They didn't have a lot of things of the menu and I was disappointed because of that. But at the end the food I had was good.
Bianca A.,"Houston, TX",34,17,1,3.0,7/5/2014,"Food good, service not. Everything kept going wrong with our orders, including just getting water and silverware.  The staff was nice, but seemed inccompetent. The manager offered us free dessert which was nice but it seemed like it should have gone much more smoothly. Leaving after 2 hours..."
Nikunj S.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,169,86,5.0,6/18/2012,"The best choice for our father's day lunch this year. In attendance were my wife - the vegetarian, my two daughters and myself - the partial carnivores. Servicing the table, Rachel - a slightly confused (read on) but attentive young lady. Beverages - water, unsweet and sweet teas, mimosas for the two daughters, sample sips for the parents. Appetizers - complimentary bread basket with the yummiest bread, fried calamari, which initially confused Rachel till my wife proclaimed that she was the only vegetarian. I had requested Rachel that the calamari be crisp and hot. She made sure it was. Thai lettuce wraps without chicken. Wife mentioned to Rachel that last time they gave us tofu instead. Rachel checked with the kitchen and brought out a plate of warm, delicious tofu in a sauce. This we ate with the wraps. Entrees - belgian waffle with fresh strawberries for my wife, lunch portions of pasta and salmon for the girls. A cuban sandwich and salad for me. There was so much food that we took some pasta, salmon, half the sandwich and the salad home. Dessert - None. You think we're gluttons ;-) Verdict - Excellent service. Good food for a chain restaurant that caters to every taste and occasion. As my friend James Turner says ""Everybody gets what they want!"""
Caroline K.,"Sugar Land, TX",125,16,71,2.0,3/4/2012,"I should have given zero stars for the lack of quality during brunch. I ordered the egg Benedict. The English muffin came out burnt and soggy. I asked the waiter to exchange for a new one for me. He came back out with another less burnt piece. I didn't want to cause any trouble for him, because I am pretty sure the kitchen did a crap job. I didn't say anything but in my mind a siren went off to not go there for brunch ever again.  Their cheesecake is the only reason I would even think about going there. My favorite is the tiramisu cheesecake. I hate the feeling of being bloated after eating fattening food. This cheesecake made me feel satisfied and not bloated at all.  I guess they named it cheesecake factory for a reason. Go for the cheesecake, not their food. (at least not brunch)"
Devender S.,"Norwalk, CT",0,10,,4.0,8/29/2015,Love Cheesecake Factory and this one is no aberration. Fabulous avocado egg rolls and jambalaya pasta. Delicious tiramisu cheesecake on top. Delicious food.
A G.,"Richmond, TX",0,17,2,1.0,7/21/2015,"I've been to this particular CF and I'm disappointed every time.  The wait staff is friendly, however, the food is not worth the money.  It always takes way too long to get our food and it's never hot.  I'm ready to leave before our food arrives.  I will go back to pick up a cheesecake but never to dine-in again."
