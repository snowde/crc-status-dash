Marilyn. E.,"Sugar Land, TX",8,153,1,2.0,6/22/2015,I've been to many a CCF but this was my first time at this location  Mall shopping made me hungry and I thought of the Orange Chicken lunch special I used to get in CA.  I walked at the height of Friday lunch hour and the place was only half full.  Shoulda been a a clue. The smallest and darkest CCF I've been in.  No high energy here. Ordered said lunch special.  After it took a tour of the dining room (the food runner was taking all her orders to the wrong tables) it arrived barely lukewarm with sauce on one side and no sauce over the other half.   My server never checked back on me so I just ate what I could and left most.  Poor guy was sweating through his shirt (FYI they have a new item of clothing called an undershirt) and walking around fanning himself.I had to flag him down to get my check and refuse a to go box.  Never offered dessert which I would have liked but ..oh well.  Won't be back to this location if lunch is any indicator of the service and food quality here.
David S.,"Rio Grande City, TX",47,62,17,5.0,1/5/2012,"Hmmm. Wow!!!! Reece's peanut butter cheesecake.... Who are some of these people? Are they from outer space? Really? Are we giving the Cheescake Factory three stars or less? Wow!  This location is probably one of the nicest locations. Located in one of the nicest areas in SugarLand, I found this location to be classy. I always enjoy the valet service at The Chesscake Factory. No charge as long as you eat or buy from the Cheesecake Factory. You know, you can eat at the Cheescake Factory (CF). The CF does not only sell cheesecake. But, where can I begin, we had the Peanut Butter and choclate cheese cake. Wow! That was a little too much sweetness, but I could not stop eating it! I, did, however, have to eat it in small doses, but that was my fault.  I wish I would have bought a few slices home with me as I was visiting my sister in Houston.  Note to other YELPERS! If you are going to give a negative review, please tell us why. I can not undertsand why someone rates a business 2 or three stars and writes ""Good food and atmosphere!"" Am I supposed to assume that means average, but why is it average? Tell me, please!  Or as Ben Affleck says in Jay and silent Bob ""When Lord, when. When is it going to be my time?"
Veronyka G.,"Sugar Land, TX",49,24,1,1.0,5/15/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory normally has outstanding service at lunch, dinner, and late in the evening so it should follow that brunch would be excellent on Mother's Day.  After we were promptly seated, it took a while to get our waiter's attention. We placed out order and received our drinks. The milk was not cold. When we spoke to the manager, he told us that the milk is kept in the refrigerator by the cheesecake so we should be getting it fresh from the fridge cold. That didn't happen.  My orange juice, although freshly squeezed, wasn't very cold either. I didn't say anything about that because at least it wasn't hot.  Our food arrived about thirty minutes later and we weren't impressed. There wasn't anything spectacular about the omelette and the pancakes didn't look all that appetizing.  In the end, I was a little disappointed by my brunch. My family would've been better off going to another breakfast place or my cooking breakfast but I will be back.  If only cheesecake."
Kelvin P.,"Ganado, TX",0,34,,1.0,7/29/2014,"I can't even begin to tell you how I think this place is over rated!  The food was mediocre,  service was subpar but the thing I hated the most was the seating arrangements.  Most of the seating is not separated so you basically have to sit with strangers, whom if the get up from their seat, their butt is in your face and when they come back it's their crotch!  NEVER NEVER NEVER COMMING BACK!"
Lisa H.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,1.0,9/13/2015,Call to place an order for pickup I was put on hold for 6 minutes I hung up call back the hostess answered on the first ring she put me on hold once again for 6 minutes I called back and Wes answers took our order immediately it should not be this hard by hostess to take an order over the phone.
Gina I.,"Missouri City, TX",284,104,4,4.0,12/31/2013,Iv'e been here plenty of times and I have never had a bad experience. I like how they have a skinny menu for drinks and food. I always order the green chicken and the skinny margarita. The cheesecake is quite expensive and high in calories but so GOOD. There is a lot of variety on the menu (perhaps too much) so it can get confusing if it is your first time.
Mary M.,"Missouri City, TX",0,9,,4.0,8/22/2015,"I love coming here for the chicken alfredo and red velvet cheesecake. However, the wait times are sometimes very long if you go on a Saturday ..."
G.E. C.,"Houston, TX",0,10,,1.0,4/27/2016,"I have been to several Cheesecake Factory's in Houston, as well as in other states. The food in the past has been consistently decent if not decadent, and the portions huge. This time in addition to shoddy service, the portions were tiny and the food, chicken in my case, over cooked and dry. The waiter's check back was so late that all in my party were just about finished and ordering something else was out of the question. Dirty dishes piled up on our table without being bussed. The people behind us walked out because after waiting a very long time, they still had not been served. My friend's appetizer salad was embarrassingly tiny, and she sent it back. The waiter explained they were under new management and many in the kitchen were new, too. Also, it seems, many of the waiters were new. I don't know if all Cheesecake Factory's are undergoing comparable changes, but until Sugarland's figures things out, I would avoid theirs."
Josh C.,"New Braunfels, TX",60,31,7,3.0,7/15/2012,The desserts -- especially the cheescake-- are awesome.  Everything else on the menu is unfortunately a wash.  Waitstaff was prompt and attentive both times we went here (the second time being for dessert only). This and the dessert alone pulled 3 stars from me.
Carrie D.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,6,,4.0,8/7/2014,"My friend and I met here for lunch about a week ago. Believe it or not I have never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory before! The food is a bit pricey but enjoyable. The cheesecake, however, is to die for! I will be back to try many, many more flavors! The reason I gave it a four star instead of a five star was that the service was a bit slow, and we had to flag a server down for a refill on our drinks. Other than that, it was a very tasty meal."
Kelly N.,"Richmond, TX",126,628,240,3.0,3/3/2012,"I like this location much more than the galleria.  Not as congested and it's well lit.  Then again we did go at 2 in the afternoon, but still.  Sunday was crowded but we only waited for about 10 minutes.  Our server was pretty attentive even though she was having a bad day she said.  We had the ahi tuna appetizer and sliders.  Both were pretty good.  My friends had the fried macaroni and cheese which they said were delicious. Friend had the spicy crispy beef...definitely a big portion but you're paying  like $16 for it...sharable indeed.  Tastes like any orange beef to me but still good if you're wanting a Chinese dish. For dessert we had the tiramisu cheesecake.  I typically don't like tiramisu but this tasted pretty good.  I so enjoy their brown bread there...I was asking for seconds!  What is your secret!?!"
Veronica C.,"Houston, TX",0,12,,1.0,8/2/2015,The food was fine. Honestly I don't pick a restaurant on Sunday morning for the quality of food rather the quality of service. We paid $65 for me and my child's food to be out 5 min later than everyone else (party of 5) and for them to bring strawberries on her plate (which I was specific about her being allergic to). On top of that he brought the wrong dessert for me and didn't bring hers at all. I corrected him again and he didn't apologize or anything he just took it and left I waited another 15 min for mine and my child's desserts. I asked him to just box mine up since everyone else was ready to go and he was so rude! He barely visited our table at all. I won't be going back.
David F.,"Stafford, TX",76,90,1,4.0,2/22/2014,"The place was clean and comfortable. A tad dark but not annoyingly so. Friendly service. Food good, although pricey. Had the calamari appetizers and the fried macaroni & cheese balls. Both very good. Main course of the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. As usual for any Cheesecake Factory that I have been in, the portions were full. I will return."
Mr F.,"Sugar Land, TX",10,24,2,5.0,5/10/2015,From the service to the food this whole experience was a great experience especially dessert. The mini sliders are just amazing and so is everything else so if you are in the mall this is the place to go.
Jared C.,"Missouri City, TX",76,7,1,3.0,8/2/2011,"Cheesecake is simply amazing.  And there really is no better place to get cheesecake than The Cheesecake Factory.  Wowza, their cheesecake is good!  So rich and creamy, I'm drooling just thinking about it.  They have to have over 50 flavors and kinds of cheesecake and I haven't had one I didn't like so far.  For a cheesecake connoisseur, this place is heaven!   The menu is extensive to say the least.  The spiral bound book of a menu holds everything from Italy to Mexico.  I really don't know how to classify this place because they dabble in everything!  But what they have in quantity they lack in quality.  I wouldn't say anything tasted bad, but there isn't much that tastes great.  I've gotten a lot of different entrees over the years and I haven't found anything yet that I crave.  They try to make up for this with portions, though.  Everything here is huge!  I'm talking MASSIVE!  Seriously epic portions. But, there are 2 things I ABSOLUTELY LOVE from this place: 1.  Cheesecake (obviously) 2.  and the AVOCADO EGGROLLS :O... Seriously guys, if you have any interest in avocado, these are a must.  Words cannot describe how awesome this appetizer is.  And the tamarind dipping sauce it comes with is astounding.  I've never tasted anything like it before or since.  And if you ask your waiter, you can get a huge jar of the sauce to take home for $10!  Hmm... now that I'm writing this, I might run down here and grab a jar... Now that I've got the most delicious part out of the way, I can tell you this place is expensive.  Everything is just slightly above what you'd like to pay.  And the fact that I only enjoy 2 things on the menu is a huge let down.  I'd be more open to pay what they're charging if the food they gave me tasted better.  Sure, you get a ton of food, but what good is it if you don't even want to bother boxing it up and taking it home?  I think from now on I'll visit here more often but skip the entree entirely.  The egg rolls are mine, I'm not sharing anymore, and don't even think about touching my cheesecake!!"
Sam S.,"Rosenberg, TX",37,26,8,2.0,6/28/2013,The Cheesecake Factory is way overrated.....the cheesecake is not all that....your better off going to sams...you can get a whole cheese cake for the price of 2 slices....food always comes out late...and maybe its just me but why the penitentiary white uniforms?
Ann M.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,87,24,1.0,2/15/2015,"I don't like the food here. I'm not picky at all but have never really liked anything I've tried here. I only go when invited by friends. Got a Cobb salad recently. Watery. Yucky. The cheesecake is awesome, of course! But the food. Not so much...."
Shariq G.,"Richmond, TX",17,107,8,4.0,12/2/2013,"Food is filled with butter, but what do you expect from the CHEESECAKE factory? Still really delicious and I LOVE the brown bread!"
Lee J.,"Houston, TX",513,94,335,3.0,1/6/2011,"They had a new ""ultimate red velvet cheesecake"" ($7.75) on their menu the day we visited. As soon as I saw that, it was the first thing I ordered, of course! I didn't want to be so stuffed without having to taste their brand new dessert. And well, let me tell ya, it was a big letdown for me. It was just okay and not as divine as the picture had looked. For appetizer, we shared the avocado eggrolls ($9.95). These fried rolls are stuffed with avocados, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, and cilantro. The tamarind-cashew dipping sauce was very tasty! We also ordered pasta carbonara with chicken ($16.50, which also comes with peas and bacon pieces mixed with the pasta). It was okay, but nothing exciting in taste. The strawberry-lemonade ($4.50) was very tasty, but the hubby said it was too sweet and changed his order to a Coke. Other items we usually order are the Bang-Bang chicken and shrimp (the sauce has curry, coconut milk, chile peppers, and peanuts) or their Jamaican chicken and shrimp.  Both were much better than what we ordered the last time. Service was a little slow and not so attentive, but at least they try to be friendly. The restrooms were in need of a little attention the last time we were there, but I know that most times they try to keep them tidy. This location was just okay, but at least the parking situation was much better than the one in the Galleria."
Kendra L.,"The Woodlands, TX",20,67,47,2.0,10/7/2013,"I don't typically write reviews on chains because it's pretty standard what you're going to get there, but I had to write something about this Cheesecake Factory. We went here for Sunday brunch and I was really disappointed. The food was fine, the portions were huge, but I just felt like everything was dirty. When we sat down, there were still crumbs on the table and on the seats, and our spoons were dirty. The cloth backs to the booth smelled mildew-y. At the end our visit, I used the women's restroom and there were paper towels all over the floor where people had somehow missed the trash, but no one from the restaurant had been around to check it out.  I was just disappointed with our experience- if the dining area isn't taken care of, I don't want to know what's going on in the kitchen. Normally, Cheesecake Factory would be a go to place, but unfortunately, this one restaurant had ruined it for me. I won't go back to this location, and probably won't be back to any location anytime soon."
