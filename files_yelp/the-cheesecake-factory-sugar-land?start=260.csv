Eric B.,"Sugar Land, TX",12,11,,3.0,9/9/2013,"Massive location.  Service is comparable to all others...friendly service, short wait and their signature vibrating pagers to let you know when your table is ready."
Ryan L.,"Houston, TX",144,282,,2.0,12/28/2010,"Once you get past the gaudiness of it all, the pretense of being classy with all the trappings, the idiotic book of a menu with the gall to insert additional advertisements in between too much selection, Chili's trained servers, and the overblown ripoff prices, you get a decent meal. Bread always is solid and fresh, and if you go for brunch, the benedict options are the best things on the menu. The rest of the menu is hit or miss, with some really excellent dishes (pork chops) to some real stinkers (shepherd's pie, french toast). That's the risk of a menu larger than most children's books. Best not to think of how they keep all their ingredients fresh. Star down because who the hell puts ads in their menu?"
Samuel K.,"Missouri City, TX",515,195,43,4.0,7/18/2011,"i go when there's not many other place's to go. i think i'm spoiled because we have one that is so close.  but when you need to eat out late and there aren't many other options beside fast food this place is always a great default. love their sweet corn tamales cakes. best thing on the menu in my opinion.  salads are HUGE and quite delicious.  i don't ever go during busy hours.   the bread is pretty good as well.  free, warm and healthy. can't go wrong with that. service is usually good."
Mark G.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,2/3/2013,"Aside from the surly waiter, the 45 min delay for our food to arrive after ordering, and the lukewarm omelette and dry hamburger that were finally delivered to us, there's not much to say about our final visit to The Cheesecake Factory. When I asked the waiter to explain the delay, he enlightened me with a brief comment: ""it's the kitchen"". Ah, I see... you're busy with your half-empty restaurant. Well, we won't trouble you further."
Linh N.,"Houston, TX",227,268,1007,3.0,8/11/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of those places I never thought I'd ever step foot in. I usually abhor restaurants that attach ""factory"" or ""company"", or even worse ""shoppe"" to their name. It usually announces ""mediocre chain"" to me.  I found myself at the Cheesecake Factory because I happened to be in the 'burbs, visiting my mom and brother that day. Brother and I wanted gelato, but couldn't find Paciugo in the retail labyrinth that is First Colony Mall.  I'd never been to this insane mecca of retail strip mall, plus an actual mall with Macy's and such nestled in the center. We were going in circles and getting hungry and cranky, so we parked it and in we went. It was about 2, so the lunch crowd had abated, but even if there was a lunch crowd, this gigantic space could handle it and still have room to spare.  We were led to a booth, given our menus, advised the lunch specials were still on, and given water, without lemon, thank you.  My brother orders the lunch version of fish and chips. It was huge. 4 pieces of beer battered cod on a bed of fries and a side of cole slaw.  My mom and I split a dinner portion of a pasta and shrimp dish. It was also a generous portion, with enough to split between me and mom and then some for lunch for me the day after.  The pasta was regular ol' spaghetti with a garlicky cream sauce, some greens and red pepper mixed in for color. It was pretty good.  Of course, being at the Cheesecake Factory, it would be a shame not to try the desserts, so we ordered a pineapple upside-down cheesecake (for me and mom to share) and my brother ordered a banana cream cheesecake and a dulce de leche, because he wanted to sample both. All pretty good, decent. Nothing mind-blowing.  So overall, an A-OK experience, pretty good, but nothing spectacular. Will work in a pinch if you're lost and hungry."
Victoria Y.,"Austin, TX",0,11,,1.0,1/3/2016,"Decided to buy a few sides and dessert from here as supplement for a small dinner gathering for my cousin's going away. Unfortunately, the pick-up experience was tarnished by corrupt staff here. While I was here, I was treated rather brusquely, and talked about (between the waiters) right in front of me. I redeemed a free slice of cheesecake coupon, used a gift card and paid the rest with cash, and unfortunately, was short changed $10!!! I double checked my wallet before exiting the store to make sure I was not imagining this. My cousin, who I was getting the items for, was with me, so I did not want to make a scene. But seriously, if you pay with cash here, best to double check the numbers. A chunk of it may be missing for their own personal gains. In addition, the receipt I asked for before leaving, was a pre-printed receipt that only showed me the total owed. NOTHING to document the transaction (coupon, gift card, cash, etc). If I had gone alone and had some extra time, I would have needed to bring this to a manager's attention. Cheesecake Factory is usually a nicer place to dine. Just watch out for your wallet at this location!!"
Hande J.,"Houston, TX",29,164,61,3.0,5/6/2013,"I have not been to a Cheesecake Factory in a long time. Our guest visiting from Europe wanted to go here so we did. Service was good, friendly and spot on. I think the food is expensive for the quality. My salmon dish was good but nothing special. I think the flat bread was also tasty but pretty small in my opinion for an appetizer. My favourite was the soup! Soup of the day was chicken vegetable soup with tortilla crisps. It hit the spot since I had a cold. Other than the soup, I would not crave anything from this place."
Emily M.,"Stafford, TX",0,56,,1.0,10/5/2012,"My fiancé and I love their cheesecakes! We have been, on several occasions, just to order dessert and coffee. Recently we did so and let me tell you, or waiter was unhappy! Even though the bill was still around $20 he was very bitter throughout our whole date. When he brought us water, he slammed down the plastic mugs causing water to slosh all over the table and leaving us to sop it up with our napkins. After bringing out our cheesecake, he took his sweet time bringing the check. We waited with our plate empty and pushed to the edge of the table for 15min before he finally came to check on us. I am sorry we didn't order drinks, an appetizer, two entrees, and then dessert and coffee, but it wasn't like the bill was $5. It was around $20 and we had planned to leave a good tip. Kind of aggravating and definitely not a good experience."
Shaz B.,"Houston, TX",131,196,56,2.0,7/19/2010,"A big no-no. Despite its extensive selection in food and cheesecakes, I have been disappointed time and time again. In fact, the only great thing about this place is its amazing decor and even that's not enough for me to give this place a better rating. Although the presentation of the food and the service is usually good, it is not consistent with the horrible taste. I've had to come here on several occasions, but never would I pick this place to dine at. There have been two menu items in particular that I have been introduced to and been quite disappointed with. First one being the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic and the second one being stuffed chicken tortillas. The farfalle had been an okay dish for quite a while and had been my regular order until I learned that they serve it with small pieces of bacon. Since I do not eat bacon, I wasn't very pleased to learn that the fact that the dish came with bacon was not even stated in the menu. How can the menu not list such a thing? The stuffed chicken tortillas were absolutely horrible and tasted bitter and soggy, which was my absolute breaking point from this restaurant. I've ordered cheesecake for various occasions from here many times and they've normally been great about having my order ready on time. Unfortunately, the efficiency changed the last time I placed an order. I called first thing in the morning to have my order ready about an hour before they closed (I wanted it for a midnight surprise). By the time I got there that night, they told me that they had no record of my order. That was a very frustrating thing to hear two hours before midnight and i had to speak to the manager who then went ahead and gave me a whole ready-to-serve sliced up cheesecake for regular price (it was a larger size). That was nice was him, but the cake came completely plain with absolutely no toppings and it was completely sliced up, which means it wasn't really able to be cut during a birthday. All in all, the cheesecakes are great and the decor is awesome, but the food is terrible. It's definitely the below average version of its sister restaurant, Grand Lux Cafe, and I will not be coming here again."
Richard A.,"Houston, TX",30,60,4,4.0,6/10/2013,"Have not been here in a LONG time, never this location. We had the Wontons for a starter and then Fish Tacos and a Santa Fe salad for entrees. The wontons were pretty tasty and the fish tacos were pretty average however the Santa Fe salad was GREAT! Very large portion and a decent price. Inside decor was very nice and clean and the service was great. I will definetly be back."
LaMark B.,"Sugar Land, TX",19,13,7,4.0,10/26/2013,I have always had good experiences at this location. The atmosphere is usually good. Service is very attentive.  Just beware that it gets very busy on Friday and Saturday Evenings! But the longest we've had to wait is about 20 mins tops
Michael E.,"Sugar Land, TX",48,194,8,2.0,6/20/2010,"I've been to this location a handful of times and have tried many different things, however, I have never left satisfied. Recently, a friend was having his birthday party here so I couldn't avoid coming here. After being seated, I was given a menu and I carefully looked over all the offerings. I opted to go for a sandwich and decided I'd go with the Cuban.  The restaurant is well decorated with many intricate designs and judging by looks, looks like a nice place to dine. Being seated outside, there wasn't much to see but the weather wasn't bad so things were going pretty smoothly. The staff was very attentive and refilled my water before my glass was empty. The food didn't take long to arrive for me but it was a large group so everything was coming in slower than usual. When my sandwich finally arrived, I thought it didn't look too bad, however, I did notice that some of the meat in my sandwich were cut too thick. The fries were crispy and golden and tasted like fries should. My sandwich wasn't the best Cuban I had, but after picking out the meats that were cut too thick, it wasn't as bad. Overall, while this may appear to be a nice restaurant, the food is constantly underwhelming and I don't see myself coming here any time soon. I wish it didn't have to be this way but after multiple visits, that's just the way it is."
Nicola S.,"Missouri City, TX",596,104,37,5.0,7/20/2014,cheesecake is always good and the chicken bellagio.... thank me later. its sooooo good
Michael G.,"Missouri City, TX",1,3,,5.0,1/10/2014,"Great Like always, food was great! Went with my wife and we shared the Orange Chicken because it is a huge serving. The staff was quick and friendly. The fact that I still remember the waiters name means something! Great time and ended up spending less than 50 bucks for my wife and I to have dinner, dessert and a couple drinks! Will be a usual place for dinner now"
Sherry C.,"Houston, TX",90,231,148,3.0,8/23/2010,After several visits here is the breakdown: Pros: -Huge portions (enough for 2 people or enough for leftover meal) -Yummy desserts (again HUGE) -Bread is warm and full of flavor -Buffalo wings are AMAZING! -Overall everything is good- not great. Cons:  -Drinks are TOO sweet -Service is SLOW -Nothing is authentic Cheesecake Factory is your usual standard chain restaurant. Nothing I dream about but it is fun to stop by with the kiddos for sharing meals and yummy desserts.
Melanie B.,"Houston, TX",51,96,19,4.0,10/13/2012,I love The Cheesecake Factory!  Great food (especially the cheesecake!) and great service every time.  The only downside is that the food is a little bit overpriced.
Oanh L.,"Richmond, TX",28,185,247,4.0,1/4/2012,"I love shopping & I love the fact that there's one of these located at most malls. My mother and I usually go shopping every Friday and have lunch. Our favorite place to eat is The Cheesecake Factory. We love eating here for a few various reason... 1.) The customer service. No matter how much we order or how little we eat, we always get the same customer service from various waiter/waitress. 2.) The patio seating is awesome! Whenever weather permits, my mother & I enjoy our lunch outside. It's a lot colder inside than outside during Spring or Fall season; patio dinning is the better choice. 3.) The interior design is simply gorgeous! It has an Egyptian look. The pillars, color, and seating nicely play together. 4.) THE FOOD! Some very delicious dishes...and the portion is huge!"
Nick R.,"Fresno, TX",10,129,3,2.0,4/26/2012,"We are here last week - not very good. We ate a late lunch, we had bang bang chicken (lol-title might not be totally correct but close enough) and my other half had shrimp gumbo. Also, had Tiramisu cake - which was the best part of the meal. Oh yea, had something called berry icicle - something like that, it was good but price has gone-up on that item used to be much cheaper now its $10 and it is not a big glass considering 1/3 of it is whip cream. Overall this was not a good experience, the food tasted bland and way to sweet. The service was ok, not bad just a bit of drama going on with wait staff. The location (Sugarland) was not busy at all. We have been to this location before but for some reason it tasted better last time. There are tons of items to order from the menu - next time the maderi chicken here its supposed to be pretty good?"
Alan P.,"Sugar Land, TX",6,58,1,1.0,1/16/2011,"not good. ordered garlic noodles and they had no taste whatsoever. I had to call the waiter and tell him to put a lot of parmesian on it. Really sux. I dont cook but im pretty sure if i went to kroger and bought straight up noodles and added random sht i could make a better dish than what I had here. I went here with a group and nobody else seemed to like their entrees either. They have like a hundred entrees based from all over the world, but probably not a single one is perfected, nor half-assed given the effort.  And the food is expensive. The only thing nice about this place is the how the restaurant looks: Real luxurious and inviting. It's a shame. Also, I've heard from a lot of sources that the real beef of this restaurant is actually the desserts they serve. Since I haven't tried it nor will I ever (since I don't eat an ounce of dessert, ever) it's all heresy to me, so enter desserts at your own risk! I give Cheesecake Factory a D-"
Jourdan V.,"Sugar Land, TX",14,143,2,3.0,11/3/2011,I like this place its ok. The Double German Chocolate Cheese Cake is out of this world delicious. Service is ok at best.
