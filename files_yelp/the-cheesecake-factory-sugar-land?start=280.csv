Jennifer H.,"Houston, TX",110,82,9,4.0,6/25/2012,"I have to say, its been a long time since I have been here, but once I sat down it all came back to me. I love love love the CF for its great drinks (even as pricey as they are) and huge array of food. I went this weekend with my friend that came in town, and we were immediately seated, that was a first. I saw my old pal, the Strawberry Martini, on the menu and it was a must have! It was theeee best! Just like I remembered it. Our waiter was super cute, however, as the evening unfolded we realized he didn't have good communication skills and the conversation just kept going in circles, weird! But the food was awesome, more yummy goodies on the menu than I remember. It took like 30 min. just to decide what I wanted, meanwhile crazy waiter dude asked us about 10 times if we were ready to order. GIVE ME A MINUTE! I guess he took that literally, lol. I will be back."
Kelly S.,"Houston, TX",0,12,,2.0,8/2/2014,"Extremely slow service and very mediocre ""original"" cheesecake. Our waiter spent a lot of time flirting with a young woman who was eating alone, but seemed like he didn't have time for us. Sorry we bothered you -- we'll go elsewhere."
Deborah M.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,11,,1.0,7/30/2014,"Ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp...very bland.  It use to be good.  The salad was not right, as it use to be.  Service poor.  Cheesecake was good."
Jonathan R.,"Pearland, TX",76,62,44,2.0,7/16/2011,No one was there to greet us at the door. After we were eventually seated the waitress didn't show up for over 10 minutes. Food is disappointing for the price. The overall experience was less than what I hoped for. I do not reccommend.
Alan S.,"Houston, TX",657,1413,293,4.0,5/18/2009,"I've gone here twice now... both times were pleasant, but nothing to write home about.  The portions are a good size, so worth the price.  However, the prices are about 10% higher than other similar restaurants.   The upside is that you can split something with a friend for lunch pretty easily.  The mashed potatoes are great... the other sides... not so much.  For whatever reason this location seems to give you a little less food then the galleria one does... perhaps it's the economy being that I haven't been to the galleria once in a few months.  I went on a Sunday at 730 and there was no wait which was nice.  The waitress was very nice and on the ball.  I've yet to be disappointed here.  Cheesecake is good... but $7 a slice is more then I am generally willing to spend."
Diane C.,"Sugar Land, TX",4,7,1,1.0,8/12/2011,"The last two times we went were very disappointing.  We waited what seems like forever to get our food and when we did, our order was incorrect, so we had to wait again.  No apologies were offered from our wait staff for the delays.  The last time we went, was on a Sunday morning for breakfast.  The place was not busy at all and there were plenty of wait staff waiting around.  Again we had to sit and wait, only this time no one came to take our order.  I asked a waitress if she could help us and she said she would look for our waitress.   She was unable to locate her and at this time we ended up waiting 30 minutes. Frustrated, my husband asked for the manager which again we had to wait for another five minutes.  I guess customer service is not a priority to this establishment."
Justin H.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,10,,3.0,10/18/2012,"I'm honestly torn on what star rating to give this place.  I went here with my wife for dinner on a Friday night.  The service was very slow, and my wife's meal tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for way too long, but my burger was extremely tasty and I really liked it!  The cheesecake I got was really good too, but then the cheesecake my wife got was definitely sub par.  I guess I'll just give them a 3 since it was a bit hit or miss.  It's not the first time we've been there, and generally speaking we like the place, but I don't know that we'll be going back any time too soon either."
Cocoa E.,"Fresno, TX",0,10,,1.0,4/24/2013,"I use to love this place when it first opened, but I guess over the past 4-5 years the service has really gone downward! I went to lunch with my mom and my food was excellent but my mother's plate was not so great. She had chicken fingers and they were salty and stale. The waiter who served us was very nonchalant and rude. I personally felt like she was rushing us to just ""get our food and go!"" She wasn't very attentive either and I felt very uncomfortable while I was there. The manager just so happened to pass by and I called him over to inform him of the rush service and nonchalant attitude of the waiter. He didn't seem to care either way and some how offered us some free cheesecake and insisted we stay as long as we liked. Well the same waiter brought out our cheesecake...in ""to go"" boxes! My mother and I looked at each other like ""ummm....we wanted to stay and eat this here!"" She apologized and said the manager said it was to go. SMH Lack of communication and just plain rude....I told her to bring me the check because I was totally done with this place and it's horrible service. The manager came back over again and apologized, but it was basically like beating a dead horse. He insisted we stay and get some coffee or whatever, but at that point there was no salvaging that horrible experience. I left my nasty cheesecake slice and we left. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you are getting your food to go!"
James L.,"Sugar Land, TX",5,15,4,1.0,1/7/2012,"Terrible service at the Cheese Cake in Sugarland. We sat for 10-15 minutes, was never greeted by a server and had to wave one down for water and bread. The server never checked up.  Food was terrible, over spiced and seasoned. This is very unusual for CC, we've always had good food and great service at the Houston, San Francisco, and San Mateo locations. Anyone considering Cheese Cake in Sugarland should just go to Denny's - better service and comparable food quality. -JL"
John Z.,"Sugar Land, TX",6,74,2,3.0,11/28/2008,"I have eaten here more times than I can count.  If we can't think of anywhere else to go, we usually go here as their menu is huge and has something for everyone. The food quality and service are somewhat variable.  Some days the food and service are fantastic, other days, the same dish can be just fair at best.  If you like Cheesecake Factory, you will like it (if you are on a chefs good day). My favorite dishes are the Miso Salmon and the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas. Downgraded from 4 to 3 stars. Food has been off more than on the past few months."
chris c.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,5.0,5/30/2012,"The first colony cheesecake is my favorite restaurant in Houston, I have never been disappointed at this restaurant. It is the perfect balance of everything and is a great value. The food is always perfect or they will take it back and make it perfect with little or no questions. Same with the drinks, if anything is not what you expected they will fix it.  The service here is very good and consistent, although it seems they hire new servers all the time. The aesthetics of the restaurant are pretty decadent in my opinion, it is very well decorated and the lighting is not too dark or too bright. The booths have high walls so even when the place is busy it still feels like you have a good amount of privacy, you don't have to worry about making awkward eye contact with the people at the next booth or having them listen to your conversation.  Overall this restaurant is one of the best places in Houston."
Colby H.,"Richmond, TX",30,14,38,2.0,1/12/2013,"The food is pretty good - My wife and I are pretty predictable here usually getting the same dish each time. I get the crispy chicken costoletta and it comes with asparagus and mashed potatoes. The chicken is cut in in 3 thinly sliced battered and it sits on some sort of a lemon butter sauce that is so good! For the first time last week I asked for an extra bowl of the sauce and was in heaven dipping the chicken and side in it. My wife gets the salmon and she can't say enough good things about it - I'm not a big fish eater so I can't comment on it personally. We had our boys with us and the younger one isn't eating solid foods yet but for our two year old we always get the kids cheese pizza and it's pretty tasty. Now to talk about the 2 stars I gave, because you are probably scratching your head why I gave them after saying all good things about the food. Plain and simple the service has a lot of room for improvement. First after seating it took forever for a waiter to come by and say hello and get our drink orders (5-10 minutes after sitting down). We both ordered ice tea and we asked for milk for our oldest and we went ahead and told the waiter we wanted to order then. It took about another 5 minutes to get the tea and the extra beer I ordered, which is fine, but they did not bring the milk and that took about another 5-10 minutes to arrive. Luckily they brought the pizza out first but the milk still hadn't arrived which was annoying. When the tea was dropped off they did not have any sugar packets on the table (of any sort) and we had to ask the waiter 2-3 times for them and that is when we could get his attention. I almost got up and went to their waiter station and got one myself.  I can't say I won't go back to the Cheesecake Factory because the food is great but it will probably be the Memorial City or Galleria location because this is not the first time the service here has be sub-par"
Brittany D.,"Fresno, TX",0,3,,1.0,3/7/2015,"My family and I went to the Cheese Cake Factory (Sugar Land) for dinner tonight. The food was ok. I had the Southern Fried Catfish. We waited 30 minutes to be seated. I have been to this location several times. On Saturdays they have a high volume of customers. Management needs to work on customer flow during peak hours. Our waitress was really nice. She did a good job! I'm giving them 1 star because the food was good and our waitress was sweet. However, when we were seated we were sat at a small table. I had my 8 month old son with me in his car seat. The waitress gave us a high chair for him to seat in. The table was so small we didn't have any room for the car seat. The manager passed by and told us she would take the carseat to the front desk. After we ate we could pick it up on the way out. After dinner my husband went to pick it up and it was missing and the front desk staff had know idea where it was. My husband eventually found the carseat & blanket up side down on the floor at the front. I feel the manager should have told the girls at the front where the car seat was."
Sugar L.,"Houston, TX",0,28,53,3.0,12/29/2010,"Dined here recently for a special event with a friend and  we both ordered the  Louisiana Pasta Chicken. The dish was very tasty and did not take long for us to get our food. Please note that even the ""lunch portion"" was huge. We were brought out bread and butter and  that certainly complemented our meal. It was someone's birthday and so a complimentary sundae was given and several servers came to sing Happy Birthday.  Also, the Tuxedo cheesecake is always a good bet for me. If you like chocolate and cheesecake, this is a good choice. We had a good time and our server was very nice. I tend to bring out-of-towners here because it is a fairly new, grand building and the parking is ample. Too, what beats a mall right next door!"
Ski Bunny H.,"Sugar Land, TX",5,92,63,3.0,2/16/2013,hadnt gone there in a while so decided to go again..they shrunk their lunch pasta sizes...and it didnt taste the same...service was good..bread was good...meh...
Jennifer A.,"Richmond, TX",0,1,,1.0,11/1/2012,"Went to Sugar Land Cheesecake Factory a couple of weeks ago.  When I received the tab, I added a generous 25% tip.  When I received my VISA bill, the total was more than the amount that I spent.  It appears that the waitress had increased her tip on my VISA after I had left the restaurant.  I called VISA and they reversed the additional charge and so the restaurant will not receive these monies.  I suspect the restaurant will retrieve their money from the waitress if she is still an employee.  I will not be eating at another Cheesecake Factory because of one dishonest and deceiving waitress."
Alex R.,"Bellevue, WA",161,220,36,1.0,2/19/2009,"OOOOH NOOOOOOO! Please stay away, I don't understand why people go here.  The food is not that great, way over priced and the service is so bad my dog could do better.  DId i mention the food is not good? I could make that food at home for a fraction of the price.   They don't even make their cheesecake their, its shipped.  This place does not float my boat at all and I would suggest walking right past it and eating at the food court in the mall instead."
Vaughn O.,"Richmond, TX",22,210,32,3.0,9/23/2011,"Only my second time here, and I know the food is normally good. I wasn't too pleased this time though. I had the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, which was passably good but not nearly as spicy as a true Jamaican dish would have been. I probably should have known better though. My wife had the Cajun Chicken Littles. She should have known better too. These were no more than glorified chicken fingers, and tasteless to boot. My son had the White Chicken Chili. He loved it, and he devoured the remainder of my dish as well after I'd eaten enough to just give up.  It also didn't help that the server was unavailable.  We had to track her down and ask for everything.  She passed by our table several times but not once did she stop to ask if we needed anything. I'll definitely be back cause I know the place will redeem itself. 3 stars but just for this visit. This restaurant is still pretty good overall. And um...the desserts are always good."
Denise R.,"Richmond, TX",0,44,21,5.0,4/28/2011,"I have read some of the reviews on this site....and WOW!!  There are certainly some food snobs in the 'burbs of Houston!!  hahahaha!!!!  Every time I have come here, the food has been delicious, the servers are attentive and the ambiance spectacular!  The Red Velvet Cheesecake is TO DIE FOR!!!!  DEELISHUS!!!  (I know, I know....delicious!).  People, really....stop complaining, if you want to spend 2 or 3x the money for snobbery....go down the road to Perry's......that will give me a less wait time at The Cheesecake Factory!"
Diana C.,"Palo Alto, CA",313,231,32,3.0,6/10/2008,"This place is a few forks short of the Cheesecake Factory standard, I would say.  The decor is standard Cheesecake Factory issue - elegant, stylish, and inviting.  The food though did not meet my expectations for the Cheesecake Factory.  In particular, my favorite dish on the menu - the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - came out with barely any sauce to coat the pasta.  The pasta tasted bland and looked as if it'd been sitting in the plate for awhile since the pasta had been boiled.  Ick.  The rest of the dishes that came out tasted alright, but the flavors failed to leave much of an impression on me.  My brother's meatloaf was juicy and tender, and it came in four giant slices.  Huge portions a la Cheesecake Factory.  Everyone ended up with doggy bags at the end of the night.  When I ventured to eat mine the next day for lunch, I was totally turned off by the fact that the rest of my pasta appeared to be swimming in a pool of oil!  Yeah, eww.  They must use a full cup of oil for every dish they make or something.  Jeebus. Anyway, nothing too special, but if you want to have a nice dinner out without completely breaking the piggy bank, this might be a good option.  If I were you, and you were taking your date out, split an appetizer, main entree, and cheesecake; otherwise, there's no way you'd be able to touch your cheesecake at the end - you'd be overly stuffed.  :-)"
