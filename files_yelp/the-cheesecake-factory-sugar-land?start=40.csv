Ebonie M.,"Galleria/Uptown, Houston, TX",223,203,1407,4.0,7/9/2016,"I commenced my day with a few hours of shopping and laughter with my bestie. We decided to have lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. We walked straight to the bar and ordered an apple martini. I haven't found a place yet that can compete with their apple martinis. The jolly ranch flavor is so pronounce.  I can never have just one. To top it off, our favorite bartender Kimberly was on duty! I had a very light lunch. I ordered soup and salad. The potato soup was delicious. The side salad was just okay. The vinaigrette dressing wasn't good. However, the lettuce and tomatoes were very fresh. We also had the crab bites as an appetizer. They were deep fried and served with a chipotle mayo. They were so flavorful, I didn't use the mayo."
Diana N.,"Richmond, TX",90,109,158,4.0,3/27/2017,"I love pasta, their chicken Madeira, and cheesecake so I come here sometimes (actually rarely), but I don't love the service, the loud environment, and cramped 2-people tables. Service is especially slow if you have a large group, although this place physically fits a big group well, and there's something on the menu for everyone (it's like a novel). Even getting a refill on bread can take awhile. This time I walked right into the restaurant to meet up the rest of my party without the hostess even greeting me; she didn't even look up from her hostess stand at all actually. For appetizers, the calamari here is consistently good. Hot and crispy with good dipping sauces. The avocado egg rolls were good too.  I ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta for the first time. It was humungo of course, and the linguine tasted good. Id say it could've been cooked maybe a minute less though since the pasta was more soft than I prefer (especially when reheating the leftovers). The chicken was a little bland (needed some salt or seasoning), but at least it wasn't dry. The shrimp had more flavor but was a little tough/ overcooked. There was a good amount of protein to carb ratio at least, which I'm always looking for. I ate this meal on 3 different occasions bc it's so much food. I hardly get to eat pasta (macros) so I still enjoyed the jambalaya flavor of the noodles which were just a tad spicy (says very spicy on the menu). Husband got the usual chicken Madeira, which is always good. The mashed potatoes are so buttery and smooth. His mother's farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic tasted more bland than usual, even for a more subtle dish/flavor profile in general? Brother in law ordered his usual Louisiana chicken pasta, which I didn't hear any complaints about. Other dishes we've ordered in the past that id recommend include the Thai lettuce wraps (which are enough for a meal), pasta da vinci, and the steak Diane and chicken Madeira combo (although I prefer just the chicken more than the steak).  Also we ordered an original cheesecake slice to share between my husband and I. Ive never had a bad flavor here (but I looove dessert! Esp chocolate), but my husband's go to is the original. So good, light, sweet, but not too rich. Mmm. Worth it (the $ and calories)!"
Monica T.,"Houston, TX",0,7,,5.0,5/10/2017,"We went here for my graduation dinner.  Ours was a party of twelve, 4 were children aged 10 and under. We were seated promptly, had our drink orders taken and delivered in a timely fashion. Same holds true for our appetizers, dinners, and desserts.  Our server was Thomas, and he was AMAZING. He was well-versed in the menu, patient with our group, and even read back orders for clarification when necessary.  The food was tasty, as usual. Its always neat to hear the conversation stop when the food is served and every one becomes so entranced by their dish. :)"
Allen T.,"Sugar Land, TX",2072,292,2541,1.0,5/30/2016,"Last night my family and I were looking for a place to have a late dinner where we've had good service and good food in the past and the Cheesecake Factory came to mind.  Now granted it has been quite a while since we've been out here but in the past we've always been fairly happy with this location.  Last night was a disaster though. I'm not sure what happened to this place but service and smiles were definitely lacking and the staff seemed more interested in socializing among themselves than projecting general warmth and service to their patrons, namely us!   I kind of sensed something was awry when I walked in and the hostess was busy engaged in some kind of banter with her coworker at the front. Without making eye contact or smiling at me as had been typical in the past, her body language and attitude indicated to me an elitist kind of attitude.  It seemed they wanted to shove us in the worst booth in the place even though the restaurant was relatively slow and the middle section with better views of the interior were quite open!   The guy who walked us over there seemed tired or totally disinterested in us.  Zero smile or energy at all. He mumbled something like your server will be with you shortly and left.  As we sat there I'm thinking we got the worst booth in the house and the worst attitude. After what seemed like a long time, I looked up waiting for this so called server and nobody approached us and nobody even asked if we needed water or drinks!   I'm sitting here trying to make eye contact with someone to come help us and the hostess walks right by us and it looked and felt like she deliberately wanted to avoid us!  At that point I was starving and highly annoyed and gathered my family and said let's leave.  As I was walking out the hostess who initially helped us didn't even seemed like she cared and kind of shrugged her shoulders.  I glared at her and asked if I could speak to the manager and asked who he was and she barked something like he's the guy over there with the tie,  almost rolling her eyes.  My wife and kids had already exited the restaurant and I starting getting the manager's attention and he approached me. His name was Matt and he told me he, yes was the manager. I was a bit upset and he could tell and in fairness to him he tried to ""make it right"" but at that point after being treated the way we were treated, did not ever want to come back here again!   I have been coming here for years but last night the service and smiles and attitude were sorely lacking and downright rude! Matt had said he had only been there for 3 months and maybe that's what the problem was. Maybe he can fix it. Maybe not but in my opinion this place has gone way downhill.... Nice and pretty inside but the worst attitudes and service I have experienced in a long while. I rarely give one star reviews. Maybe this is my only one but after last night this place for sure deserved it! We've always loved the food at the Cheesecake Factory. I used to work in the Galleria area and discovered this chain many many moons ago but this was the absolute worst experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory.  Maybe Matt the manager was sent there to fix the problems. Hopefully he can but as far as my family and I we've been treated much better in many other less ""showy"" places.  We won't be back Customer service is a big part of the experience and last night it was the worst I've had in recent memory..."
Demetrius S.,"Missouri City, TX",289,1,,1.0,11/29/2016,"Chicken potstickers the easiest thing of all came out last, extra salty; orange chicken sauce was suspect came out late, but came out cold. Ordered chicken nachos, no chicken came on them. No bread was offered. Server told us it's the end of the night so that's why, I asked if we were getting an ""end of the night discount"". Smh. Ordered hot chocolate it came out luke warm. Everytime we mentioned something to the waitress she ignored it and wouldnt respond. The ""manager"" melody offered ZERO help and madw it quite obvious why the server was indifferent to the poor service and representation, because her service was poor also. This is becoming a normal here. Dr. DJS"
Anita C.,"Pearland, TX",26,34,8,2.0,6/4/2017,"Pros: the food tasted good. The decor looks good. Cons: the waiting line was long. I understand our server was busy. Even though she's friendly, the service was slow. Nobody greeted us for twenty minutes after we sat down. The silverware was set right on the surface of the table, which was kind of gross. The floor was very greasy and slippery. My husband said he expected that in a Denny's maybe , but not in a restaurant like Cheesecake Factory. 30 minutes after we left, I realized I left my credit card there. I called them, but I was on hold for about 15 minutes. I decided to go back to the restaurant to check. I was standing at the hostess' table. The hostess was on the phone. I waited patiently. When she was done, she just looked at me, ignored me, and turned around talking to someone else. She didn't even give me an acknowledgement. I was worried about my credit card, so I asked another server. He was way more helpful. He found the manager and I got my card back.  Conclusion: the food was good but pricy (for what you pay for). I was not impressed with the overall experience. I do not recommend Cheesecake Factory."
Amanda D.,"Missouri City, TX",226,3,6,4.0,4/1/2017,I came in pretty late with a friend but we were treated great from start to finish. The crab and artichoke dip it's self was good but the bread it came with was bland. I got the Louisiana Pasta and it was delightful. Portion was huge and the flavors mixed well.
Champagne J.,"Missouri City, TX",0,3,2,1.0,6/18/2017,"The place is not clean. The floors were gross, not sure if they believe in a broom and dust pan during service.  They did not wipe down the booth seats, And it took forever before a server greeted us for drinks."
Jesus G.,"Richmond, TX",0,6,1,1.0,10/29/2017,"I know this review won't change a thing, but I'll let it be known anyway. I asked for a table for a party of eight at 6 pm and I was told the wait time was 45 minutes. it's understandable that the venue was very busy due to the Halloween activity in town center, however at 7:30 pm we were yet to be seated. When I asked what was going on with our table, I was told a different party had an issue with their table so they gave our table to the other party, and they tried to stick us in a table outside. It would have been nice to know that our wait time was extended since we were waiting outside in the cold weather. All we got from the manager was a simple ""I'm sorry"". He did absolutely nothing to fix the issue or seat us quickly. As I talked to the manager all I got was a head nod and a bad attitude. He as a manager looked very young, inexperienced and had no idea how to handle the situation. I honestly felt like I was talking with my teenage son. Not to mention the terribly slow young man who was fixing our table. The venue was full and that bus boy was was sitting down as he wiped the table slower than dripping molasses. After we were seated, a whole ten minutes went by before anyone took our drink order. We ended up leaving hungry, and upset. I have never been to such a terribly unorganized restaurant led by a completely useless, garbage manager."
Christopher V.,"Houston, TX",0,14,16,3.0,7/23/2017,"Service was good, food on the other hand was so so , had the mac and cheese burger , it was meh, got my salad but kitchen forgot to put apples in my salad that should had come wit it , all good mistakes happens"
Rick G.,"Houston, TX",6,2,,1.0,7/8/2017,"We had to wait a long time from getting water to getting the check. My wife ordered the burrito and the chicken was burnt black. A manager came to our table and it was reordered. Long wait for it. We had to leave before we got it, over20 minutes.My chicken & biscuits had only a little gravy. Had to ask for more.  Waiter rarely checked on us. Terrible experience at this location. There are so many places to eat in Houston. We don't have to eat here and we won't."
M. W.,"League City, TX",36,82,10,2.0,10/10/2016,"I do not see the attraction for the Cheesecake Factory. Four people, no alcohol, one appetizer, 4 entrées and 2 pieces of cheesecake = $107.50 before tip! What the hell? I had the bacon bacon cheeseburger with fries. It was good but not $17.50 good. The wife had a parmesan chicken dish with bacon mash potatoes and undercooked broccoli. Daughter ordered a salad and sandwich combination. She said it was very good. The son ordered a chicken specialty entree that was wrong from what he ordered. We were all finished by the time he got his and it was basically tough soggy chicken with raw green beans. Terrible. The waitress got the drinks wrong also. It took forever to get our cheesecake and the check. The cheesecake was excellent though. Sad experience."
Rachel X.,"Houston, TX",356,189,450,5.0,9/8/2015,"I have been here at least a dozen times. It's a safe choice when you can't think of anywhere to go. It's casual, yet nice.  The menu is humongous, such a wide selection sure to satisfy everyone in the party. Favorite appetizer - sweet corn tamale cakes Favorite salad - from their skinnylicious menu, they are less calories but HUGE and filling  Favorite dinner entree - fish tacos Favorite dessert - all their cheesecakes are great, depending on what flavors you are drawn to! Service - we have always had pleasant experiences here. There was a little bit of mistake in our entree today, the manager took it off the bill immediately and offered us a free giant piece of cheesecake, how nice! Ambiance - looks like a fancy restaurant, but the price is very reasonable"
Matthew S.,"Bedford, TX",96,199,50,5.0,3/31/2016,"I have always wanted to go to the Cheesecake factory, so imagine my surprise when I moved down here and there was one just down the street from me.  First cheesecake I had was a salted caramel one, it was so big and scrumptious that I ate it right outside the shop. My cousin and her husband took me there another time to have dinner. We had an amazing server that knew the menu enough to recommend food to us. It was very expensive, so it's more of a special occasion type of place, but so worth it. The food was delicious, warm, and every time I've gone in there, the people there have been friendly. You won't find any complaints from me here"
Tish P.,"Houston, TX",907,408,1021,2.0,4/28/2015,"Worst CF I've ever had the non-pleasure of dining... Seated and server acted like our table was the last one he wanted to wait on.  Got my sister's order wrong...he didn't just get it wrong, he chose FOR HER instead of clarifying which option she wanted.  I wasn't paying attention but being that she doesn't eat shrimp, I'm more than certain she said she wanted fish tacos.  He brought her shrimp and she bout died lol not a problem, he took them back. I ordered my staple, lemon herb roasted chicken.  That was the smallest, and overcooked half a chicken I've seen EVER in the history of my many, MANY years ordering this at TCF.  I immediately raised the flag and the mgr came over.  Of course, I got her to agree the chicken was smaller than normal and she agreed to bring me some more.  Only problem is, it took 30 minutes to get it and it wasn't even cooked right.  No lemon flavor...just some old plain roasted chicken with a touch of herbs.  I will say it definitely looked more like a full grown chicken and not that freshly hatched out of the egg one I got previously. I guess waiter dude is mad now, he just brings me the check.  Hmmm excuse you sir, but who the hell doesn't ask if you want dessert at the damn CHEESECAKE factory?  #WTDTA? Apparently Sugar Land!  If you don't bring me my damn kahlua cocoa coffee and my sister's oreo dream, there's gon be trouble, trouble up in this piece.   Bout then, I was done...I'll never venture back to this location #pass"
Yvette P.,"Corpus Christi, TX",1,19,3,1.0,6/23/2017,Hostess needs to remember she's at Cheesecake Factory and not at Mc Donald's (show a little more enthusiasm) not friendly at all. I take that back I have been greeted better at McDonalds. Noticed the restaurant was really bare and that made me happy thinking we would get quick service and good food. Service was very slow and you could tell food was sitting under lamp for a long time. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce. By the time I got my sandwich my sauce had dried up into my chicken and dried and crusted on my plate. I wish I had taken a picture. I don't think I will be back.
Lunch O.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,2/26/2017,"What's up with the service. I had to walkout! When asked for high chair for the car seat, the waiter tells me to use extra seat space . I told him it won't fit, he said keep it sideways. On my way out I talked to the manager, he said they have high chair not sure why they didn't give. I've asked him go figure and reply to my review on Yelp. I look forward to hearing from him on what he would do so that it doesn't happen again with other parents with an infant."
Adam A.,"Eastex/Jensen, Houston, TX",0,4,,1.0,6/10/2017,"Worst. Service . Ever . Came Saturday evening at 930 pm, surprisingly  it was not busy and now I know why! These other reviews must be scaring away customers ! Started by coming in and they tried to sit us 4 in the smallest booth possible even though there were PLENTY OF TABLES OPEN AROUND. Waiting 15 more min for another small table we decided to sit.  Been here for over an hour as I write this finally canceling our order. The FREE bread sticks came out 45 min after seating . While the entree is no where to be found . As I told them to cancel my order after an hour of waiting he was giving me trouble until I called another co worker here to help. This had to be the WORST Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. Hands down needs new waiters and servers and management !! Would give it 0 stars if I could!"
Chantel P.,"Houston, TX",4,28,50,1.0,10/20/2016,"Whiskey Smash and Bourbon&Honey....Drinks were delicious, but the thyme sprig and lemon zest was not present in my drink (they ran out of drink garnishes). -Slow service. -Bread was hard. -Food was ok...steak was not medium well---it was well done and tough! Shrimp scampi was pretty good. Will not be returning to this location."
Ernest E.,"Houston, TX",2,6,1,3.0,5/6/2017,"The food is moderately ok but the Service is why i rated at 3 stars. This is my second time coming here and always have the same service, slow on everything and generally lacking on caring. Getting refills on drinks generally take about 10-15mins if they remember at all. I had my this done to me every time I went here and generally didn't like my experience with food and service."
