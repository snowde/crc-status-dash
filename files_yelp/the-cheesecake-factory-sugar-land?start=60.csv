Janette D.,"Houston, TX",5,61,2,3.0,9/25/2016,"Food is always good here . The only bad thing is everytime we come they seem to never have bread for us. Other than that , food is great! I recommend the chicken Madeira and the stuffed chicken tortillas , with a raspberry sweet tea!"
Miley G.,"Missouri City, TX",6,54,17,1.0,8/13/2016,Just left this location with my family of 5 and the experience was horrible. Our waiter Timothy was always never to be found. The food took 30 minutes or more to get to our table. Tim served me a Coke that he knew was flat cause he admitted it to me when I requested a different Coke product. We had ordered a cheesecake and were not provided any forks or plates to eat it. We had to borrow plates and forks from a different table. Like my dad had to get up and get them himself! Our food wasn't bagged to go instead we were handed the tools to do it ourselves . But I saw Tim bag the table next to us food.  This was my first time taking my family here cause they have never been and we will never return because the service was poor and our server was incompetent.
Lina O.,"Paris, France",0,12,2,1.0,8/22/2017,"When I go to the USA, I ALWAYS go to the Cheesecake Factory from the Galleria mall. This time we were in a different location. I am So deceived. The worst service ever. I was so thrilled to go there but the service was so bad that we didn't enjoyed. The bread was cold and burnt. We waited so long at the table without anything to eat. I don't understand how the service can be so slow when it is not busy. I was even deceived by the cheesecake. Please, smile, be happy like American people! This was my first and my last time at this location. I will go back to the galleria."
John D.,"Missouri City, TX",164,644,107,4.0,10/30/2015,"I usually avoid this chain like the plague because the average entree could feed a family of 4 for a week. But with the promise of a new lighter menu, my folks talked us into going over the weekend. The verdict: the skinny menu has good stuff and doesn't make you feel like you're being penalized for being on a diet. Knocking a star off for service. We had a great server, but there are breakdowns in communication - we were seated at a table by the hostess before the server had a chance to finish cleaning it. Props to the server for fixing this without being asked. The food could stand to come out of the kitchen a little faster. End result: we'll visit again. I'll even pay the $6 to valet the car as finding an open parking space in this corner of First Colony is a chore."
Megan H.,"Houston, TX",78,16,,4.0,4/10/2017,"My mom, brother, and I came in on new year's eve for dinner at around 7-8 pm. The restaurant was VERY crowded and it took forever to be seated. I remember ordering the shrimp pasta which was delicious. Their pasta is chewy and super flavorful, just the perfect texture. The restaurant itself is beautifully built with a very warm, relaxed, yet classy setting. The walls and ceilings are beautiful and the environment is very great.  Great customer service, food, and environment!"
Brittany N.,"Houston, TX",159,7,10,3.0,11/6/2016,"Messed up on my friends order (old fashion burger) wanting the side salad but received French fries. The staff here is not well attentive to their customers. My shrimp and meat pasta was (3/5) probably wont eat again. Overall, service could improve."
My N.,"Houston, TX",168,153,101,3.0,12/14/2015,"Came here with my two sisters and I wanted to treat them at this place. It was a rainy Sunday but it was still crowded and packed. I asked the hostess how long the wait for 3 people. She stated about 10 mins. (She lied it was about 20 mins+). They knew we weren't going to leave if we were already waiting 10 mins in! When we finally got called we got seated in the booths. Our table was still dirty but the staff apologized and finished cleaning up. Our waiter came by a few mins later to take our drink order. So for the food we decided on the crab and artichoke dip. My sister got the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic pasta, my other sister settled for the grilled salmon salad, and I ordered the spinach bacon eggs Benedict.  They gave us complimentary bread with butter. They were both delicious! Our appetizer was good. A tad bit pricey for the portion and it was a bit spicy but I say 4/5 stars. My sisters enjoyed their entree. I got to try a bit of the pasta but something about it wasn't right. I like to say the pasta may not be cooked right and with it dousing in the sauce it was okay. I didn't try my other sister's salad. Only the salmon which was yummy. It was not fishy and it was cooked just right. As for my dish...it was a bit disappointing. I love eggs but I like them cooked right. Unfortunately, one of them was cooked as a hard boiled egg. Fortunately the waiter was nice enough to give mr another poached egg but I ended up letting my sister have it with her salad. The breakfast potatoes were crispy and tasty but I don't think it was that great for me to come back to eat. I probably be back if someone invites me but I definitely won't be suggesting to go here. There are plenty of other places or different locations to go to."
Deepa A.,"Honolulu, HI",0,3,3,1.0,7/12/2016,"The quality has dropped dramatically at this location, nor did I realize I'd be fighting flies for my meal inside the restaurant.  We got our food and didn't get an opportunity to let our waiter know that the mashed potatoes were clumpy the chicken undercooked and the cheese burned on our chicken Madeira. We got seated at the bar when there was plenty of room in the main dining area. So our waiter who was bar tending saw us once to take our order and then 30 minutes later to ask how are food was... Manager said he can't do anything about it because we had eaten too much of it. Don't come here if you are a hungry pregnant woman like me... Also, he let us know that they typically run out of wheat bread on Tuesday nights (tonight), shipment of flour is on Wednesdays.... Managers name is Ivan Ingram. Updating this review, took my son's food home because we didn't want to stick around there any longer.  I got home and dumped his fries into a plate - please checkout the picture to see what else was at the bottom of his paper cone of fries - looks like some old rice, a vermicelli, some other fried junk.  This actually just reminded me that the last time I came and ordered him chicken strips, there was a fried calamari in the mix too.  Since my son doesn't have allergies I let it go, but for anyone that does that could've been deadly."
Rogers C.,"Richmond, TX",176,5,2,2.0,4/16/2017,Ok... I get it... it's the worst day to come to a restaurant outside of Mothers day. EASTER... but this is the second occasion that I've been here and they were out of catfish... so I ordered a new York bone in... and guess what out of that as well... so I get an upgraded steak to a mediocre Ribeye for the price of the strip... ok cool but darn it man... can't have two menu items that appear at the top of the menu to be out... or have someone keep counts on the low items... I'm a chef I know you can put a count on items in the pos... but yeah
Eric M.,"Houston, TX",0,18,,1.0,3/18/2017,"Last 3 times I been hear just been miserable. Probably my last time here. Tonight's food Cajun chicken littles were all clumped together the mashed potatoes cold as ice, the corn and vegetables were cold and raw. My fiancé had chicken Marsala and steak combo the steak looked like it had been chewed up and the size of two quarters. I don't mind spending money but in a crapy meal it pisses my off."
Vincent D.,"Houston, TX",32,2,,2.0,7/2/2016,"A review for mainly takeout but also for previous dine in service. Foods not bad. Cheesecake is great. Service is slowwwwwww. So slowwwww. If you've got hours to kill in one place, place is no problem. Have an hour lunch or want a quick takeout, you're out of luck. For takeout, I've gone on a few occasions, months apart. I usually just order cheesecake. 3 slices for the family but always seem to have to wait atleast 30 minutes. I understand they're busy but I usually have to complain to get my cake and it takes them 3 minutes. Literally 3 minutes or less. 3 minutes to move to a to go box if they realize it's one of those forgotten dine in orders waiting on their counter none of the waiters have claimed. Otherwise it takes them less time. Next time, I'm going to ask to wait to pay until I get my order. 3 slices of cake, man! No fries or other food to wait on! TO-GO!"
Katrina S.,"Victoria, TX",42,5,,5.0,4/5/2017,"I had an amazing experience here for my birthday! We came at happy hour and had the most amazing waitress! We got avocado egg rolls, a burger, and the tuxedo cheesecake with a cosmo, Bellini, and margarita. Everything was amazing!"
Bob C.,"Richmond, TX",1,1,,2.0,3/21/2017,"My wife and I keep trying to like this Cheesecake Factory because we have never had a bad experience at any of the others all over the U.S.  Sadly, we will never go back to this one after three bad experiences.  While the food is satisfactory (if you get what you ordered...), the service is consistently the worst I've experienced at any restaurant.  The problems range from never getting any service to getting the wrong food.  We watched others get the same treatment while we were there also.  We have just gotten up and left after 15 minutes of no service after being seated...not even a welcome and get your drink order and we couldn't get anyone's attention.  This restaurant needs new management and staff.  Absolutely awful."
K B.,"Woodinville, WA",2,50,12,1.0,6/21/2016,Food was sub par. I travel across the country and feel that this location really is sub par on their food standards as well as on service. Service is extremely slow and they just seem so unorganized. Our waiter was nice but not as prompt as we'd like him to be.  Kids food and parent food both were just below OK.  Will be choosing elsewhere next time. If I'm going to spend $90 maybe I'll go to a higher end restaurant.
Roger B.,"Sugar Land, TX",88,18,,1.0,12/30/2016,"The one Star is because the food is OK. The only reason we went is because my wife is a teacher and gets gift cards. The Service was abysmal. We are seated: - 12 minutes in, I catch the eye of a server who strolls over and asks if we want drinks. We request waters and a beer.   - 3 minutes later, waters arrive - 12 minutes later, I catch my waiter's eye and ask about the beer.  He said he was going ""right to get it.""  Somehow, it takes him 4 minutes to walk 15 feet to the bar and get the beer - now, we are 31 minutes in and no bread for the table; so, I stand up and catch a manager and ask for the bread. Finally, a few minutes later, the bread shows up. We order, and, 15 minutes later, someone shows up with another table's order; then, he argues with our waiter about whose fault it is. PS..I don't care. At the end of the meal, I give our 3 gift cards to pay for our order.  Then, we get 7 (yes, Seven!) receipts.  All I know is that the amount I wanted to pay was the gift cards; so, we just left the gift cards and went home. Cheesecake Factory, your service stinks; and this is why we do not frequent your establishment.  Too expensive for terrible service."
T A.,"Missouri City, TX",0,37,6,3.0,1/19/2017,Yes they are pricey for heat lamp food.  Waiters are normally great. We usually stick with brunch and girl talk. ...lemon ricotta pancakes are always hot and fresh.  Ask for syrup to be hot. Although i could eat these pancakes without. I'm a huge fan of the red velvet cheesecake....Omg!
Yessi H.,"Houston, TX",0,5,1,1.0,11/18/2016,"I am giving it a 1 star cuz I cant give it a zero. Horrible service, horrible seating, horrible waiters and horrible BAR area manager on a Friday night 11/18/2016. She apologized and said she will make it up to us somehow. We don't mind paying $82 in a 2.5 star restaurant. But when we (4 people) confronted her about how she was making it up after all? She said, I never said that. Being at peace is better than being right or wrong. Trust Yelp and stay away: 2.5 stars sad, sad, sad."
Ashley P.,"Sugar Land, TX",18,72,42,3.0,4/16/2016,Had the hibachi steak. Steak was way salty and overcooked eventhough I asked for medium/med rare. Was really looking forward to wasabi mashed potatoes but they were just mashed potato with a runny green sauce on top. I was starvimg so I ate it all. Tropical martini was on point as well as my service and my girls devoured their meals so.... I'll give 'em 3.
Humna H.,"Houston, TX",2,16,49,4.0,8/9/2016,I ordered the Cajun jambalaya shrimp. It was delicious. Big portion. Our server was pretty slow. He literally took forever to take our order and we have to ask other servers to send him back. Food was really good. We tired their pecan cheese cake 10/10 :D
Jimmy Z.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,12,12,5.0,9/5/2016,I love their appetizers. The spinach dip is my favorite. There selection  of cheesecake is in the best.  When busy their service is slow but portions are large.  Never leave hungry!
