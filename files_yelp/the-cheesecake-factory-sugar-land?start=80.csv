Lan N.,"Houston, TX",146,174,688,2.0,8/30/2015,"Food is okay, everyone comes here for the cheesecake anyways. Our waiter got most of our order wrong but he was nice, food took forever to come out and the hostess can use a touch up with her choice of words. The hostess literally asked ""which one are you"" when I came up with my buzzer thing to be seated. And for all the above you will get exactly 15% tip."
Randy R.,"Houston, TX",0,14,6,1.0,4/24/2017,"I met a friend there for lunch Saturday around 11:15 and sat on the patio. Our food tasted great but the service was very poor. They weren't that busy yet, we had to ask for silverware, napkins, refills on drinks, and condiments that should've came out with the food. We were very disappointed and will not be back anytime soon."
Arlene J.,"Sugar Land, TX",23,77,29,1.0,10/3/2015,"I give our table's server a full 5-stars. Extremely patient, competent, knowledgeable, and an all-around nice guy.  The bartender gets negative-5 stars. My bro-in-law requested an off-menu drink... Which is predictable that he would, given that the Cheesecake Factory is not well known for being culinarily ultra innovative and everything on the menu is about as avant garde as Beef Wellington in the year 2055. I get that.  But when a customer asks for a drink, and TELLS you what goes in the drink because you're too douchey to google it for yourself, and you're just too set in your old ways to even learn a new drink so you flat out refuse to make it for this customer... well now you're just solidifying the reason why vacuous bints frequent this G-d forsaken, wannabe-on-the-Vegas-strip gaudy restaurant.  Oh yes, and thanks for charging my sister an extra $5 for 4 pieces of shrimp.  Verdict:  Why do we even bother."
Shane S.,"Missouri City, TX",44,2,,1.0,2/18/2017,Horrible! This place used to be good 5 years ago but not anymore. Last time we ate there the plates were nasty they had leftover food still stuck to the bottom.  We gave another shot and went again today... my wife ordered a Greek salad which she orders every time... the plate came it had yellow crust stuck on it (again plate was dirty) also my pasta was slimy it was disgusting to say the least. And their silverware is spotty. Not acceptable!!! Be ware
Anthony A.,"Manvel, TX",57,290,974,3.0,9/26/2015,"We stopped by for some after dinner dessert and coffee, and since that's all we wanted, we opted to sit in the bar area.  We sat there for about 10 minutes wondering if someone was going to wait on us or if we were supposed to go up to the bar to order our food.  Finally a waiter came along, and it looked like he was the only one waiting on the tables in the bar area, and he did apologize for taking a while, and he said it was because he was trying to gather tableware for us.  Since we knew what we wanted we ordered 2 coffees and a slice of the Ultimate Red Velvet cheesecake.  When we got our coffee, mine was hot, but my wife's decaf was actually room temperature.  Since it took a while for it to come out, she didn't want to make a big deal of it and just drank it while we ate the delicious slice of cheesecake.  We were hoping to get coffee refills before we finished our slice of cake, especially since hers was cold.  Finally, our waiter showed up and she asked for regular coffee this time, since we assumed they weren't brewing fresh hot decaf. After we finished our meal, funny enough, our waiter was quick to give us our bill, and even cash us out quickly. It's been a while since we've been to the Cheesecake Factory and i'm hoping service wasn't this bad in the regular dining area.  Although our waiter was really nice and polite, I think they should have had more than just him stationed in that bar area."
Nikhil J.,"Seattle, WA",193,48,62,2.0,8/11/2015,"At 10:30pm, you really won't find many options in the Sugar Land area. If you see cheesecake factory pop up in yelp, just pretend it's closed and keep searching. Our party arrived at 10:30, and while we were the only ones waiting for a table, it took the staff almost 15 minutes to seat us. I ordered a Pesto Pasta w/ chicken, which rang up to $17.95 (and was worth about $5). The food itself was completely forgettable. The pesto sauce with the pasta tasted like water was its main component. The chicken tasted like it was pulled straight out of a freezer and dumped onto the dish. The only reason I'm giving Cheesecake Factory a 2* and not a 1* is because it lives up to its name - the cheesecake itself is not bad at all (though a bit pricey)."
Marah B.,"Sugar Land, TX",13,13,5,2.0,4/1/2016,"I love taking my girls and mom at this place after attending the mass. For our lunch, we always ordered our favorite Miso Salmon's and calamari for our appetizer. The waiter was attentive and nice so to make  a long story short. My kids ordered an orea milkshake and my younger one ordered a godiva ice cream. They cannot finish it all so I requested a to go cup. I transfered everything in the to go cup and put the godiva ice cream on top of the milkshake. My older daughter decided to finish the rest in the house and what we found at the bottom of the cup was a soda plastic cap mixed with the orea milkshake. We don't have any idea how it got there but It was disgusting to know that my daughter finished most of it. I'm glad that she didn't swallow it or something worst happen to her."
Sean S.,"Sugar Land, TX",455,143,47,4.0,6/30/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory is located in the Town Center/ First Colony Mall area. There is plenty of parking available around that area due to the shopping centers that surround it.  The interior is well-decorated. Lighting has a nice feel to it and the service is pretty good. This place is a good place to bring family and for special occasions as well.  I had one of the pastas and I must say that it was pretty darn good. It's really about picking the right dish. I can't say everything they have here is amazing, but the one I picked was just right!  Bonus: On your birthday, they give you a free ice cream sundae (It used to be cheese cake).  All in all, I thought this place was pretty good. It's a nice place for celebration. I can't say its my favorite place, but once in awhile is fine."
M M.,"Hudson, WI",17,7,9,2.0,1/2/2017,Worse CCF I've ever been to. Service was so slow. Table for 5 was an extra chair in the isle next to our booth...and they weren't packed out either. Service was poor. Food order wasn't right.....took for ever to come out also. Never going there again. Not classy enough. Good free bread. Food taste pretty good.
Persia L.,"Richmond, TX",7,37,23,4.0,5/24/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory is really yummy , and I love the drinks, they are very strong too"
K F.,"Stafford, TX",0,9,,1.0,6/18/2017,I went to pick up an order and asked for silverware and was told I couldn't get any silverware because I didn't order silverware? Lol
Carolyn W.,"Missouri City, TX",0,1,,1.0,7/9/2017,"My family and I like the food; however, even on a slow Sunday, the wait time to be seated & the wait time for food is way too long. The food took 45 minutes to arrive after we ordered! And, because I've had this issue a few times before at this location, I even ordered as soon as the waiter came to our table. If you have young kids, think twice before choosing this location!"
Jacob C.,"Missouri City, TX",0,14,3,1.0,11/20/2016,For some reason I come here thinking it will be better like it used to be years ago.  Very disappointing! Food took forever to come out and when it did it was very uneventful.   I ordered the Cajun jambalaya and it was dry with no sauce or flavor.   My wife ordered the shepherds pie and it looked more like ground hamburger meat under a blob of potatoes.   Pathetic! Never coming back to this place ever.
Gr D.,"Houston, TX",0,17,3,1.0,6/10/2017,Floor is slippery everywhere. Took 30 mins to get bread no exaggeration and 45 mins in still have not gotten my food. Place is dead. Service sucks! Need new management
Dan D.,"Richmond, TX",2,9,,1.0,6/4/2017,"This is nothing more than a glorified Denny's. Fries were caked with salt, Cobb salad was just gross with tough chicken and no dressing. ! Will never come back to this restaurant."
Alizain D.,"Sugar Land, TX",53,11,1,1.0,10/30/2016,"Worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to. Always had a problem here but today was just too much. The jambalaya was sooooooo salty, it was inedible and the waiter didn't comp it even though I complained. We sent back 2 jambalayas plates 95%full and since it was late we didn't get a replacement meal."
Ashley Y.,"Houston, TX",103,428,480,4.0,4/27/2014,I understand some other ppl might think the service was not good sometimes. Yes I believe so if u came in the dinner time.   That is why I haven't been here for a while. I came here for happy hour and I really Enjoyed it.  The mix drinks and serval appetizer are all $5 each. It is a very good deal.  I ordered the Long Island ice tea and it's strong enough for $5.  We tho the appetizer might be real small portion but it came out in pretty big portion!  I know they really have bad service sometimes but I always love their food!
Josh P.,"Stafford, TX",92,150,88,5.0,4/23/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory, ah we meet again.  Everywhere I go, everywhere important that is, I found one of these guys... Why? Because they serve great food everytime. I've never had a bad experience here. I know some who have, but they aren't writing this review, are they? I write reviews based on MY experiences. I happen to write alot of positive reviews, and I am usually very pleasant to deal with. Coincidence? No. If you are nice to the waiter, the waiter is extra nice to you. Simple, really.  We had an excellent Anniversary dinner here at the Sugar Land location, our server was phenomenal. Never have had better service! The drinks were awalys full, and the bread was overflowing. Not to mention our portions were enough for 2 meals a peice.  It's always gonna be pricey here, here's why: Good Food = Money You definitely get what you pay for here, though. and since the price was high, the food proportionally sized and delicious."
Alexandra M.,"Richmond, TX",0,37,43,4.0,1/1/2017,"After 2 days of going to 2 extremely overpriced, bad restaurants, I decided to take my girls to the Cheesecake Factory for a nice New Year Day meal. We only had to wait about 5 minutes. Our waiter was Sieh an really nice and efficient waiter. I ordered the grilled salmon and asked for the lemon sauce that comes with the herbed salmon. One girl ordered the herb salmon. Both salmon dishes were great. The fish was cooked perfectly. My other daughter ordered the tostadas chicken salad. It had a nice smoky vinaigrette. Also very tasty. I also ordered the calamari for appetizer and again, cooked perfectly. The calamari was very tender. The portions are huge so we ordered the desserts (because you HAVE to order dessert) to go."
Roxana C.,"Houston, TX",23,6,,1.0,11/27/2016,"Dirty, took forever, short staffed i love the food here but the service was awaful and the music was obnoxious and loud usually not this loud"
