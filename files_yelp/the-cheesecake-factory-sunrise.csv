Brandon M.,"Davie, FL",81,25,78,4.0,11/21/2017,"Ahhh The Cheesecake Factory..  always an excellent choice no matter what mood you are in.  There is so much variety in the menu here that you don't have to pick a ""type"" of restaurant.  If you want Italian style food, they have it.  Asian? They have it.  American? They have it plus much more.  To top it off, you will have some of the best dessert options in town when you are done!  If it's available in the fall, go for the pumpkin cheesecake!  If you're not concerned about an overly healthy meal, I highly recommend trying the fried Mac and cheese.  Words can't describe this dish so I won't try.  Also, if you want a drink, you have to try the whisky smash.  It might be my favorite drink in the world.  It's strong enough to get the party started for anyone, but soft enough that a light drinker will also enjoy.  The only problem here is that there's almost always a solid wait time because, well, it's worth it.  If you haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory yet then you're obviously living under a rock.  Get yourself there!"
Kiona B.,"Hollywood, FL",187,38,186,2.0,9/25/2017,"Who can go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory, I thought. I'm a fan, but not with this location. You know when you're craving one specific thing and only want that one thing? Well, that was me yesterday. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan speciality and was informed well after ordering my meal that it wasn't available. Ok, I regrouped but the only thing that saved me was the sweet tamale cakes (appetizer for $10.95).  My son ordered a side Cesar salad and when it was brought to him they realized it was for the table behind us. My son pulled his fork from the salad and returned it only to get another salad 10 minutes later. I believe the croutons are sautéed and were waaaaaay to hard to chew.  I'll just stick with the Cheesecake Factory in my neck of the woods."
Samson K.,"Hollywood, FL",48,10,10,5.0,9/23/2017,"Never disappointing! Two years ago was my girlfriend and I first date, now two years later to celebrate our anniversary we had dinner married and with our 1 year old baby girl  Love the food, service and the overall atmosphere."
Tina Y.,"Miami, FL",161,35,61,4.0,1/5/2018,"We decided to sit at the bar for faster seating during this busy lunch break. I had stuffed mushroom to start off and had chicken Marsala and mango salad. We had actually ordered buffalo chicken and it was like smothered chicken battered and deep fried. The sizes were huge but had to take it back. The manager came by to check, thought it was professional of him. The other items we ordered was delicious. We had couple wines and enjoyed our lunch. I'd come back when I'm in town."
Kike A.,"Miami, FL",147,13,6,1.0,10/22/2017,"I usually don't like to leave negative reviews due to the fact that I am in the industry and I understand that things happen.  But for me to get up an leave, was a result of too many mistakes.  First, it took the server 3 tries to bring a diet coke. He kept mixing the drinks and delivering regular coke. Brown bread was not available.  I order chicken and waffles and received eggs benedict, and to top it off, we order penne carbonara and the plate had a mix of spaghetti and penne pasta.  At this point our appetite was gone and decided to leave.  I remember that good old Cheesecake Factory, it was the place to go, but now the quality and service has gone down."
Dani C.,"Hollywood, FL",33,2,,1.0,1/2/2018,"Went in yesterday with my boyfriend for New Year's Day. I asked the host, ""how are you?"" She responded, ""how many?"" Got sat and my server Brandon was wonderful, but I noticed flies were flying around (signs of filth). I ordered a Cobb salad and a fly flew right into my salad dressing, when I told the manger he acted like it wasn't a big deal, and replaced my salad, I still had to pay for a salad when the restaurant is so freaking dirty I had to send the first one back??? Never giving this place my business. Go somewhere with a clean kitchen cause I saw pictures of roaches in these reviews too!!! YUCK"
Rosa L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",283,108,722,4.0,8/29/2017,"My daughter and I went where in the mood for the National Cheese and there and behold we went on a Sunday during brunch. As always it was packed with people, but more crowed for the special event of National Cheesecake. We had food and the new cheesecake to celebrate life together. I also tried a Peach Bellini, which was refreshing while in the outside seating area. The waitress was very nice the service time was not too fast not too slow. We definitely were stuffed when leaving. My 10 year old daughter did mention the bathroom was not as clean as it should be. The time we had here is always special. I'm glad its at a mall so we could walk off some calories. I will be back if out at Sawgrass shopping."
Julie F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1600,475,1683,3.0,4/13/2017,"This place was packed and so was the mall. There was a wait for regular tables so we sat at the bar where you can order from the full menu. The bartenders (2) were a little overwhelmed as they were making the  drinks for the entire restaurant as well as waiting on patrons eating. I was surprised how many people were having (multiple) alcoholic beverages at lunch -- although most were tourists here on vacation. The menu is quite large and it takes a while to go through it. There's also a list of ""specials"" -- prices are the same on the regular menu so I guess it's just items they are featuring or pushing. Then there's a separate one for skinnylicious meals. These are ""lighter"" versions of menu items. Although that may not mean much. Calories are listed next to most items and if people really paid attention to the numbers some items would never be ordered. Eek! Inside the regular menu is a section -- buried a few pages back and on the lower half of one page -- that lists lunch specials with smaller portions of some items and combos like soups and sandwiches, et al.  I ordered off the skinnylicious menu and got a ""factory"" chopped salad. It had romaine lettuce, bits of avocado, bits of bacon, corn kernels, a smidgen of blue cheese, a few tiny bits of apples, and a few cubes of cooked white chicken meat. It came already mixed with a vinaigrette style dressing. It was a fairly large bowl (with 500 calories). I gave part of it away and basically picked out the pieces of chicken and avocado.  It wasn't bad, but not sure I would order it again.  This is not fine dining and you wonder how they can control such a large menu and do all the things correctly. It's loud and busy. It's not a place to linger and chat, but at least it's slightly better alternative to food court dining."
Howard H.,"Dania Beach, FL",531,457,3132,4.0,3/26/2017,"My wife and I came here for lunch after walking around the all morning.  It's been a while since I visited this Cheesecake Factory last, probably 5 or 6 years.  But surprisingly, this place looked the same and hasn't change at all from my memory. I am amazed how they managed to keep the place look this good after all these years.  We went to the bar and it looked exactly the way I remembered The menu hasn't changed much neither.  The only differences is before  I used to order the dinner entrees and asked for the lunch portion., but now  there is a lunch special menu.  Since they have just a few beers on top, I decided to order their mojito.  It tasted pretty good but perhaps it was a bit pricey.  I should come back during their happy hours where the same drink will cost probably half of the regular price.  My wife ordered her Long Island Ice Teas as usual.  She thought they were pretty good. For lunch we tried a few items in their appetizer menu.  I love egg rolls so I ordered their egg roll samplers which came with 4 different kinds of egg rolls with 4 different kind of sauces.  They were all very crispy on the outside and the fillings were delicious.  My wife ordered the Tomato Basil Flat Bread and enjoyed it.  And also, how can you come to Cheesecake Factory without ordering a cheesecake?  My wife ordered their White Chocolate Carmela Macadamia Nut Cheesecake.  She apparently loved it because she was worried so much about the calories in the cheesecake.  She thought the carmela might be a bit too sweet.  Overall, we liked our meal.  The drinks were good, and so was the service.  I think we would come back during their happy hours for great deals on food and drinks."
Kara M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",271,647,3103,4.0,1/29/2017,"We stopped in here today for brunch a few minutes after 10 AM.  The restaurant was not crowded since the mall did not open until 11. Our waiter (Michael P) was great!  He was awesome about checking on us.  We promptly received coffee and water refills.  He was super polite too!  He gets 5 out of 5 stars.  My husband and I agree that he was one of the best waiters we have had at this particular establishment. I think the kitchen was slow or backed up, it took a little bit of time for the food to come out.  The quality of the food was good though."
Amy S.,"Tamarac, FL",200,535,1781,4.0,1/7/2017,"I have a love / hate relationship with this location.  They get very busy so this was a lucky hit without the long line.   I was on my way into Nordstrom Rack and happened to notice the quiet entry.  I wasn't planning to eat here or now but had to take advantage. As I was being seated (alone), I realized I left my book in the care.  I rarely eat alone without reading material but my server happened to be there and ensured me he would take good care of me and even allow me to order from the lunch menu... it was only a minute or 2 before 4/ He didn't disappoint.  He was quite busy but do follow through and I had a great piece of salmon at the lower price.  Yummy and happy to save a little. If you want to eat at this location, get there at an off time... the place is a hoppin'."
Michelle H.,"Plantation, FL",195,69,399,5.0,7/12/2017,"No matter how busy this place is, the workers there are always so attentive & nice. We came in during happy hour & our host was Chris. He helped recommend some tasty appetizers & was very quick whenever we needed something. We tried the egg roll sampler & got desserts since we weren't that hungry. The hazelnut chocolate crunch cheesecake was to die for! I love this Cheesecake Factory & since it's located at sawgrass, you can get some shopping in and end it with a nice meal :)"
Brittany O.,"Boca Raton, FL",244,47,31,5.0,6/8/2017,"Never had brunch here before, I have always just done dinner. And as we all know the portion sizes are huge!!!! Well the same goes for brunch. My bf order the breakfast burrito which he said was really good, it was still crispy and it was packed with all the breakfast essentials. I got the breakfast combo eggs, bacon and pancakes with the most delicious and not to mention warmed up syrup! OMG to die for :)   The wait wasn't long at all maybe 10 minutes which was surprising to me since it was a Sunday at the Sawgrass mall but none the less we had got to our table and the waitress showed up promptly! I also ordered a Camel Macchiato that was amazing!!! Had to add sugar but it cause I like my coffee sweet.  I'm not the hugest fan of chain restaurants but Cheesecake Factory has never let me down :)"
Brandon R.,"Hollywood, FL",31,44,208,5.0,4/5/2017,"My girlfriend and I usually come here on the 25th of every month, and heck I can't get enough of it. The best part is that since we're a party of two, we don't have to wait long. I really love the Macaroni and Cheese Burger. I've ordered this four times already and I still crave it. As for dessert, I always order the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake. Nothing can go wrong with a name like that, right? The service is always on point and the food makes my mouth water. There are times when I can't decide on what I want because of how yummy everything looks, haha! This place is simply superb, and I can't wait to come back here in 20 days."
Cherra R.,"Chicago, IL",123,21,28,5.0,6/3/2017,First let me say our server Caitlyn was AWESOME! This was my significant others first time at the Cheesecake Factory and I'm so glad we chose to come here. Our experience was 100% perfect! The food and drinks were bomb as well!
Dawn C.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,2,,2.0,12/26/2017,"So tonight I went out to dinner at the Cheesecake Factory at the Sawgrass Mills Mall expecting to have a good dining experience. Well that didn't happen. I ordered fish tacos and the dish was $15.50. So I expected a decent amount of fish. Maybe at least amounting to one fish steak spread over the 4 tacos I received. I was so disappointed when I looked at my dish and the pieces of fish all together that were in my meal didn't even make up an average size fish steak. To top it off the rice was still hard . I was so upset , so I asked for the manager, who insisted that it was a normal portion of fish for their tacos.  I did not expect that from this restaurant chain. I normally love the portions you get whether you eat in or take out.  And this was not on the lighter menu section, so they really dropped the ball here."
Joan D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,9,2,2.0,10/24/2017,"To quote Gordon Ramsay, ""it's fuc#@% raw!"" We've been here before and the food has been decent. However, today it was disappointing. I ordered the Steak Diane (asked for medium) and the meat was tender, but flavorless and certain parts were raw! It also had way too much pepper and no salt. Service was good though. I think next time I want steak, I'll go to the new Texas de Brazil that just opened up close to cheesecake."
B T.,"Miami Beach, FL",2,30,86,5.0,4/28/2017,"Few days ago I went to Sawgrass Mills Outlet Mall with my boyfriend and couple of friends for shopping. After exhausting hours of shopping we sat in Cheesecake Factory for the first time. Wait was only 5 minutes, and hostess was very  professional. We ordered drinks, for appetizers we had Mac and cheese fried balls and Quesadillas. For main course everybody had a steak. Our server Carlos recommended my steak with mashed potatoes, tempura asparagus, wasabi and mushrooms, amazing! Cooked to perfect medium rare. For dessert we split one Nutella caramel cheesecake.  Great food, great service! All recommendations!"
Barbara V.,"Miami Lakes, FL",0,10,,4.0,12/19/2017,I went to this restaurant with my daughter before the Y100 Jingle ball event on Sunday. The restaurant looks very nice. The staff is pleasant and welcoming. We had a great experience with the service and food. My only concern was almost all of the utensils were visible dirty. One of the forks had a creamy sauce on it. And both spoons had dry chocolate on the front and back. They should improve that and they would have definitely gotten 5 stars!
Wendy P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",30,4,2,2.0,7/1/2017,I received Chicken Nachos via delivery tonight from door dash. They were thrown in a pizza box with no toppings except cheese and chicken. Totally disgusting. Does the Cheesecake Factory not take pride in their good or how they package it?
Marcos M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,15,,1.0,11/3/2017,Cheesecake Factory used to be one of my favorite restaurants.  I would go there at least once or twice a month visiting all South Florida locations. I won't give up on it yet but my 2 most recent visits indicate there's a problem that needs to be fixed. Prices have inched up to depart from casual dining into the fine dining category which it definitely does not compete in. The shrimp scampi and Bistro shrimp ordered on the last 2 visits are just under $20 and come with pasta only. The shrimp are medium size not large or jumbo. On 1 different occasions the food was served cold. Inexcusable. Service has gone down hill. No checking back to follow up. Appetizers were ok but overpriced. The cheesecake is still the highlight of the meal. As far as food it was a major disappointment. I won't give up but will not return to the Sawgrass location for a while.
Erica D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",28,44,11,5.0,6/9/2017,"Loved this place for years. Gorgeous architecture.  Brown Bread is the best there is! Avocado spring rolls are to die for! Huge menu has something for everyone.  Very clean.  Bad:  long lines on weekend.   A bit on the pricey side  Fish selection is tasty.  Hint: park in the Burlington garage and come thru the back on busy days. It has cool art on the ceiling,too. Lol"
Faith K.,"Plantation, FL",222,131,107,2.0,6/16/2017,"Where do I begin with this nightmare?  Stopped in at lunchtime on a Tuesday. I was with 3 colleagues and we were seated in the bar area. As we were seated, I said we were on our lunch hour and we would like separate checks.  The waitress eventually took our order.  Three of us ordered salads and one person ordered 2 appetizers as a meal.  The table next to us was seated about 10 minutes later and we watched them get served their hot meals. As the waitress was MIA, we went to inquire about our food as we were still on our lunch break.  The food finally came (as the table next to us finished their meals) and the hot appetizers that my friend ordered were room temperature.  I ordered Sheila's Chicken and avocado salad and I am here to tell you that there was no chicken and a few diced pieced of avocado. It took a while to flag down the server and she said she would go get me some ""extra"" chicken. I explained it was not ""extra"" as there was no chicken in the salad. I don't think she understood... My friend ate his appetizers because it was such a hassle to get my salad corrected.  Then the manager came over with 2 bowls of chicken and told me this was my ""extra"" chicken. I looked at him with amazement. Seriously, just adding the chicken to the salad is not okay as it does not have any of the flavors melded into it.  He offered to re-toss it as it would only take ""a minute"" - I agreed to have it re-tossed. However, due to the length of time, I took one bite and asked for it to go as it was getting late.  When the server came back, she inquired if we wanted the check ""split by 4"" and I said I had previously requested separate checks.  She again asked if we wanted it ""split by 4"" - There was a serious disconnect so one of my friends took over. A few minutes later she came out with a piece of cheesecake (sadly the person most wanted cheesecake, does not like the coffee flavored cheesecake.  I, personally, don't even like cheesecake. So, my friends picked at the cheesecake, my salad was off the check and we were out to lunch a lot longer that it should have been.  I don't foresee returning anytime in the near future.  There are way too many other places in the area that we can eat at more quickly with less aggravation.  I was sad as I have always enjoyed the salads and the brown bread  at the Cheesecake Factory."
Ulisses S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,15,25,4.0,10/28/2017,"Always happy with my meal, service sometimes can be slow, but the food is consistently good so its a regular spot for me!!!"
Arturo M.,"Plantation, FL",74,35,35,1.0,4/30/2017,"Was disappointed in this place. Not a fan of ""franchise"" type eateries, but I thought this would be different.  The place was packed and we got a table that was slanted because the floor was kind of on a hill. I asked to be moved and was not accommodated even though there was 3 empty tables right behind ours. Food was blah.. My wife ordered a salad with NO onions.. Emphasized this numerous times. Even joked about it saying watch it have onions...Food comes and guess what it has...... ONIOnS!!! We waited for the waiter and my wife begins to pick out the onions. The waiter strolls over and I proceed to tell him there are onions and he apologizes and asks if she wanted another one. By now she is half way through the salad and was done eating it... Would make no sense getting another. We just ask for the bill. No apologies for the delay, no cares whatsoever. Bill comes and the salad wasn't even offered to be removed. No problem though. Cheesecake factory enjoy that $13.99. You'll never get another dime from me. No more onions and no more eating on a ramp!"
Shakyra L.,"Miami, FL",398,20,10,5.0,10/4/2017,Outstanding service and the food is amazing! Nice healthy proportions. Our waiter was super attentive. Definitely one of my favorite locations. The cashew chicken is out of this world. Don't forget to get dessert.
Deb G.,"Washington, DC",126,540,531,3.0,10/18/2016,"I have visited the Cheesecake Factory more in the last few months than in the last few years because a few of my friends here in FL are fans. I'm generally a lot happier in hole in the wall ethnic places than big chain restaurants, but I can't deny that the huge menu at Cheesecake Factory makes it easy for people with disparate tastes to eat together. In order to skip the wait on a Friday night, we opted to eat outside - luckily it was sort of nice outside. It was crazy busy, and I'm not sure if that was a typical evening or because it was the day after Hurricane Matthew luckily missed us. Our waitress was delightful and funny, and even though service was a bit slower than I expected because of our out-of-the-way seats, she definitely checked in on us regularly. Now, to the food. Stepping outside my comfort zone, I got the grilled chicken tostada salad. their description: Crisp Corn Tortillas Topped with Grilled Marinated Chicken Breast and Black Beans Piled High with Mixed Greens, Fresh Corn, Green Onions and Cilantro All Tossed in Our Vinaigrette and Garnished with Avocado Cream, Salsa and Sour Cream. When it arrived, I received a huge, huge, massively huge plate of salad greens. Everything else was buried by the salad. Eventually, I unearthed two little tostadas with grilled chicken and black beans on them, and piles of corn and tomatoes that looked and tasted like pico de gallo. So here's the problem - it's served with balsamic vinaigrette. Do you put pico and balsamic together? I don't. After I got a different dressing (BBQ Ranch), it was enjoyable, even though I felt like most of my evening was spent trying to find the different components of my salad. Don't think I'll get that one again. However, it did provide not one but TWO more meals, so I can't complain."
Sabrina M.,"Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, FL",56,5,7,5.0,7/30/2017,WILL. ROBERTS. GREAT SERVICE!!! He's super considerate and nice. My friends and I needed and place to eat and catch up and he was GREAT! He checked on our table a PERFECT amount of times. Not too much not too little. Attentive but did not make us feel rushed which is amazing especially on busy hours. I'm very thankful!
Jennifer R.,"Sunrise, FL",126,23,58,4.0,12/14/2016,The waitress was a doll. Very nice! Brought our drinks out immediately. I live for customer service.  Ordered the factory nachos with extra jalapeños and I must say. It was EXTREMELY huge. In my opinion could've fed a family of 5. Great for an appetizer but I settle to have it for dinner .  Also got the Nutella cheesecake and it was divine!
Ricardo M.,"Florianopolis, Brazil",41,408,4512,4.0,3/8/2016,"Came here just to try out the Cheesecake. The place was really busy and we had to wait some 15 minutes for a table. Not that bad. Was impressed by the menu, so much stuff. A lot of cheesecakes to chose from as well. We had an ""Original"" and a ""Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake"". The slices are huge, and you could feed a family of four with the two slices we ordered. For that, and cappuccino and a soda, we payed about $ 25, not cheap, but not too bad, and within prices of other chain restaurants. Plus the place was clean and had a nice decor, unlike some other chain restaurants. Our server was a fairly nice guy, but the place was really crowded, and, at time, was kind hard to get a hold of him. Also, I noticed the guy at the next table ordered a latte, and it came in a glass cup. What it up with that? Overall, we had a nice time and would came back."
Melanie B.,"Hollywood, FL",27,7,,1.0,11/21/2017,I live across the street from the Sawgrass mall. My husband and I have gone frequently to the Cheesecake Factory. This was by far the worst experience I've ever had here. First we arrived on a Tuesday evening at 7:30. We were told it would be a 10-15 min wait. So by the time we were seated it was 35 min later. The hostess seats us at a table for four people with only 3 chairs and walks away leaving us standing there missing a chair. We had to take it upon ourselves to find a chair. It took another 30 min to get drinks and our appetizer came out before the bread. The waiter was inattentive in all aspects. We ended up not even having dessert because we were afraid we would've been stuck there waiting for another 30 min. Such a shame this place has gone downhill. I didn't even get into the fact that all the food came out a different times and my husbands dish had chicken and he doesn't eat meat. It was just a disaster from the start. Beware locals.
Jules G.,"North Miami Beach, FL",0,1,,1.0,9/24/2017,"Bad management & services in cheesecake factory Sunraise , usually I order my lunch at 11:00 Am, I pick it up at 12:00 Am as my lunch break half an hour from 12:00 Am to 12:30 Am . At 12:00 Am I went to pick my lunch they inform me"" the order is not in the system there is no  food ""They called the manager for the issue , manager replayed me sorry ,I told the manager this my 5th time I ordered  never happened any problems, i do not think sorry is the solution to solved the problem because  i missed my lunch time without food. I go back to my office without food everybody in my company asked me did you eat ? you come back empty  where is the food? my office on 2ND floor has more than 600 employees  I replayed them what happened with to me everybody surprised saying this is bad, unprofessional from the management and bad service ."
Lacey S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,11,6,5.0,11/20/2017,"I've been going for years and never was disappointed. I recently ordered the new menu item , honey truffle chicken and it was amazing. Cheesecake is always great! Drinks are great. Atmosphere is great. Portions are HUGE. You will likely get to bring some home."
Black H.,"Boulder, CO",26,18,1,4.0,4/22/2017,"Great service excellent drinks what more can I ask for?  I got the Jw's pink lemonade and it was great it consists of vodka, raspberry liquor and lemonade. And it turned out very well thanks guys!"
Krizia L.,"Pompano Beach, FL",269,127,368,2.0,11/8/2015,"I think that pretty much every local knows that cheesecake factory here is pretty terrible and a mess when it comes to wait times and a little on service. Worst part is parking and the wait times. This is foreigner and out of towner central. Long story short, got here at 6:30 pm Saturday night for a table for 7. They told us it would be a 30min to 40 min wait. They kept extending the time and we ended up sitting about an hour and a half later. Terrible. Been here many times but it hasn't gotten this bad. Our food took a while. By the time we got it, I already lost my appetite. We were stuffing ourselves with their delicious bread and butter. Price wise, they're okay. Their portions are definitely big and you get your moneys worth or even more at times. Their food is great though. I'll give them that. My favorite is the Farfalle bowtie pasta and shrimp scampi. Their  complimentary bread and butter always served hot and delicious. Their calamari is absolutely delicious too. Lastly they really bring the name of cheesecake very well. My favorite is the red velvet and white chocolate. But because this is foreigner central, a lot of the diners here have luggage they carry with them and it gets crowded and a lot of families. CHAOTIC atmosphere. Disorganized wait time system and hostess even though they have the beeper. This place is not worth going to, to get a peaceful nice date during traffic hours. But on calmer hours, it's nice. Yeah lesson here don't go during traffic hours."
Lus B.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",26,7,5,2.0,7/10/2017,"I love the Cheese Cake factory but the last few times my food has not been to good.  Today my chicken was so dry! I told the waitress and she offered another piece but I had ate most of the pasta by the time she came to check on us. She said the manager would come and he/she never showed up! They were really busy so I just paid and left. However; I was disappointed. Stick to the one in Fort Lauderdale and Boca, no matter how busy they are the food and service is great!"
Khalimah R.,"Margate, FL",80,82,38,5.0,7/13/2017,"The menu is so big there is no way you cannot find more than one thing for your palette. The serving sizes are huge, even on the ""smaller"" lunch menu. Service is friendly, helpful and prompt. I have never had a negative experience and I am here often. Usually the spot I take my family when visiting because of the many options. The avocado egg rolls, the mac n cheese balls, all the salads, the pasta dishes are all amazing!"
Marcos K.,"São Paulo, Brazil",5,21,76,4.0,2/28/2017,"They recently renew the space (dec16) by creating a more spacious environment. The chicken Madero and steak diana are my favorites, beside the strawberry cheesecak, of course."
Ernesto C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,14,1,1.0,7/3/2017,"Very disappointed to this place, Wait for an hour for the food. We ordered medium burgers came out burnt also the steak medallions we order medium came more than well done. Service was good but unfortunately TERRIBLE FOOD.!!!!! WILL NEVER COME BACK..!!!"
Alyssa A.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",1,1,2,5.0,10/20/2016,"Waitress is SUPER nice! I seriously need the bread recipe because it is superior!!! What is your secretttt?????? Anyways, I ordered the Caesar salad appetizer, and it was amazing! It was a little cramped, but that is normal for a small but popular plaza."
