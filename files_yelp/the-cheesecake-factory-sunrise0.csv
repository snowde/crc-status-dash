Kenny Z.,"Miami, FL",28,68,48,1.0,10/14/2013,I went last sunday for brunch and waited over about an hour and forty-five minutes. Which is ridiculous!! I was so upset when i got it but what surprised me the most is how weird the hollandaise sauce looked and its because it was cold. I was very disappointed and will never return there again.
Fatty D.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,280,,1.0,1/1/2013,"Oh oh..First time had a lousy meal at this stalwart. Tortilla Soup, served hot but was thick and pasty. Nachos were burnt. Skimpy on the cheese and other condiments. White Bean Chili was thin and like a soup. All in all, nope just didn't care for any part of this meal. Also, prices have inched up for meh food."
Mark L.,"Davie, FL",45,11,3,1.0,4/26/2014,"Portions were small, food came cold, shrimp had poop left in it, plates had crusted food and were poorly washed."

Adam S.,"Coral Springs, FL",28,121,3,2.0,8/24/2014,Went here last night around 5pm and was surprised on how busy they were at that time. We were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait for a table or 20-30 min wait for a booth we told them a table was fine as we had our 2 year old son with us. After about 15 mins they were able to sit us at a booth which is what we prefer so that was good.  The food was good however my fish tacos could of been a little bit less soggy and contain  more fish it seemed like there was almost no fish in the tacos. They did have a nice spicy kick to them which was told to me by the waitress which was fine since I like spicy foods. My wife had the Shepards pie which she said was good and we ordered chicken tenders for our son who only ate a couple of pieces as he was in one of his I don't feel like eating modes so I'm sure they were fine as our son will Sometimes eat and sometimes won't.  We ordered cheesecake to go as you can't go there without getting their cheesecake.  The waitress was extremely slow and not very attentive she also failed to ask for my I.d. as it states to do so on the back of my card. Not sure if I'll go back anytime soon.
Daniel B. O.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,296,36,4.0,12/5/2014,"Always a great place to grab a lunch or dinner. Great variety of dishes and enormous selection of cheesecakes. The spicy cashew chicken is great. Perhaps one of the best mashed potatoes too. Many good cheesecakes: Chocolate and Coconut, Tuxedo, strawberry, and their 35th year anniversary cake."
G's Mom C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",15,21,6,5.0,4/6/2015,"About 12 of us went last night for Easter dinner,. ...while the wait was long (5 pm on a holiday), the manager kept us updated every 15 mins what was going on with our table. We knew it would be an hour +, but it was very nice to know we weren't forgotten.  Some of us bought a drink at the bar while waiting, and the drinks were delicious.  We did sit after an hour or so, and were given warm bread right away. Yum. Our server Alexis C. was just as cute as Christmas. Some had appetizers which came out quick and hot, (fried cheese square...lightly breaded and full of gooey cheese). Our drinks (sodas) never got the chance to get watered down from ice, she brought new fresh soda. When the entrees came, there must have been 5-6-7 people helping deliver the food to everyone.  Our server was personable and handled all 12 of us talking away asking questions. Giving recommendations.  She was a delight.  We never felt rushed. We ended the night with espresso. ...cappuccinos and of course cheesecake.   Excellent cheesecake.  Light and fluffy and not heavy and dense. It was a wonderful evening. Everyone loved their dinners...the service...the experience.   On the way out, I told the manager of our great service. 3 of us work in a restaurant and we know you tend to hear the bad and rarely the good.  I recommend Alexis C. if anyone wants great service.  It was a wonderful Easter."
A S.,"London, United Kingdom",49,487,643,4.0,7/12/2011,Always great service in Cheesecake Factories. Food is good standard and huge portions. Very varied international menu. Always worth a visit
Heidi M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",92,30,12,4.0,8/2/2013,"What's not to love here .... Cheese Cake of every kind !! The food is consitent so it's always good. I frequent the Sawgrass restaurant and due to the amount of tourists, there is always a wait. But the restaurant is big so usually it's a 15-20 min wait. I don't mind the wait as I brow through their plentiful menu. Portions are large so bring your appetite. I always leave with left overs. Parking is always full do to the theatre, other restaurants, mall and BB&T center across the street. Valet parking is availble.  Dessert... well what could I say... the name says it all !!!"
M. S.,"Miami, FL",46,22,6,4.0,3/2/2011,"So I was at Sawgrass with friends and the decision to come here was a piece of cake (cheese, of course)... This is one of the few restaurant chains that I trust to be consistently good no matter what location I visit. This encyclopedia others call ""the menu"" is just bound to have many things anybody will like. Aaaaanywho, this review is about this specific location: The server was very helpful and full of opinions. I'm not the type that expects the server to have tried EVERYTHING, but come on, sometimes I need a little help. In this case, he helped us choose, and better yet, they were great choices!  My friend recommended the pear pizzette, and holy crops, no other dessert comPEARs with that! (Sorry)...  Overall, a very good experience! Anyway, I know, It's just the Cheesecake Factory, and you've probably been there. But even big, multi-million dollar restaurant chains deserve a positive review ;)"
Xuefan Z.,"New York, NY",36,30,,4.0,5/31/2011,"It's cheesecake factory~ it's the same as the other cheesecake factories out there. There is huge selection of food, making it a good eat-out place for company as there is something for everyone. It's a bit pricy in my mind, but the food is pretty good :) I always get the same thing... shrimp scampi, with angel hair. It's so good! The service is normal CCF service. It's at a convenient location though, which is in the beautiful outdoor part of Sawgrass Mills :)"
Mel R.,"Tampa, FL",26,11,2,3.0,11/15/2010,"was invited to dinner tonight and to my surprise the company was great, but the service was average I ordered the four cheese pasta (I'm just such a cheese lover) and it took forever to come out but at least the Sour Apple Martinis helped me pass the time.  To end the evening right a slice of original cheesecake was just amazing. Nice place to enjoy a good meal and good conversation."
Steve D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,15,2,1.0,1/25/2015,"Entered to eat this evening with my wife at 8pm.  We asked for a booth in the back and we waited 15 minutes. Not bad and is what we were told, however, we were not seated in the booth we requested so we were told 15 more minutes.  While waiting I went ahead and ordered two pieces of cheesecake to go for later.  The gentleman ran me up and closed out my order and I waited for my two deserts.  After fifteen minutes I asked him where were my deserts?  Incredibly he forgot to get our order and we had to wait again.  NP  Our table was still not available anyway and we spoke with manager Antonio who was very nice and apologetic about our experience thus far and personally ensured we got the appropriate booth within five minutes.  After being sat my wife and I both ordered the shrimp scampi as we do two to three times each month here.  The scampi is usually awesome and to die for (were addicted to the sauce).  On the visit tonight it continued to go down hill when, after 25 minutes, we were served cold shrimp and pasta so over cooked it was one big clump of rubber.  At this point we were ready to go and chaulk it up as just a bad night.  Evidently our server Cydney, who was very nice as well, let the manger know about our scampi and desire to leave.  The manager, Sandy, came by our table and asked what was wrong.  I told her the shrimp was cold and I also proceeded to show here how the block of pasta was overcooked she snapped ""I can see you don't need to show me"".  It was evident in her tone the she did not want to be there..... Seems she was having just as bad a night.  Sandy asked if we wanted our scampi replaced (over an hour now) we declined noting she really didn't want to be bothered.   On our way out we ran into manger Antonio again who inquired about our visit and we told him the mishaps.   I mentioned to him that after not even getting to eat I thought it was in bad taste that manager Sandy charged my wife for her glass of wine she never finished after such a bad experience.  Antonio agreed and asked us to please stay for a minute because it was his duty to make sure we leave happy and was going to be right back with us.   This is where they lost two good regular guests.  After five minutes Antonio returned and stated ""I am so embarrassed to tell you that Sandy took our meals off our check but insists on charging for the wine (even though it wasn't drunken) and she is senior to his position and there is nothing he can do"".  After getting crap service, crap food, and an attitude from Sandy on top my wife and I just looked at each other and we left for good.  As long as Sandy is employed at The Cheesecake Factory this restaurant is on our ""STAY AWAY"" list.  Fortunately they have a sister company next door Grand Lux Café (run very well) that just got some more regular customers."
Rusty S.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,37,,4.0,11/8/2010,"As others have said, you'll always get a good meal at this Cheesecake Factory location.  It's not five-star food, but it's always satisfying.  The fact that the kitchen can always churn out good food with such a large menu has always amazed me. As with all Cheesecake Factory locations, the portions are enormous.  The appetizer salads are the size of an entree salad at any other restaurant.  A bowl of soup is literally a bowl... about two bowls at any other restaurant or four cups.  My wife and I gave up on trying to order an appetizer soup/salad for each of us because we were full by the time our entrees arrived. We've since resorted to ordering one appetizer to share.  Our favorite is the Avocado Eggrolls.  If they come out soggy, send them back because when they are crisp, they are one of the most delicious things on the menu. If you've never tried the Pumpkin or Pumpkin-Pecan cheesecakes, get out there before they go off of the seasonal menu.  They are fabulous.  The pumpkin goes down sweet but you get the full pumpkin aroma in the back of your nose and throat just as you swallow.  I never liked pumpkin anything before, but these two desserts are great. My biggest complaint with this location is the table layout.  In the center of the interior dining room are two long benches with alternating two-tops and four-tops.  If we are unfortunate enough to get seated at one of the two-tops, it can totally ruin the dining experience as the adjacent four-tops are only one foot away.  If you get two families with children on either side of you, be prepared for a less-than-enjoyable evening.  My recommendation to the management would be to put all the four-tops and two-tops together as much as possible.  At least couples would then be seated together and be able to enjoy their meal without their conversation being drowned out by larger parties.  Worst case, tell the hostess you're willing to wait for one of the few two-person booths."
Joe B.,"Weston, FL",10,5,,2.0,5/26/2013,"Short wait for a seat which was great! Now I understand why. Slow and lack of attention from service staff. Food was poorly sauced and executed. Overall= the martini was strong, that's all the good I have to say about here."
Roland M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,6,,1.0,11/13/2013,I used to frequent this restaurant years ago when it was good but over time it has gotten worse and worse. They used to serve decently sized portions but go there today and you are lucky if you get a sliver of chicken with your chicken salad. The waiters are rude and talk so unreasonably loud over everyone that it deafens your ears. Like standing next to a speaker. The food is overpriced and served cold. We had to wait more than an hour to get any food. I'm taking my business elsewhere.
Debbi N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",96,233,181,4.0,7/5/2012,"Today I realized I have never reviewed this place and I have eaten here dozens of times, in Cheesecake Factories all over from Boca to Aventura and this one in the Sawgrass.   I usually meet people here since it's halfway between me and some of my Boca/Parkland peeps.    It's good for lunch, never really go here for dinner for some reason.   My favorite thing is the BBQ Ranch Chikcen Salad, but it's not really figure friendly.   Has a  yummy dressing and fried onion rings, so today I tried the Skinny Licious Menu.  They absolutely know their clientele and always seem to get it right.  I had a turkey and avocado sandwich with bacon and a side salad, and how it's skinnylicious, I'm a little suspicious but it was good.  My friend had the BLT and enjoyed that too.   We split the skinnylicious flat breat and it was just licious, skinny or not.   No cheesecake for us, I never seem to have room or the nerve to eat it, but if you are with a big group, or have a better metabolism than me, go for it, have never had a bad piece of cheesecake here.  The truth is I have never had a bad meal here and have liked everything I have ever ordered in all the years I have gone here.    The good news, it's not as popular as it was in the beginning, so I don't have to wait on line to get in for lunch, not sure about the dinner scene."
Harm A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",56,8,2,3.0,1/25/2013,"Ordered a roasted pear and bleu cheese salad. Would have been nice if there were even a single piece of roasted pear. The rest of the family's meals were good, as was the service."
Esther B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",344,331,,4.0,3/16/2012,"To my amazement, I have not previously reviewed this restaurant. I have been eating here for years, and don't think that I have ever been dissatisfied. The menu is pretty much a book. I do not know of any restaurant, anywhere, with this many menu items. Here are just a couple of my favorites: sourdough bread is heavenly! Chinese chicken salad. It's the best one anywhere (and the prettiest too). Lunch portion is smaller, and still huge. Sweet corn tamale cakes...just total yumminess. 3 beautifly presented corn cakes (slightly sweet) atop a long leaf of corn, garnished with guac, sour cream, and the most delicious sauces. This is a unique and amazing dish that will have your taste buds dancing! Fried mac and cheese balls...need I say more? Review would not be complete without a mention of cheesecake. Everyone has their fave. Mine is chocolate raspberry truffle. Two pieces of advice: 1. Share whenever possible. 2. Save room for cheesecake. Management does things right, and service is usually great."
Sean S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",75,71,,5.0,7/4/2015,"ok, normally I would be a 3 for cheesecake factory... they're all the same, all cookie cutter... but my server was so nice and attentive I went 5 stars."
