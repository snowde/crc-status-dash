Armando G.,"Winter Garden, FL",68,215,461,4.0,7/11/2015,"Other than the usually long wait, I love every single thing about The Cheesecake Factory. They have great appetizers, great entrees, delicious cheesecake and good service...and great free bread.  Favorite appetizers: Tex Mex Eggrolls, Avocado Eggrolls, Fried Mac & Cheese, Buffalo Blasts, Thai Lettuce Wraps and Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes.  Favorite Entrees: Chicken Di Pana, Caramel Chicken, Orange Chicken, Spicy Cashew Chicken and the Monte Cristo Sandwich.  Dessert: Any and all cheesecakes.  You just can't go wrong here."
Mark F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",3,87,,3.0,7/17/2017,"I have been to many Cheesecake Factory locations, and while they are all similar in decor, food selections and business model, and I like them generally, this is the worst one I've been to. As far as the food, I ordered the ""skinnylicious"" chicken pot pie. I specifically asked the waiter how this dish can be made with less calories as indicated on the menu, & he specifically said ""the pastry shell is extremely thin."" I had no problem with that. But what I was served instead was, literally, ONE bite-sized piece of chicken. I had to complain, and the apologetic waiter brought some more chicken. Unfortunately, we didn't see much of our waiter, and had to flag down someone else for drink refills. I can only assume that this location's mediocre rating (I would give 2.5 stars if possible) is due to its captive audience of many thousands of shoppers (most of them tourists) at the Sawgrass Mills outlets. They don't do better because they don't have to, but the good part is, I don't have to go back."
Jules G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",144,3,1,5.0,8/20/2016,The lady was nice she asked us if we wanted anything  or are we ok and the cheese cake was excellent  I would  definitely come back the Oreo cheese cake was a success
Maria D.,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",47,59,42,5.0,11/14/2015,"Big, noisy, full of people.  Multiple choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Small and big sizes, low calorie, kids meals. Cheesecakes are from heaven. Better to share. I tried Ultimate Red Velvet cheesecake and a hibiscus limonade :) highly recommended"
Michael M.,"Reno, NV",46,115,21,2.0,9/8/2015,"I have been to Cheesecake Factories around the country and am sorely disappointed in this location. When I first heard there was going to be a Cheesecake Factory in Reno I was very excited since they are always great in other cities.  The decor is the same at all locations and is very nice, nicer than say a Chilis or TGI Fridays. The food is ways great as well and is at this location as well. The thing that isn't the same is the service. I have been to this location multiple times and the food has always taken a long time to get and the waitresses seem like they are brand new and don't know what they are doing yet. It has been a while since I have gone here and not sure I will even give it a third chance or not. With so many great local restaurants in the area it's hard to justify giving an upscale chain restaurant a third chance in my opinion."
Dylan W.,"Panama City Beach, FL",0,16,,1.0,1/1/2017,The thought of eating here scares me. The entire experience is awful and over priced. This particular location is extra horrible due to all the tourists wheeling around luggages from shopping. Food is disaster. Never understood why people prefer 300 fish options and food from 50+diff countries --of seriously crap quality food most likely 75% menu is FROZEN vs a simple easy menu selection. It takes 46 min to review menu options. If I must put 1 star it's because the pumpernickel bread to start is good.
Alyssa K.,"Fort Myers, FL",383,471,35,4.0,8/4/2014,This review is based only on my experience with takeout at the counter the other day. I have been to this restaurant for dine in before; and while you will get good service and food-you will wait dearly for it: this is a primo location. The take out was pretty fast. The guy was flirting but wouldn't give me the half off cheesecake day discount (I was a day late!) so no go. Sorry ;) That being said it was easy to get what I needed and walked out of a packed house with 4 slices and a hungry car waiting. The menu here is enormous but that's every CF. I will go to CF for dine in: but not on a weekend night and likely not at Sawgrass. The place alone (and parking!) gives me anxiety. However I bet their waitresses make bank...maybe I should ask for a job.
Chris D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",42,3,,2.0,10/12/2016,"Dirty silverware, Server Christian doesn't know how to take down an order and the management has no interest in rectifying a bad experience. I love Cheesecake but won't be back to this location. Next time I'll hit up California Pizza Kitchen next door if I'm hungry in the area. My girlfriend had her food come out well cooked, it would have been nice to be able to eat with her since we, you know, went out on a dinner date together. 2 stars for the Old Fashioned Whiskey."
Rossmari P.,"Miami, FL",159,68,45,5.0,12/12/2015,"Good food, but cheesecake are amazing! Are bigger and very ñumy ñumy. Price are not chipper, but well some days you can give you a pleasure.  Nice place."
Inas A.,"Davie, FL",0,12,20,2.0,5/22/2016,When with strawberries expecting to get more than a couple of slices.... And no coffee after 10 minutes of waiting.
Okan A.,"Donaustadt, Vienna, Austria",0,1,,5.0,7/2/2016,"Perfect! I've been there many times. It is always perfect, good taste, affordable cost, quick service."
Harris D.,"Atlanta, GA",0,2,,2.0,11/26/2016,"The food here is decent.  We had a nice waitress. However, I'd like for management to be mindful of keeping the place more tidy. The table was sticky and underneath had lots of garbage; napkins, butter, and food particles all around the perimeter of the table.  The restrooms should be cleaned and stocked with toilet tissue every hour."
Korene S.,"Hollywood, FL",1,34,1,3.0,5/11/2016,"Took my mom and girls there to celebrate Mother's Day early.  Although it was a Saturday, we were seated within 15 minutes.  Server was nice, he never came back to refill my water though.  It was pretty busy so I understand.  I will never eat out on the patio again though, it is way too congested.  It is hard for two people to walk comfortably between the aisle and the tables are way too close.  When the person behind me pushed their chair out to get up, it hit my chair.  The food was not good at all.  I had the orange chicken and it was hard and dry.  I had to ask for sauce.  The rice and vegetable were good.  I will never order that again.  I have never had issue with their food, which is why I gave them 3 stars.  Next time, I will go to Grand Luxe."
Stephanie S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",12,96,39,1.0,4/26/2016,"Terrible customer service. I've been to this location several times. Before it has always been good food and good service. Today I spent 15 minutes waiting for a table, while they seated many people that came in after us. When we courteously asked the host how much longer it would be, he informed us our table was being cleaned and the people that were seated before us were actually seated outside. Then they called 3 more parties that had arrived after us and definitely say them inside. Incredibly rude, and I won't ever be back."
Maheen D.,"Cooper City, FL",7,12,5,1.0,4/20/2016,VERY BAD SERVICE and the manager is an extremely mean person. She was so mean to me when I complained that my food was late and that I had Been siting for 30 minutes. After that she told me that they couldn't serve me what I ordered because they 'ran out' of it and then replaced with my order with a cold steak. never ever going back there again
Casey M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",115,97,67,3.0,2/12/2014,"We generally really like the food that we get served at The Cheesecake Factory, and if it wasn't for the service this restaurant would absolutely give at least 4 starts.  However, the service is totally an issue here!  It seems like it is either a total hit or miss for us.  Sometimes we get a server who is great and have no issues, or it is like the polar opposite where we are sitting for 20 minutes before someone even visits our table. As far as the food goes, our favorites include the avocado eggrolls, chicken avocado club, and the cuban sandwich.  We literally always share whatever we get because of the massive portions. We will definitely be back, but our visits are frequently dampened by crappy service!"
Abbie C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",261,9,,1.0,8/23/2015,I came here with my family for brunch. Our waitress was very nice but there must have been something going on with the kitchen.  First I ordered an iced coffee. I think they just poured hot coffee over ice because it was very watered down and had no taste. As I'm drinking it my sister pointed out that there was a bug in it. Gross. I exchanged it for a hot coffee instead.  Then our food took an hour to come out. I finally got my omelette and took the first bite. I immediately knew something was wrong with it and I looked Inside and the bacon was so burnt it was black. They remade it but by the time they brought me a new one everyone in my party was done eating and I had lost my appetite.  We asked for boxes for the leftovers and a different waiter came and only had small boxes. When we asked for larger ones he said they didn't have any. We asked a manager for bigger boxes and he brought them right out.... My experience this time was very disappointing. I will not be coming back to this location.
Cedy H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",19,54,160,4.0,5/17/2015,"I've always been satisfied every time I've eaten here. I ordered the Chicken Pot Stickers for appetizer. They were seasoned perfectly and they were delicious. I enjoyed my Spaghetti and Meatballs for dinner. The marinara sauce was homemade and amazing. The meatballs were a bit dry, but I enjoyed every bit. I always order the Red Velvet Cheesecake for dessert. I even ordered an entire Red Velvet Cheesecake for my birthday one year. The waitress was very attentive and pleasant."
Kedma C.,"Miami, FL",2,9,4,5.0,5/15/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory. The service, and food is always great. Was welcomed right away, then seated. Our server was Michelle and she was awesome. Took care of everything I needed and checked on us to make sure we didn't need anything else."
Rachel L.,"Pompano Beach, FL",4,7,15,5.0,5/14/2016,My favorite restaurant to eat at. Everything from the food to the customer service is amazing! I always try a new chicken and pasta every time I go! Love the fried Mac n Cheese
