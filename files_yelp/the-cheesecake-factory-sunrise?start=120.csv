Shannon H.,"Tamarac, FL",2,14,17,4.0,8/5/2015,"I love this place so really it can do no bad in my eyes lol, had the chicken tortillas stuffed , my friend had a burger, and I think we got spinach dip as a appetizer. I love there corn cake that's come with it or whatever they call it it's so good. I had a unfortunate waiter who seemed like he didn't wanna be there, but wasn't gonna make him ruin my meal, so I just got another. I talked to him after dinner he said he didn't mean to make us feel like that, I understood everyone has a bad day but at least try not to show it lol. Other than that the food great , appetizer great, cheesecake great. I recommend the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake to die for lol."
Monét P.,"Colee Hammock, FL",135,23,13,5.0,4/16/2016,The wait wasn't very long. The food and service was great. The portions are satisfactory. We enjoyed our dining experience for date night! Side note: The Oreo cheesecake is so delicious!
Allen C.,"Miramar, FL",381,145,271,4.0,12/23/2014,"If there's one thing that Cheesecake Factory has been - is consistent. Nothing bad to say about this one or any other CCF that I've been to here and other places across the country. Good good and great staff make every experience amazing. The Food: You will always get your money's worth in food, and it's good every time. I'm simply amazed at the binge of dishes they have, which at times can seem a bit overwhelming. But whatever your selection may be, expect a well prepared and flavorful dish. The Drinks: I like sitting at the bar when by myself. The house wines are good. The mixed drinks tend to be hit or miss, but usually they're good. Only gripe is they sacrifice elbow room for more seats at the bar. Cramming more seats at the bar is a good way to send the wrong message to your customers. The Cheesecake: Does anybody actually eat the cheesecake here? You're usually too full at this point to even consider it. But I can say that they do have some great cheesecake. I prefer the strawberry cheesecake myself. Overall, it's a great experience no matter what time of the day you go."

Mike M.,"Pierrefonds, Canada",0,2,,5.0,9/21/2015,"***this review rates the gluten free menu*** The gluten free selection is not very big but, they indicate on the menu which items are so you don't have to ask. Our waiter was knowledgable and knew which items were gluten free off the top of his head which was a welcomed surprise (most people's eyes cross, answer ""yes"", then offer you bread...) The GF hamburger bun was the BEST one I've tasted so far. My wife and I both had the bacon-bacon hamburger. Delicious. Long Island iced tea...can you expect more than alcohol and ice? Sangria was delicious. Good service and the price is very reasonable for the portion size."
Jessie L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",44,103,23,3.0,11/30/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is always so over-crowded. Good luck not waiting at least a half an hour. Packed with your average fat fuck Americans who need cheesecake like a hole in the head. But last night I lucked out and came here with 3 other people and were seated right away. Upon being escorted to our seating area, the 4 of us almost slipped and fell. The floors in here were so slippery that we could've moon-walked to our seats. One issue with The Slip 'N Fall Factory is that their menu is like an encyclopedia, making it nearly impossible to order in a timely fashion. They have 2 pages of just ""Specialties"", which are mainly all chicken dishes. We found ourselves using the process of elimination just to order. I think that's why the wait times here are usually ridiculous, because most peoples' time is spent on deciding on what to order. Not to mention the horses who stuff their faces with cheesecake that park themselves for an hour or 2 after they're finished to digest their food, disregarding the other patrons waiting to be seated. The food is good. I don't think that I've ever had bad food here. The caesar salad was excellent, after they finally got to us. We saw one food runner whose GPS clearly wasn't working, walk past our table several times with our caesar salads. Later in the evening, he ran spaghetti and meatballs to the party next to us and he served it over the wall next to them, causing his dirty rag that he wipes up his sweat with to fall into the food. The oblivious people ate it anyways. The main courses were very good. About mid-meal, we called for a manager to inform him of the slippery floors and the bloody murder that occurred in the ladies' room. There was blood on the sink, piss on the toilet seats, and no toilet paper. The manager arrived, and he was of Asian descent, about 21-years-old. I've never seen a Chinaman so tall. He informed us that the slippery floors were grease from the food, and he said that he'd take care of it right away. He sent out a sweeper who I saw sweep up about 4 or 5 tiles, and the slipperiness was in every square inch of the joint. On exit, the floors were even greasier than before. The best thing about this place is their Red Velvet Cheesecake. It's to die for."
Jose A.,"Pompano Beach, FL",22,31,2,5.0,2/21/2015,"I am a regular here and it is one of my favorite places... Plates are big and though I have tried many dishes they never disappoint.. The menu is extensive and have many different cuisines to satisfy anyone from the sophisticated foodie to the 5yr old that wants fries and chicken fingers... Service is consistent and though they rarely make mistakes when they do they Really good at correcting whatever went wrong. The place can get busy at times but it is always a satisfying experience. Prices are fair.. Not pricey or cheap...  To sum it up I wrote a Song it is called ""everything is awesome!"""
Jason H.,"Chicago, IL",104,361,3,3.0,1/19/2014,Given the location and size of this place I'm sure they're basically printing money. Miraculously found a seat on a Saturday afternoon before heading over to the Panthers game. Enjoyed my stuffed chicken enchiladas but my Dad wasn't a big fan of his chicken pasta. The piece of chicken I tried was extremely salty. Not a bad option...if you can get in.
David S.,"Miami Gardens, FL",4,8,19,1.0,3/25/2016,"Cheese Cake Factory not what it used to be. Been a couple of times now and had to send food back. Poor food quality. Maybe too many people to handle....Will not be my first, second or third choice anymore."
Bianca B.,"Hollywood, FL",62,112,66,3.0,1/2/2015,"Pros: very family friendly.  Interesting decor and great cheesecake!    Cons: Well our waiter disappeared for long periods of time and the food was okay. I enjoyed the sun dried tomato and chicken Alfredo pasta but that was the only thing that I didn't have to extra for having chicken in it. I find it quite ridiculous to have Fettachini Alfredo pasta having no chicken in it unless you pay extra. The cheesesticks were okay. My brownie dessert was very good. Honestly, I was not impress by the food  and it's not because it was nasty, but it was because the prices were unreasonable and I've had better at Olive Gardens and even Fridays. The cheesecake was amazing but what do you expect from a place called the Cheesecake Factory?  Will I come back, maybe. Was the food good? Yeah. Is it overpriced? Absolutely."
Nik M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",6,29,1,5.0,3/4/2016,Cheesecake Factory is always great. The menu has tons of options. Our food was a little slow to come out but the server more than made up for it with her attentiveness. She also made a point to talk to our 2 year old son and and entertain him. When we did get out food it was worth the wait. I don't think I have ever had a bad meal here. I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is great value for the money. The portions are huge!!
Tanya B.,"Hollywood, FL",0,19,12,4.0,2/2/2016,"Love this place, I don't even eat cheese.  Even for some one who dose not eat cheese The Cheesecake Factory has a wide verity off food. Let's not get me started on the dessert. I always find something good that is not cheesecake. A great place to cheese eaters and non cheese eaters alike."
Naveen N.,"Midtown, Detroit, MI",7,348,,4.0,12/25/2015,Standard Cheesecake Factory menu. Waitstaff was quick and friendly. Cheesecake was delicious.
Nicole R.,"Brooklyn, NY",393,116,37,4.0,1/14/2013,"Mmmmm....cheesecake. People have been to ""The Cheesecake Factory"" time and time again and know what the deal is, but I love The Cheesecake Factory! So I will review it! My favorite location is in Florida, of course. Everything is always better in warmer temperatures with a little sun. Located in ""Sawgrass Mills Mall"" (Largest mall in south Florida) this Cheesecake Factory is large. What I also like is that  this particular location of the mall is all open, with no rooftop. So you can dine at the seating area outside(which I prefer) and enjoy the nice weather.  Whenever I go down there, I prefer lunch at the cheesecake factory. Their menu is ridiculously huge. I look through about 10 times just to narrow it down to atleast 3 options lol. They had this burger, which I don't see anymore, unless they changed the name, but it was a huge burger with cheese and lettuce and onions and tomato and a perfectly cooked egg right on top. And yes, it's simple enough and a lot of places serve a burger like that, but this one is done really right. Yum! I also love love love their ""Spicy Chicken Sandwich"". Crispy chicken breast covered with melted cheese(your choice) and either spicy buffalo sauce or chipotle mayo served on a brioche bun. I'd go with the mayo. It's a really big sandwich too, even I can't finish it!. I've also had their ""Kobe burger"" which fell in the category of not so great, but i'll give it another go, just to make sure.  They also have this really great lunch special with their pizza menu. It comes with an appetizer (I get caesar salad) and you choose any one of their pizzas. And guess what?! It's unlimited! Their pizza is really good too. I recommend the ""Tomato, Basil, and Cheese pizza"".  So you see, even though  the Cheesecake Factory is a chain and everyone has been there, it has some really great eats. And you just might enjoy it more in another place like I did in Florida."
Danielle R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1210,879,2797,3.0,12/6/2012,"Not the best experience I've ever had here and throughout the years I've dined here more than 10 times. Server was overwhelmed and it took a while to get bread, water, drink orders, drinks, more drink orders, food order, and checks. Their new Skinny-licous menu is what saved them in my opinion, everything is under 590 calories [they don't disclose fat grams which I would like to see] but it's a start! AND they have like 40 options on this menu. If you can sidestep their Cheesecake selections you can eat healthfully here!"
Susan E.,"Boca Raton, FL",34,69,127,4.0,10/25/2014,"Appetizers, salads (luau, my personal favorite) small plates, large plates, sandwiches, pasta and so much more. Every kind of cheesecake you can think of."
Melissa Y.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",17,81,70,3.0,10/4/2014,"I hate being that person who gives a poor rating for bad service. But I can't help it - it was so bad it felt almost personal. (Yes I'm so sorry I sat in your section as a SINGLE diner. How dare I?!) That said, the food was just as I've come to expect from the Cheesecake Factory - reliably tasty and generously-portioned. This location is a pretty big pain unless you're in the mood to drive around for twenty minutes looking for parking, then walking a half mile to your destination. But on an off-peak time this shouldn't be an issue."
Linda M.,"Boynton Beach, FL",3,71,15,5.0,12/21/2015,Love that place specially after a long  day of shopping. Always nice and delicious plates. Never left disappointed! Four cheese pasta with shrimps and chicjen jambalaya! !
Stephanie R.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",59,142,952,4.0,10/2/2014,Love the lunch specials perfect portions and prices. The cheesecake factory is slightly overpriced but offers good service with decent quality food and portions.
Terrence G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,5,,5.0,2/9/2016,Sometimes the wait can be a little long but the food and service is amazing!  Would recommend for anyone with an appetite for quantity and quality. One of my favorites! Also doesn't hurt to have as much variety as they do.
