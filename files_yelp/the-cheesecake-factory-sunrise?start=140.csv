Elizabeth M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,17,,4.0,3/11/2015,"Went here for date night with hubby on Saturday. It was my first time here and I was very excited! The menu is a little overwhelming because of all the options, but we started with Raspberry Lemonades and Chicken Pot Stickers. Very good. I ordered a delicious angel hair pasta dish with mushrooms and a lemon sauce and lemon chicken and hubby had fried shrimp. We both loved our food and got filled up fast. Our lovely server, Joanna (sp?), offered to box our food for us. We finished with the Oreo cheesecake which was to die for.  Overall we had a good time. The food was excellent. It was a busy place though with a lot of people walking around quickly -- almost got knocked over a couple times. We will be back, though. (-:"
Sherri B.,"Little Rock, AR",18,17,52,5.0,9/20/2013,"My husband and I stopped here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. I had a half order of the Asian Chicken Salad. It was excellent and definitely enough to satisfy my hunger. It is my favorite salad and I've ordered it from several restaurants from Los Angeles to Florida and states in between. The Cheesecake Factory makes one of the best. When I told the waitress what I wanted she said, ""excellent choice"" (it is her favorite salad also).  The service was great. The restaurant was clean and the decor of the restaurant is beautiful; of course if you've seen one Cheesecake Factory you've seen them all. We were there during a time that I gather was the post church rush so we did have to wait but the wait was handled in an orderly fashion and it was a normal wait time considering that it was busy.  This Cheesecake Factory location is by an outlet mall, you can park yourself or you can valet park."
Jessica B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,8,3,4.0,7/7/2016,"The desserts are very good. In fact, the rest of the menu seems pale in comparison. If you have a small child, ask for the ""kids bread plate"" when you first get seated. They will give them a plate with bread and fruit to hold them over and then the adults have more bread to themselves."
Howard P.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,4,,1.0,7/31/2016,One of our consistent place to eat. Tonight was disappointing for our 10 year old grandson who could not get a well done hamburger after two tries and an hour later by their managers. Very apologetic but how do you let a ten year old not get his hamburger and leave your restaurant with no food. Hum. Oh. Yes they left him fries and bread.  It should happen to your family the next time.
Ernesto M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",167,117,62,4.0,7/10/2014,Cheesecake is one of my favorite chain restaurants and the other affiliates are pretty decent also. What can I say about cheesecake that the whole world doesn't already know? They have good brunch??  Yes they do!  Umm their freaking cheesecake is amazing!!! There you go enjoy.
Alex G.,"Pompano Beach, FL",184,74,566,1.0,5/10/2015,"Absolutely disgusting staff . We arrived and was told that we have a 45 to 1 hour 15 minute wait . We waited and in the duration of it a party of 6 came in and waited 15 minutes and were seated before us. As we are aware the Cheesecake Factory has no reservations so we knew it was a mistake that they let the other people go before us .We mentioned the error and instead of them correcting it . Sandy 1 of the managers was very deceptive and deceiving by saying they never said 45 to an hour wait . In in addition when we addresses her why did they go before us she responded ""Mistakes Happen Jesh ""We asked to speak to her manager as every tone that spewed from her mouth was riddled with a vitriolic message.Sandy was absolutely rude and raised her hand at us and said I don't have to talk to you. If your workers have pressure issues and can't respond to customers respectful and effectively then they shouldn't be in this field ."
Rebeca G.,"Miami, FL",130,23,130,2.0,7/16/2014,"I was convinced to go have dinner here. I probably hadn't been in about a year. Well I was reminded of why I don't like coming here to begin with.  We sat in the bar area. There were only a few tables sat, yet we still managed to get poor service. The server barely checked on us. I'm not sure why this occurs often at Cheesecake Factory, but it almost makes me never want to go back.  Onto the food. We ordered the fresh vegetable salad w/chicken & the grilled avocado club sandwich and an edamame to start off with. The edamame was good. The appetizer salad, which I ordered as an entree is enough for two people, but was drenched in dressing. The avocado club sandwich was very good. The bread was buttered generously, the bacon & chicken were both cooked well with just the right amount of avocado.  They have an extensive menu, full bar and amazing cheesecake. Get the Oreo cheesecake, it'll change your life!  Would possibly consider going back in the future for take out to avoid the service, unless something changes."
Carolyn J.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,10,21,3.0,8/4/2015,"Believe it or not, this is the first time I have ever been to this popular chain. I have heard all about it for years with jaw dropping comments ""You've NEVER been to Cheesecake Factory!"" So I was pretty amped to try their food and famous cheesecake. Needless to say I was not impressed. The server was efficient and it was VERY busy! I had the calamari which was tender but flavorless. I had to drown them in the two lackluster sauces that were included. I didn't get a full meal because I wanted to try their famous cheesecake...my favorite dessert....soooo disappointed. The array of cheesecakes to choose from was impressive, and they did look beautiful. However, it didn't taste like a ""real"" cheesecake. Honestly, the bread and butter at the beginning of the meal was the best part. Of course the company I was with made it all worthwhile!"
Robin T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",42,32,103,4.0,4/27/2014,"Sunday Morning Brunch! What could be better ? You should try the Brunch Combo consisting of two farm fresh eggs, crisp bacon and their delicious pancakes. Omelette are good too. The bread lately hasn't been up to par. Sometimes it's warm, baguette not crusty anymore. Overall a great place to eat."
Joan H.,"West Bronx, NY",25,2,,4.0,11/6/2015,I went last night with a friend of mine service with great quantity of the food was great something was however wrong with the steak it wasn't cooked the way we asked they immediately took it back and brought us back the one that he needed the manager also came out and gave us his apologies overall great experience the food tasted well
Emily R.,"Germantown, TN",40,253,623,4.0,2/22/2015,"Consistency,consistency, consistency ! This is the key to any good restaurant and that is what you get at the Cheesecake Factory. Always great service is a warm friendly clean environment. Good quality comfort food for any palate. They just never disappoint. Its predictable sound flavors are what keep bringing us back when we know we don't want any surprises. I know that at any Cheesecake Factory anywhere in the country my old favorites wi always be there to satisfy my cravings."
Doron S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",10,24,41,5.0,11/3/2014,Great food nice people and always have a good time and enjoy the food here seascape is our favorite in this restaurant
Pemig F.,"Miami, FL",0,6,3,2.0,5/31/2016,this is the worst location we ever visit the waiting time was no that bad about 15 minutes the table was no properly set up we have to ask for utensil and the plate for the appetizers for the 4th person our lunch took more than 30 minutes to arrive and on top of that the plates came in different times so the family have to wait in order to eat together. our plates were cold my jambalaya pasta look like was served long time ago the avocado club sandwich of my daughter literately was a big tomato cut it in 4 slices etc. the server was very distracted he came by the time we almost finished  I will commend to a branch manager to be around to fix those details o maybe they don't care because is a lot tourist that goes to this locations so they don't care about the locals
Tanya H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",101,73,84,4.0,1/12/2014,"I had miso salmon and brown rice, if you like creamy dishes this is the one for you. I can't remember what brown sauce topped the salmon but it was really tasty. Finishes off with colored de sol red wine, great evening. Waiter was really nice and helped us out with taking our pic!"
hank t.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",63,53,130,5.0,5/4/2014,Great meal. Six for brunch and except for the pancakes being overcooked everything else was spot on. Carlos and a trainee were very responsive and had no problem keeping the coffee and water refilled as needed.
Sue M.,"Orlando, FL",198,578,5462,5.0,5/1/2012,"As good as it gets.  We shared the Hot Cheese & Spinach Dip as an appy. Fantastic!  The artchokes were smooth and the shallots added the perfect touch. For an entree' I had Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. The description of it is exactly what you get. All fresh ingrediants. Penne w/roasted eggplant, artichokes, oven dried tomatoes, etc. It was extremely filling! The server was fantastic. Even though it was packed he kept checking w/us constantly. A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for. And it's worth every bite!!!"
Lee Z.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",22,323,688,4.0,2/20/2015,"This location is always crowded.  But no matter how many times I go, the food and service are always good.  I like trying different cheesecake when I go.  Always delicious.  If you are a chocoholic, try the Godiva cheesecake....YUMMY"
Dewey C.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",180,256,2126,3.0,11/9/2014,"I gave four stars because of their new calorie conscious menu which is both reasonably priced and is nicely designed to offer something other than the heart attack specials this joint specializes in. At the Sawgrass Mall (my first visit since they opened, as I hate malls, with a few notable exceptions) I was surprised that the help was so pleasant and fast. They were all good and the waiter was especially on his game. The menu in question is more or less what you would expect a low cal Cheesecake Factory Menu to look like and they do it well and the food is tasty. NO WI FI, an outrage."
John L.,"Toronto, Canada",0,2,,4.0,7/29/2015,"Shopping at the Sawgrass Outlet Mall in the hot Florida summer is tiring.  You want to rest and have a good meal though not necessarily a fast food meal.  Consider the Cheesecake Factory.  The servers are fast and very friendly.  The food was fantastic.  We tried the Americana burger, skinnylicous burger, factory burger, Asian wraps and a red velvet cheese cake.  My son thought his Americana burger was the best burger he ever had.  It was moist, sloppy, juicy and delicious.   For people who complain about the wait, it is a sign that the restaurant is popular not a nuisance to get food.  In this case, the food was worth the wait!"
Jacquelyn M.,"Delray Beach, FL",618,394,728,4.0,12/21/2011,"This location is always crazy packed looking.  However, be sure to talk to the hostess because it may only be a few minutes of a wait.  The appetizers are great here.  I love their spinach dip, artichokes and zucchini options.   As for the meals, my two top choices are the skinny veggie burger and the four-cheese pasta.  The skinny veggie burger has onions in it, but you cannot taste it.  (If you read my previous reviews, then you know how I do not like onions). When a friend and I came here on a weekend for lunch, we asked the waiter about happy hour.  Apparently, they do not have happy hour.  The waiter said they do not, but I am sure it is happy hour somewhere.  He was a riot.  I wish that I remembered him name because he was offered us great service and was very funny.   As for the cheesecakes, they are all amazing.  I mean it goes with the name.  There is a huge selection to choose.  I am starting to crave one as writing this now.  Sigh"
