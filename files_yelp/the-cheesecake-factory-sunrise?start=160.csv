Jessica D.,"Coral Springs, FL",189,122,79,4.0,3/2/2014,"I have only eaten here one time. My father and husband took me here for my birthday last year. We came here on a saturday night, luckily we didn't have a wait. My first impression was that the restaurant seemed really busy and kind of loud. We were seated and our waitress introduced herself. She was very personable and friendly. She took our drink orders and we ordered a few appetizers. We ordered a quesadilla and something else I can't remember but I remember everything was good. Not spectacular but good. We then ordered dinner and everyone opted for burgers and fries. The burger was good but not memorable. Maybe I was more focused on the conversation then the food or maybe it's just the food didn't leave a lasting impression on me. Anyhow as far as the service goes it was top notch. Our waitress kept our drinks full, she was attentitive but not hovering and had a great personality. After dinner we opted for of course, cheesecakes. I ordered their most popular one the strawberry cheesecake. My husband ordered some kind of chocolate cheesecake. Our waitress actually brought my cheesecake out with a candle and everyone sang happy birthday to me. It was very nice. Overall I had a great experience at the cheesecake factory. I will be going back to try some of their different food."
Daniel T.,"Pompano Beach, FL",6,3,,4.0,7/18/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has yet to disappoint.  It had been a while since we'be been to a Cheesecake Factory and  we chose this restaurant for our date night because we had a gift card. We were thoroughly pleased. We went on a Thursday evening and were seated within 5-10 min (time we used to gawk at the desert windows). Our waitress, Paige, was attentive. The drinks were good.  The Mrs went with a Cosmo while I was happy with a blueberry Mojito. We also tried the Caribbean Cooler which was good as well.  I can tell u the 1-2 pieces of Dynamite Shrimp were tasty but u'd have to check w the Mrs on that one as she ate them all before I had a chance.   The entrees of Jumbalaya pasta dish and Farfalle garlic chicken and shrimp dish were very tasty and satisfying. Their portions allowed us to take pasta home.  And of course the cheesecake! We asked for a slice of the key lime and vanilla bean to go, which were taken care off by the end of the night. No complaints.  Gift card or not we had a great evening and were very stuffed and pleased."
Adrianne S.,"Palm Beach, FL",24,26,1,2.0,2/27/2016,Besides the service I can't say much good about our dinner tonight. Other times I've been here it has been great. My pasta was over cooked and lacked chicken I paid extra for. My husbands steak tasted burnt and green beans were over cooked. The bathroom was a mess. Definitely not worth the price tonight.
Jennifer K.,"Markham, Canada",114,5884,49859,3.0,11/21/2009,"We always come and have a late dinner at the Cheesecake Factory after shopping the whole day at Sawgrass Mills. There is no Cheesecake Factory up where I live, so it is always a treat coming here. The portions are huge!! The first time we order this Ceasar Salad to share... I was full after eating that mountain of lettuce! The Angus beef burger and the pasta are the dishes we usually orders. We never has a chance to taste any of the cheesecake! Always so stuffed after the main course... I don't mind coming here because the service which can be a little impersonal but is always attentative. And the food is ok.. not great, but is ok.. and after walking around the whole day I just feel like sitting down and just get some rest and it is convenient.. BTW, they send me a $10 gift card last time from doing a customer survey online.. so I might just use that to get a cheesecake to go as a late night snack.. ;)"
Kevin C.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",24,33,71,4.0,2/13/2014,"This is located inside of the Sawgrass mill at the oasis, the decor are alike with the other Cheesecake Factory restaurant. 3 of us have go back-and-forth 4 times to finally get a booth. The server was quick, Henry took our drink and quickly he come with the drink, then the appetizer, after salad and then the main dishes, shrimp scampi my wife's favorite dish. Of cause, cheesecake to finish off."
Minnie C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",34,53,8,4.0,1/24/2015,"Fantastic food, great atmosphere very rarely are we disappointed here. Fam  and I are regulars and we are usually very pleased."
Katie M.,"Tamarac, FL",381,226,374,3.0,1/14/2013,"Been to this location a few times. The food is always good and the portions are huge! Plenty of food to take home half. The food is kind of expensive to me but I feel like if I can take home half my meal, then the price is more justified when it's more expensive. I've tried a few items, but of course the cheesecake is really good. The dulce de leche, Godiva chocolate, banana creme, pumpkin (seasonal), and mocha are the flavors I've tried and all were delicious. The chicken and avocado club sandwich is probably one of the best I've ever had as well. I would recommend this place to my friends."
julie f.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",6,79,43,2.0,1/2/2016,"First of all when they tell you the wait is 40 minutes and  40 minutes comes and goes I'm totally not happy with the service. Went up to the desk and they say well waiting for tables to get up , over 1 hour later we are seated.  Long story short my food comes out and they tell us my husbands dinner they ran out of the fish why wouldn't they tell us when order was put in. So my recommendation go for lunch maybe and call it a day"
Yuri S.,"Schenectady, NY",0,3,,5.0,4/17/2015,Had the herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus couple days ago and it was delicious. They were really busy so there was a little wait but so worth it
Customer T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",10,96,12,5.0,5/12/2015,"Always great food, grilled salmon with potatoes and asparagus in lemon butter sauce, just delicious, as well as the quinoa salad, just great."
Nicole T.,"Wellington, FL",114,110,15,4.0,11/19/2010,"I am a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory! They offer an extensive menu of Americanized versions of eclectic dishes, and the prices are decent considering the giant portions! Although the menu is overwhelming (put in the form of a small book!), there is something that will suit everyone's taste at this establishment.     Last night my friend and I started with an order of the chicken samosas, which were very crisp and stuffed with well seasoned chicken. They were accompanied by a creamy cilantro dipping sauce, not too spicy but not too bland, very tasty. I also ordered the factory burrito, which was the size of my head! This thing was enormous! After eating almost half of it, I still had a full portion to bring home with me as leftovers.     Once again I had a positive, fulfilling experience here!"
Cindy M.,"Cameron, NC",0,177,11,5.0,6/15/2013,"I love Cheesecake Factory and I am definitely a regular at this location. My boyfriend and I used to live about 5 mins away and we came in at least twice a month minimum to order some drinks and some cheesecake in the least! We have also never had any problems with the staff there, we always have a good experience with the servers/bartenders and the wait has been crazy sometimes but they are really good about quoting a proper amount of time. I am in love with their snickers cheesecake and their passion fruit mojito. It is a sweet combination and it can get overwhelming but it is my only way. The snickers cheesecake has a dark chocolate base and then the delicious cheesecake with some caramel and chocolate on top and let me say that it is the most amazing cheesecake you will ever have! The mojito itself is a basic mojito but with an added passion fruit flavor and it is just refreshing and delicious.  I have had a long range of their meals and I don't think there's enough characters here to mention but the Louisiana chicken pasta is worth the time. The chicken is inside a thin crispy parmesan crust and then the pasta is tossed in a New Orleans creamy sauce and it is just amazing. The flavor of the chicken combined with the sauce and the pasta is exactly what you need any day of the week."
Ariadna P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",12,76,15,5.0,6/30/2013,"I want to give props to this location for no wait time! We went for dinner on Friday night and did not have to wait! This is the first time that happens at Cheesecake Factory.  The food was amazing as usual. I had the crusted chicken Romano which was out of this world. It is my favorite dish! I drank a Cosmo which was very strong, it kind of felt like I had three drinks after just one which made me want to stop. As for dessert, can never go wrong with the Oreo cheesecake. My oh my I can still taste it!"
Trupti T.,"Holly Springs, NC",66,220,1090,2.0,3/13/2013,"I wasn't too happy with this Cheesecake Factory. It started off badly from the start itself, we were told a wait time of 10 minutes but weren't seated even after 45 - response we are waiting on that table to get empty. That doesn't mean you don't look for another table to seat is. If we wouldn't have said anything we would have waited till the other folks left or would have had to personally go and request them to leave so we could eat. The server was obnoxious blurting out the years we were born in out loud. Took forever to take out orders. The water wasn't refilled, we had to flag him to get attention. Very slow service. When seated we were 7 cramped in a booth of 6, which was very uncomfortable. Many other places around the area to eat skip this one. The two stars were given because Oreo cheesecake was awesome."
Charlotte W.,"Toronto, Canada",109,473,60,2.0,9/28/2012,"I am not a really huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but as I was with my Canadian friends, they really wanted to try this place out (as they heard so much about it). I never order from their regular menu as I just can't imagine scarfing down a minimum of 2500 calories in one go. If anyone has ever heard of the book, Eat This, Not That, Cheesecake Factory dishes are often on the Do Not Eat That category...and for good reason too. One of my friends ordered the Chicken Little which basically was a plate of not-so-little deep fried chicken pieces. As he ate, the pieces actually seemed to multiply (that's how big the plate was). My bf ordered the Monster Burrito which comes on a lobster-sized platter. The waitress describes the burrito as big as a wrestlers arm, and she wasn't kidding - filled with rice, beans, guacamole, cheese and sour cream, this will be enough to feed an entire family. At Cheesecake, I always order from the lighter fare menu which lists out caloric content. I had a salad, but my salad came with a heap of rice?!?  My friends ended off with a HUGE slice of the Red Velvet Cheesecake which was delish, but nothing special. All in all, if you want a mega-caloric-artery-clogging experience, come to the Cheesecake. Service was friendly."
Gary F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,1,,1.0,2/16/2015,"So I finally decided to visit Cheesecake factory and I must say never again period!!! Here is a quick rundown of the disaster,  1) There were 3 receptionist loafing talking about their drama on Facebook, while my guest and I and another couple waited to be seated. 2) After being seated, we were brought very dirty food crusted utensils....Really, I say to be disrcrete he waiter says ""I dont see a problem"".  At this point im livid, We leave the drinks we ordered and walked out.  3) I MUST SAY THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER at that nasty disgusting place.. You want cheesecake go to Junior's in Brooklyn, NY, you want good food go cook it yourself! There a resolution for ya."
Thais A.,"Delray Beach, FL",223,235,95,4.0,9/12/2010,"Went here for brunch today and I was pleasantly surprised. Cheesecake Factory is always good, not amazing, but good. Brunch however is a different story. I ordered ""Renee's special"" -- turkey sandwich, garden salad, and broccoli cheddar soup. Everything was incredible. The soup tasted fresh, the mixed green salad was crisp, and the sandwich was perfectly prepared with just the right amount of turkey to lettuce ratio.  Girlfriend ordered the Napoleon French toast  which has now become one of my favorite french toasts I have ever had. It was a little ""mushy"" but a good mushy. very well dressed, loaded with fresh strawberries and as always more than enough food for two people. Cant wait till next Sunday for another amazing brunch!"
Nan J.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",13,17,1,5.0,7/30/2013,"Came on a late Saturday night and since it was pretty late, I figured everyone must have been too exhausted too care, but I was craving cheesecake so what the heck.  We didnt even have to wait for a table. The service was awesome, and so stupid of me but I forgot our server's name, but our server was very pleasant and actually smiled. :) The food came out quick, and it was delicious. All Smiles."
Christina O.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4,28,39,3.0,1/28/2015,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory dozens of times so I'm quite familiar with everything. Overall, it was good. We had Buffalo Blast as our app and it was delicious! My boyfriend said his Koby Beef Burger was legit! My meal, Chicken Stuffed Tortillas, has been better. The service was blah...I've had better."
Joshua G.,"Eatonville, WA",7,22,10,4.0,12/20/2012,"Given that this is a chain, I'm always amazed at the quality. I had my favorite dish there, the Steak Diane and Salmon combo.  It was wonderful as always.  The steak was cooked exactly as ordered.  The Salmon was not overcooked (which seems to be a miracle these days). I also ordered their popcorn shrimp and the batter was nice and light.  Good dipping sauce. And to top off the DECADENT factor, some of their Lemon Cello Cheesecake.  Which is great.  Wonderful fresh lemon flavor. The service was very fast.  I called in my order over the phone while I was about 8 min away.  When I got there my food was ready about 5 min later.  Which was really impressive since it was after 6pm and the place was packed. For those reviewers complaining about the calories... Come on... it's called THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!  Don't eat there every day and it's not a big deal.  You can splurge periodically.  And they do have PLENTY of lower calorie dishes to choose from. I've eaten at many of the various locations in my travels and found they are almost always very consistent in their food quality.  The one or two times I have had even the smallest issue with something not being right with my order, I was immediately treated to a free dinner on the house either that day or another day during my travel stay. The ONLY negative I could give this particular location is parking is a bit of a challenge as it's part of the big Sawgrass Mills Mall.  So depending on the time of day, you might have to hike to get in from the parking lot."
