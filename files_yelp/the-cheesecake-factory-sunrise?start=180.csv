Stian R.,"North Miami, FL",319,45,69,4.0,8/10/2014,"Had the chicken samosas and they we're awesome. The sliders not so much as they were so plain and bland. Plus poor presentation, but all over great experience. It's a big wait for the tables but go to the bar and it's way faster and service right away."
Joy J.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",27,87,5,4.0,9/20/2014,"Love the diversity and healthy choices on the menu. I ordered the ""small plates"" kale salad - and clam chowder because I thought it'd be a small salad. the clam chowder was delicious, and so was the salad - which is enormous, considering how packed it is with filling ingredients such as kale, nuts, raisins, apples and buttermilk dressing. I ended up bringing most of it home (the clam chowder was very filling!) and just ate it for breakfast. That's what made me think of writing a review. I rarely go to restaurants because of the expense and typical ""unhealthy"" food -  I love Cheesecake Factory. The kale salad, which would have been a whole meal, was about $6.00."

Sivaram V.,"San Jose, CA",89,257,74,4.0,9/16/2012,Never been to a Cheesecake factory just for the fact that everything on the menu is atleast 1400 calories... We decided to give it a try...they had the skinnylicious menu which had healthy low cal options and lots of them.... The ambience was classy..service was friendly... I got the edamame and the farro salad..my wife got the garlic noodles.... The salad was deliciosu with arugula...tzatziki sauce the barley and the feta cheese...loved it...LOVED IT....The edamame was good too.. From the name i thought my wife's garlic noodles would be tooo garlicy but it had sun dried tomatoes...asparagus...and delicious noodles with a hint of garlic.... We were stuffed so no dessert...but still..we learnt u can go here without having a belly busting meal...
T N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",12,37,193,3.0,6/14/2014,Love their Asian salad! But it's so big you can't finish it yourself. I wish it was smaller portion and lunch menu came with small (not the big one like you order) piece of cheesecake:) even with a couple of dollar extra. I always wanna eat cheesecake here but I get so stuffed I end up leaving without ordering cheesecake.
Kimberly H.,"Dania Beach, FL",4,188,48,2.0,6/27/2014,service was ok fair I have had better at other locations. This one hasn't been consistent with other locations regarding service otherwise ok nice and clean
Dan S.,"Sunrise, FL",17,11,3,4.0,11/15/2013,"The food is good and the service is ok.  Just the waiting time was long , I was waiting for 50 min.  The price is normal. I recommend to try just not on weekend only in the week days when line is sort"
Mark C.,"Cape Coral, FL",5,52,3,4.0,6/25/2014,Great food had amazing shrimp gumbo.nice and spicy. The cheesecake is obviously great..All of it...waitress wasn't the best or it would be a 5 star for sure. Love the cheesecake factory
Danny S.,"Hialeah, FL",7,12,49,5.0,8/17/2013,"As always amazing food amazing service. Outrageous chocolate raspberry cheesecake. I usually go to the one in Aventura Mall, and I gotta say for a Saturday night we only waited about 10 min. Before sitting down. I had a chicken asparagus soup and bread to start things off  and then as a main entry I had the  chicken farfalle, as always amazing"
Ivette R.,"Miami, FL",268,1047,251,5.0,10/12/2014,This Cheesecake Factory in Sawgrass Mills is awesome it's big and is still as fancy as all the other locations
Bianca L.,"New York, NY",160,131,87,4.0,7/21/2012,"Honestly, this place is really great. I am from New York and I still really enjoy this chain restaurant. The Cheesecake Factory has good food way beyond cheesecake. I've been there a couple of times every time I visit my parents in Florida and I have NEVER disliked my food. The clam chowder is AMAZING. Creamy, and oh! so so tasty :)  I've had a few of their burgers, but yesterday I tried the Macaroni and Cheese burger. It was ok... it does not taste like much. I think they could definitely make the ball of mac n' cheese a little more spiced up, and top everything off with a special sauce, or something. The fries are amazing, though! My mom had the bang bang chicken and shrimp and loved it. I've had some chicken chipotle pasta in the past (can't remember the name) and it was so awesome that I usually take that. The portions are so huge that I have to take the rest home and it's enough to fulfill my hunger at lunch the next day. And let's be honest, pasta is always best when reheated the next day. I had their Mai Tai, it was such a delicious cocktail! Can't wait to go back. All the cheesecakes are good... No need to mention them, everyone knows they are crazy good."
Pete O.,"Miami, FL",23,166,14,3.0,9/29/2011,"I will honestly say I HATE this place and you would never here me say, ""Let's go Cheesecake Factory."" Celebrated my mothers birthday here with my family and we are growing rapidly in number (15 in party; at one point last year were only 7). My family loves this place and I HATE it for one reason lousy, lousy, LOUSY service. I understand we have a large party food will take awhile but why did it take over 20 minutes just to take our drink order? Our waiters attitude was great he was very nice, just slow with service and forgetful of what we were requesting. The food is never a problem for me and although they did not have what i ordered this night (lemon herb chicken) it was replaced quite well by the Teriyaki Chicken. Appetizers, breads, and deserts are 9/10 times good. If the service was not so horrible I would love this place but even a party of 4 takes 2 hours to get in and out. Why? I'll never know most meals are very pricey anyway so there really should be no delay on the waiters part of how much he/she well get tipped. I usually just tip 20%, more or less if warranted by my standards. Thanks for the time fellow Yelpers, I hope you all have a much greater experience then I, here."
Steven D.,"Fort Meade, MD",5,327,10,4.0,6/11/2014,"Cheesecake Factory has a large menu, so its hard to say what is the best food to order especially when all you could think about is the cheesecake.  My favorite food to order is the Factory Nachos or Chicken and Biscuits or my meal, and the Snickers Cheesecake for desert."
Binh D.,"Cote-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grace, Canada",14,7,,4.0,6/1/2014,Quite impressed by quality of food considering the size of the restaurant. Burger was delicious and shrimp scampi pasta was very tasty. Service was courtious and fast and friendly. Thimbs up!
Herman G.,"Miami Beach, FL",173,138,163,4.0,5/1/2011,"How can you really review a cheesecake factory? If you've been to one, you've been to them all! The wait sucks, the food is good (and humongous), the service is meh. :-)"
German B.,"Miami Beach, FL",121,165,12,5.0,1/4/2014,"I love Cheescake factory. It's the best American food you can have if ypu really like it (yes, it's like 5000 calories per dish, but that comes with the pleassure of enyoing this kind of food). A very wide variaty menu, where you can find anything you're craving, one dish can be shared between at least two people, at a very fair price (you can say cheap) and you can't miss a cheesecake for dessert. My advise, share an appetizer, a main dish and dessert between 3 peoples, it will be enough food and you wont spend more than $10 per person."
Tom L.,"Punta Gorda, FL",0,32,19,2.0,3/22/2011,"We go here quite a lot when I am over in the Plantation/Sunrise area.  It's relatively convenient and the family likes the mall. Now let me start by saying I always order the same thing.  Everytime-no matter what CCF I go to and I have never been disappointed.  I order the little lunch special with the spring salad, chicken salad, and soup of the day.  it's cheap, good, and hard to screw up and none of them ever have. That being said my family are more adventurous with their food and they like to try different things.  Silly them when it comes to places like this. As noted by prior reviewers- loud, crowded, and slow with a long wait time just about anytime of the day.  Sometimes you are seated on top of the neighbors in those stupid little tables that I can't stand and you end up not talking to your spouse the entire time because either you don't want to talk about personal stuff within earshot of others or you are too busy listening to other talking about personal stuff. On this last trip our wait was only five minutes or so.  Then we were seated in a nice booth.  Shortly thereafter Jabba the Hut, our waitress arrived.  To say she was nasty would be an insult to nasty people.  She was downright rude and it seems we were far below her station in life and were interfering with her personal time.  I put an end to this quickly and had the manager changes waiters for us.  That put things back on an even keel. So we ordered and the food was served to the four of us at four different times since it seems the kitchen couldn't coordinate a four tops meal.  My wife's picata was OK but it was a cream sauce and was too salty.  My daughters alfredo was ok but it tasted like a jarred sauce.  Once again my old favorite was fantastic. I guess it comes down to this.  At least for the Cheesecake Factory find something they can't screw up and keep ordering that.  Stray from the path too far and you are going to be sorry. Will i go back again.  Sure, at least for my little lunch special.  I'll just be sure to carry enough garlic to scare the ogre wait staff away."
Carla L.,"Orlando, FL",1034,1383,20,3.0,1/21/2011,"Lets get the obvious out of the way, shall we? Yes to all of the below: Wait to be seated Crowded Loud Slightly overpriced (even for the lunch portions) OK, having gone over what we already know about all of the Cheesecake Factories in existence lets get down to service and food. The way to describe the service is ""stressed"", you can tell those poor servers were just going nuts with all the people they had to serve.  You could tell they all were doing their best to keep up.   Because of the incredible amount of foot traffic, they had to stand between the tables that were about 2 feet from each other.  ""What does this mean exactly?"" You may be wondering.  Well, that when they were talking to the other two tables on each side I had a very personal relationship with the servers butt.  That was just something I wasn't too keen on, not being a canine, it wasn't something I wanted at nose level. The food was abundant and very good so I have no complaints on that part.  I had the Grilled Veggie Pizza with Goat Cheese.  It was good eats.   The tea was as always DELICIOUS! The Red Velvet Cake with layering of Cheesecake was too big for 2 people even though it was out of this world."
Julie T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",272,588,1256,3.0,8/28/2009,"Huge, loud, always busy with slow service, and mediocre food. Is it really worth it? Every time I come to this place to eat, there's a line and a wait. The food is okay, but is it worth the crowded tables? Or the fact you have to yell at your neighboring diner to have a conversation. Not to mention the mind boggling book for a menu? I'm one that prefers to have a restaurant with one or two specialty cuisines. Cheesecake apparently has everything under the sun and it gets confusing. You have to go there and make sure you have a preference or your brain will be playing ping pong with which dish you should order. Everything I've had here is just plain okay. Nothing extravagant or to die for. I have a few people that love the huge burrito, and my father was extremely impressed with a lunch miso salmon. Me....I don't even remember exactly what I've eaten here other than a simple salad dish, and a chicken dish that was unremarkable. The free bread is scrumptious though, so I guess I could just go there for the bread and some cheesecake. I think the only thing worth getting here would of course be their cheesecakes. That way you don't even have to stay in the obnoxious dining room, but you will still have to put up with the lines, waits, and pure insanity at the front entrance."
Luisa C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",821,237,467,5.0,9/4/2011,"I am a fan of cheesecake factory. I think their service is always great and their food backs it up 100%. I have never left unsatisfied.   I recently discovered their Vegetable Chop Salad (about $13.95 w/ 3 oz grilled chicken), which has a great mix of veggies and greens in it.  It is served with chopped apples, beets, asparagus, edamame, tomatoes, cucumbers and some white cheddar cubes. They bring it with a pomegranate glaze and a balsamic vinaigrette.  I skipped the glaze and just used some of the dressing.  It is very tasty just by itself.  My boyfriend had the lunch salmon portion, which was fairly big.  They serve you a 7oz piece of salmon, almost anyway you want it.  He opted for the grilled version, served with 2 veggies (some veggies are $1 more) ($13.95)  Robert our server was very attentive, polite and patient with us. We will definitely be coming back here."
