Harvey D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",216,406,,2.0,3/12/2012,"I have eaten at The Cheesecake Factory many times and never really had a bad experience.  Until now...  This was my first time eating at this location and it wasn't great.  I had the Factory Burger and my wife ordered a pasta dish.  We had both ordered these menu items in the past so we thought we knew what we were getting.  Apparently not.... My wife's entree was significantly smaller than before with much less pasta than the times she had ordered it before.  My burger didn't taste great and I actually had trouble finishing it.  However, the most disappointing aspect of my meal was the fries.  They used to serve the shoestring fries and they would give you a huge amount of them.  They now not only give you less fries, but they changed the fries to a much thicker version and not as tasty.   We did have to wait approx. 15 minutes to get seated.  Out waitress was very good and she refilled drinks promptly and the food was served in a timely manner.   Overall, this location just isn't up to par with the other locations I have eaten at and I wouldn't go back here.  There are plenty of other Cheesecake Factories in this area so I don't need to go back here.  And I hope that they go back to their old style of fries!"
Rob G.,"Jackson, NJ",0,36,2,5.0,9/4/2014,"We ate here as a family and the food was excellent, the servers were really friendly. They managed our table with speed and accuracy, we had a party of 9. I would recommend this restaurant to my friends and family."
Phillip K.,"Mt Holly Springs, PA",8,3,,3.0,11/25/2012,"My wait time to be seated here was faster than other Cheesecake Factories. The staff was efficient, and the food tasted exactly the same as any other Cheesecake Factory in America."
David G.,"Boston, MA",1,19,4,4.0,2/15/2013,This a standard stop on my places to eat.  This is a simple chain but has better quality food than most chain restaurants.
Amy L.,"Hollywood, FL",47,34,7,4.0,8/19/2012,"I love this reliably great food, awesome selection of cheesecake...bread to die for..great service.a favorite of my whole family."
M M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,9,8,4.0,1/28/2011,"If you have a group of people who are all in the mood for something different then go to The Cheesecake Factory.  I don't know how a restaurant is good at preparing so many different types of dishes (from American to Chinese to Seafood to Italian) but this restaurant does it and everything is so good!  I've never had a bad meal here.   You will wait; sometimes 10 mins, sometimes 1 hour but show me a good restaurant in south florida where you won't wait at least 45 mins to be seated.  You have to wait to be seated everywhere down here. They even have an extensive breakfast menu that you can order off of any time of the day.   The restaurant is PACKED with tables, so it will be noisy and it will be crowded.  Even during the week for lunch it's busy.....but see...there's a reason....with such a huge menu everyone in your party will def find something they are in the mood to eat, and it will be yummy.   The portions are really big so you get your money's worth.  If you can squeeze in some cheesecake, their seasonal cheesecakes are really good and only available for a limited time (for example, pumpkin pecan cheesecake in October....so good).  You really need to split the desserts with someone or else take half home...again big portions.  Which is not a bad thing...not a bad thing at all...."
Steven Z.,"Parker, CO",58,45,6,4.0,6/3/2012,"I've never really eaten at The Cheesecake Factory before, just had coffee.  Since it was right next to the theater, we came here for an early dinner.  Huge varied menu.  I had the butter lettuce Asian chicken wraps, which though not gluten free for a Celiac person, were fine for me, and they were very good.  The place was really bustling at 5:30 on a Sunday.  They told us 15 minutes, but we were seated in 5.  After seeing MIB 3, (Imax 3-D is the only way to see it) we came back for dessert, and the place was still bustling, but once again we were seated in about 5 minutes.  I don't remember which cheesecake my son got, but it was good. My friend got Strawberries and whipped cream, a good choice for those watching calories or gluten free."
Scott C.,"Murrieta, CA",59,41,23,5.0,4/21/2010,Quite possibly my favorite restaurant ever. We finally made it there for Sunday brunch and it was so worth it!
Aaron A.,"Dania Beach, FL",102,51,24,3.0,2/24/2012,I am not a big fan of Cheesecake Factory. To me the only great thing about it (besides the many cheesecakes) is the sheer size of their menu.  Something for everyone.
hans simon f.,"Hollywood, FL",197,72,1046,2.0,6/6/2011,"Let's keep this review REAL!! I was a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory back in the day when it introduced itself to the South Florida dining scene back n the 90s. Now, and for a very longtime, I'm not really enthused about dining here. Apart from a very extensive menu that confuses the heck outta me, over time it become unattractive. So, I had a hankering for Ribs and since I was watching my carb intake, I scrapped the mashed potatoes and subbed for Asparagus. Ok, the beef ribs came room temp to the table, the BBQ sauce was good and the amount of asparagus served on the dish was meesly, a mere 6 stalks, after spending already $27 on the ribs and add another $7 to sub for the asparagus, come on Cheesecake, you can do better! Really, thoroughly disappointed, AGAIN!! I only went because my friend had a celebration dinner and I tagged along. The only pleasant surprise for the evening was our server that was efficient, organized and a pleasingly witty personality. Plus, the Coconut Chocolate cheesecake was really good and reminded me of an Almond Joy candy! Ok, even the cheesecake at the CF need improvement, a real cheesecake need ro have taht taste of cream cheese! Junior's Cheesecake, NYC!! thats all i have to say CF!!!"
Daniel V.,"Cusseta, GA",1,1,,4.0,6/24/2012,"Great lunch today with my family,almost no wait if you are in a small gorup but i saw people complaining of waiting too long,we always order the bruschetta as an appetizer even though is not on the menu by far is the best they got,the mexican salad was awesome,and the veggie burger was ok"
Jeff P.,"Phoenix, AZ",60,897,17,3.0,6/21/2011,"The usual tasty food and beverages here.  But, the service was disappointing.  How many times do you have to ask for a refill on your water?  You shouldn't even have to ask, it's pretty obvious.  The staff seemed oblivious to every request.  Fortunately they had red velvet cheesecake to make me happy again."
Carlos G.,"Austin, TX",25,117,25,5.0,7/3/2009,My favorite iced tea. Place is usually packed. Limited veg menu. Clean bathrooms. Parking is hell. Valet is a must. Lock your valuables.
Torrey R.,"Asheville, NC",92,133,47,3.0,9/2/2008,"Come hungry.  Leave with a doggy bag.  Cheesecake Factory is known for giving you huge portions.  Don't say I didn't warn you.   Salads are pretty good, pastas are better but I like the Mahi Mahi with mashed spuds and carrots.  I don't know what they do to the carrots but yum.  I think they put brown sugar on them or something. Don't forget desert.  The name kinda gives it away.  They have cheesecake.  All kinds of it.  If you like cheesecake you'll find something you like here for sure. This location is often a zoo with all the people.   Tip: Go on off hours or make a reservation.  Also, there are often bar seats available that people overlook when it's busy if you don't mind sitting at the bar."
Raquel E.,"Broward, FL",41,50,3,5.0,7/22/2009,"This has to be one of my restaurants in the whole entire UNIVERSE! lol The food is delish, the service is right on, the cheesecakes knock your socks off and the drinks hit the spot!! The entrees feed well over 2 people and you will leave with a doggie bag.  You won't regret checking out this place! If you go, lemme know how it goes for you!!  MY PICKS: Factory Meatloaf, Clam Chowder Soup (on Fridays), BLT Salad (2 pple), Crab Wontons and Guacamole Made to Order!!"
Alejandra M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",162,275,50,4.0,7/9/2012,"First of all, HUGE PORTIONS! My husband and I came here to have what we thought was a shared ""SMALL"" meal along with my sister and her husband who both ordered a ""small"" appetizer and when it all came out everything was HUGE! My husband and I ordered the meatloaf sandwich. Delicious! The side of mashed potatoes that seemed to definitely be homemade were outstanding! My sister ordered these buffalo chicken bites and it looked like a tower when it came out. My brother in law went for the Asian style sushi appetizer. I wish I remembered the name but after picking from their plates here and there I must say that everything was good! We of course had no room for dessert so I left with the Oreo cheesecake in mind. I opted to take out a star because this place needs a better method in organizing the large crowds of people waiting. Other than that I must say that for my very first time of going to the cheesecake factory I had a great dining experience!"
Katie H.,"Larkspur, CA",74,603,28,2.0,4/14/2008,"I don't actually hate the Cheesecake Factory. Depsite the often hellish waits, grotesque portions and mediocre service, when I have eaten at other locations, I haven't minded so much, given that I can get 2-3 meals out of one moderately priced entree, and the food is actually pretty tasty.  This was not the case when my sister hosted a post-baptism brunch here on Sunday. She arranged for a private room for our group of 17 and asked to have a table for the 6 kids and a table for 11 adults. The table was set in somewhat of a U sahpe, if the U had very short arms. It was impossible to see, let alone talk to, half of the people in our party.  We were given one server for our party, and she apparantly did not believe in using a tray, meaning it took her about 4 trips to get everyone their beverages. We were given a limited menu to choose from - ceaser salad and pesto pizza for me and a burger for my husband. The ceaser was so bland. My memory of the CF ceaser was that the dressing was creamy and garlicy. This was basically just oil. The pizza was just okay. My husband's burger was good, but overcooked (medium well when he asked for medium rare). The serving of the food was a complete cluster-F. My sister ordered a large pizza for the kids as soon as we sat down and asked that it be brought asap. It came 20 minutes later. Another 10 minutes later, the rest of the food started coming out - again without a tray jack and 2 dishes at a time. It was almost 15 minutes between the time the first person was served and the last.  By this time, my sister was fuming and asked to see a manager. She also asked that the cheesecake she had arranged for be brought out immediately as we had already been there almost 2 hours. At this point she was informed they didn't have a record of her ordering one!  Eventually they got one out, and didn't charge us for it. But based on that experience I would never return to this location, and I would not reccomend you host a large group here as they are clearly not equipped to serve a large party appropriately."
David W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",18,8,6,4.0,5/31/2013,"a Fantastic place to eat, but ask me how much it is for a bottle of bud !!!!!! $7 yeh man, thats Miami south beach prices, other than that, i do like this place..."
Mireille C.,"Hallandale, FL",1,20,,5.0,11/15/2013,Very good and love their gluten-free menu.
James B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",78,83,21,2.0,5/5/2008,"Hmmm after much hated disposition to TCF, I decided to give them another chance. My mother and I came here for an after-church brunch a la my treat.  We ordered the crab hash ($12.95) and a lunch portion of the Luau salad ($8.95).  The luau salad was presented very nicely with shredded carrots, mango, romaine lettuce, nuts, and shredded sliced(?!?!) chicken.  The chicken was more reminiscent of lunch meat chicken, but the vegetables were fresh and tasty.  The dressing was nice but somewhat overdressed for my tastes.  The fried wonton skin was nice and crispy but soon became soggy.  Overall, the salad was okay, and it was big enough to split between the two of us. So what happened?  The crab hash was a disaster.  Couldn't be salvaged.  I had ONE tiny piece of crab, the eggs were poached poorly and looked messy, the potatoes were overcooked and oversalted. And surprisingly, the presentation was awful and looked worse than a fast-food diner.   It could have used some fresh herbs!  For $12.95, this was worth maybe $3 to me.  Extremely disappointing! The service was pretty average.  Our server was nice because they ran out of the oat bread and he brought us out extra bread in the end.  Note that cheap bread cannot make me change my mind about that disgusting crab hash!"
