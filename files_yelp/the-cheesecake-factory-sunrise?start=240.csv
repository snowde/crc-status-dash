Patricia C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,6,,3.0,6/4/2013,"I was a little disappointed this time with the food. I got the Navajo sandwich because we just wanted a quick lunch, husband got the blue cheese blt burger. I found my sandwich to have no flavor at all, and husband said his burger had so much blue cheese that it overpowered the whole thing. Both items gave us acid reflux /indigestion. I usually have such a great experience with the food, despite having to wait for a long time for a table. This time was the opposite. We were seated fairly quickly for a Saturday, but the food was just not up to par this time around. I guess I'll stick to dinner here since I have had many a good one, and take my chances with the wait time. Overall - not bad, but not really good either."
Tim S.,"Miami Beach, FL",10,12,,3.0,1/25/2011,"Had the Baja Chicken Tacos, which weren't on par with everything else I've sampled in the years I've been going to Cheesecake factory.  On the bright side, the servers were very friendly and the burger my brother had was unreal.  I'll be going back, but won't have the same meal.  The tortilla wasn't tasty and the Tacos lacked flavor."
Wanda C.,"Pompano Beach, FL",11,11,,4.0,1/19/2011,I am a fan of the Cheesecake Factory and can't count on my hand how many times I went because thats how good their cheesecake is. Im also in love with their carrot cake and spinach dip.
Shari B.,"Wellington, FL",125,8,1,4.0,5/23/2012,"i'm not usually a fan of chains, but this is one of the best ones out there. the menu is way too long, but i usually get the same thing every time i go. stuffed mushroom small plate and the chicken lettuce wraps appetizer. it's more than enough food for a meal and it's delicious. i've been trying to copycat the mushroom recipe at home for years...still no success, so i guess i'll just have to go to cheesecake factory for more research ;)"
Lucy W.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",117,251,51,4.0,4/23/2011,"I don't usually like chain restaurants but I like Cheesecake Factory. A lot of variety and after many years, I came back for my birthday. I had the Chipotle pasta and my bf had the mushroom burger (not the portabella one). I liked the bread and both meals were tasty even though I found out the calorie content later. I must say they do have variety and despite the ridiculous wait lines (even during lunch), you get good food and service and a lot of choices even if they are a bit pricey. Not really but this is why I don't eat out much. The cost effectiveness and because God knows how much BUTTER and ""flavor"" they put in their food but it is tasty! Needless to say I skimped on their tasty 900+ calorie cheesecake slices but I did make one that was suppose to be their recipe and well, for almost 2 cups of sugar you can count on creamy tasty heavenly goodness... if it doesn't send you to heaven first because of how much sugar's in it."
Tommy N.,"Hollywood, FL",30,28,2,4.0,8/3/2010,"Who doesn't love a visit to a rare occasion of The Cheese Cake Factory? I came in for lunch, first thing that should catch your attention is the large variety on the menu. For the atmosphere, it had a luxurious feel, mix in with the soothing Egyptian portraits on the wall. We were warmly welcome with the brown wheat bread with butter after quickly ordering what we wanted. I ordered the factory burger, BUTTT! (big but) be careful because they literally mean factory, I bite into some kind of bone, soo called USDA selected =/ but i didn't let it ruined it's tastiness, as I munched on my company's dishes also =D Miso Salmon (delectable), Asian Chicken Salad (quite invigorating), Louisiana Cajun Pasta (Scrumptious). To finish the satisfying lunch, my sis order the award winning Red Velvet Cheese Cake, one bite sends into sinful bliss. 2 thumbs up for this CCF location, hopefully your burger won't be as surprising as mine."
Joanne W.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,18,,4.0,9/8/2008,"I like the cheesecake factory, not because of the cheesecake (frankly I think I make them better and I have to watch the waistline) but because I know what to get.  I don't mind the wait, because it is one of the busiest malls in the country and it is a cheescake factory.  I don't mind all the dissonance of noise, because I expect it from every large chain restaurant.    I don't mind the fair service, that is neither good nor bad, because every table is filled.  My husband ordered the baby back ribs here and it was remarkably good.  I had the Asian Salad and it was filling and the dressing was above average.  I took a bite of the cheesecake my husband ordered (a chocolate raspberry??) and while it was a little dry it was better than most restaurant brought cheescakes.  Don't come here for great service, out of this world food, and short waits.  Come because you want a filling meal while shoving through the mall on a shopping spree funding from credit card."
