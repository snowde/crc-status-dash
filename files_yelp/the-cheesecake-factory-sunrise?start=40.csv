Sean F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,2,,1.0,11/5/2017,The service here so bad that we just couldn't wait anymore had to leave will never ever be coming back to this place again!!!
Bianca A.,"Pompano Beach, FL",546,9,2,2.0,6/16/2017,"This place is never consistent with service . Sometimes the food is out fast and service is great , sometimes it takes a long time to get ur order today is one of those days . The last time we were here which was months ago the same thing happened . We used to be regulars . I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon . It's a shame , we used to love many items from their menu ."
Heather G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",39,65,81,4.0,6/5/2017,"Came here today with the fam for a graduation. Had a party of 8. Our server Jared (? So sorry if I misspelled that) was outstanding! Very attentive and on top of the drinks. I usually order the same thing every time I go so I was very happy with my tossed green salad from their skinnylicious menu. Passion fruit iced tea is so refreshing. Avocado egg rolls were on point. Two kinds of bread given with the meals. The people in our group who ordered pasta were not impressed with their dishes though. I only tried the chipotle chicken pasta which was strangely sweet instead of spicy and I didn't like it. Fish tacos were reported to be quite good. My sister had a chicken pot pie that was actually more like chicken soup with a round crust on top. Weird. But then came the desserts. Insert the little emoji with saliva dripping from its mouth. Never fails to impress. Everyone loved their cheesecake. The two graduates got a congrats written in chocolate syrup on their plates. Very cute. So despite the pasta fails, the desserts and Jared's service with a smile bumped you up to an above average rating, cheesecake. Thanks for being a part of their special day."
Ilene F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",240,348,2544,4.0,10/6/2015,"Went were today with a group of 10.  Shout out to great service by Dominick.  He handled all of our orders, they were all perfect.  No complaints about the separate checks.  No mix ups with the bills. He brought a handful of pens so we could sign our checks.  All in all he was GREAT!   I had a make your own omelet...egg whites, spinach, feta, mushrooms and avocado.  So delicious.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  One of the guys had the Mac and cheese burger, which he said was very good.  One of the girls is vegan and she was excited to see a variety of choices and had the vegan Cobb salad.   We arrived at 11:30am.  I thought it was odd that some other parties of 2 were told to wait when the restaurant was empty.  They also don't take call ahead or reservations for large parties."
Sam M.,"Boca Raton, FL",480,271,2416,4.0,6/14/2015,Today was a special Sunday because usually I play cricket on Sunday's and today was the first day of the off season so I decided to surprise Rabia at work and took her to Cheesecake Factory.  Now we have been to this location multiple times before but I have never reviewed it so I guess this was meant to be my 100th review for yelp. Now that's a century !!!!!! Cheesecake Factory are very similar no matter the location and the food is as always very consistent. The service is always 10 out of 10 and today was no different.  We ended up ordering fried zucchini and four cheese pasta lunch portion which is as big as the dinner portion just a couple of dollars cheaper. The bread is the best part of going to cheesecake very similar to red lobster cheddar bay biscuits.  The cheesecakes get an honorable mention as no review would be complete without mentioning the mouth watering desserts!!!!!!!
Joseph L.,"Hollywood, FL",0,2,1,1.0,8/10/2017,Took one of my customers to lunch there today first turn off the water had something floating around in it so my customer just ordered an appetizer I'm a vegetarian got the veggie burger the veggie burger had no consistency of a burger once you push down on a sandwich to bite it everything spewed out of the sides kind of reminded me of oatmeal and as a vegetarian I try not to eat out but when I do I rarely complain cuz I normally order a salad but this time I saw veggie burger so I said why not let's give it a try and OMG was that the wrong thing to do anyway I probably won't be visiting the Cheesecake Factory anytime soon and if I mistake I do I'd probably just get drinks and leave
Karoll F.,"Sunrise, FL",13,9,2,1.0,5/7/2017,"The wait time is too much for a simple salad with few servings of protein. Horrible customer service for takeaway orders, when I asked how much longer I required for my salad I was rude and the hostess had very bad attitude and I was ignored. I never come back!!!"
Kelly I.,"Mount Dora, FL",0,20,10,4.0,10/20/2017,"Food was excellent. Service was so slow. After thirty minutes we asked our waitress to check on our order. The waitress said she'd check and must have completely forgotten. Someone else brought our food. When she checked back and with surprise saw we got our food, I was astonished because she said she hadn't checked on it yet and we were half through. Wasn't offered a water refill until she took the credit card up for payment. Needless to say, I turned it down - didn't want to wait...again."
Colleen R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",231,186,514,4.0,2/23/2016,"Yes, The Cheesecake Factory is a chain, but there are many reasons it is popular. The food is consistent, the menu is huge, the service is significantly above average, the portions are large, and the prices are what you'd expect. And yes, the cheesecake is good (but definitely pricey).  Complaints revolve around how crowded the restaurants are and how long the wait for a table can be.  All of the above is true for the Sawgrass Mills location. Add in a terrible parking situation, and frankly, I usually avoid eating here. That's a shame because I've eaten here twice in the past three months and had a great meal and a good experience both times.  Friday night our party of three decided to try our luck at Cheesecake Factory around 6:30 pm. Both cars found nearby parking spots right away (unheard of!) and there was no wait to be seated (on a Friday!). Lesson learned - no one is shopping at that time on a Friday and crashing at Cheesecake Factory.  The hostess was very friendly and our server came by right away when we were seated. Soon after, our drinks were served, and warm wheat and sourdough bread was placed on the table. We loved the bread.  Recommendation - two new items on the menu were really great. The blood orange mojito my sister ordered was fantastic. It had a perfect mix of sweet and sour with a zip!  And the side dish of cooked carrots with pecans that I had was unbelievable. Sooooo sweet, and crunchy and just yum.  I really enjoyed my meal of herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and the aforementioned carrots. The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and came with a piccata-like lemon butter sauce. Delicious! The mashed potatoes were a pile of creamy starchy goodness. When dipped in the piccata-ish sauce, they were even better. There was plenty of everything to take home for another meal.  My family really enjoyed their chicken and shrimp meals as well, and we got cheesecake to go. I always recommend the chocolate mousse cheesecake if you're a chocolate lover like me! Overall, we had a really good meal - No wait, friendly and efficient service, and good food."
Dylan R.,"Lauderhill, FL",259,19,1,4.0,7/13/2017,Pretty empty for it being Cheesecake Factory which was nice As we got seated right away. Server was friendly but did forget our drinks! Food came out with appetizer ??? That's how you know it's slow. Lol. Food was good!
Nour S.,"Boca Raton, FL",2,35,36,5.0,12/18/2016,I stopped by the cheesecake factory in between shopping food was good my friend and I shared a couple of appetizers wasn't disappointed after a long day our server helped us through the menu and did a great job
Dara B.,"Sunrise, FL",118,395,398,5.0,4/5/2016,"Came here on a Saturday night and only had to wait 15 minutes for a table!!!  I know!!!! Sitting outside is the best when its not too hot outside.     Food, drinks and service terrific!! I don't see the pizza that I ordered on the online menu but it was delic!!  Had raisins, some sort of cheese and something else on it.     To the owners : coasters,  you need to invest in coasters."
Israfel C.,"Miami Gardens, FL",60,8,3,5.0,6/11/2017,"I'm usually not a fan of this place other than the cheesecake. Most of the time I have food and it leaves something to be desired. Today was an exception. For starters we were lucky to have Minhea B as our waiter which made he experience awesome. As we sat down he brought the usual bread and a special plate with small pieces of banana and small pieces of bread for my god daughter. He was extremely attentive and very helpful as my wife had many questions about the meals. Today I had the Parmesan chicken pizza thing with spaghetti on top. Very good and the good in general was very good. Cheesecake was, as always, good."
Lissette C.,"Orlando, FL",48,64,26,4.0,4/10/2017,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory several times now and every time I get something different and it's it usually always good. I really like how they include the calories by the food items and they offer so many choices on their skinny menu. I had the Avocado Turkey sandwich it was super tasty, the food had the factory burrito which it was tasty also the black beans wasn't good at all just FYI. As for the cheesecake it I had the 30 anniversary cheesecake and was super yummy I thought they put too much icing which made it too sweet but overall the food was good and service was fast"
Colleen G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,53,96,2.0,3/2/2017,My experience  at C.f.has always  been  pleasant  however  this time the service  could  have been better  and environment  needed to be tidy. Waitor was mediocre.
Noam M.,"Hollywood, FL",0,5,,5.0,6/19/2017,I was very impressed about how the manager handled this situation after seeing my review ..definetly a first class operation.....2thumbs up to Chris the manager
Kimberly D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",521,357,1174,4.0,3/17/2015,"Located in the Oasis of the Sawgrass Mills Mall, this Cheesecake Factory is one of the busiest. But my friend and I had a great experience, even though there were people waiting out the door on a Friday night. We waited only 15 minutes for a first available table, which happened to be by the bar. The tables were clean and turnover looked very fast. The restaurant is very dark inside and very loud. Our server was really great; I forgot her name but she came to check up on us enough times and was very attentive to our table.  I ordered the steak medallions from the Skinnylicious menu. Even though it comes with mashed potatoes, I was able to change it to steamed broccoli to fit my diet. I asked for my steak to be cooked medium, and it was delicious! Soft and chewy (the way I prefer) and the marinade for the meat was tasty and flavorful. It was my first time ordering it and I would not hesitate to order it again. Although the portion looked smaller than usual CF dishes, I was very full at the end of my meal. Obviously you have to save room for some cheesecake when you visit the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered my usual favorite, the Tuxedo Cream cheesecake. It has a mix of milk and white chocolate that tastes like heaven in your mouth. It's my usual go-to when I am not feeling adventurous for dessert."
Al N.,"Hialeah, FL",0,97,8,1.0,7/24/2016,Sorry silverware. Poorly cooked steaks. This place is falling apart. New management needed.
Minu D.,"Innere Stadt, Vienna, Austria",0,8,1,2.0,9/21/2017,The service is great - so were the nachos and the pasta. BUT the chicken my boyfriend had was horrible - chewy and with a very weird taste. He even had food poisoning afterwards... very disappointing as we really liked the Cheesecake Factory
Stephanie F.,"Stuart, FL",151,141,127,4.0,1/20/2016,"Out experience here with a group of 10 was ok. Food arrived after an hour.  Amongst the orders were the Chicken Madeira, Chicken Marsala, Mexican Chicken Lettuce Tacos, and Chicken Alfredo...all great. Only thing I noticed was that the chicken tacos leaked a lot over my plate so be careful with these.  Dessert. Enough said. If you can't find a dessert for you then you're shit outta luck cause this place is THE BEST.  Recommendation: ask for Christopher for amazing and personable service, he never disappoints."
