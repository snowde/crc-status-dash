Robert F.,"Miami, FL",7,18,24,1.0,7/24/2017,"Waited and waited for someone to come to the table. Finally let a busboy know that maybe the waitress didn't know we were there. He said he would send someone. Waited, waited, made eye contact with a waitress, who walked away. The restaurant was almost empty. We gave up and left."
Gerard G.,"Orlando, FL",2,32,20,5.0,5/14/2017,Awesome staff first time at that location would definitely recommend eating here very high class environment and the food was awesome.
Tairyn A.,"Coral Springs, FL",526,680,7288,3.0,10/27/2015,"I've been to this location a few times. Most of those times I've had to wait upwards of 45 minutes to be seated. On this instance however, the bartender at the bas wasn't even done with my drinks before we were called. Super quick. Our waitress was nice and attentive, and the food was great. Drinks are expensive and a bit watered down. I had two and I didn't even felt the alcohol, but they were sweet and tasty. Dessert always makes it worth it for me. Definitely one of the better places to try at Sawgrass mall."
Linda L.,"Tamarac, FL",889,469,1794,3.0,10/14/2015,The servers here work under extreme pressure and our server tried to get everything we needed. She did a great job! The Cuban rolls I ordered was decent but the pork was a bit fatty and the appetizer overall was very oily. The sweet potato fries were perfect and a huge portion.
Renee L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",9,27,82,4.0,8/20/2016,"I go to this Cheesecake Factory frequently, mostly for lunch. My last visit however was on a Friday evening for dinner. This place has a very long are menu with great selections for just about anyone. Of all the times I have been here i don't think I have ever ordered anything I wasn't satisfied with. They serve very large meals so be prepared to share or have leftovers to take home. The herb crusted salmon is one of my favorite meal here."
Kerri V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,48,7,2.0,3/12/2017,"New healthy menu is much better although the tacos were flavorless.  I still do not understand the line.  All of the calories so when you take a look the best part, the cheesecake, you close the menu when you realize there's more than a days calories in one piece."
Nicole V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",416,431,1047,5.0,9/5/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory, once known as a special occasion restaurant is more like an every day restaurant.  With reasonable prices on food, HUGE portions, and a menu that has something for everyone,  what's not to love?!? We took my boyfriend's son for his 7th birthday. He had never been so when we walked in, he was excited by all the cheesecake in the display. We had a brief wait and then we were seated. Our server, Elias was friendly and attentive despite it being busy.  I was starving so I started with a bowl of clam chowder only served on Fridays. It's incredible - trust me! My bf and his son had the bbq pulled pork sandwich, which they both finished despite its size. They were hungry too! The birthday boy had a cheese pizza from the kids menu. He was more focused on saving room for dessert! I also ordered the eggplant parm but packed most of it to go home since the soup was super filling. For dessert we each selected a slice of cheesecake- key lime, mango key lime, vanilla bean, and my favorite: chocolate tuxedo!  The Cheesecake Factory is consistently good."
Nanda Morzaria K.,"Mississauga, Canada",4,3,,1.0,5/3/2016,"Have been here many times. We got a seat quickly at lunch time but our food took over 30 minutes to arrive when we ordered an omlette, pot stickers and a salad.  There was a ladybug on the omlette and a new one was made about 20 minutes later.  The toast was not remade and was cold.  We had to ask to be compensated.  No apology was offered for not compensating.  They made it look like it was too much trouble to deal with us!!"
Mayda G.,"Hollywood, FL",21,4,,1.0,2/11/2017,"I had dinner last night with my family we were all looking forward to a nice dinner. Service was good our waiter was very sweet. However, I woke up this morning so sick I think I may have food poison. I've been told by some of my co-workers and friends that they have had the same experience with their food it's either not good quality or its old food. It's last time that I will ever eat there again!!"
Rebeca P.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",31,20,1,4.0,2/10/2017,"I love The Cheesecake Factory in general, although I'm guessing it must be for the quantity of people in this mall, the quality of the food is not so great."
Aliy L.,"Minneapolis, MN",2,18,9,4.0,12/26/2016,"Typical Cheesecake Factory experience, large portions, good service, and strong drinks! This particular location was in an area where a lot of construction is currently taking place so that was kind of annoying, but the overall experience was good."
Daniella F.,"Sunrise, FL",0,5,,4.0,7/12/2017,I love that this place has really good bread. Service during the night time usually seems like it's better. Or maybe it's just a more exciting experience at night. But the burgers here are good although I feel like everything's overpriced. The scenery is beautiful and it's a great experience with the right people and the right servers.
Carolyn P.,"Toronto, Canada",5,16,26,5.0,9/29/2015,"Great ambiance, food, and service. You get value for your money here! We had the guacamole made-to-order, and aside from my own, it's the best I've had. The shrimp scampi was to die for, the beef medallions melted in your mouth, and the roasted chicken and avocado salad was ridiculously good. Finish it all off with a shared piece of cheesecake (how could we not?!), and call it a day. I'll be the one rolling around the outlet mall.  Sorry for the lack of photos. We were too busy enjoying all the food!"
J D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,30,2,3.0,12/11/2016,good place. decent service. BUT. ate lunch there yesterday with you family. waited nearly 20 min for a table even though we were told 5 minutes wait time. and the place was half empty. I've included a photo of my Asian chicken salad that was pretty much devoid of all chicken.... humorous!!
Sally c.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4,37,7,3.0,2/11/2016,"Apart from the  dirty utensils and crumbs left on the bread plates this place isn't too bad. Our food was hot, our waiter was attentive, and the wait was around 20 minutes for our party of 8.  The waiter saw how gross the utensils were and changed out 4 plates for us, brought multiple sets of  utensils, and even offered us plastic utensils. Our check was $150 for lunch which I thought was reasonable."
Reed T.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,3,,1.0,11/6/2016,The food is almost always pretty good. But the service at this one at the Sawgrass Mall SUCKS!!! Our waitress disappeared for 15 minutes after taking our drink order and then when she came back and I told her we were ready to order- she said ok and disappeared for another 10 minutes. We had to flag down another waitress and then t took about 35 minutes to get our sandwiches. Awful..... Don't come here if you don't want to spend about two hours to eat a quick lunch.
Nabila Y.,"Miami, FL",239,28,14,4.0,4/26/2015,The brunch here was great today. I definitely recommend the monte Cristo sandwich !! It's so flavorful and is definitely big enough to share !!  The only bad part of today's brunch was the service. The coffee took too long to come out and the waitress didn't come back at all until I was finished with my food to offer more coffee. Considering it's a brunch hour they should definitely be more attentive when serving coffee and coming back to inquire if everything is ok. Other than that I enjoyed my plate of food and will definitely go back !
Shauntay P.,"Atlanta, GA",134,145,390,4.0,2/10/2016,"I am almost sure I have been dining at this location for over 10-12 years easy, this has been my first visit in over 2 years (blame yelp for all my adventurous new dining choices lol) but it still has the same great flavor of food and ambience. I stopped in after an evening of shopping, and as usual the line was out the door but I decided to eat at the bar area instead. My bartender/waitress was great and she took very good care of me. This will always be a consistently good place to dine for any meal of the day."
Tony F.,"Toronto, Canada",222,438,228,4.0,11/19/2014,"If there's only one chain restaurant left in the world, I'm hoping it's a Cheesecake Factory.   I've consistently had pretty good food.  It's yummy.  Just don't tell me about Calories and such.  The experience at all the CCFs I've been to, it's been fairly consistent too.  Clean.  Like the Interior Design.  Like the Mega Menu.  Plus I've always had way above average level of service.   And of all the CCFs this is probably my favorite location.  As busy as it is, it's one of the quicker ones to get you seated.  Most CCF wait times around the country seem to clock in at over 40 minutes during busy hours.  Of the 5 or 6 times I've been here, it's been less than 20."
Ms. K.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",1,31,39,2.0,7/22/2015,"Today my daughter chicken in her chicken salad came out burned. My mojito was wayyyyyy too much mint, again it is alway hit or miss, today was a miss! Came back today (2/4/2016) for happy hour (not my choice) the waiter is horrible we literally had to ask for plates, napkins and silverware. The waiter forgot to bring out something twice and never came to check on us to see if we needed anything. I ordered food to go and he forgot to put it in, I refused to wait any longer because we waited 15min to ask for the check. AWFUL SERVICE!"
