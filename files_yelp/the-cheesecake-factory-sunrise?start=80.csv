Randy R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/11/2017,My server was awesome. Went in with a party of 8 paid the bill and forgot my to go Cheesecake on the table. Went back 10 minutes later and the manager refused to replace it as it was thrown out. Worst customer service.
Lyndenise B.,"Miami, FL",294,530,2076,2.0,2/7/2015,"As much as I tried to enjoy my experience here it just wasn't working out.  I ordered the corn tamales without sour cream and about 10 minutes later the tamales came out with more sour cream than the actual corn tamal. They made a new batch without sour cream but I'm thinking they forgot to actually to put in the oven because it was very, very cold. By this time I was starving so I didn't even bother to say anything. I ordered the GF five cheese pasta that I love. As soon as it was set on the table, I got my fork to pull out a very long hair from my pasta. Disgusting. I sent it back and told them not to even bother with making a new plate because it was already late and it takes longer than usual. I enjoyed the Godiva chocolate cheesecake although the waitress forgot my coffee. She was very sweet but definitely not having her best day. The manager, Ferdindan, did stop by to apologize and they didn't charge me for my tamales or cheesecake so I did appreciate that. There was just a huge disconnect with the kitchen and whoever made the stuff for my table just wasn't on their A game. Too bad! :("
Marie B.,"Miami, FL",2,13,,1.0,11/7/2016,"Way overpriced for mediocre food.  Their quality has gone way down.  I could not even eat my meal it was that yuk  This was my go to restaurant, what a shame.  Do NOT order the chicken salad sandwich, I am still not sure what it was.  Way better places around town and much cheaper."
John t.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,21,,5.0,4/5/2017,Love the cheesecake! Can always count on them. Have a great skinny mojito that is amazing!
Savanna M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",254,966,4960,4.0,8/2/2013,"I'm going to start by saying this is my favorite Cheesecake Factory in the area (considering Sawgrass, Aventura and Fort Lauderdale) and that's based solely on parking.  Yes parking is a mess, but it's more of a mess at Aventura and Las Olas.  As far as food and service goes, it's pretty generic, never had an experience that would swing my opinion either way. That being said, I think I finally figured out the secret to Cheesecake Factory - HAPPY HOUR!!  Happy Hour is from 4-6pm, a little short and early for my liking, but I can usually get in there and enjoy it from 5-6.   Some wines, drinks and beers are $5 - mojitos, margaritas etc.  There are also specially priced menu items at $5.  For a Cheesecake Factory these are great prices!   The corn tamale, roasted artichoke, avocado eggrolls just to name a few are excellent.  Plus you'll leave not feeling overly stuffed like you usually would, and you won't break the bank!"
Natalie A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",42,29,17,1.0,11/11/2015,"Cheesecake is one of my favorite restaurants, but after today when a roach crawled out of our bread basket I won't be returning. We were sitting at a table close to the kitchen not outside or near the doors. This roach definitely was from the kitchen!"
Jasmine P.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,1,,1.0,3/18/2017,When cheesecake tells you to write them so they can help you and they never respond ! Great service guys
JB A.,"Jupiter, FL",249,107,5,3.0,1/20/2016,"Went in with a group of 11 on a Saturday night. Was told 45 minutes - waited almost an hour and a half. Seated at a table for 10, which was too small. Asked the hostess to correct it and it was done promptly - thank you for that. Appetizers (3) came out hot and fresh. Dinner(s) came out soon after and were all correct and tasty. We ran out before we could get dessert but they all looked fantastic. I wish they took call ahead seating or reservations, it would have made the initial shock of a hungry group easier to manage."
Ash T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,8,,5.0,2/25/2017,"Went for my birthday (my second birthday here and probably my 50th time going there overall) after another pizza joint disappointed. Safe to say this is probably my favorite restaurant at the moment. Tried the chocolate tower cake, the garlic bread and the margarita flat bread. Delicious. I'm glad they added the super foods selection- can't wait to try the avocado toast next time. This location is way better than the one in downtown Fort Lauderdale where the average wait on a Thursday night is thirty damn minutes. Although our server could have paid more attention to us and the host could've given us our preferred seating, the food made up for it like always."
Bobby R.,"Coconut Creek, FL",215,284,161,3.0,5/10/2016,"Not a bad location! Right outside the mall... Well I think it's considered part of the mall... Either way, service was great and food was delicious. Nothing too much stuck out at this location. Like with any other cheesecake factory, I always suggest the Banana Cream Cheesecake!!!!"
Fiel C.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,14,11,3.0,8/27/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is very noisy. The tables are so close together that it's impossible to have privacy when you're a couple. The cheesecakes are delicious. It may take a long time for the server to return to the table after serving drinks and the entrees. If you are only after the cheesecake, it might be better to get it to go so you can enjoy it in peace."
Mike W.,"Los Angeles, CA",120,61,4,4.0,4/30/2016,"This is your standard Cheesecake Factory location. Good service, decent food, and a standard size outdoor patio. If I'm back in Florida again I would make a second visit to this location."
Nora C.,"Windsor, Canada",37,20,29,4.0,11/13/2015,"Every time I've gone to a Cheesecake Factory for dinner, it's usually been against my will. Aside from their cheesecakes, the food hasn't been impressive. The menu has about ~100 pages of options! My husband dragged me to this location, and for the first time, I actually enjoyed myself, mostly because of our awesome waiter Carlos. He even brought sliced bananas for our 6 month old. He suggested a few dishes, and my husband and I got 3 different ones to share. I really enjoyed the falafel salad and from now on, it'll be my safe go-to option! Thanks for an enjoyable evening Carlos!"
Roei A.,"Sunrise, FL",138,153,118,4.0,1/10/2016,"Love this place for its selections, good food for whatever you feel like and service is usually very good. Cons are its pretty packed at any giving moment and very very loud and lastly the waiting area at the entrance is small which usually makes it hard to come in and out especially with kids and strollers"
Jordanna E.,"Plantation, FL",406,321,1853,3.0,7/23/2013,"I have been there too many times to count over the past few years, never thought it was amazing, but never thought it was terrible.  I think the only reason it isn't rated higher is the fast paced atmosphere and inconsistency in service.  The other day I had a five star server though, her name was Jamie.  This is a rare thing, and I was extremely happy to have such a great server, who was not just an order taker.  The food was good, but the service truly did make the difference. I was trying to not spend a ton of money so we went light, but the bill was still about $60 which is by no means light, but I know where I could have trimmed...   We started off with the white bean hummus as a cheap and quick little appetizer.. can't go wrong there.. Love it, and it comes out as fast as the drinks. I had a lunch size pasta, farfalle with roasted garlic and sundried tomatoes, and requested the fried chicken with it for a change.. I usually don't eat the chicken, and was thinking the fried chicken would be a good leftover for the kids later on... We also got the lunch size ""Shepard's Pie."" It's a cottage pie guys...not a Shepard's pie..get it right. Always a delicious option for lunch.. filling and full of hidden veggies... I ordered the kids some chicken fingers, but as usual they ate most of my food, and the chicken fingers went home..  Husband loves the mint green tea.  I told Jamie to skip on the ridiculously small sized glass, unless she wanted to fetch a refill almost immediately..she took heed of the warning and brought him out a big glass, to save her the steps, and him the chance of being parched.  Great experience the other day.  Jamie was a rock star."
Rom L.,"Sunrise, FL",52,1,,4.0,4/17/2017,"I went to cheesecake with my family, such a good time.... Amazing food and place, perfect service and fast appetizers .... High recommend"
Mauricio B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",122,254,1677,3.0,9/27/2014,"This is always a fun place. Food is OK, they have a good variety of dishes and their cheesecake selection is great. Two of my favorites are: Dulce de Leche and Godiva. Service is usually OK, but the place is very busy, so sometimes service suffers. Noise level is high, so if you have little kids, you do not have to worry about disrupting other people."
Christina B.,"Alcoa, TN",139,4,,2.0,3/15/2017,"My friends date asked the girl at the front counter how late they served food until because got there at 10:30PM. Her response with an attitude, ""when we close."" Umm but when do you close?, he says. With an attitude she replied, ""11:30PM"". We were starving so we waited for a table. We got seated with menus. About 5 mins went by and the same girl walked back to where our table was with the girl who sat us at the table and pointed over to us and it looked like she was saying something about her seating us at the wrong table (there were several opened tables so it didn't look like it mattered) but I'm just glad they didn't ask us to move. 15 minutes later when we had picked out our drinks and the food we want no one ever came. I went to the girl who sat us and told her no one has asked our order. So she asks one of the other servers to take our order. She asked for our drinks and walked away. About 10 minutes later she comes back with the guys in our party's beer. Another 5 minutes later she brings us (girls) liquor drinks but still no waters. She told us they ran out of bread both white and brown, we were a little disappointed. She took our order and after 15 minutes she came out with bread saying look what I found lol I was confused where she ""found it"" but it was good so I was happy. One other strange last thing was my husband ordered the chicken potstickers and they only brought him 4 ... so 10 minutes later he got the single potsticker they forgot. Anyway ... it was just so much slower than usual service. It's usually a lot much more organized than this especially when our table alone spent $140. We didn't get our check to get out of there until 12!"
Marc L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",37,85,2,5.0,6/22/2016,"It was our 2nd time at this Cheesecake Factory location for lunch while we were shopping at the Sawgrass Mills Mall.   We were seated within 5 minutes and the sever Chijioke came right over to tell us about the specials and take our drink order.  He brought our iced teas and took our food order.  We decided to go for the special Chile Lime Tortilla soup, Beets with goat cheese salad, Ahi Tuna tartare appetizer and the Asian Chicken lettuce wraps.  All were really good and the server was very pleasant and efficient.  Very nice surprise !!"
Giselle M.,"Delray Beach, FL",27,19,26,4.0,8/1/2016,"I have been many times at the Cheesecake, there's nothing special about it, but this time our server made all the difference. He was super sweet, gave me great pointers on the light menu. Completely changed out view on cheesecake. I only wish I remembered his name :("
