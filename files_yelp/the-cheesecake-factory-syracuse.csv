Rosita M.,"Northside, Syracuse, NY",10,6,15,5.0,10/3/2017,"This is probably my new favorite spot! They have the works, they even box the food for you. Our waitress was great. She was funny, friendly, attentive and fast. The food was great, they have a plethora of choices from drinks to food and cheesecake! The atmosphere was splendid, works for a intimate dinner, a lunch with friends or even the whole family. Nice dining with cloth napkins and low lights. I enjoyed my first time experience and will be returning back with my fiancé. We ordered: Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp Grilled Steak Tacos Caramel Royale Macchiato  Typhoon punch Crispy Cuban Rolls"
Stefan F.,"Boston, MA",0,20,26,3.0,12/13/2017,"Waited almost a half hour to be seated despite plenty of open tables out on the patio. Had the option to eat at the bar but there wasn't adequate seating and the noise level was unpleasant. Ordered a large garden salad that was delicious with the cilantro dressing!  When the White Bean Chicken Chili was delivered the server stated ""be careful it's hot"" and the dish bowl was however, the chili was warm and some of the chunks of chicken were not. Sent it back and it was delivered piping hot (of course) and it was a very tasty dish. Waitress didn't ask if I was interested in dessert which I was somewhat surprised by, not to mention no sincere apology for the barely warm chili.  The food is usually tasty but pricey and this was the first time I've ever had to send a dish from this chain back. I guess I'll go to the counter and get my own cheesecake now!"
Joshua D.,"Liverpool, NY",256,281,635,1.0,10/8/2017,"So I normally don't like adding a one star review, but today I have no issue whatsoever.  We come here often(which will be changing for sure) and so we have a general idea of what they serve and what's delicious.   So today we planned to go to the Sunday brunch, which is quite delicious.  We got up early, but we had to go to a funeral home first. That took quite a while.  I want to preface that had we showed up at 2pm or 2:01pm, I would not be upset.  So we rushed to restaurant after the funeral home and got their about 140.  We told them we wanted to have the brunch, but the girl said that by the time the ESTIMATED wait time was up, it would be 2:10 and brunch would be over.  I let her know that we arrived before 2 and that it wasn't or fault there was a wait time.  She said she would be happy to ask a manager for us. (Side note: she was very pleasant and a good employee).  I heard her ask and explain the situation.   The manager told her that they stop brunch at 2pm and that due to limited supplies they couldn't let us have brunch if we ended up sitting after 2pm.  Again...the time frame was an estimate and we may well have got our seat in 15 minutes.  That excuse was utter nonsense.  I have worked in the restaurant industry and that is a common reason to give.   For this reason we won't be back for a long time.  Again we didn't show up after 2pm and if we were seated at 2:10 it's only a smidge past 2.  Not cool guys. Not cool."
Fox E.,"Buffalo, NY",3669,4868,17338,2.0,8/2/2017,"Cheeses, Mary & Joseph! The prices are high! But some of the stuff here is decent. It's really not a bad franchise as far as franchises go. This particular location didn't have service as stellar as the ones in Buffalo and Washington DC and Pittsburgh that I have been to recently. The product is pretty decent but I wouldn't say great. Some of the shakes are sometimes great. I find the cheesecake really bland compared to the best of Chicago and New York which are Elixs and S&S of Bronx. The burgers here are nothing more than average. I'm not really sure why people who think they know good food are obsessed with this corporate chain."
Guy R.,"Syracuse, NY",1,67,78,3.0,6/19/2017,"Went on a Friday night, they were not to busy, we only waited a few minutes for a table. We sat on the patio part, overlooking the mall walkers. Service was MEH, she was not overly friendly, and just seem to be going through the motions. Food was good, it did not WOW us, but it was good. Overall not much to say"
Kwi L.,"Syracuse, NY",103,144,443,1.0,4/25/2017,"My friends and I were in the mood for a late night snack while window shopping in the mall. We had all agreed upon cheesecake. We were seated in the bar area in which the hostess said ""bar seating is available with full service"".  NOW I do not know how much full service we actually got. It took a good 10 minutes for the waiter who dropped off our menus to return for our drink orders. Now granted maybe he was busy.... I was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. Soooo we continue to order our food. I ordered the beet salad since I was not as hungry. Supposed to be beets, goat cheese, and a bed of arugula. Came out and the salad was so bitter and hardly no arugula on the plate. The greens had long green stems on them so it was difficult to eat it.  NOW... my friend ordered the beet salad and an order of wings.... Another friend had already gotten her fried foods and we had to patiently wait for the wings. We're thinking oh they're wings so they're fried... probably takes LONGER, right??? Finally we decided to ask the server where are the wings? He says he will go check on them. He returns and proceeds to tell us they NEVER dropped them! So I assume hey maybe an apology for not getting the order out? maybe a beet salad taken off... maybe a drink? NOTHING! Soooo yeah probably won't be returning anytime soon for overpriced and mediocre food with poor service. Look elsewhere."
Eric G.,"Huntington Station, NY",55,72,14,2.0,8/10/2017,"So far... got here at 9:20 on a Thursday night. Restaurant is 1/2 empty. Still made us wait 10 minutes for a table. Took nearly 30 minutes for two dinner salads and a hamburger. The burger was good, the salads,  meh. 10:20, ordered two pieces of cake. 15 minutes later,  still hadn't received the cake in a 75% empty restaurant. Canceled the cake got the check and left. Not worth it."
Dave S.,"Syracuse, NY",63,69,175,3.0,7/21/2017,"I'll start off by saying. Corporately run big chains are not my cup of tea. Maybe I do have a little hipster inside of me for that. But they always seem the same. Long waits for underwhelming food I can make at home. So why did I make 4 attempts to come here turning down a 45-60 minute wait each time and keep coming back. I'm not sure. Partially cause I have never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory, and some genuine curiosity about how in the world it's so popular. Now, I don't eat cheesecake, or really any sweets for that matter and I guess that is the huge selling point for this place. So maybe that's my reason for a lower star review. But here we go on my take on this joint.  First off like I said. Don't come here if you don't want a wait. At least this destiny location. It took me five attempts to get a cramped small table that might as well have been family style and joined with its neighbors. But my wait this time was less than five minutes and I can live with that. The decor was not at all what I expected given my only experience with the Cheesecake Factory is the Big Bang theory. And this looks absolutely nothing like it is on that show. To use the word ostentatious would be an understatement. However it's so busy here that it seems hard for the staff to keep the simple things clean. Like some booths have mirrors covered in fingerprints and there a lots of crumbs on the floors when you're churning out the business this place does. A lull to clean is probably a hard commodity to come by. The seating as I said. In the section I sat in was a long bench booth seat with 5-8 small tables then 5-8 wicker chairs on the opposite side. So close I bumped elbows with my neighbor attempting to leave after eating. If you want to have a private conversation. You won't here.  The menu is pretty intense with a lot of options. But all fall pretty much in line with any other corporate location. A page of apps, a page of burgers, pasta, steaks, sandwiches and so on. And a completely separate one for their wide selection of desserts.  This was a date night for me and the fiancé. And we had a movie after so I didn't want something heavy in my stomach. But loaded tater tots isn't something I could pass on. I'm a sucker for a good potato appetizer. And I also ordered a Cuban sandwich because it's one of my favorites. She got a chicken Marsala pasta dish. I'll give the servers credit. They got each other's backs and everyone helps everyone. And that's great. But I found it weird that they announced their breaks and introduced a new waiter every time. Saw it happening all over the restaurant, But I think that's just me probably that found it weird. But super friendly and helpful and very well trained at their jobs.  The food came out appetizer first and a order of bread on the house. I wasn't super thrilled with the bread but I can always appreciate softened butter when it is served because spreading something right out of a cooler can be a pain. The tots, delicious. And as much as I hate to admit it. Being someone that despises sriracha. Their dipping sauce was also really good as well. So we were off to a good start. The sandwich came next. And Ill say while it's not the real deal Cuban, It's a fair replacement for it. Cuban bread isn't a easy thing to come by in upstate NY they used a chewy crusty odd bread that I wasn't sure what it was exactly that was flattened in a sandwich press. The meat inside was juicy and flavorful though and the mustard and pickles weren't bad either. Not the best ever. But a very far cry from the worse. Fries were also done very well. Not crunchy, nor soft. Sort of right up the middle again. Naomi's Marsala could have stood to have the wine cooked out of it a little more. But the pasta was perfect and again. Right up the middle with the food. If this place was a round of golf. It's definitely shooting par.  Naomi got a banana cream cheesecake slice to go. And as I said. I don't eat the stuff. But it looked tasty enough I that counts. Bill wasn't too awful. If memory serves about 60$ for two people including tip. So all and all an affordable option for a date night.  So I guess my general consensus of this place is what I expected going in. My socks still firmly on my feet. Not blown off, but my stomach full and happy. My experience with Cheesecake is par for the course. I'd come again, but definitely on like a Wednesday afternoon when I might be able to hear myself think."
Shantanu B.,"ON, Canada",35,121,255,4.0,12/26/2016,"We have always admired the service and menu options at Cheesecake Factory and thankfully this location didn't disappoint. Stopped here to meet friends in Syracuse and had an excellent late lunch in Destiny mall. Enjoyed every dish followed by trademark cheesecakes for desserts. Two entrées in particular were very appetizing: The Shrimp & chicken gumbo and Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. Tiramisu was a perfect dessert. Hershey chocolate cake was a relish. All drinks were made to perfection. They also serve alcohol, the old fashioned way which is not on the menu. Last but not the least, convenience of parking outside and straight in to be seated."
Sreyoshi D.,"Somerset County, NJ",27,52,75,4.0,5/15/2017,"The food, service, and cleanliness all remain on point. What I hate here is the exorbitant price for everything. Add to that the horrid dim lighting. I can barely ever read the menu properly. But ranting apart, the food has never been disappointing. My favorites here are the bang bang chicken and shrimp, cajun chicken and shrimp jambalaya, shepherd's pie, and last time a new dish got added - the chicken and shrimp gumbo. I would definitely recommend these, apart from the variety of cheesecakes of course. The prices are quite high. Each of the above mentioned dishes come at either $18 to $20. I ordered a house classic margarita as well, which was a whopping $10.25 -_- not at all expected. At least they didn't skimp on the alcohol there. But yeah, wish this chain would go easy on the price."
Erin o.,"Syracuse, NY",0,46,4,4.0,9/17/2017,Food is decent but the menu is sooo long it is hard to choose. I have not had much I didn't like but as someone as indecisive as myself I need a 2 maybe 3 page menu tops not 20'
Guillermo D.,"Hollywood, FL",23,2,,5.0,11/20/2017,Amazing dinning experience great service and perfectly cooked food. Thai chicken was awesome. Choc tower cake yum!!!
Amana C.,"DE, DE",135,383,740,3.0,7/30/2016,"Your typical CF,  has a nice ambiance. The menu is overwhelmingly large.  It's open late so it's usually where we end up for dessert/coffee/snacks however they tend to run out of a lot of their popular items. The best thing about this location that sets it apart from others is their outside but still inside the mall sitting area."
Andrew L.,"Freehold, NJ",175,117,102,3.0,8/13/2017,"Family visited Syracuse for the weekend and wanted a nice quick meal. We are no stranger to the Cheesecake Factory chain, so we decided to check out the establishment in Syracuse. Honestly it wasn't that bad. Compared to the other chains we have been to, this one pretty much was hitting the standard in terms of service and food quality. The only downside side of our meal was the time it took for food to come out. Our waitress was sweet and food was great when it came out, but it was an odd wait time. I don't think it we were in during the busy hours seeing we sat down around 9pm.  Everyone's meal came in but for some reason my tacos, which I would assume would be the easiest and fastest to make came in last. I had to wait another 10 minutes after everyone else's meals came out. I also ordered cheese cakes which took almost 20 minutes to get. I don't know why it takes so long to cut and deliver 2 pieces of cake, but it's what happened that night.  Regardless, we left happy and full. Maybe it was just a bad night for us to eat but I recommend people to check out this establishment. It's staff are friendly and the restaurant is pretty clean. Couldn't complain about anything else!"
Amina M.,"Syracuse, NY",105,75,63,3.0,2/4/2017,"It's nothing amazing, but nothing horrible. If you're going for your first time, try the staples : Avocado Egg Rolls, Macaroni and cheese, any type of burger, ultimate red velvet cheesecake etc. Don't go rogue on this menu, because you'll likely be disappointed. For example, fish tacos and Cuban sandwiches are not their speciality. Not saying it's bad, but you've probably had better. I've had better experiences for brunch than dinner."
Donna G.,"Liverpool, NY",0,3,,5.0,11/21/2017,"I especially like the "" Bang, Bang Chicken & Shrimp "" ...my husband orders "" Chicken & Bisquits "" which can be inconsistent.  We DO like easy access from the parking lot !"
Kelly C.,"Baldwinsville, NY",4,48,22,1.0,8/5/2016,"This is my 3rd trip to the cheescake factory. The first time was when it first opened and the meal was out of this world good. The second time was two weeks ago.  We were not greeted for about 3 minutes even though 2 girls were at the front counter. It took a third coming over to seat us. We sat at the table for about 10 minutes and even though 8 or so wait staff walked by us, none stopped at our table. I went to the hostesses and she said someone would come over. After another 5 minutes still no one, so we left. No one on the patio was served either. I contacted the manager and she apologized and sent me a gift card. Very nice.  So we went today. We were greeted promptly and we had a waiter immediately (I didn't say anything about my last visit).  Our drinks took awhile to be served and our waiter apologized. Our calamari came out lightening quick. It was ok, not the best I've had as it was the huge rings..which tend to be more chewy.  My husband ordered the shepard's pie and he said it was great. I ordered the shrimp scampi (traditionally a garlic and butter dish and so written in the menu.  When it came I think I got two different dishes in one.  My shrimp was butterflied and coated in various spices (some spicy).  Needless to say the shrimp was overcooked and when I mixed the noodles in with the shrimp and the little sauce that came with it, it was a hot mess of spice. Nothing like a shrimp scampi. I like spice, but it left a burning sensation on my tongue well after I stopped eating it.  The waiter said it should not have been spicy and offered to make another meal. I did not want to wait. The manager came over and apologized, asked if I wanted another meal (which I did not want to wait) and offered a free slice of cheesecake.  As a side note, I was shocked at how much a mojito cost.. $12.95!! More than a glass of wine.  The cheese cake was still awesome, yet noticeably a smaller slice than when the restaurant opened.  Over all the staff were much better this time around, but based on my last 2 experiences I will not be back."
Tony L.,"Brooklyn, NY",164,73,96,3.0,1/21/2017,"I've been to a couple Cheesecake Factory locations in the past and I've always dined in. But not this time, we had dinner at Dino BBQ and came here afterwards to pick up a couple slices before heading home. From my past experiences, the food is not bad, I just remember getting their signature chicken dish and possibly a soup? But their speciality should be their cheesecakes, hence their name. I don't have a sweet tooth but my girlfriend recently tried cheesecake for the first time and instantly fell in love with it. So trying cheesecake from THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY was a must. After looking at all the cheesecakes on display, we decided to go with the classic with strawberries and the oreo one. We regretted getting the oreo flavored one because it was overwhelmingly sweet, but the strawberry one was ok. After finishing, my girlfriend said ""I'm never eating cheesecake again"". I guess her cheesecake craving days are over."
Amber C.,"Flushing, NY",291,144,578,5.0,8/26/2016,"Typical cheesecake factory. Huge overwhelming menu & two pages worth of cheesecakes. The good rating comes from our waitress Gina - she was amazing!! Super funny, super helpful & bright. A fly had flown into my mojito and she quickly took it away to give us a new one and took the original drink off the bill as well. Good service goes a long way people."
Shekinah G.,"Liverpool, NY",292,13,,5.0,9/21/2017,"I can't stand chains, but this place has some great options like the Thai wraps appetizer. The three bacon cheeseburger is hard to beat too!"
Yuri K.,"New York, NY",362,142,280,2.0,1/21/2017,"I was so excited to finally try cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory. We had dinner somewhere else and wanted dessert so we came here and got cheesecake to-go. I have been obsessed with cheesecake recently so coming here already made me super happy. There were so many different cheesecakes to choose from, the selection was incredible. I have a huge sweet tooth so the Oreo one was perfect for me. My boyfriend is basic so he got the classic with strawberries. When we got home to try them, it wasn't as exciting as I had expected. The first 3 bites of the oreo cheesecake was delicious but it started getting too sweet and overwhelming for me. The oreo cheesecake had 3 layers to it. The bottom layer was almost like a moist chocolate cake. The middle layer was the actual cheesecake. The top layer was an oreo cream cheese filling. On top of that, the whole cake was covered in a layer of milk chocolate. It was too chocolate-y and sugary in my opinion. The classic cake was good too but there was nothing special about it. The texture was a little fluffier than I would have liked; it wasn't as thick. I wasn't a fan of the candied strawberries because they had a minty flavor to it. Overall, their cheesecake is average. I literally felt like i was getting diabetes from every bite I took. I didn't stop myself from eating the whole thing because at $8 a slice, that money would've gone to waste! From what others rave about, I was expecting a lot more especially since cheesecakes are their specialty. Maybe cheesecake isn't for me. Who knows... All i know is that I'm gonna have to work my butt off for the next week to burn all those calories"
Susan H.,"New York, NY",262,160,229,4.0,12/15/2015,"The Spicy Chipotle Chicken pasta is my new fav dish! The sauce was creamy deliciousness with a hint of spice, the chicken was tender and the asparagus and peas added to a perfect dish. Everything just tasted so well together. I also shared the quesadillas with my boyfriend and it was delicious. I was so impressed with the quality of the food as well as the generous portion sizes. I originally planned to get dessert but by the end of the meal, I was too stuffed to even think about it. However, I've tried The Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake several times in the past and it never disappoints. The only problem I did incur during my dining experience here was when we were getting seated. I came in with a party of 10 and we were dropped off in front of two separate tables with 8 chairs total. Obviously we didn't have enough space, yet no waiters were there to help us arrange the tables. We ended up moving three tables ourselves right next to each other so that we could sit altogether. The server in the front could've been more accommodating with our seating arrangement. Otherwise, the waitress who served us, was amazing. This place is a solid 4 stars."
Darren K.,"Syracuse, NY",418,103,46,5.0,6/30/2017,"We love this restaurant! Known for ridiculously large portions, this restaurant will reliably serve you great food with palatable flavors and familiar tastes. Their pasta fare is common, but serve with just enough of a twist for you to enjoy your meal. The service is on par with most chain restaurants. One thing that has me coming back over and over is the Ambiance of this place. It is dim at night and makes for a wonderful romantic option to take your date for dinner. The cheesecake is always delicious no matter what you choose. I'm more of a dark chocolate or milk chocolate fan, and I'm never, ever disappointed. One of the favorite dishes that my fiance and I love to order is the fried crab wontons. It's very similar to the crab rangoons you can get at your typical American Chinese restaurant, but this one has got more class to it. The fried wonton skin is thinner and finer comma with a lighter taste. The cream cheese is not overbearing or too creamy or heavy. Will continue making our Cheesecake Factory rounds every other week or so :-)"
Leigh S.,"Atlanta, GA",2,72,44,3.0,2/5/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is of course your typical chain. Decided that since I was visiting the Destiny USA mall, why not pick up some food to go. It was snowing btw and getting late so I didn't want to stay out too late.  I came around 7:45-8pm. They were definitely busy. It took them about 15 minutes just to get someone to take our to go orders. So as an FYI just go ahead and have a seat and dine in. Ambiance: Definitely casual so don't over dress.  Meal: I ordered the Chicken and Biscuits with rice and a side of broccoli. I sat another 30 minutes waiting on my meal. No one was directing and checking to make sure that the meals were delivered to the customers. So the food obviously was sitting there getting cold. Needless to say my chicken was super bland. No flavor at all. Sweet Treat: I ordered the Red Velvet Cheesecake! This is why they get the 3 stars. Their cheesecake is always superb!!! Hence the name.... There were so many people stopping through to purchase some cheesecake.  Price: I think they are a bit pricey... with tip my total was roughly $28. If my food wasn't bland then it may have been worth it. The Cheesecake Factory has an extensive menu. The menu is so large with a variety of items I'm sure that's possible to find the one or two items that taste super good. For me I think less is better. Maybe focus on a couple of items, make them great and then change up the menu seasonally. If you're in the area or just walking through Destiny USA, stop through and try it for yourself but don't leave without trying out some Cheesecake!"
Elle S.,"Syracuse, NY",0,2,,1.0,8/26/2017,"Called in an order to curbside pickup.  They said it would be ready in 15 minutes.   Got there, waited and went inside to be told they were putting it together and it would be ready in 5 minutes.    40 minutes later still not ready.   When it finally was ready, they forgot 2 items which I had ordered which took an additional 20 minutes to make.  Then when I got home with my order and was about to eat I opened everything up and realized that both of the meals they had given me were wrong........  They literally did not get a single thing right except the price that I was charged."
Leah B.,"Montour Falls, NY",25,4,6,2.0,8/3/2017,"The most overpriced, mediocre, over-portioned, ""fancy""-plated diner food ever. My first time at CF, the food wasn't terrible but it wasn't great, and for the prices at CF I expect flavor and good food, NOT a portion for three people of pretty bland, generic, flavor enhancer-laced dishes. You can tell immediately the kitchen is just shlepping meals with no pride. The server though, she was very nice and did a great job. I think she got the hint that we didn't care for the portions OR the food when she removed plates with SO MUCH left (and we HATE wasting!) and we didn't want boxes for the leftovers for anything. We won't be returning to Cheesecake Factory. For the price, my family can enjoy a pretty fine dining experience elsewhere."
Michael R.,"Yorkville, NY",2,4,,4.0,7/30/2017,"Each and every time I visit The Cheesecake Factory the service, food and atmosphere is great. Out of the 20+ times I've visited, there has only been 1 disappointing occasion. Their menu is huge, filled with choices that will gave you wanting 5 different things. The prices are a tad high, but I'll gladly pay a little more for the service, quality of food and convenience of its location."
Negar V.,"Manlius, NY",20,25,62,4.0,7/14/2016,"My second experience in Syracuse cheese cake factory was so better than first one. When it was newly opened, waiting time was more than 3 hours. But now it is less than 30 minutes. Food was so delicious and portion of meal is more than enough for one person."
Alexandra S.,"Syracuse, NY",11,167,4,2.0,4/18/2017,"I LOVE Cheesecake Factory. It is usually my favorite restaurant. This location is nice but just be prepared to wait. I like to come here because I love the bread and the food is always good. My favorites are the grilled steak tacos and salmon. However the past few times we've come it has taken so long. The first time the manager apologized. The second time we had an entree comped because we were waiting an hour for our food. The last time we were waiting and they kept telling us it was almost ready when... clearly it wasn't. I'm not sure what changed recently but we don't like it anymore. When the waitress dropped off the food I was trying to ask her something and she brushed me. Anyway, the food is great but just give yourself lots of time and be prepared for a poor customer experience."
Sean S.,"Syracuse, NY",30,5,3,5.0,7/22/2017,When a place make me want to go back it definitely got my vote I didn't know what to expect my favorite dish from their is the chicken fettuccine it got me hook it's a little expensive but worth it
Mary-Rachel M.,"Binghamton, NY",73,1,,1.0,5/25/2017,"Worst restaurant experience of my life.  I'm a server, so for the most part I am lenient, and have never in my life, left less than a 20% tip. Until tonight.  First off, our server greeted us after two other tables that were sat at least 5 minutes after us. He had no personality, never smiled once, and was kind of attentive, maybe, if you could call it that. The cheesey garlic bread was okay. When the food came out 20 minutes after our app was finished, just looking at my ""rare"" $30 ribeye, I could tell that it was grotesquely overcooked. As I thought, I cut into it and it was extra well done. The server came back a few minutes later and asked how everything was and I showed him the mistake and he apologized and had it remade. 20 minutes later, after my boyfriend had already finished his food, I got my steak and it was cooked properly. The manager came over and casually apologized. I had my food boxed up and was offered a complimentary dessert.  That was kind of nice. Overall, way overpriced, over rated, and dissatisfied with the quality of food and service. To have a rare steak come out extra well done at a place where it is priced at $30 is a huge over sight. I felt like more could have been done, seeing as I hadn't even planned on dessert."
Daphnee M.,"Binghamton, NY",42,18,32,2.0,1/7/2017,Their price increase plus the wait time for the food and decrease quality is what has them at two stars smh.
Ron G.,"Peru, NY",1,45,32,2.0,7/15/2017,The service was subpar.  Food was ok.  The portion on the kids meal was larger then the adult portion and $10.00 cheaper.  Really disappointed in the visit to The Cheesecake Factory.  We have been to better Cheesecake Factories by far.  Sooo disappointed.  Maybe a management change is in need.
Jen G.,"Naples, FL",18,5,,2.0,7/9/2017,Very slow service. Hostess miserable and doesn't even crack a smile. Server not friendly either. We were seated quickly but sat and sat and sat waiting for food to arrive. Won't be back.
Meredith O.,"Darien, CT",1,9,,2.0,7/6/2017,"Waiter was nice, but service was slow. Messed up our drinks and there was no chicken in my chopped salad. A lot of room for improvement."
Ashley L.,"Tampa, FL",50,225,158,1.0,9/13/2016,"Went once and only once and the service was absolutely horrible. Had to send back my order and literally didn't eat a bite, however when they came back to tell me that they took the order off my tab, they took off the wrong plate for the wrong person while they continued to tell me how next time I shouldn't eat the whole plate and then send it back. Extremely rude and disappointed in staff. One and done there!"
Tara R.,"New York, NY",4,38,24,5.0,5/28/2017,"We had a party of 4 on a Sunday afternoon and only had to wait 10 minutes for a table! The appetizers came out quickly. We ordered chicken pot stickers (amazing) and fried cheese, which was a little smaller than expected (6 triangles with a 1.5"" base). Both were great though. Dinner consisted of Asian chicken wraps, shepards pie, rosemary crusted chicken and the skinnylicious lemon-garlic shrimp. I wasn't too impressed with the amount of food given in the shrimp entree. It was over $17 and had only 5 shrimp with a half cup of pasta. Good size portion for the skinnylicious menu, but way too expensive. I highly recommend the homemade lemonade. I also tried their new Chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake with Nutella. It sounds amazing but it's actually really dense and heavy. I ordered it a la mode to try to lighten it but it didn't do much. I honestly wouldn't recommend it, and say to stick to a classic."
Aby P.,"Yukon, OK",0,24,6,4.0,5/23/2017,What can I say? Cheesecake Factory always tastes the same consistently across the board. Service was great and the food was what I expected!
Maureen M.,"Syracuse, NY",71,15,5,4.0,6/19/2017,The food was outstanding. Service top notch! Ordered off the father's day special menu. Huge portion for a low price! My only knock was the table was a bit sticky from previous people and the booth was cramped for space.
Kris M.,"Binghamton, NY",0,2,,1.0,5/30/2017,"Awful service. I have never been to a restaurant where servers purposefully avoid eye contact with patrons.   It was at least  15 minutes before we were even be spoken to by a server & that was after we spoke up to host who told us we'd be served faster in the bar area at a table.  OncE we spoke up, the Host & server said they'd take care of us, rectify the situation. Great, right?  Nope. We had to continue to flag down the  waiter, who was more arrogant than helpful & while host offered to comp us dessert, that was  worthless gesture. We skipped dessert because the whole dining experience was 1.5 hours .  Food was over priced & mediocre at best. and nothing comped, no apologies for lengthy delays, forgotten items, &  The left with "" never again"" rating."
