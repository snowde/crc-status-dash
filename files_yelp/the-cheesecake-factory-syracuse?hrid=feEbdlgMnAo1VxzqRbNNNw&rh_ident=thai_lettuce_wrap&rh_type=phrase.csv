Nick H.,"Syracuse, United States",48,165,115,4.0,26/11/2014,"I love the Cheesecake factory. Granted some of their dishes aren't that great, I have been sticking to 2-3 dishes that I have found to have liked on their menu that they do really well and do it really consistently. If you have never been to a cheesecake factory or have tried these dishes, I would absolutely recommend the bacon and shrimp sandwich and the   (appetizer). The bacon and shrimp is like a perfect meritage of shrimp and bacon and a sauce that is absolutely mouthwatering. Combined with a nice and toasted bread makes the sandwich absolutely delicious. The   is sometimes inconsistent with their chicken as it is sometimes dry and sometimes moist and tender. The best part of the appetizer though are the sauces which are out of this world. They usually come with 3 different sauces that can appeal to basically anyone. If this chain only had these 2 dishes, I would rate it five stars, but then they decided to load their menu to 100 other items, most of which are subpar or ""A-OK"" Service wise this is a rather large restaurant and I would have to admit, the servers were relatively attentive compared to what I would come to expect from a Cheesecake factory. Then again, we came around lunch time when it wasn't so busy, so I would be careful about coming at dinner. My experiences with Cheesecake factory is they value quantity over quality which ultimately results in lackluster food an poor service. Tried the cheesecake as well. Tasted same as any other cheesecake factory (guess that's what you expect since it is a chain XD). Not really a fan, but it sure tasted good. I sure do wish they would have a sampler plate for their cheesecake because there are just way too many flavors to try/pick from."

We came for lunch and I had the   from the appetizer menu as my meal. It is not the first time I have had this dish and it is probably not the last. The fresh veggies, tasty tender chicken and amazing sauces will satisfy your health nut tooth, just delicious..."
