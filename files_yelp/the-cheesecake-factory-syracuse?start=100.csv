Nick H.,"Syracuse, NY",48,165,115,4.0,11/26/2014,"I love the Cheesecake factory. Granted some of their dishes aren't that great, I have been sticking to 2-3 dishes that I have found to have liked on their menu that they do really well and do it really consistently. If you have never been to a cheesecake factory or have tried these dishes, I would absolutely recommend the bacon and shrimp sandwich and the thai lettuce wrap (appetizer). The bacon and shrimp is like a perfect meritage of shrimp and bacon and a sauce that is absolutely mouthwatering. Combined with a nice and toasted bread makes the sandwich absolutely delicious. The thai lettuce wrap is sometimes inconsistent with their chicken as it is sometimes dry and sometimes moist and tender. The best part of the appetizer though are the sauces which are out of this world. They usually come with 3 different sauces that can appeal to basically anyone. If this chain only had these 2 dishes, I would rate it five stars, but then they decided to load their menu to 100 other items, most of which are subpar or ""A-OK"" Service wise this is a rather large restaurant and I would have to admit, the servers were relatively attentive compared to what I would come to expect from a Cheesecake factory. Then again, we came around lunch time when it wasn't so busy, so I would be careful about coming at dinner. My experiences with Cheesecake factory is they value quantity over quality which ultimately results in lackluster food an poor service. Tried the cheesecake as well. Tasted same as any other cheesecake factory (guess that's what you expect since it is a chain XD). Not really a fan, but it sure tasted good. I sure do wish they would have a sampler plate for their cheesecake because there are just way too many flavors to try/pick from."
Jocelyn K.,"Ithaca, NY",17,172,27,4.0,12/19/2014,"Stopped in for a bite while Christmas shopping at Destiny Mall. After being exhausted from walking around so long, then waiting in line for 45 minutes to be seated, we were very pleased with our server and quality of food. We had fish n chips and a burger. Then ended by splitting the banana cream cheesecake. A fun night out!"
David S.,"West Monroe, NY",0,4,1,2.0,1/31/2016,Came in tonight had a gift certificate food took forever she said be careful when she put the plate down I felt the plate it was Luke warm probably won't return
Nabeel N.,"Baldwinsville, NY",42,187,29,2.0,4/19/2014,"First off - Wake up Syracuse!  This chain has been around for years.  Definitely not worth waiting in line for 2hrs for a table.  But then again, anything new in Syracuse gets a lot of attention. What doesn't get a lot of attention however is the customer! Unfortunately I had to visit this place, not once, but twice.   Our first visit took over 15mins before a server arrived at our table.  Food taste and quality was the same as you would expect at any chain.  Gigantic portions that end up going to waste - Portion control people!! Our second visit happened to be at brunch.  My father-in-law and I both order Bloody Marys, and after about 20mins, our waitress swings by to let us know that it isn't quite noon so she couldn't serve us alcohol, which was absolutely fine, but then she just walked away without asking us if we wanted something else to drink.  Another 10mins and we finally put in our drink order! Somebody please MANAGE this place!!!!"
American C.,"Liverpool, NY",0,6,4,5.0,11/10/2014,"You get what you paid for. Food and service always excellent, never have complaints spending time and money here whatever state I'm in."
Michael K.,"Fabius, NY",10,54,5,2.0,3/17/2014,"Stop for the first time , not as good as Rochester location , my wife had chicken and biscuits grilled chicken breast , A few chunks of carrots and lack of gravy or sauce . Ask for more sauce or what ever they called it  ( never came) it's one of those systems not sure who is server , food drop off  person . The new system it takes several people to due one job  , I like the old system better Other people had burgers ok over cooked favor ok"
Jennifer K.,"Waxhaw, NC",0,19,14,2.0,11/1/2015,The service is lacking at this place. I was there late afternoon for dinner this week. The waitress serviced outside seating was unpleasant. I tried to smile at her to make her smile back but she just made me nervous the entire time. I'm a regular at this chain in other locations nation wide. Rarely had unfriendly waitress like this.
Brian C.,"Venice, FL",0,21,4,5.0,9/27/2014,Have eaten here a number of times.It is busy on weekend evenings but that should tell you that people must like it. Usually wait 20-30 minutes for a table. Food and service has always been very good with large portions. Always take extra home. Prices comparable to other restaurants. Look forward to coming back.
Linda A.,"Liverpool, NY",0,10,,3.0,2/8/2014,"Ate lunch during the free preview promotion.  The restaurant looks beautiful and very clean and shiny. The 10 minute telling you how to order in a group was a turnoff , but you had to suffer it to get your seat.  This could have been done at your table in 2 minutes by a server or hostess. Our waitress was new but did a good job and we never had to look for her.  She had a great personality. Since it was a free preview the menu was limited.  The peach Bellini was excellent.  So was the beef kabob appetizer.  The salad and spicy chicken pasta were just okay.  I don't think I would order either again but try other dishes. The bread was average. Tried the apple streusel cheesecake.  It was okay..kind of dry without ice cream . I will be back when they are open for business to try other dishes and those great kabobs."
Phil S.,"Lake Mary, Orlando, FL",0,26,11,4.0,4/16/2015,"Great food, and wait staff...... Excellent when you consider just how few choices you have in upstate NY..... Enjoy !"
Carla M.,"Miami, FL",2,43,7,4.0,4/29/2014,"Food was awesome as always!! Huevos rancheros breakfast is a feast any time of the day. Service was great and even if they mistaked my order.., they made it up the best way you can imagine. Nice detail!!"
Zack W.,"Liverpool, NY",0,1,,1.0,2/26/2015,"Just bad. Like many other restaurants in Syracuse, The Cheesecake Factory fails to hit even minimal standards. The food would be good if it were prepared by anyone that had the slightest idea what they were doing, which also indicates a failure in management and supervision. Had I been managing the kitchen, I never would have allowed the food I received to go out. Both burgers we ordered, mind you they're just about the easiest thing to make correctly, were cooked rare--not what we ordered. It was clear that they had been sitting in the window under the food warmer for at least ten minutes as the plates were practically on fire, buns soggy, and vegetable toppings warm. Having worked in restaurants, I would have been able to understand this a little bit if it hadn't appeared to be their slowest night of the week. At these prices, it was a completely unacceptable experience. I would have refused to pay if my fiance hadn't been begging me not to be mean to anybody. On top of a sub par entrée, the cheesecake my fiance order looked old. I am utterly surprised that this location is still open. I would've been happier at Denny's or McDonald's. I will never go back."
A C.,"New York, NY",0,58,,5.0,8/5/2015,"Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! Amazing food, and service. Just went in July for the first time, will be back!"
Samuel M.,"Albany, NY",0,28,,5.0,5/25/2015,"Went here for Sunday brunch and was blown away! We got there early and had to wait for them to open but could see through the windows the manager getting the employees hyped up for their work day. By far had to be one of the best managers I have seen, motivated his employees and was in control of everything. The staff was amazing. Our waitress was extremely polite and helpful. I am use to either never seeing your waitress or having them hover over you the entire time. She came by regularly to check if we needed anything and was able to answer questions about anything! Also, The food was amazing! I would recommend always going here if you are at Destiny USA. You will not be disappointed."
Oblivion T.,"Syracuse, NY",23,6,4,2.0,10/11/2014,"Just not an experience we'll be repeating. Eventually we got our orders, after an array of tag teaming servers. Never got our beverage order. Food was, just ok. People around us came in and left before us. When we arrived it was not busy, by the time we left it was packed with a line. We were there way too long for such a visit."
Sean B.,"Cicero, NY",0,9,8,4.0,3/27/2015,"Either you like it or you really like it. It's the standard franchise, syracuse style with in mall seating not outdoor seating. Service has been excellent on 4 occasions. Two thumbs up for an extensive menu with many GF options."
C M.,"Rhinebeck, NY",0,36,,5.0,12/13/2014,So so good!! My favorite chain restaurant hands down.  Really nice bartender... Laura.  Kale salad... Awesome... Drinks great.. Banana creme cheesecake to die for!!! You can't go wrong here
Sara S.,"Cicero, NY",0,5,,1.0,5/27/2014,"If you like upset stomach, puking, diahrea then, by all means, go pay Them to give it to you. May 10. Husband and I ate here after about a 40m wait  After eating at the Cheesecake in Cambridge MA, roch and buffalo NY, I'm pretty familiar with the menu and loved everything I've ever had. Not only was the steak Diane and herb crusted salmon disgusting, I could make better, fresher food at home. Unedible. We were so excited to get this restaurant to Syracuse. Our waiter was bad, have us the wrong check and was too busy, had too many tables so it probably wasn't his fault. I went to crouse hospital and had a test to co ng item food poisoning. The county health dept asked me a thousand questions about what I are the previous 3 days to eating there. I received 2 bags of iv liquids I was so sick and dehydrated. What a fiasco! Never again and I'm sad because it used to be one of my favorite places. Had a Mother's Day in bed throwing up instead of spending w my kids. Get some real managers or shut it down. Don't make people sick!"
Steven M.,"Frederick, MD",1,52,54,1.0,5/8/2014,"The food was way over priced and I was way UNDER whelmed . Eating Food here was about the same as a cheep TV dinner pretending to be a upscale entree .They may make cheesecake but that don't mean they can actually cook anything beyond microwaved appetizers . They have a huge menu - it's not nearly as good a Denny's or a no name truck stop diner but the service was slow and the food tasted like it had been frozen and microwaved even though they say it's not. Pizza was horrible and so small it couldn't properly feed a single young lady who ordered it .  There were 4 of us who ordered all different meals . We agree that we won't be back here again . I ordered Shepard pie - really disappointed to the max. I didn't bother to finish it. My sister ordered a steak ($26) it was so small and of such low quality-  it was finished in 4 bites...we could have gotten a better tasting one at IHOP , we paid the $92 bill - for  low quality that your average diner could easily surpass . We walked  out still hungry and went to a pizza place  and got a few slices . $92 later and the food was inedible . I found the food to be on the same level as a cheap no name TV dinner that was pretending to be a upscale place . Don't waste your time here . I hate. TV dinners ,especially when they charge $25 for what taste like poorly cooked last months defrosted leftovers . Absolutely the worst service I have ever had in 50 years throughout my travels in over 72 countries and I live in SYRACUSE. I didn't try the cheesecake . I wouldn't come back here even if they paid me to eat the slop that they pass off as edible on their menu . Read my other reviews and you will understand that it's rare for me to ever write anything this negative- but this place earned this review,they begged for it . I want my money back."
Sally B.,"Liverpool, NY",2,24,,4.0,8/14/2014,"Went on a weekday afternoon, about 1:30, and after a 5 minute wait we were seated outside the main restaurant, where it was a little brighter and more casual.  Waitress brought a little basket of small slices of both french bread and wonderful dark sweet bread.   The menu is huge.  There is a 'skinny' menu  insert which is useful for those watching their weight or who eat there frequently.   We had the deep fried pretzel chicken skewers and crab cake bites for appetizers. Both were very good, the chicken the better of the two, with dipping sauces for each. For the main course, one of us had a burger and fries, the burger medium, pink inside, with thin onion ring garnish. This was declared 'excellent'.  I had the lunch sized portion of shepherds pie, and it was quite good, if a bit salty.  Chunks of ground beef, mushrooms, green peas, strips of carrots and zucchini, in a savory au jus gravy, with a thin serving of savory mashed potato on top.  We had one beer and a glass of ice water to drink, got a piece of red velvet cheesecake and piece of tirami su cheesecake to go, and took some of our meal home in containers.  Service was excellent, very quick, and the setting was nice! .... So far, 3 hours later, both of us are feeling well and unpoisoned by Cheesecake Factory food.  The portions were of an adequate size, but one could sense there is strict portion control going on somewhere.  I can say we were both happy with our meal, which was a bit of a splurge.   I sometimes wonder if I lack life experience, or am too easily pleased because other than being rather expensive, everything was fine.  Maybe the kinks have been worked out, since the place opened.   The menu is huge and awesome and we look forward to going back several more times, and getting a cocktail or two."
