D A.,"La Fargeville, NY",0,8,,2.0,2/23/2014,"Yikes!!! A 180 degree turnaround from grand opening. I had the pleasure of visiting Cheesecake Factory Syracuse on the opening day, food was fabulous. My greatest fear was that the 'best foot would be put forward on opening day and things would quickly change for the worst. Opening day: prompt, organized, generous portions. Two Week mark: Inexperience of waiters became evident, lack of organization from seating to plating to serving, worst of all the very same dishes that had been ordered several weeks in terms of portions and quality reduced by 50%. The quality of the food took a serious dive."
Maurice T.,"Blainville, Canada",0,32,2,5.0,10/12/2014,"It's the restaurant you see in every city and think it's all about cheesecake, so you don't bother going in. So I finally caved in and decided to try it, and very happy I did. Not only was the food good the portions are more than fair. The nachos are huge and very good. We ordered burgers, California cheese steak and orange chicken. One was better than the other. Burger cooked to perfection the cheese steak was very tasty the baguette bread its served on is money!!!! The orange chicken is just like at a oriental restaurant if not better. Finally we get to the cheesecake it self, our favourite  was the key lime one. Also has a stylish and modern decor, definitely will go back!"
Kristin O.,"Fountainville, PA",1,4,,3.0,6/27/2014,"Just visited for lunch on a Friday afternoon. We were seated immediately, but that was the highlight of the service.  There was extensive waiting between each phase of the meal. Eventually I made the hostess aware that we had been waiting 15 min for 2 slices of cheesecake. She said she would send the manage over, and even for that we were left waiting. He did not offer his name and was mildly interested in our feedback. He said he'd see what he could do.  He never returned but the bill was discounted 25%. Unlikely to return."
Tori L.,"Salem, MA",0,3,,2.0,2/20/2014,"Well...at first I was impressed. The decor was pretty upscale looking for a chain. Then we sit down excited to order some allegedly delicious food. We decided the buffalo blasts for an appetizer- they're out. I wanted chicken and biscuits- they're out. So we looked at the menu again and being that I don't feel like risking $18 for ""Italian"" or ""Chinese"" cuisine made by an American chain the only thing I can bring myself to order is a burger and fries. We also attempted to order the macaroni and cheese bites as an appetizer- they're out. She then assures us that they have ""like 30 other appetizers that are just as good"" but we were pretty darn discouraged at this point. So "" ""luckily"" for us they managed to keep enough artichoke dip on hand for us-which was good-thank god. While we waited for that my husband went and stood in line for some cheesecake to go for about 10 minutes only to discover that there is but one register back there- and apparently it is used to cash out the checks of the servers checks as well as people who want cheesecake- so- you stand in line with waitresses and hope that the chaos moves along quickly. My husband ordered ""the incredible eggplant sandwich"" which he sent back. We have been together 10 years and he has never sent a meal back! The eggplant was not flat or filleted, it was the whole eggplant cut in half, which rolls off the burger. He then ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and was very happy. I had a plain burger and fries and was satisfied. Cheesecake was phenomenal."
