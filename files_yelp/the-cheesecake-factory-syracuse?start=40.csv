Sarah L.,"Oriskany, NY",104,198,185,4.0,9/10/2016,"Stopped here for dinner the other night as we spent the day in Syracuse. They got us right in with no wait time. I got the roasted chicken with caramelized carrots and mashed potatoes. It was so delicious I think I'll probably order that dish every time I go. Skipped the cheesecake as I'm not a big cheesecake person. I know, what kind of person doesn't like cheesecake right? Our waitress was very nice and service was quick. Overall a good experience. The only thing I didnt like was where we sat which I like to refer to as picnic table style seating where you're elbow to elbow with strangers.   That's me being picky though. I would recommend."
Saarthak C.,"Reno, NV",175,54,207,4.0,4/30/2017,"Like all other outlets, this cheesecake factory outlet does not disappoint .. It has cm great cheesecakes; the one I like the best is the chocolate hazelnut one. The virgin pina colada is great too. All of this comes at very reasonable prices as well. All in all, a great experience !!"
Mike F.,"Syracuse, NY",0,34,,2.0,6/2/2017,Food is good but it's just way too expensive. Won't return.
Rebecca M.,"Syracuse, NY",107,6,,1.0,8/5/2016,"I've been here so many times and the service and food has been great. This most recent time was absolutely terrible. My boyfriend ordered a salmon salad, and they told us they were out of salmon. No big deal. He changed his order to a small house salad, bang bang shrimp, and buffalo wings. The waitress came back over and said they were out of wings. Okaaaaaay? So he was annoyed, but he said he was happy with just the shrimp and salad. Next, the MANAGER comes over to tell him they're out of bang bang shrimp. What? How can this giant restaurant be out of shrimp, wings AND salmon on a THURSDAY? So the manager offers him a free slice of cheesecake and my boyfriend politely declines and says he realizes it's just a crazy coincidence, but he doesn't want desert. Here's the worst part of this whole situation. They didn't take off his 4 dollar salad. They literally made us pay for everything, even the one drink we ordered. Just because we didn't accept the free cheesecake."
Kristen P.,"Baldwinsville, NY",0,11,10,3.0,3/8/2017,"The fried Mac and cheese balls were so good! The sauce that comes with them is delicious. I ordered the bacon bacon burger, I asked for it medium but it was cooked incorrectly and some of the cheese was not melted all the way in it. Also ordered the Cesar salad which was giant, but was very garlicky. My favorite cheesecake here is the salted caramel one, I recommend it. The service was good."
Hana C.,"Parish, NY",2,6,3,5.0,2/4/2017,"Very attentive waiters at this location.  Food is always excellent and have never had a bad experience at this location, even during busy times.  It's our go-to date night place because we love it so much."
Maria R.,"Liverpool, NY",24,5,,1.0,1/8/2017,"The worst dinner experience EVER... Went last night for my birthday dinner. I chose to eat there over a ton of other restaurants.. we went early, 3:30. I had to ask for the bread and butter every other table was given when they were given their beverage order. By 5:15, still no food. Tables around us were seated, ate and left BEFORE the kitchen manager came over to apologize for a server error??? That took him 10 mins from when the server said he was sending the KM to our table. We never asked for a manager so I thought that was odd. After apologizing for the server error,  he offers us a free piece of cheesecake?? Really??? Almost two hours for a meal we never get, and then we're offered A FREE PIECE OF CAKE???  Very poor service and even worse  management ruined a wonderful romantic evening for me. Because of the time we left (height of dinner time) there were waits over an hour at every other restaurant in the area. I went home and had a bowl of soup. Never ever will I eat there again.  I'm getting married in May, guests are coming from all over and I will recommend EVERY other restaurant but this one...."
Johnny A.,"Miami, FL",75,104,38,5.0,7/8/2016,"i went 2 days in a row. The amazing service never fails, theyre always outgoing and friendly. I had the macaroni and cheeseburger, it was good but i was looking for actual macaroni on top. Macaroni and cheese is one my favorite foods , its the only reason why i ordered it but it wasnt bad. The following day I had the four cheese pasta. It was very good. But the desert!!!!!!!!!! You have to try the rocky road sundae!!!! omg i was already kind of full before I ordered the desert , but it was to die for, heaven sent, so sensational, i enjoyed every bite. I would definitely order that as a desert for a while, its so good."
Londynn K.,"Hilton Head Island, SC",0,3,3,1.0,3/4/2017,"Not very satisfied at all!! Waited for over an hour and a half went in to complain and they proceeded to tell me it could be another hour!! This is crazy, and I will edit this if the food changes my mind"
Beverly C.,"Troncone-mancino, Italy",27,98,1174,4.0,9/5/2015,"I know this is a chain but I have to tell you we revived exceptional service and the food was on point. We came for lunch and I had the Thai Lettuce Wraps from the appetizer menu as my meal. It is not the first time I have had this dish and it is probably not the last. The fresh veggies, tasty tender chicken and amazing sauces will satisfy your health nut tooth, just delicious..."
Robert P.,"Watertown, NY",86,73,58,4.0,7/4/2016,"I finally had the opportunity to try this place and it was good but I feel like it's a little bit blown out of proportion but perhaps that could be on the fault of my missed opportunity to try the cheesecake. I will say that the staff was pretty exceptional and by far some of the best service I've had in an unfortunately long while. As for the meal I ate, I chose the Fried Macaroni & Cheeseburger. I couldn't really tell by the taste that there was a fried macaroni & cheese ball on the burger. It tasted like a normal burger. I also had the Pineapple Moscow Mule. It was really bitter and that's mainly the taste I was getting through the length of the drink. I ended up paying about $60 for my wife and I which is what I expected. Overall, good experience."
Emily W.,"Pompton Lakes, NJ",154,8,14,5.0,3/28/2017,"Simply an amazing experience.  Better get here early because this place fills up fast!  I went on a Saturday and put my name down at 4 and was given an estimated 45 minute wait time.  Luckily we were seated within 30 minutes.  The bread took a little too long to get to the table, but in all honesty, the portions are large enough to the point that I knew eating the bread would be a terrible decision.  I ate the bread anyway and it was delicious.  I ordered a Cuban sandwich and I was not disappointed.  Not only was it the best Cuban I have ever had but it was probably the best sandwich I have ever had as well.  I will go as far to say that it was probably the most delicious meal that I've had all year.  My only critique is the portion size may have been a little too big.  Thats more of a personal issue because even though I tried to save half for latter, I inhaled the whole sandwich then and there.  I was so full, I was convinced I had the stomach flu.  Having my body withering in pain was definitely worth it and you'll  find me back at this Cheesecake Factory in the near future."
C H.,"Cortland, NY",0,10,,1.0,1/11/2017,"Just ate there. Very disappointing for the second time. Hostess was arrogant, waiter was inattentive; pushing drinks but had to ask for bread and water, food was served cold and tasteless. Rip off and over rated."
Patrick B.,"Liverpool, NY",31,123,41,5.0,4/6/2015,"Good stuff! Been here a few times and enjoyed it every time. I really liked sitting on the ""outside"" of the restaurant rather than the inside, the feel of it was very nice and you get to people watch as you eat. There are SO MANY WAITERS here, holy cow, if you need something just start talking toward the aisle and someone will hear you! haha. At first it took them a bit to serve us because I think they didn't know who had table 52 at the time. One woman apologized and brought us our drinks and took our order, then eventually introduced us to a different woman who would become our actual server. I didn't mind one bit, the food came out quick and everyone was very polite. I LOVE the ambiance of the inside of this place, very majestic and regal. I like fancy places like this that don't also carry a hefty price tag too. So this place is great for many reasons. Definitely in the top 3 places to eat at Destiny!"
Jared B.,"Raleigh, NC",258,70,466,4.0,3/23/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory lives up to expectations. There's been a lot of hype around The Cheesecake Factory. And whenever I breeze by at the mall, there always seems to be a long wait outside. This Sunday, I gave lunch a try. The Cheesecake Factory is located in the new wing of DestinyUSA. It's a lot like the other franchises I've been to: the brightly lit dining room's gaudy interior is a modern take on the 1920's. Separated by a glass divider, a busy kitchen runs along the interior wall, visible to the entire room. The service was fast and polite. Our waitress was quick to take our order, and many members of the staff brought us our food to us. The menu is huge, mostly made up of American and European favorites: small plates, chopped salads, pizza, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, and an array of meat entrees. There's a ""Skinnylicious"" menu, which features a selection of items from the regular menu, made slimmer through smaller portions and healthier ingredients. I was stoked to see a large selection of gluten free items, including bread and buns for the sandwiches and burgers. I ordered the turkey burger. The Cheesecake Factory is famous for building its meals from scratch, and it shows. The burger was fresh in juiciness, texture, and taste. They incorporated a flavorful medley of seasonings into the patty (coriander and cumin, I think). The chefs topped my burger with caramelized onion, and sandwiched it into a gluten-free bun that was big and soft (a rare treat). I ordered sweet potato fries for my side and they were served crisp and tasty. The prices are on the high side for Syracuse (I could get a turkey burger at a lot of other establishments for a few dollars less). But, I wasn't robbed: they clearly work with quality ingredients, and that's where I found the value. It's blasphemous, I know, but I didn't get cheesecake. I'm just not a cheesecake guy. Sorry, not sorry. Ultimately, if you wonder if the hype is deserved, I'd argue it is: the food at The Cheesecake Factory is very good."
Jared B.,"Johnson City, NY",11,53,1,5.0,1/17/2017,Great food. I had the enchalata. It was freezing cold in there but I asked to warm it up and they had no problem. And they did. It got a lot warmer.
Latoyia Z.,"Atlanta, GA",18,79,13,4.0,10/15/2016,Food was awesome! I had the barbecue chicken salad and my husband the miso salmon. I also ordered the Oreo extreme cheesecake at the to go counter because our server never offered the menu and we were ready to go. The only downside was that the bread was cold and our server was not attentive and slow. It took a while to get our food. We had to flag her down for a couple things. I will return and hope I get a better server!
Warren L.,"Worcester, MA",39,143,919,4.0,6/22/2015,"Kitchen speed was adequate, food was excellent, & service was excellent.  The menu goes on forever.  I love this place."
Pat D.,"Kanata, Canada",1,30,7,2.0,10/23/2016,I'm not impressed with the amount of time it takes to get drinks here.  Food was very good but our drinks took way too long because the restaurant was full and only one bartender was working behind the bar.  It would have been nice to see management help behind the bar to help out but that didn't happen.  I won't be back.
Nina M.,"Chandler, AZ",1,6,2,5.0,5/28/2017,"Ah yes, the Cheesecake Factory. Filled with goodies for all of us to eat. For breakfast, I have ordered a waffle with strawberries, whipped cream, and a white chocolate drizzle on top. The strawberries tasted so sweet and fresh, the waffle was so fluffy and sweet, the  white chocolate drizzle and whipped cream so delicious!! I had to get another bite! I haven't eaten a good morning breakfast in about a couple of years. That was the best waffle I have ever had!! I would definitely love to go back and get some more. The waitress was nice and so caring too. I'd love to give her plenty of tips and thank yous.kisses to the chef for preparing such a marvelous meal! Inside the restaurant, my jaw dropped. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. It was so dashing and beautiful inside. The booths were so comfy cozy, I could Sit and eat there for days. Please do try to come here if you can. I hope you enjoyed your stay as much as I did!"
