Alan R.,"New York, NY",99,14,12,4.0,1/16/2016,"Certainly worthy of 4 stars.  Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant, but unlike many other chain restaurants, makes everything from scratch every day. It's a very noticeable trait that makes Cheesecake Factory near the top of the commercial list.  At this location seating is almost always immediate. The appetizers are absolutely awesome...literally every one that I've tried has been great. Service has been very good as well. The only item that wasn't super enjoyable was the Tuna carpaccio..it had a heavy water taste to it which usually suggests frozen product, but hey, it wasn't too bad.  Main courses are again very well made. Their selection I must say is usually different than the expected standard of any said dish...I'd assume the chefs use some creative liberty in this department...not sure how much is from the corporate and how much of the process is local. I'd describe as an American Asian fusion cuisine. Even the Italian dishes seem to have an Asian spice to them. All the better for me! Finally their cheesecake is not typical and not what you'd expect in the city...but with that being said it's darn good. I really mean it.  I recommend Cheesecake Factory at this location, especially for first seating...I've had my best meals here at this time. Hope this helps!"
Sarah B.,"Raleigh, NC",157,37,15,4.0,3/21/2015,"In the realm of quality chain restaurants, Cheesecake Factory is high on the list.  I had the spicy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce and a side salad. The sandwich was good, though stacked enormously high. It was a bit hard for a gal with an average sized mouth to take the first bite. Once I got rolling, though, it was delicious - and more than I could finish. The salad was decent, though it seemed like it had been sitting for a while - the leaves were slightly wilted and sunk into the bottom of the side dish.   It was just a simple Saturday lunch, but overall, a good experience! I would come back, for sure."
Valery B.,"Mountain View, CA",0,19,,3.0,10/5/2016,Can't say that I didn't enjoy the cheesecake ( lemon rasberry for life ) but the Veggie burger is 95% rice and other main dishes were somehow disappointing.
Ashley W.,"Denver, CO",566,97,568,4.0,3/4/2015,"We chose the Cheesecake Factory for my company's monthly lunch outing. We were very excited to eat some greets cheesecake and were not let down!  There was plenty of seating and there is actually direct access to the restaurant from the outside of Destiny, which is a rarity. We were seated immediately and our waiter told us she has tried everything on the menu, which must have take forever since there are so so may cheesecake options. She was extremely nice and helpful to anyone who needed help deciding between a few cake options.  Although they have some cakes showing in a display case in the front there are NO pictures of the cheesecakes in the menu! I was completely surprised about that and our waiter did a good job clearing up a lot of questions we had, and it was clear the descriptions listed in the menu were not exactly the case and pictures would have really helped. I would go back here for a dessert, but I would absolutely pick out my cheesecake at the display case before I sat down at my table."
Furman L.,"Columbia, SC",117,200,113,5.0,1/23/2015,"This is an awesome Cheesecake Factory. Enjoyed dining here twice while in town for a wedding.  The staff are friendly. Food comes out hot. And to top it off, they are open late.  Parking is abundant and free. Location is outstanding, with one of the biggest malls in the USA attached to it.  Highly recommend."
Ruthnie A.,"Syracuse, NY",226,18,35,4.0,12/23/2014,"Just sitting around waiting on my takeout and taking it all in. The ambience is so metro but tame. It *feels* like a place with constant business.  The presentation of the cakes are clean, attractive and beautiful. I haven't gotten my lunch time pizza and salad home to scarf down yet but I will let you know how that goes. The front waiters did have about a 5-10 minute wait but the front hostess set my expectations accordingly. They've earned my curious palette a future visit and first-time dine-in experience."
Terri T.,"Warrenton, VA",2,76,1,4.0,6/17/2016,I love going to Cheesecake factory anywhere.....  consistent quality of food and friendly wait staff.  This location though seems less roomy than the one closest to me.  We went on a Saturday night around 5:00PM and was pleasantly surprised we were seated less than 3 minutes.  When we left there was a 20 minute wait.  The best thing to have a wonderful restaurant like this in a mall?  Is to walk it off with some window shopping!
Steph G.,"Syracuse, NY",67,386,6,3.0,6/20/2016,"i cant give you more than three stars, cheesecake factory. you have a great space and your servers are always helpful. but.. your food is no good! ordered the chicken salad sandwich on brioche with a side salad. the chicken salad had excessive amounts of mayo, and the brioche was toasted :( the salad was heavily dressed, but luckily still crunchy. neglected to order any cheesecake post-meal, but did sample my pal's chocolate mousse slice. it was obscenely decadent (shocker) and oversized. you lose a star for that portion faux pas!"
Chase H.,"Vero Beach, FL",0,3,3,4.0,3/30/2017,First of all I would like to recommend The Cheesecake Factory establishment. Me and my family had a great time dinning and experiencing the aura of many different cultures brought into one. Our waitress was very kind and refilled my drink several times over the course of my meal. She also came back with more bread multiple of times when we ran out. I ordered the four cheese pasta which was very good! (Picture Below) Although it was a little too much for me so I brought it home in a plastic container. After we all finished our dinners we were off back into the mall for some more shopping. Depending on what you order it can get pretty pricy. We ended up not getting cheesecake because we wanted a desert at home. One small slice of cheesecake was 8$! Maybe it would be worth it if the slice was a little bit bigger. Other than the usual crowdedness (Saturday) the experience was pleasant.
Victor J.,"Santa Clarita, CA",60,105,130,4.0,7/11/2016,"we are having fried zucchini sticks, four cheese alfredo end to top it off, some cheesecake for dessert."
Mina C.,"Liverpool, NY",22,81,29,4.0,10/14/2015,"Just ate dinner here- ordered the chicken salad with avocado; it was a HUGE portion- they should say feeds a family of 5.... We also ordered chicken avocado club with French fries.  We were sat immediately and our server took our drink orders right away; once we put our food order in our food came almost almost too quickly.  As I was enjoying my salad I bit into a portion of lettuce with tortilla chips and chicken that just had an odd taste; I brushed it off and had another go with just mainly lettuce and it tasted like full blown cleaning solution. I immediately spit it out and couldn't continue to eat the salad. We got the attention of a waiter who took it away and got a manager. The manager came over pretty quickly and he said he tasted the salad but no odd taste but would take it off the bill.  We were very happy that they offered to get me something else, but after that I lost my appetite. Even though we had this poor experience I can't rate them poorly bc our other meal was good and the service was good.  We will return and hopefully my salad won't taste like chemicals!"
Halyna L.,"Utica, NY",0,4,,4.0,7/20/2016,Had apps and dessert and the food was very good. We had the hamburger sliders which were delicious and the fried macaroni and cheese balls which were creamy and yummy. Of course had cheese cake - one piece of lemon meringue and carrot cake . Didn't like the lemon meringue cheesecake - too sickly sweet -tasted like lemon cough drops. Since I am not a cheesecake fan- they replace it with a piece of really good tiramisu. I tasted the carrot cake cheesecake and it tasted like a dense carrot cake. The carrot carrot cake was good.  We came around 5 pm when the didn't have a lot of servers but they were attentive and service very good. All in all a very pleasant experience.
Autumn S.,"Baldwinsville, NY",53,35,17,2.0,11/6/2015,"Fat fat fat. Hard to eat anything on the menu without putting in 1000 calories into,your guy. Let's not even take about dessert, there you expect it. You don't need it in your dinner too.  Typical franchise fair, I don't get why they're so busy"
Mary B.,"Marietta, NY",62,1,,1.0,1/25/2017,"We have been many times, and the food/service has been good.  Tonight was a different experience.  The hostess told us to ""step aside"", she'd ""let us know"".  We thought about leaving, should have, didn't.  Server was nice, walked us through specials, brought my wine.  Took order, was pleasant, great follow through.  Appetizer, was small, but tasty.  Entrees arrived, mine was brunt, tasted like charred garlic.  Husbands, was bland, that entree the only reason we went there.  He likes that meal. This is when it gets interesting..never saw our original server again.  No one came back to check on the meal. A server whom we had never seen before came over took our plates without even speaking to us.  Then came back and said, "" do you want the check?""  Um yes, I guess no dessert. Thanks.  The best ending was the wine I was brought was not what I ordered.  Guess that's the last time we go there.  But I'm assuming they don't care, what's our $60 bucks?  Pretty obvious by the random server swap."
Hak T.,"Ottawa, Canada",30,188,407,5.0,8/30/2015,They never seem to disappoint both with service and the food!  I haven't been here for at least 1 year I noticed on difference in service.  As far as major chains go top 3 for sure.  This location is fantastic service wise!
Andi C.,"Hagerstown, MD",58,13,2,4.0,7/5/2016,Burger was a little overcook but the filet mignon is one of the best I've ever had. So amazing! We always enjoy this place. Service was amazing as well. Cheesecake is yummy! Always save room!
Justin V.,"Ithaca, NY",21,143,13,5.0,2/28/2014,"This place.....is amazing. I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory before so when I heard this was opening in the mall I had to check it out. We waited 3 hours to be seated and it was SOOOOOO worth it! The atmosphere here was awesome. We were seated by an awesome waiter who was very attentive with our needs and refills even though they were super busy. He made us feel as if we were important to him and not just another table which was great! We were also seated within view of the SU game which was awesome. We ordered drinks, apps and food and they all came very quickly. I started with a blueberry Mojito, my wife had the Peach mimosa and both were great. Easily one of the best mojito's I've ever had. For apps I got the Buffalo Blasts and Edamame. The buffalo blasts are chicken, cheese and buffalo sauce in a wonton wrapped, fried and served with blue cheese dressing and hot sauce. They we GREAT! Crispy, lots of filling and lots of flavor. I tasted the cheese and chicken, not just hot sauce. The blue cheese dressing was great too! It's hard to find good blue cheese dressing some times. The edamame was cooked perfect and salted perfectly. For the meal I got the Chipotle pasta with Honey Chicken. The portion was HUGE! The pasta was spicy but had GREAT flavor. Lots of chicken and the honey was a perfect contrast to the chipotle. I love sweet and spicy and this delivered on both notes. My wife got the chicken tacos and loved them! Lots of chicken and mix in's and again, big portions! They were very accommodating to our friend who was gluten free and lactose intolerant which was great! The waiter made sure that he was going to tell the cooks to be careful with her food and made every precaution when she was going to order to let her know if the food she was going to order had either in it. For a menu as large as they have I was surprised they knew almost the whole thing!!! Afterwards I got the Banana Cheesecake and my wife got the peanut butter chocolate one and both were the best cheesecake we've ever had. For a place with the title ""Cheesecake Factory"" they better deliver and they did. I was not hungry to eat the whole thing but it was so good I did haha. Overall the service, the food, everything made waiting 3 hours worth it in every sense. I would definitely wait again. The only suggestion I have, and I hope they see this review, is that they really should devise a better system for waiting. Right now they have the sensor things they give you and they only work so far from the restaurant. If you go out into the mall it won't beep. A lot of restaurants in the mall are doing cell phone numbers and calling you when your table is ready, that system is perfect and allows us to roam the mall whilst waiting so we are couped up just sitting waiting for our table. *Also....they totally sang to my friend for his birthday and gave him a small little treat! On a busy night too! Really made everything that much more special."
Phillip N.,"Liverpool, NY",10,69,,3.0,4/19/2016,"For the most part, I love all their entrees. The portions are big and prices reasonable. However, I ordered buffalo wings today and was disappointed. They were overfried, way too salty, and sauce to vinegarly."
Ashley K.,"Owego, NY",21,20,14,5.0,4/4/2016,"Couldn't think of a reason not to give them five stars, very deserving!  Though the wait is long.  (Been there three times, never had less than an hour wait - but it was Friday, Sunday, and Monday dinner time) However I don't think this is the restaurant's fault, just everyone in the area loves them too! The hostess(es) is (are) very friendly! They tell you straight up how long the wait is and how far you can take the ""buzzer"" and they even take your cell number to call you when your tables ready!  ::Inside:: A little dim, but not dark. Background music  - contemporary, not loud but audible. Marble flooring, doesn't look cheesy. Minimal decorations, in good taste. Very clean. Open patisserie case with all 30 flavours of cheesecake on display as soon as you walk in.  ::Sit down:: Waitress/waiter comes to ask about drinks right away, and he/she stays on top of refilling them all night. Dinner moves smoothly, not too fast (which I finds just as annoying as slow) or too slow.  Menu is expansive. Quite a selection of all different types of food. And everything I've ever had there is good! They are a chain restaurant. But you definitely can't tell from the food!  My fiance and I got the tamale cakes and tomato & mozzarella toast. Delish.  I haven't had dessert there yet. ::hangs head in shame:: I know, I know. This is what they're known for. But by that time I am always too full! I can only imagine how wonderful that cheesecake must be. I would love to try all 30 flavours of cheesecake! (They also offer desserts that are not cheesecake.) However we did get a cup of coffee after dinner and it's good coffee (I'm kinda a coffee snob at restaurants.)  ::Check comes:: Not too pricey. We are happy with the bill.  Overall - great place to take a date or have a girl's/guy's night at. Comfortable. Intimate. Affordable. Good food. Great experience."
Andy G.,"Ithaca, NY",245,445,10,1.0,10/13/2014,"An awful experience--I would not go back and would tell anyone I know to stay away. We avoided going to this restaurant for quite a while after they opened in Destiny Mall just to give them time to iron out any training and logistical issues. I assure you, they have not ironed them out. The staff is not on top of their duties, or do they take ownership when you politely mention something that's gone wrong. In addition, the over-complicated menu is overpriced and lacking in quality and creativity. Never again."
