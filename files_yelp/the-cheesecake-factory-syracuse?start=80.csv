Renee L.,"Weedsport, NY",19,12,,5.0,5/5/2016,I'm drooling just thinking about this place. Drinks are great.  Food is always amazing.  I really can't say anything bad about it. It's my favorite place at Destiny to eat!
Brittany M.,"Geneva, NY",24,2,1,4.0,8/7/2015,"Let's start with the menu... Wow it's huge, there are way to many choices especially if you,re an indecisive person like myself. We ordered the buffalo blast for an app, I didn't care for them. I ended up going with a simple chicken sandwich for my meal cause I knew there portions were HUGE! My sandwich was good, the bottom portion of bread was a little soggy.  By the end of my meal I was to full for cheese cake, but I've had it in the past and it's delicious! I'm sure I will eat here again but it's not in my top 10 favorite places to eat."
Jesse P.,"Syracuse, NY",1230,190,122,1.0,7/28/2014,"The food was raw. We waited almost an hour for our food. We were the first ones in the section to be seated. Everyone around us got their appetizers, their food came, they got their checks and they were leaving when our food finally came out.  Nobody told us there was a problem but obviosly there was. When the food finally came out my Partners was ok but mine was raw. The pasta was crunchy in the middle and I ended up not eating any of it.  This trip took 2 hours of our life and the food and service SUCKED."
Shannon G.,"Syracuse, NY",40,52,7,4.0,9/17/2015,"Went for lunch not long ago, and had drinks, a meal, and cheesecake. Overall, we enjoyed our meal. I had a small pizza and salad. The salad was very bitter (it's mixed greens). The pizza was pretty good, but seemed a bit undercooked. The crust was soggy and very thin, I couldn't even pick it up to eat. The margarita and cheesecake were both excellent. Overall, it was mostly good, but a little pricey. I highly recommend the lunch specials during lunch time, they seem to be pretty good deals."
Jim E.,"Belleville, Canada",455,286,1086,4.0,8/28/2014,"It was only after eating here that I saw the newspaper reports of Health violations previous at this location.  I make it a point to eat at each location that has a Cheesecake Factory and Syracuse was no exception.  For me we had a little wait to get seated, the service was great as well as the food! I love the Cheesecake Factory!"
Jen M.,"Syracuse, NY",0,43,3,2.0,10/14/2015,I was here twice I love the appetizers service was good but when it came to ordering dinner the meals were very high priced and very low quality. The cheesecakes are very good .
Casey K.,"Syracuse, NY",33,6,,5.0,4/12/2015,"Absolutely delicious! Let's get one thing out of the way; things can get expensive here, and getting a bunch of drinks is a sure way to ramp up your bill. The good news? That's the only negative I've found. I'm a huge fan of steaks, so it's not easy to blow me away; I didn't expect Cheesecake Factory to be the place to do so. Lo and behold, this steak was out of this world! I got a ribeye with fresh seasoned green beans on the side. The veggies were on point; hot, steamy, crispy and full of flavor. Expertly steamed. The steak? WOW. I get my steaks medium rare and they nailed it, serving it in a pool of its own hot, delicious juice. It was cooked to perfection, just the right amount of pink. The food was brought out by one of the cheeriest cooks I've ever seen, and our waitress went above and beyond to let us know about the steaks before we bought them. She also put in extra effort to get me just the right whiskey (though at 11 bucks a drink, I hope that's common). The wait was about an hour but as soon as we came back from roaming the mall a bit, our seat was ready to go. The atmosphere is great and we were perfectly comfortable.  Lastly, it wouldn't be a review without mentioning the cheesecake. Absolutely out of this world. I got the traditional slice of cheesecake with strawberries and cream, and it blew me away, the perfect end to my visit. Use caution, though; there are so many types of cheesecake it can be overwhelming, and if you pick something too crazy there's not much of a cheesecake flavor (my friend learned this when he got the Reese's cheesecake). I only mention this because the cheesecake is so great on its own, you don't need to drown it with other flavors. It ran me about 80 bucks total for a damn fine cut of steak, great cheesecake, and two fantastic whiskers (which they didn't skimp out on!) like I mentioned earlier; don't come here if you're on a budget. But if you're looking to splurge, you can't go wrong at the Cheesecake Factory in destiny USA. Bravo!"
Haley D.,"Lederach, PA",60,16,17,2.0,1/2/2016,"Not the best Cheesecake Factory I have been to. The nachos lacked cheese and were burnt. Ordered the Mexican chopped salad without chicken; and found halfway through the dish, chicken was indeed still added. Wish I did not have to write a bad review to a place I usually love going too, but I was very disappointed overall."
Andy G.,"Camillus, NY",0,8,1,2.0,5/10/2014,"Food tasted good and service was great. After we left, my girl and I got a bad gut ache and wound up repainting the toilet! Overly crowded and hard to concentrate on the vast amount if menu selections. Couldn't hold a conversation because of the loudness.  Need to rethink their restaurant layout to cut down on the echo and overpopulation. Two stars for the food taste, but the rest utterly sucked."
Chris D.,"Syracuse, NY",191,42,31,2.0,10/28/2015,"The hostess sat us outside where there were several families with newborns. The server also didn't stop by very often. The bread was delicious. And we got a mojito that cost almost $12. Really? That's a bit pricey for Syracuse, NY. The cheesecake was amazing. I recommend this place for dessert only!"
Brett G.,"Syracuse, NY",1,6,1,1.0,3/31/2014,"The 45 minute wait to be seated was understandable.  It is a new restaurant and wouldn't be a problem if the dining experience was great.  Sadly, it was not good.  We had terrible service, 30 minutes to get a beer (bottle) from the bar, and our fellow diners were saying it was their first time there and they won't be coming back.  The food was not good either.  Fried Mac n cheese is baked and dry.  Girlfriend ordered California cheese steak and roll sounded like a crouton when she bit it.  She said cheese was horrible and only ate 3 bites.  I ordered Moroccan chicken and best part was the cous cous.  The chicken was very over-marinated and had a bad texture.  We would not go back again. OH, and $17 for 2 pieces of mediocre frozen cheesecake with terrible whipped cream is RIDICULOUS!!!"
Tom S.,"Syracuse, NY",1,15,,4.0,7/7/2015,Had the beef and chicken combo plate then pineapple cheesecake. Combo plate was vary good. pineapple was ok. Price was a shock. Plan to spend $80 total.
Chrissy S.,"Ashburn, VA",1,4,,5.0,5/16/2015,"I have always thought of this as a ""cheesecake"" bakery! (Silly me) until a friend to me she was having dinner there! We were in Syracuse for my sons hockey tournament so we decided to try it!! We arrived in the early evening I would say around 6:30-7 pm and the wait was very minimal! Food was excellent, service was excellent and the dessert made cheesecake lovers of my kids! They are always asking to go back! Our server was beyond ""kid friendly."" What a great experience! We will definitely be back!"
John C.,"Roselle Park, NJ",39,10,,5.0,8/22/2015,"I wish I can rate this place more than 5 stars our waitress Cheryl was funny, sarcastic in a good way extremely conversational and very focused and on top of her game. I asked for the manager to come over and Denise stopped by and even she was extremely pleasant and funny and focused. I wish I could experience this service everyday everywhere . it's been an amazing experience . Thank you Cheryl for your awesomeness."
Jonnymoj0 ..,"Binghamton, NY",0,3,,3.0,9/26/2015,"First time visit. Service was good. Waitress checked back frequently. Ordered cheese steak sandwich with fries. Wife had loaded potato soup and salad. Food was slow to arrive. Cheese steak was very good. Fries were just warm. Wife's salad was good. Soup was good although wasn't very ""loaded"" with potatoes. Overall experience was average."
Ramona G.,"Syracuse, NY",117,271,969,5.0,4/21/2015,"cheesecakes are amazing! food is great too! i've been four times and can't wait to return. Get the mini crab butes, corn tamales, stuffed mushrooms, etc. You can't go wrong! I love the pasta carbonara!!! so good. finger licking good!"
Beth T.,"Greenwich, NY",0,31,1,4.0,5/30/2015,"Yummy but heavy food.  Mac cheese bites for app, j had chx&biscuits, me shrimp pasta.  All good great service!"
Jeffrey Y.,"Mount Pocono, PA",0,6,,5.0,3/25/2016,"Fantastic. The bread was great, the Thai Salmon was tender and the cheesecake was exquisite as well. One of my favorite places to go."
Katie R.,"South Windsor, CT",26,18,1,4.0,1/11/2015,"Good value for what it is.  I enjoy the atmosphere and the service. I have some special restrictions and the waitress and staff was very accommodating.  I've never had a bad dish or a bad cheesecake.  The roasted pear pizza is fantastic. The fish and chips could use a little less breading and a little more fish, but was otherwise tasty.  The pear and endive salad was good, but could have used a little more pears and a little less chicken. Be prepared to wait a while for a table; they don't take reservations."
Kevin H.,"Syracuse, NY",1,141,1,5.0,3/14/2015,"Great good but don't look at the calories, and save room for dessert or start with it it's great.    Weekends expect a long wait but it's not bad Monday thru Thursday.    Service was excellent too."
