Otto P.,"DuPont, WA",2,14,89,5.0,1/10/2018,Not quite sure why the reviews are so low but the food is FABULOUS! Service was good Food was better! Shiitake mushrooms top sirloin marinated in Napa Valley wine and cooked to perfection!
Dan B.,"Warren, MI",2,72,1,2.0,12/11/2017,"I ordered two things. A Santa Fe salad and an order of buffalo blasts to go. The salad was delicious. It was perfect. Then, I opened the blasts in my hotel room. I wouldn't believe this review if it wasn't my own order. 5 out of 8 blasts had no chicken in them. You read that correctly. The buffalo chicken blasts did not have chicken in them. I don't even know how Cheesecake Factory accomplish cooking the empty triangles. That is as bad as it gets.  Order a salad here or don't come."
Sheree S.,"Lacey, WA",135,144,395,5.0,12/11/2017,"We spent hours shopping here at the mall, so we earned a good lunch and when I say good what I really mean is Yumtastic.  My mans order was the best thing I think I have ever tasted. He got the cajun jumbalaya , it was so goooood!!! Seriously had to use those exclamation marks to make you understand that you need to order that. Dec 11th  This is my 3rd time here, I love the food However I hate the 15-20 minutes min wait they always have tables open its like they like to make you wait. No matter how many people are there, there is always a wait. They dont welcome strollers so leave those behind, fire hazard."
Nicole T.,"Tacoma, WA",41,134,273,1.0,1/3/2018,"Was super excited about coming here and using my gift card here from our football team. We were greeted and seated immediately but it took around 5-7 minutes for our waitress to show up. We placed our order of 2 small plate specials and our entree orders. A lunch pizza and salad, fettuccine Alfredo, bacon burger and steak Diane. We also ordered drinks like that 8 dollar milkshake. 10 mins go by. No bread, no drinks and finally our waitress shows up saying they were out of one of the small plates- we orders truffle bacon grilled cheese, Nashville hot chicken bites, chicken taquitos(out)  and there are no small pizzas for the lunch special but she will just order the large one. We asked for the same price and she stated no- . Ok. So now we are 10 kind behind with our food orders and small plate order. Any who... chicken was amazing. Not as hot as real Nashville hot chicken but good. And the truffle bacon grilled cheese was great. I can always count on the food to be ok it's the service that lacks every damn time."
Ryan C.,"Spanaway, WA",0,16,17,4.0,1/9/2018,My wife and I stopped in for lunch for our first time at a cheesecake factory. We sat in the bar which we learned the table we sat at wasn't actually the bar. The guy was rude about it that let us know it wasn't a seat yourself table. We went to the front to wait to be seated and the girl seemed annoyed with us at the counter. It wasn't a great first impression. We would've left if it wasn't for the gift card we had. Our server Robert changed our entire experience once we were seated. He was very helpful with questions we had about the menu and he had a great customer service attitude. My wife had the veggie burger and I had the steak Diane. The food was very good and above average. The atmosphere is really cool! We will probably return sometime. Some of the staff definitely needs a better attitude or more training in customer service.
Jizelle O.,"Orange, CA",1409,151,1268,4.0,6/14/2017,"Based off cheesecake alone because I only went here for dessert, ON POINT! The cake, the icing, the crust, and presentation was all amazing. From the first bite to the last it was just all delicious. I have lost all control of what went in my mouth...what is a diet anyways?  From carrot cake cheesecake to peanut butter cup to red velvet to Oreo, they've got it all. They even have the basic plain cheesecake in ""low fat"" options, and it's one of the only slices they offer under 1000 calories! Well worth it though, I would run a few miles for some of their cake.  No lie, it was pricey but then again it's the Cheesecake Factory so go figure. I paid $20 (including tax and tip) for two slices. My poor wallet! I would definitely only eat here for special occasions considering how expensive it is but no regrets!"
Danica T.,"Tacoma, WA",127,37,21,4.0,11/29/2017,"All of my experiences at the Cheesecake Factory have been great. The service has been on point! A few weeks ago I went with my boyfriend's family and we had ordered desserts after our meals, we were so busy talking that we didn't even realize that our desserts were taking longer than expected. After 20 minutes or so, the waitress came and apologized profusely and had her manager come and give us a gift card for the wait although we told her we didn't mind. She took responsibility for the wait and honestly made the situation 10x better! Her professionalism and kind personality have definitely earned them a loyal customer! I've also done takeout and have never had a problem with that either!"
Yewon L.,"Tacoma, WA",58,1,,2.0,1/8/2018,"I went to go buy 2 Godiva cheesecakes but came home and realized they gave me red velvet cheesecake. I was a little annoyed that i didn't get what i ordered but i was just going to slide this one. I called to make sure that i didn't pay more than i should have and to let them know that they made a mistake with my order, but they were just careless, rude and they didn't even apologize. Im paying a lot for a tiny slice of cake, you think they would at least have good customer service."
Jen L.,"Tacoma, WA",5,4,,2.0,11/20/2017,"I went to the cheesecake factory last weekend and was really disappointed in my experience. We waited 45 minutes or so for a table - which we normally wouldn't have done but they told my husband 30 and we were able to get our shopping completed ... so we waited for another 15 in line .. which wouldn't have been a big deal but we have a 4-year-old and a two-year-old .. we probably should have just left at that point, but we didn't have enough foresight.  Upon being seated, we ordered our drinks and an appetizer. The drinks took a while to get back to us, and when the server appeared with them, she asked if we thought about any appetizers. She forgot to put the order in. So we decided to skip it, since the kids were hungry at that point.  We ordered 2 salads, some apps and 2 kids meals. My husband's salad came right out, and they told me mine would be out soon. It wasn't, and after I was able to flag the waitress down and ask where my salad was, she said our food would be right out too. I wanted to eat my salad, and not be crowded for space at our little table, so they brought the salad out to me and said they could hold the food.  When they brought the food, the avocado toast we'd ordered was browning and the toast was soggy. My daughter's meatball was raw - not pink - RAW. We asked for a new order of spaghetti + meatballs since it was raw ... they went and cooked the same order longer, and brought it back out (on a very hot plate that a 4-year-old shouldn't touch). It was still undercooked, but at this point, she was so hungry, so she ate some pasta and part of the meatball that was cooked.  They brought the food to us on incredibly hot plates - leading me to believe they just let our food sit in the hot window while I ate my salad that they forgot to bring to me. AT the VERY least they should have swapped out the plates for the kids to be on dishes that wouldn't hurt them to touch. They should have re-made the avocado toast because it was gross. And then especially after serving a raw meatball to us, and after I let them know it was still not totally cooked and that no, we didn't want to take it home and that she was not going to finish the uncooked portion that they should have at the very least taken the kids meal off of the bill.  Our waitress was busy and not attentive, and we had a sub-par experience. After dropping off the bill, she was nowhere to be found so I could pay for this whole thing and leave. My husband had to take the kids (who were so done with being there after this whole long ordeal) to the car while I waited. And finally, the host who sat us initially finally took my check.  The manager's lack of care around the raw meatball served to my daughter, and the lack of care of the food they served us and the terrible service will make me think at least twice before returning to this location.  Mistakes happen (we'd been served raw chicken at this location once before - seems like they happen here a lot) but the way in which a manager or server handles hte situation is what makes me decide to go back or not, and I'm incredibly disappointed at the way they handled this!"
Zipporah J.,"Tacoma, WA",128,13,1,3.0,12/18/2017,"The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, but the meal itself was very underwhelming. If I were rating on the quality of food alone, I would only give a one star rating. Brandon was our server and he was excellent. Despite the restaurant being very busy, he was extremely attentive and was there to refill our drinks sometimes before I even noticed I was running low. We are a large party of 8 which includes 4 kids and a baby, but he was very patient and accommodating! He even got one of the items taken off from our bill because the kids didn't like it. If I were just rating him, this would be a five star review. Chances are that if I wanted some cheesecake and maybe a drink or two and was in the area, I could see myself coming back. But only after having had dinner elsewhere."
Teaha L.,"Fairfax, VA",21,9,10,2.0,5/26/2017,"Absolutely the worst food I've ever had from a Cheesecake Factory. I've been to numerous locations across the country and have always been pleased. This time, at the Tacoma location, was more than disappointment.  Thai lettuce wraps: the chicken was less than a single breast and was dry and overcooked. The lettuce was DIRTY. Was sent back.  Louisiana chicken pasta: GREASY.  Kids macaroni: Very good.  Chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake: delicious!  The issues were brought up to a manager and we were brushed off. They removed the Thai lettuce wraps from the check, but didn't offer anything but a condescending smile and nod.  On top of our own issues, our neighboring table sent back their shrimp tacos due to the fact that not only was the shrimp overcooked, but it was diced up and only 4 little dices on each taco.  Needless to say we will not be returning to this location, nor would I recommend it to anyone I know.  The only reason I'm even giving it 2 stars is because the kids meal and cheesecake were good."
Ben L.,"Puyallup, WA",0,18,,1.0,1/6/2018,Not a good vibe here. No smiles from staff and even the red head manager had a scowl on her face. Food took 35 minutes to be served to our party of 5 and came at different times. Very disappointed very slow service. Not worth the$$
Ben C.,"Tacoma, WA",35,58,26,4.0,10/8/2017,This experience is based on my brunch experience in Tacoma.I love the options they have.I ate the monte cristo it was amazing the outer bread was a French toast with bacon and ham and eggs in the middle with a side of strawberry preserve and house potatoes.I would recommend this and order it again also feel free to treat yourself to a blood orange martini what a wonderful pairing with brunch
Victoria M.,"Tacoma, WA",2,18,7,1.0,9/28/2017,Yuck... yuck and YUCK Service was great. Although the food was disgusting .... not what I remember of my typical cheese cake factory. This Tacoma location definitely ruined it for me.
Mindy M.,"Tacoma, WA",33,93,49,3.0,9/6/2017,This location is so much smaller than the one in south center. It gets crowded real quick. The food also seems to be off comparing it with the one in south center or Seattle. Will not be returning to this location.
Neko G.,"Tacoma, WA",83,105,47,2.0,8/15/2017,Me and some friends came in to pick up desserts for everyone and we were stuck at the order area for 30 min. The person who is assigned to take orders stepped away and basically forgot to come back. After a manager apologized he went to grab her from the kitchen. She took our orders and then left again. So we waited for 15 min while a server 3ft away complained about her tables and having to deal with birthdays. I really wanted to leave but we had already paid so we were stuck.  The worker returns to hand us our pies (if we had known our order was sitting ontop of the case the entire time we would have just grabbed them and left) and we decided no matter what no more Cheesecake factory unless we are dining in at the one in Westfield.  The Salted caramel was good but you really have to love caramel.  Classic fresh strawberry was really good. White chocolate macadamia is def for someone with a crazy sweet tooth. Current fav is the white chocolate rasp.
Linda J.,"Seattle, WA",71,279,75,3.0,3/9/2017,"So to be honest, I was scared to eat here after reading all of the negative reviews. I decided to risk it because I don't eat meat so I thought, how sick could I get (worst case scenario)? I should preface my review by saying that I've waited tables before so I'm a little more understanding (and also a little more discerning) than most patrons.   Upon entering the restaurants, I received friendly greetings from smiling faces. It wasn't long before our waiter came over and took our beverage orders and asked if we wanted bread. The drinks came pretty promptly.  I was catching up with my friend so I didn't pay close attention, but I'd gone through the whole wheat bread by myself (don't judge) and waited for a while before our meals came out. She ordered a salad and I'd ordered a veggie burger... It probably shouldn't have taken that long since I eat food very slowly (especially since I otherwise don't eat bread). Our waiter was attentive and had pretty good timing as far as asking if everything was okay, etc... Right away I noticed that my food was about room temperature. Not good. It was borderline and I hadn't seen our waiter for a while so I started eating. Again, there was no meat involved and I was hungry. I don't remember anyone coming by to refill our waters (though I'm not sure hers needed refilling).  I eventually told our waiter that my meal was lukewarm and I'd like him to relay that message to the manager. I also told him that I'd read a lot of reviews on Yelp about the lukewarm food situation. I didn't want to be a pain and told him as much... I did not pressure him to redo my order because we were already done eating and I could easily reheat it when I got home. Other than the temperature of my food, it tasted pretty good. The portion was huge which made me feel like I got my money's worth. I've never seen a veggie burger patty that big so there's something to be said about that. However, the more I thought about it the more it bothered me that he didn't insist on redoing it or getting the manager for me. I can only imagine it was a server in training that came with him to bring us our bill and my friend ordered a few pieces of cheesecake to go. When she came back I told her the same thing I'd told our waiter. I admitted that I told him he didn't HAVE to worry about it but I'd wished he'd offered to rectify the situation. She was very apologetic and gave me an eta on remaking my burger. I thanked her and the manager came over to address my concerns. She too was apologetic and said that they have new kitchen staff and they are still trying to find their rhythm, etc... Not really a valid excuse or one that should be offered to patrons, but I don't imagine there's anything she could say that would make sense. The server in training wrapped back around with us and apologized again. I really do hope that the cooks get it together because this place has potential. It would be a shame for the waitstaff to suffer due to circumstances beyond their control. I gave three stars because in the end it was handled well and attitude goes a long way."
Lovely R.,"Central District, Seattle, WA",0,19,12,1.0,10/24/2017,"Very disappointed with this place today. Ordered my usual meal. Louisiana chicken pastas. When the food came to go. There was no Parmesan. And no eating utensils. Had to ask for that. The cashier seemed to have a little attitude about having to walk to the back to get these things. Seemed a bit agitated with me for asking. I pay and go straight home, I live across the street. Not even 5 minutes away. Eat some of my food and it's not even warm. Probably room temperature. I'm pissed . I just paid about $16 for this meal to be cold and not even satisfied. Shame on them because when I called to let management know all he could say was that they made it ready to go and it should've been hot. That's it. Truly horrible customer service experience.I will not be back to this location again."
Nancy S.,"Grapeview, Grapeview, WA",0,3,,1.0,12/28/2017,"Won't be going here again.  The receptionist at check-in was rude and told us even though we had reservations they would not seat any of us until the entire party arrived.  period.  it took about an hour to get our food after we ordered, and they ""made a mistake"" on one of our orders so they needed to take an additional 15 minutes or so to get that order out.  by then most of us were done eating.  the food was just above average, not great.  the cheesecake was amazingly awesome but not worth the hassle of everything else."
Chris G.,"Clarksville, TN",50,17,3,3.0,11/23/2017,"Food was great, many options on the menu-too many. Service was good, but food came out super slow. Their kitchen needs some work. The waiter picked up that it was my daughters birthday, without us telling him and sung her happy birthday with the other waiters."
Heather H.,"Kent, WA",133,12,4,5.0,1/9/2017,"Great experience! My 4 year old daughter got a new ""baby"" and asked the waiter for some strawberries to celebrate her baby's very first birthday... we were blown away when the waiter came back with a wonderful strawberry ""cake"" complete with a candle. The staff really went above and beyond to make my daughter's visit special.    The waitstaff was incredibly attentive to my family's needs, and while this may not seem like that big of a deal... let me add that we had a one year old with us as well. We are quite used to the ""Oh great, here comes baby mess"" look, but there was none of that here, only kindness and friendliness.   We really enjoyed our visit and would recommend this particular location to our friends and family. Thank you!"
Matthew H.,"Dallas, OR",141,191,1030,5.0,12/14/2016,"I've been to the factory before, but not this one. This one is brand new to Tacoma. It's a very nice place. Everyone is very helpful. They offer just about everything.  Steak, seafood, pasta, burgers. Everything and cheesecake. Great place"
Debbie S.,"Tacoma, WA",0,3,,1.0,12/20/2017,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory at the Tacoma Mall last Saturday 12/16/17 with a friend of mine. Although the restaurant did not appear busy it too forever to get service. We waited 25 minutes after we ordered to finally get our food. I ordered the Avocado egg rolls which were good but just toward the end there was a hair in the dipping sauce. The waitress told me that it was unacceptable and that the manager would be right over.. after waiting 15 minutes, just paid the bill and left. The combination of inattentive server and what appears to be lack of concern for their customers by management, I won't be back nor recommend this venue."
Luke K.,"Sumner, WA",60,19,2,3.0,11/1/2017,Came there on a Wednesday night.. wasn't too busy... they sat us quickly at a table... the food was alright and service was above average...
Kerri L.,"Whitehall, PA",99,7,,2.0,10/15/2017,"Boo!!!!! Unfortunately every time my husband and I go here we are more and more disappointed. We went this morning for brunch and ended up walking out. We sat at the bar for ten minutes and no bartender showed up. Two gentleman in dress shirts were at the wait station and never acknowledged us or the fact that a bartender was nowhere to be found. We use to enjoy coming here at least once a week. Sadly, I believe this was our last attempt at Cheesecake Factory redemption. Ended up at Top of Tacoma and had a great meal with great service."
Mad M.,"Tacoma, WA",11,237,1995,2.0,6/10/2017,"Chain restaurant. Lines horribly long for dinner, not sure why as food was mediocre. Steak was  burned and dry. fries soggy. chicken dry. not impressed."
S R.,"Seattle, WA",2,19,59,5.0,12/7/2016,"It was their opening day and so we thought we would give them a try. In all honesty, I expect their system to be a bit out of place but to my surprise they were very professional and attentive. The people and staffs there made the place feels more alive than ever which is always a plus.  The food are great though the only thing I saw that could be better is the sourdough bread that was served before other dishes and how it could've been a little softer and warmer.  I also LOVE LOVE LOVE their orange juice. Why? Because it is fresh squeeze as you order which takes longer time but I didn't mind the wait for it because the staffs took their time to make sure their customers receive the best quality food."
Nick C.,"Sumner, WA",0,2,,1.0,12/20/2017,"We called in advance and was told that we couldn't make a reservation for a party of 6, it needed to be 7 or more. We came in and waited for 1 hr. In the time we waited another party of 6 was seated right away and we were told ""our table was being cleaned"" the staff was very rude and unapologetic about the obvious oversight and it was another 15 min before we were seated. Our food was very good we ordered multiple appetizers, meals, and desserts. Everyone enjoyed the food however with the experience I had while waiting for a table, I will not be back to this location."
Robert K.,"Tacoma, WA",0,4,17,3.0,10/7/2017,"Nice decorum and pretty good food. My go-to selections are the Hibachi steak, chicken belagio, and the Tex mex eggrolls off the appetizer menu. Love their Asian pear martini's. Jayden and Andrea behind the bar are fantastic. Very cordial also when they come from behind the bar.  Today they flubbed my wife's order and instead of waiting for them to rectify the problem after she lost her appetite we turned down them making it over. Our server Athena not only took it off but came back about 8 minutes later and offered clam chowder on her dime. The little things matter."
Dean N.,"Tacoma, WA",26,6,,2.0,12/7/2017,I have been to many Cheesecake Factories but none as bad as this one. The staff was rude and unprofessional. There was an issue with them not seating our group so asked to speak to a manager and she was about as unprofessional as the come. The only bright spot was the server was pleasant (the reason for 2 and not 1 star). The food was only so so. Will definitely never go back.
J C.,"Seattle, WA",2,49,2,1.0,3/23/2017,"I have been to this location twice. Both times my order came out burnt/overcooked. The first time I was dining inside and had to ask to have the order sent back. The server claimed it was overcooked because I wanted it pretty plain (factory nachos. I just wanted chicken, cheese and sour cream). I told him every other time I've ordered it it's been good. Wanting a smaller amount of toppings should not mean it's overcooked. No money was taken off my bill even though it took them another 20 minutes to remake the nachos.  Against my better judgment I returned to this location for a curbside to go order with the factory nachos. I should've checked the order before I left as when I got home and opened the box I found the nachos burnt. It was much worse than my first order was. Most of the chicken was inedible with lots of char and the consistency of leather.  It is absolutely unacceptable that orders are sent out to customers when they are clearly burnt. I would recommend that customers go elsewhere until this location trains their cooks how to make orders correctly. They also need to train their servers to not blame customers when an order is burnt.  I posted a picture of my second order."
Kaila M.,"Puyallup, WA",74,17,2,5.0,9/23/2017,"I am writing this review because a group of us decided to eat here for lunch after Bridesmaid dress shopping. There was about 7 of us. I had my 1 year old daughter with me. The staff here are amazing.  We came at a busy time... and yet they sat us in a timely manner. Our server was AMAZING. Her name was Alisha. She was friendly, personable, and so accommodating! I was so impressed with how genuine she was. She does an amazing job!  There was also another woman (I didn't catch her name) but she noticed my daughter was a little squirmy and asked me if she could bring her a Banana! Great customer service! Great food! I am very impressed! THANK YOU, ALISHA! You made my day!  -Kaila"
Sonia S.,"Olympia, WA",17,100,56,3.0,5/6/2017,"We came here around 815 on a Friday night.  When we checked in we were told about an hour wait, then she said no, not that long maybe 30-45 minutes.  She said we could get drinks in the bar area...which was packed, so I was basically standing over seated bar patrons to get a drink--and then I could only order one drink at a time.  There is no way multiple adults could be in this area not seated, ordering drinks.  I suggest a beverage server just for the waiting area...considering that wait times seem to be an issue with this place.   All the dishes ordered were good.  We ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken Nuggets...temperature was hot, tastes good...just suggest more pickles.  Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo...temperature a little above lukewarm...taste different than gumbo I have had elsewhere, but still good.  Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich...temperature BURNING HOT PLATE--had to have been in heating area for quite some time.  Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon Combo...this plate was cold and food lukewarm.  Taste good...just would have preferred proper food temperature and  more vegetables...only four spears of asparagus...even a starter salad would be nice for the price. Service was okay.  Server seemed to have knowledge and was friendly and prompt.  I think he said his name was Tom. I do like that they have a menu with lots of choices.  I think for some it could be overwhelming...but they definitely have something for everyone.  The prices are a little high...our total bill was about $124 not including tip.  Especially cocktail prices...it was over $13 after tax for the Passionfruit Mojito.  So for the four drinks our party had was over $50. The ambiance is nice.  With a little work, a few changes/additions and more consistency...this could be a great place.  I would like to return in the future and I hope to see some positive changes."
Jill K.,"Tacoma, WA",122,37,14,3.0,3/24/2017,"FINALLY.  Every time we've tried to come here, the wait has been an hour or more.  Once, we got there 10 minutes after they opened, on a Saturday around 11:45am, and there was already an hour wait.  WTF, are people lining up in advance of opening at this place?   Anyway, so we finally came in and were seated right away - it was 8:30pm on a Thursday night, so I guess that made the difference.  To start, the service was great - friendly server, brought water quickly and didn't rush us too much with deciding on food.  I got an iced tea with lemon, but no lemon came, though he brought back sweetener without being prompted. Shortly after our orders were taken, they switched servers so one could go on a break.  I appreciated that they came to let us know, but they tried to run off so quickly, I had to raise my voice to get one of them back to the table - I asked for the lemon that was forgotten with my tea. After that, the service just became lackluster.  The lemon never arrived and I gave up on asking for it a third time.  Drink refills were ignored.  There just wasn't much attention to the table - it seemed like the servers - both of them - had some friends at a table near us and were busy being sociable with them. In all, not the end of the world.  The food was still tasty and I'll be back for more - maybe the service is better during the day when it's impossible to get a table without taking a nap in your car while you wait.  Only major complaint?  BRING BACK THE CARAMEL CHICKEN."
Rusty F.,"Olympia, WA",3,120,,1.0,8/13/2017,"Why?!?!?  No really?!?!?  Why? This place is weird, $$$ for what they offer, not special.  People wait for over an hour?  Again- Why?  What am I missing?  Italian?  Greek?  Chinese?  Ok.   Weird?  I will not return... Gimikee OH yea... That's why there are so MANY people that wait in line for a seat- in a cafeteria setting.  Dude?!?!?  I ask again.. WHY!?!?!?  Is this place in biz?!?!?"
JJ D.,"Tacoma, WA",0,2,1,1.0,7/20/2017,"We have been to this location twice within 2 weeks, both times were bad.  The first time I ordered a salad, came to me with pieces of paper in it, we assumed from the bacon. If so, it means I had raw meat in my mouth (did not know about the paper until I ate it).  They took the meal off the check, that was fine.  We decided to try it again about a week later, and it was an even worse experience. My kids and I got our meals, but they didn't bring my husband's. My kids both ordered the buttered noodles and both came overcooked and hard and I don't know how they could not have seen it. We asked for replacements. My meal sat and got cold because I wasn't going to eat in front of my family when they had nothing. The 2 replacement noodles came out and one of them had some other food on it, something orange!  And my husband's burger was small, about half the size of his bun. We ended up asking for the check and leaving without eating.  I think it's safe to say that we will not be trying a third time. They really need to work on quality control here."
Hed M.,"University Place, WA",13,34,20,2.0,4/16/2017,"I think the biggest problem with the Tacoma location is that it's inconsistent. My first time there I ordered Chicken Marsala and got Chicken Madeira. Some days the servers are knowledgeable and fast, and other days it takes almost an hour to get your food-and you can definitely tell it's been under the hot window.  Normally you can't go wrong with any dish here, but on any given day the same dish is different! Chicken Marsala is my favorite dish, for example. Sometimes it comes with parsley and you are offered freshly grated cheese, other times it's chicken and pasta with barely any sauce. Some times you get sourdough and sweet bread, sometimes they are out of one.  I'm hoping that they hire more servers or continue with their training since the location is so new. And also-if they could add a waiting area to even the outside that would be great. Everyone is just squished in there like cattle waiting for their table!"
Catherine B.,"Tacoma, WA",35,23,,4.0,3/19/2017,"Great food, good service, accommodating kitchen, curbside to go. But OMG the calories, even without an $8+ dessert. Hubby and I love it, and a 16 year old girl will eat here no problem. If you have someone in your party with a smaller appetite order a half portion (if available)."
Cindi H.,"Gig Harbor, WA",0,15,,2.0,2/23/2017,Meh. Food was lukewarm. Didn't have to wait long because it was lunch time. Felt nauseous an hour after eating. Definitely wouldn't wait an hour to eat here.  ** update - after leaving this review The Cheesecake Factory contacted me and did remedy this situation. I am impressed with their customer service and desire to satisfy their customers.
Kristina K.,"Kent, WA",120,223,36,1.0,2/14/2017,"We were so excited for a cheesecake factory to open up nearby. At least once a month we go to Tukwila just to have their avocado eggrolls and a slice of strawberry cheesecake. It's a wonderful treat and something my girlfriends and I look forward too. Naturally when it was time to choose a restaurant for my Bachelorette Party - I called the new Cheesecake factory in Tacoma! I have made reservations for Cheesecake Factory in Tukwila, Hawaii, Belleuve, Tigard, Florida and all over the US while traveling. I love the ability to make reservations as they are always so busy. The hostess rudely told me that they do not take reservations. When I said ""we are coming in with a party of 14 and I do not want to overwhelm you, are you able to at least note that we are coming in?"" She said ""just send someone in two hours early to let us know and wait for you. WHAT?!? That's absurd. I called BJ's that is right next door - they happily took my reservation and had a table waiting for me.  The day of the party, before going to BJ's, I stopped and looked in at Cheesecake factory just to see if they could accommodate 14 at the last minute (since reservations did not work). 95% of the tables were empty with three girls standing around just chatting at the desk. When I asked how long the wait was for 14 - she said ""approx 90 minutes"" without evening looking. She then turned around and continued chatting with the other two girls, something about their boyfriend not liking a sexual position. We walked out and will not be returning to this location. I am absolutely appalled by the service over the phone, inability to provide any customer service, the service in person and the conversation they were having."
