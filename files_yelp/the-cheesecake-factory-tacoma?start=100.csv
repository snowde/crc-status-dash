Vanessa S.,"Zamboanga, Philippines",0,2,,2.0,12/25/2016,"We eat here last night for Christmas Eve dinner. Our server was great but when we ask to boxed our left over food that we hardly eat, it took them a long time. Then got home with the wrong left over food!!! Called them and was told that they'll give us a gift card that will send it through the mail. I wonder how much it is going to be cause our food was hardly touch for two and if we only get $25 gift card I will be very disappointed! so we'll see!!"
Wenwen Z.,"Tacoma, WA",33,1,,3.0,2/28/2017,"Reading other people's reviewed before I wrote this because I don't want my hunger to be my judgement at the moment, but looks like bad management at this place isn't news. waiting to be seated for a party of 5, for over an hour we have waited, and still waiting. We were told that the next table opened will be ours. I am looking at open tables right before us, and earlier walked by another open table that hasn't been cleaned yet, but somehow nobody bothers to think that maybe seating us down is a good idea. I mean, the table doesn't have to fit exactly 5 ppl if that was the problem!"
Amanda J.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,10,,5.0,12/20/2016,It's new and busy so be prepared to wait a little bit. With that being said I feel like some people need to just give this place a little more credit. My husband and I went today and we had a great experience. The servers are obviously trying to get a hang of things but you can tell that they are really trying. Our waitress was very nice. Forgot one or two things but it wasn't a big deal to us. The food was classic Cheesecake Factory a.k.a. delicious. My one tip would be to make sure that you stay close. When we checked in we were told that it'd be a 40 minute wait but to start making your way back in about 25 minutes if you head into the mall (the buzzer only reaches so far). We ended up coming back after about 20 minutes and I asked if they had called our name yet and they had just called it. So we were lucky that we came back extra early. 5 stars for service and food!
Penny G.,"Puyallup, WA",15,1,,1.0,4/7/2017,First and last time  at this restaurant. We waited for 45 minutes to get our order. Ordered hamburgers and mine came with the bun dripping because sitting in a pile of bloody grease.  I always order my burgers done so this doesn't happen.  Had coffee and got one  refill in the 2 hours we were there. It took the waitress 20 minutes to return my change.  Never again...
Starr C.,"Nashville, TN",0,1,,1.0,4/2/2017,"Worst service. Sat at the bar section for half hour before our sever realized we were new customers in his section. Ordered coffee and cheesecake and still 20 minutes later, no service. Server didn't even realize we walked out of the bar, then on top of it all, as I still wanted a slice of cheesecake, the server approaches us and says our coffee is just being made. Still charged us for coffee and waited another 15 min for cheesecake. On top of it all, restaurant was not even busy. I gave this a 1 star jus to complain about bad service but I prefer not to give any star at all."
Pat B.,"Surprise, AZ",0,36,,4.0,7/14/2017,I love this place! The food is always superb and service is the best! The menu has a wide selection no matter what you're mood is and did I mention the cheesecake? Oh my gosh! Wow! Can't wait to go back.
Melissa M.,"Glendora, CA",0,29,3,2.0,1/18/2017,"Wait time was quoted 55-80 min to be seated, and we waited the 80 min. It seemed like they were supper unorganized. There was an open table ready to go and it took about 15 min to get a party seated. By the time we got seated we were kinda over the excitement, our waitress got switched out about 3 times not sure why so many times. We had to ask for the complimentary bread, waited about 15 min to get our beer order. The food was not so great.  There is def better customer service at the one in Renton, not sure if we'll be coming back."
Henry F.,"Puyallup, WA",106,6,1,4.0,2/8/2017,"Food is good, service is great. Just wish I didn't get checked on every 30 seconds when I have a mouthful. Lol but good overall."
Valerie M.,"Tacoma, WA",4,49,25,5.0,1/1/2017,"This is my 2nd visit to The Cheesecake Factory here in Tacoma. The hostess station has kind people who are very accommodating. Once I got sat, which was less than 15 minutes both times I was greeted by a very friendly server. I ordered the mushroom cheeseburger with a vinaigrette salad on my first visit...it was easily the best cheeseburger I've ever eaten, and I've eaten a lot. For dessert I took a very generous slice of lemon meringue cheesecake home. Yum! This 2nd visit I had to have another mushroom burger, but with fries this time. It's that good. Thinking my cheesecake is going to be one with peanut butter. I highly recommend this place for the service and the quality of the food. I'll be back many times."
Lisa J.,"Olympia, WA",0,24,,5.0,3/17/2017,"Best service, best drinks and best entree! Our server Jonathan was on point so knowledgeable and was super attentive. We will be back soon! Thank you for such a great night especially for celebrating our daughters 13th birthday!"
Destiny B.,"Puyallup, WA",0,38,2,1.0,7/24/2017,"We have been to this location three times since it opened. The first time the service was horrible, and the food was just okay. My son who wasn't with us the first time wanted to try it out so we came back for a second visit. Our service was amazing and most of the food was good. Yesterday was our third visit and our last visit. We came in a little after 2pm and were seated right away, surprisingly enough as there is usually a wait. That's when everything went downhill. Our server came over dropped off some bread, said she would be back with some water and left, we didn't even get the chance to order an actual drink. Fast forward to 20/25 minutes later our server returns, drops off the water, I say we'd like to order some fries and some drinks (we were waiting for 2 other people). Another person dropped off our fries and our server and our drinks were nowhere to be found again. Another 10/15 minutes go by and finally our server found her way to our table, with our drinks. I was clearly upset by this point. For the cheesecake factory, they really weren't busy and I found the service completely unacceptable. At this point our server went ghost, she was nowhere to be seen or found. I eventually went to the front were I asked for a manager, his name was Paul and truth be told, he didn't seem to make anything better. He got a round of drinks quickly for our table, and that was it. When our server finally did show back up we placed our cheesecake order and that took a solid 20+ minutes, for 5 slices of cheesecake. We were so irritated we just wanted to leave. There was no discount, no compensation, no nothing. I told Paul how bad the service was and how long we were waiting, and waiting, and waiting, he clearly didn't care either. We paid our bill, and left. My husband went back in to speak to a manager, but was told by the girl at the front that they were understaffed and a manager was unavailable. As I stated before, we won't return to this location or any other Cheesecake Factory location, as they can't seem to value and appreciate their customers."
DeAnna C.,"Vancouver, WA",103,25,3,3.0,12/10/2016,They are new and our wait staff was pretty bad. The guy helping the waitress took my drink and did not bring it back. Our waitress was attentive till we got our food. Then she just disappeared and we stopped existing to her. She took people besides us order with out a glance in our direction. I understand they are busy but there was tons of staff probably 20-30 visible staff. So there really was no excuse. The manager did apologize and made it right. As it was tip time we got a sarcastic half hearted apology from the waitress and attitude. She seemed to not care that she was in the wrong. The food was amazing and the other staff was amazing. A busser heard us talking about where our waitress was and quickly alerted the proper people and we were taken care of. I say wait a bit till the bad staff is weeded out. Then you will have the service Cheesecake Factory is known for.
C G.,"Olympia, WA",0,2,,4.0,4/14/2017,"This was our first visit. We arrived when the opened at 11:30am, and were seated few minutes later. Our waitress was awesome! Cassandra was so friendly and made great recommendations from the menu.  We ordered the chicken taquitos. They were so crispy, flavorful and delicious. We also ordered the truffle bacon grilled cheese sticks. They were also great. We ordered the Pasta with Shrimp and Sausage (lunch portion). The pasta was cooked perfectly. The freshly grated cheese made a good entrée even better. We also tried the Key Lime Cheesecake. WOW! It was so sour, but sweet at the same time. It was ahhh-mazing! The drinks are pricey ($12 mojito), but good.  We will definitely come back."
Elle B.,"Nyack, NY",0,5,,1.0,3/13/2017,"Every time my husband and I have eaten at Cheesecake, we have had excellent service...that is until last night. We brought our family (party of 5) to the restaurant to show them how we love this place and show them the delicious selection of cheesecakes. We waited about an hour or so but the wait wasn't the problem. The service was TERRIBLE. Between the sarcasm of our server and the unprofessionalism the manager showed, we are so disappointed and are contemplating never coming back to this location. My brother ordered a simple bacon cheese burger, medium rare with cheese fries on the side and my cousin order the Macaroni and cheese burger well done with no lettuce, tomato or onion.  My brothers fries came out way before the burger and with everyone else's food & the burger came out as a double bacon avocado burger well done! Then, my cousin got his Macaroni cheese burger with lettuce tomato and onion on the side with no fries and the patty was basically bleeding it was so rare. Finally they came and switched the orders but it didn't matter because they still messed up the temperature and continued to give us fries!  I haven't even gotten to my uncooked chicken Romano dish as well as my cousins girlfriends uncooked meal as well. Like I said, we have always gotten exceptional service every time we've eaten here but this was the absolute worst restaurant experience in general I've had in a very long time. Not to mention the server telling us it was his ""Friday"" and that our bill should be really cheap tonight... PS - never got an apology from the server either..."
Holly R.,"Tacoma, WA",24,11,,5.0,1/6/2017,"Went to this Cheesecake Factory location for the first time this week with my family. The food was hot, tasted great, the service was awesome- our server checked to make sure we were okay quite often and gave excellent service. Highlights- the sangria that is house made, the fried Mac n cheese appetizer and the chicken Madeira. My boyfriend works for another chain restaurant and even he was impressed, which is hard to do. No complaints. Can't wait to come back."
Ashley M.,"Tacoma, WA",43,10,,3.0,1/25/2017,I love the Cheesecake Factory but the service at this one is lacking. We had two different people try to give us a meal that we hadn't ordered. It took them a very long time to even acknowledge us when we sat down at the bar area. I also saw the hostess try to seat a family of four with small children at one of the tables in the bar area. Huh?? The family looked confused as well and the hostess moved them to another area. This location in particular needs to get it together.
Anny T.,"Tacoma, WA",0,8,,3.0,1/13/2017,"All the times I've been to cheesecake factory, I've had a pretty good experience, fast service, fairly seating, delicious food.  All locations, especially Tacoma needs a better seating area! There is only 1 small bench to sit for customers! I've ate at the Bellevue location, Southcenter, and now this will be my 4th time at the Tacoma location since they've opened.  This last experience was not well at all! We went out last night on Thursday (1/12/2017), figured it wouldn't be that busy to take out our friend here for their 1st time eating at this restaurant.  We arrived there at 6:30pm, there was a small group of people waiting to be seated (about 4 groups, compared to the other weeknights we've been going to the Tacoma location).  There were 5 girls at the hostesses stand: 1 African American, 2 white girls (blonde & Brunette), 2 Asian girls (1 must've been the manager - she had keys around her wrist & wore a different color top). 2 girls faced us when we approached the stand (blonde & brunette); we were told that the wait would be 20minutes by the long brunette haired hostess, which was fine for us since the waiting crowd wasn't large.   People that were there before us were getting seated, and it was about 45minutes of waiting until we asked if we were skipped.  The blonde hostess couldn't find us in the system and realized that our buzzer never got clocked in.  She told us that we'd be seated at the next available table. 1 family got sat after we were told we'd be next (which was fine because it was just 1 party), but then 5 more people were getting seated! I understand they're going through the buzzer system, but if we had been skipped and were told we'd be seated at the next available table, then we should've been sat! I saw that the blonde hostesses kept telling her coworkers to seat our party next, but the other hostesses kept skipping through us, grabbing the other buzzers, printing out the slips with customer's name - taking the other people. I can tell the blonde was getting a little frustrated with everyone else not listening to her, so she personally went to go set our table and sat us there (which we appreciate, but we were still very annoyed).  We literally waited almost an hour before getting seated! When it wasn't even busy when we got in! I understand when this restaurant is extremely busy, but seriously Tacoma needs to figure it out.  Southcenter gets packed like crazy, but their seating time is quick for always being busy.  Hostesses need to figure out this buzzer system and actually clock the buzzer in instead of handing it off to customers.  There needs to be more hostesses or something, because all I saw was the 1 Asian hostess being the one seating majority of the customers, rushing back to the hostess stand after each seating.  Blonde was in charge most of the time for handing off the buzzers (except for us the Brunette handed us ours), the black & brunette girls stood around wiping the menus, not even helping seating customers when there were people waiting.  Manager would come and go from the hostess stand, not sure what she was doing. Not sure if it's just the Tacoma area, but I swear most restaurants we've gone to around here, have the worst service with hostesses and at times service!"
Jestin P.,"Tacoma, WA",100,2,,1.0,2/24/2017,"Made reservations for 7, didn't get sat until after 7:30. After that pretty much everything took half an hour; seeing my server, getting an over priced beer, finally getting to order. The server was nice enough and seemed like she was trying her best, but it could not make up for the awful experience I had. Save yourself the headache, stick to the food court."
Emily M.,"Spanaway, WA",29,38,2,2.0,1/7/2017,"Two hour wait which we didn't mind as we wanted to browse the mall. The waitstaff was very nice and efficient.  It goes wrong when it comes to the food! My chicken marsala was horrible! The chicken was slimey, pasta severely undercooked some was even crunchy and the sauce was so watered down. My husbands burger was way overcooked. My son got the mac/cheese and it was anything but cheesy. The cheesecake was decent. Not worth the 80 bucks we blew here at all."
Crissy V.,"Tacoma, WA",1,9,7,5.0,12/13/2016,"Haven't eaten in the restaurant yet but I have ordered to go. Very pleased with the amount of food I was given and the staff! Happy customer right here!!!! Food was also great. Came late to pick up my to go order and my food was still warm and all ready to go, right when I got there."
