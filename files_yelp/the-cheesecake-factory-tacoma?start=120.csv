Michael D.,"Tacoma, WA",4,4,,1.0,2/12/2017,"I completely understand that they opened recently but there is no reason for their wait staff to be so untrained and lethargic.  If you go here, be prepared for the staff to tell you that there is a 20 minute wait and 5 groups ahead of you all while they forget about you and youre waiting over an hour while they seat everyone else that came in after you.  Food comes out cold because its sitting in the window for too long.  Prepare to wait at least 30 minutes after you are finished eating to get your check.  Cant really give the food a fair judgment since its cold by the time I get it but would go 0 stars if possible."
Flora N.,"Tacoma, WA",0,1,,2.0,2/12/2017,"Visited 2/11/17 with a party of 5. Arrived around 6:00 pm and waited over 2 hours to be seated. After being seated, service was slow. It even took a long time to get bread. It was very disappointing and ruined the entire experience.  The waitress was excellent. And when we finally got our food, it was fine. After paying the bill and tipping the waitress, we asked to speak to the manager. The male manager did not take our concerns seriously. He stated he ""would never wait more than 30 minutes"" and even discounted what we were saying. We felt unheard so asked for another manager. The female manager listened and tried to explain. She also apologized. Next time we will make the trip to Southcenter. It's definitely not worth the wait!"
Sara B.,"Tacoma, WA",3,11,3,5.0,12/19/2016,Pack your patience! Waiting to get in is part of the experience. It is prime people watching time. The atmosphere is cheerful. The food was absolutely delicious. I had the passion fruit margarita and loved it. The staff is lovely. I would like to become a regular!
Matt M.,"Lacey, WA",0,1,,1.0,7/20/2017,"This place and its management are horrible. I stopped in with my wife for dinner and have never had such terrible service. We ordered a salad and 2 quesadillas. It took 1 hr to get 1 quesadilla which literally had no cheese in it. After sending it back they brought another with no cheese. So 1.5 hrs in we had 2 quesadillas with no cheese and finally a warm wilted soggy salad at the end. No compensation whatsoever, the manager actually made my wife feel guilty for wanting cheese in her quesadilla. I'm convinced they were messing with us for even complaining. Screw this place."
Giselle B.,"Federal Way, WA",43,2,,1.0,6/12/2017,"My family has always loved the Cheesecake Factory and looked forward to celebratory dinners there with friends and family. My daughter and her family have been visiting from North Carolina and we wanted to have such a dinner there tonight. We chose a Monday evening because we know how crazy busy the place is on weekends. We had never eaten at the Tacoma location, so I called early afternoon to see if we needed to make special arrangements for a larger party. There were to be 9 of us; 6 adults and 3 children. I was told over the phone that they don't do call ahead seating and it is strictly walk in. We decided since that was the case to make it an early dinner just to be safe. We arrived at 4:25 and put our name in for a table. We were told they'd have to get a manager to come let us know how long the wait would be. There were many empty tables in the establishment and not that many people waiting to be seated. After waiting several minutes, we assumed everything was fine and even took the kids over to see all the delicious cheesecakes on display. They were excited about dessert! At 4:55, which was 30 minutes later, a manager came up and told us that if we all wanted to be seated together it would be an hour to an hour and a half wait! This is totally unacceptable customer service. The worst part was that they waited 30 minutes before telling us this. I can assure you members of our family will think twice before dining there again. Unfortunately, for them, they have lost a good return customer."
David H.,"Belfair, WA",22,5,,3.0,1/21/2017,They had a  pretty large selection of both food and desserts. All of our dishes were not bad The service was painfully slow.
Stephanie L.,"Graham, WA",0,12,,4.0,1/13/2017,"Welcomed by friendly hostess. We arrived in the late afternoon on a Friday, and were seated right away. Greeted by other staff members as we passed on the way to the table. Our waiter was very attentive, and friendly. Food was fantastic! And the Cheesecake was the best I've ever tasted! We will definitely be back. Lots of menu items I am anxious to try.....Prices are a little high, and the lighting is a little dark for my taste, those are the reasons I gave a 4 star instead of 5."
Cindy B.,"Puyallup, WA",12,6,8,5.0,1/7/2017,I had seen some not so good reviews but a group of 5 went last night for dinner (Friday night) everything about it was awesome from check in to leaving. The wait was about 5 minutes..our server was PJ and he was best server I have had in a rest. No I don't know him and we were all a midish age group.  The food was delicious and very large portion...absolutely impressed...thank you Cheesecake factory
William R.,"Bonney Lake, WA",11,1,,1.0,1/6/2017,"Wanted to experience this place, called ahead wanting to notify them of a party of 7 people. They said they did not do reservations. We finally arrive at 5:30 pm to find out it was a 60 minute wait if we want to sit at 2 separate tables. It was almost 2 and a half hours if we want 2 tables together."
Dan J.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,5,,2.0,1/5/2017,"Standard Cheesecake Factory.  Smaller than most.  Long seating times and extremely slow service .  Went to the restaurant on a Thursday afternoon around 4:45 pm.  Even though there were several empty tables, it still took an average of 30 minutes to get seated for guests.  The hostess said she called our party and someone responded; so she skipped us adding another 10 minutes to our wait.  We were finally seated after we realized what happened and approached the hostess. Food was what you expect from a Cheesecake Factory."
Douglas W.,"Fairview, OR",52,77,76,5.0,2/27/2017,"Would have gotten a 2 star at first based on food taking 1 hour and 15 min total. Was on a father daughter date while momma and brother in law were having fun at the Blake Shelton concert. My daughter got her kids pizza 30min after ordering which was fine and expected. But it took another 45min after that point to get my food after asking my waitress 2 times where my food was. Think she was telling the truth and there was something going on with the cooks not making my food. But in the end, I didn't have to complain and the waitress stepped up and told the manager about my long wait. The manager came over and apologized. He said dinner was on them that night and asked if I wanted anything else. Said we were planning on getting a slice of cheesecake. A waiter brought one over of our choosing and then the manager came back with another slice thinking I hadn't got it yet. Well he left that extra slice there and said to keep both. Manager said if I ever come visit again to ask for him and they'll do something nice for us. They really turned things around and made our night. Daughter was happy to get her dang cheesecake lol. Overall, everything was great except the cooks not making my sandwich. I understand shit happens."
Rachel D.,"Tacoma, WA",36,22,1,4.0,12/17/2016,"Today was busy with being a Saturday a week before Christmas.  Our waitress was very attentive and our food was delish. Similar quality as at other Cheesecake factories. The only negatives, when opening and entering from mall,  you walk thru the bar. Becomes quite smooshed. The other negative was an employee,  we figured out, who constantly is walking thru the tables and didn't interact. Felt creepy. Other employees were also checking but also spoke to customers"
Sam P.,"Federal Way, WA",0,3,,3.0,12/12/2016,"chain food restaurant with reasonable prices .  Negative;We haven't been in C. F. for 2 years and were surprised with mutated menu. Two pages totally dedicated to chicken dishes and on next page couple seafood and meat. Now they need to change name to Chicken Factory. Positive; All appetizers were fantastic. Negative; For main we ordered Shepard's pie. I think chef was running out of it and made improvisation from spoon of mashed potato, gravy, peas and some beef stew. .thinking we never seen Shepard's pie. That was bad decision and total disrespect to customers. He should say; -""sorry guys it s going to take some time or you can order smth differen""     Negative; Nice interior design but packed tables next to each other with no privacy for each party."
David T.,"Baguio, Philippines",0,24,2,5.0,12/11/2016,"Woo hoo! Used to go to Cheesecake Factory in San Diego, so I was so excited when they announced that they would be putting one up here. First of all, lets cover the cons. They got rid of popcorn shrimp for appetizers, but they still got the crab cakes. Serving time for the usual bread at the start was really long, but I understand that they just opened up and are trying to set everything up. Besides that, everything else is excellent! I was worried that they would give smaller portions because I noticed they do that as time went on at the last Cheesecake Factory I went to, but actually, they are pretty generous portions--I mean, there's not like a butt load, but even for me who needs to eat 2 subway footlongs to get full, the entree portions are pretty filling. The servers are courteous, and the customers don't trash the restrooms like uncivilized monkeys. Tasteful music, and great atmosphere. A small suggestion would be to light it up a bit because it was a bit too dark, but besides that, great decor and temperature control inside."
Sara D.,"Tacoma, WA",14,1,,5.0,12/11/2016,"My husband and I went here last Saturday night and it turned out to be a fabulous night out. The service was fast and friendly. The food was amazing!! And to top it off, the piece of cheesecake I had was the best tasting piece of cheesecake I have ever had. I would recommend this place for a very nice dinner for date night as well as a place to have a large family dinner."
Allen A.,"Lakewood, WA",0,33,,4.0,5/28/2017,"When I went, this Cheesecake Factory location had just recently opened up at Tacoma Mall and I was very glad they opened one up a location there. That meant not having to drive all the way up to Tukwila Mall just to eat some Cheesecake Factory. Considering it was fairly new, the wait was even longer for a table because of all the hype and waiting for a table at Cheesecake Factory is almost always long. Me and my family got a table for 6 in two hours. Besides the long wait, the food was delicious! I do recommend their Chicken Alfredo. I tried the cheesecake and it was really good as well. The wait for the food didn't take too long, but don't expect ""fast food"" time. To top off the good food, The waitress was very respectful. She made sure our food was good, kept asking us if we were enjoying our food, and was coming back to us for an occasional refill for our drinks. In all, it's a nice restaurant to go to if you're patient. Definitely makes Tacoma Mall even better and look nicer."
Molly L.,"Brooklyn, NY",33,90,17,2.0,3/10/2017,"We have come to this location twice now. The first time they were or of what we ordered. The second time they were out of what we ordered. I heard that sometimes they aren't actually out - they just don't want to defrost it. The second option I wanted to order last night - they were out of that too! I ended up ordering something else (filet mignon) which happened to be good.. but it wasn't what I came there for. I get the same thing every time and I look forward to it. I also ended up spending way more because they didn't have what my husband and I came there for. Most likely will just drive to tukwila if I want to eat at the Cheesecake Factory, at least I will get what I want."
James K.,"Lakewood, WA",0,36,2,1.0,2/15/2017,"Funny that there are about 14 one star reviews that are supposedly ""not recommended"" on this site yet this restaurant only deserves a one star review because you can't put ZERO.  I am NOT putting down the Cheesecake Factory because I enjoy their food.  However the Tacoma location is SOOOO mis-managed it's not even funny, even though one of their managers (Jason) thinks it's funny when his employees provide incorrect information to customers.  Don't tell me it's a 15 minute wait and then I walk in 5 minutes later and I'm still standing in the lobby waiting to be seated an hour and a half later!!! Just trying to talk to a manager is a job in and of itself.  I requested to speak to one and it literally took 25 minutes and it only happened because I walked out onto the dining room floor and demanded to speak to him back at the lobby.  I mean, what a joke! Who is running this show!?!?  I explain the situation and he laughs...I'm not totally surprised being they wouldn't even let uniform police officers into their location because they had guns...are you serious!?!? I brought that up to Jason and he lied and said that incident NEVER occurred.  I guess all the news outlets and newspapers are out to get them then because it made NATIONAL news...hopefully they can find someone who knows what they are doing to properly manage this place!"
Reid Z.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",11,3,,1.0,3/31/2017,"I never EVER write reviews but all of the bad experiences here match the one we had. We just waited THIRTY minutes at the counter to get the Peanut Sauce that they rung us up for and then were too vastly incompetent to get. I eventually asked them to give me my money back and left. Horrible customer service. The waitress was fine, but if the manager can't manage to get the sauce that was paid for THiRTY minutes before, I'll happily go to BJ's instead."
Linaya P.,"Phenix City, AL",54,51,51,1.0,12/16/2016,"My family and I have been eating at this chain for years. But this particular location is poorly organized, very slow, and inconsiderate of the needs of their guest. My husband and I came here for dinner and were willing to wait the ""50 minutes"" for seats because we knew the food and drinks would be well worth it especially after a long week of work. After over an hour past and it was our time to be sat, the poorly trained hostess walked us all the way around the restaurant, missing our seat, and then noticed that our booth had been ""double booked"". We walked back to the front where she was told to sit us elsewhere. Once we arrived and the new seats I noticed the discomfort on my husbands face. How was he at 220lbs 6 feet supposed to fit in such a small space? I asked to be sat at the empty booth across the aisle instead. She leaves us standing, goes back to the front and shortly returns with our denied request and informs us that if we wish to sit somewhere else we will have to wait the line again. At that point we left. Terrible experience for us both."
