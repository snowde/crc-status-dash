Soll P.,"Tacoma, WA",114,13,10,1.0,12/23/2016,"I went to the recently opened tacoma location and had a horrible experience. First time I went it was opening week, I ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta (my all time fav) it was terrible, and so my service. Today my friend and I decided to have lunch there, but I was hesitant due to my experience. But because I love the Cheesecake Factory, I gave it another try with hopes it didn't crush my heart. My heart was crushed, like a bag of potato chips. I ordered the bistro shrimp pasta (my second fav) and it was just dry unseasoned noodles. So disappointed. Also, I was seated in the booth in the back closest to the kitchen, I counted at least 7 dishes being sent back during my outrageously long wait for my horrible food. To top off this ""great"" experience, I witnessed the manger totally mistreat our server. She messed up on someone's tab, and the manager corrected her so rudely in front of everyone. She was humilIated. After this don't think I'll be going back to the Tacoma location anytime soon."
Grace K.,"Lakewood, WA",1,18,1,1.0,12/26/2016,"Absolutely crappy service. Hostess gave me a buzzer or whatever it's called because it was going to be an hour wait. She told me I could walk around the mall in the meantime so after an hour, I come back and she told me she tried to page me but I did not feel any vibration. Then she tells me ""Oh did you go to the mall? We can't page that far"" - what the fuck? Then why did you tell me I can go to the mall in the meantime.. also, we ordered Mac and cheese burger and 10 minutes later the waitress tells us that they're all out. And we also ordered the factory nachos as appetizer and then 10-15 mins later, she comes back and tells us they're all out... what the hell do you guys have in the back then? And while we wait all this time thinking our food is ordered and cooking, it's not. Not to mention, happy hour only applies if you're sitting at the bar... Horrible service here, huge disappointment."
Emily A.,"Tacoma, WA",0,2,1,2.0,4/27/2017,"First off I want to say the staff were amazing. Waitress was nice and attentive. We (3 if us) went on a Sunday and it was pretty busy, we got one of their pager things and shopped in the mall for a while. The wait wasn't to bad. Their a bit high priced, but I knew that before hand. My only complaints was the food & how long it took to get to us. The appetizers ( egg roles & fried zucchini) came quick and were good. Our main dishes took almost an hour. My daughters meatloaf was good, my other daughters fettuccine, she said was ok (bland) I ordered the shepherds pie, not only was it extremely greasy but the hamburger meat was almost raw on the inside. The picture I took does it no justice. It looked like grease soup with red hamburger meat. Some of the meat was literally bloody still. It also didn't taste well at all. Again the staff was amazing and most of our food was good with the exception of the shepherds pie and fettuccine with chicken."
Shelley R.,"Tacoma, WA",12,1,,1.0,1/4/2017,"My daughter wanted to come to the Cheesecake Factory for a belated birthday dinner on January 1st. Our entire little family would be there--my daughter, my son (who was home from college), my husband, and myself. I suspected that the Tacoma restaurant didn't take reservations since the Seattle one didn't, so I called them to explain my situation. My daughter is 25 and has autism. She is very sensitive to loud sudden noises and the confusion that often occurs in a crowd, but is usually okay once seated at a table. I asked the first person I spoke with if we could make a reservation for a time that it would be convenient for the restaurant because if my daughter got set off by a loud noise, we wouldn't be able to stay (it is not pleasant when a 25-year-old has a temper tantrum and starts throwing things). I explained that I was asking for a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act, and that I noticed that the restaurant was aware of some disabilities as they had braille menus available. The young man who answered the phone just kept repeating, ""We don't make reservations."" I asked politely to talk with the manager. A woman came on the phone. She said that she didn't think making a reservation would be a problem given our situation, but that a manager would have to approve it. Then a young man came to the phone and said he was the manager. He said, ""I can't make a reservation, but I can seat you and your daughter at the first available table."" I said, ""Great! But there are four of us."" He said, ""I can only make an accommodation for you and your daughter."" Since he sounded as though English wasn't his first language, I explained again that we were a family of four and we were celebrating our daughter's birthday. He then repeated that he could make an accommodation for my daughter and me. Every time I reminded him that there were four of us, not two, he said he could make an accommodation for the two of us. I explained that wasn't an accommodation because there were four of us. He kept repeating the same statement, word for word, over and over again--at least six times. Needless to say, we didn't go there for dinner."
Greg A.,"Graham, WA",10,1,,1.0,1/4/2017,"My wife and I ate at the new Cheesecake Factory last night.  It was not a good experience.  We arrived around 5:25 and we're seated right away, which was very nice.  Our beverage order was taken quickly and we received our drinks right after.  We were asked about apps but no suggestions.  The server took our food order and that was it.  About 20 minutes later a Manager came by to let us know my Pasta Carbonara was an issue but was only about 3 minutes away.  15 minutes later my wife received her food, which was only luke warm, but mine was not there and nothing was said about another delay.  5 minutes later my dish arrived.  No apologies whatsoever.  This was also only luke warm.  Eventually our server came around to ask about dessert.  We wanted something to take home so she brought by a menu.  Again, no suggestive selling at all.  She came back a few minutes later and we ordered cheesecake to go.  It took almost 15 minutes to get the cheesecake.  We had been ready to leave for at least 20 minutes but because we couldn't get our check we felt as if we were being held hostage.  Through all of this there was no idea by the staff that we were not enjoying our visit.  No one apologized about how long it took or showed the least bit concerned.  After all was said and done we were there for 90 minutes and received indifferent service and just average food quality."
Michele A.,"Federal Way, WA",0,7,,1.0,12/31/2016,"Called ahead of time to make sure they were serving breakfast. Arrive and was informed they were NOT serving breakfast. Ordered food part of my order came when I asked for butter I was given COLD/frozen butter that was unable to be spread. One bartender scratched her face did NOT wash her hands and made drinks touching the straws on the top as she stirred a drink. CHECK PLEASE!!!!! Very disappointed for what's suppose to be an ""upscale"" establishment"
Emily J.,"Tacoma, WA",11,9,5,1.0,1/15/2017,"My husband and I were very excited when we found out Cheesecake Factory was coming to Tacoma.. our first visit was on grand opening day which was typically very busy so there was no major regrets coming on opening day knowing how busy it would be.. On the other hand, we came today to have a nice dinner and I'm just in disbelief on how unorganized the hosts are. I was told that the wait would be 40 minutes for a party of 3 which I agreed with and was given my number and was told it would vibrate when our table was ready. Everything was fine until I noticed multiple parties of 3 that arrived after us getting a table before we do. After an hour of waiting, which in sense is normal waiting time for a Sunday evening at a popular restaurant was totally unnecessary when the 2 parties of 3 that came after us and one that just walked in received tables before we did. I asked the hostess which seemed so flustered told me someone would take care of it then the other hostess who ran to her manager to double check the screen for her didn't even make eye contact with me.. what's worse is that the manager did not make eye contact either and clearly seemed annoyed with his life trying to figure out how to properly sit people down within the given allotted wait time.. there are a lot of opportunities for this location since they clearly can't seem to get the idea on organization.. overall service for the rest of the evening seems fine but the experience with how unorganized the front hosts are just ruined our whole visit entirely.."
Jaclyn P.,"Granite Falls, WA",21,15,11,3.0,3/27/2017,its a little out of my preferred price range but the food and customer service are great.
Leslie B.,"Federal Way, WA",0,6,,2.0,3/21/2017,"My family of four came here for my daughter's 21st birthday.  The food was good and the waitstaff was extra friendly.  We had several drinks between us.  When the bill came, it was around $250.00!  I have never spent that much at a restaurant before, except at the Met Grill !  I am upset that the drink prices are not listed on the menu.  I expected they were probably around $8 a piece, especially since we sat in the bar.  Found out afterwards that they were $12!  Unbelievable!  We kept ordering because the drinks were SO weak and watered down. My last drink was a Long Island Iced Tea. After about 2 sips, my family noticed that there was clear liquid left in the glass, pure water.  My daughter received a Margarita in a small martini glass. WTH? To top things off, we told the waiter that it was her birthday. They brought her choice of cheesecake with her name written in chocolate on the plate, a candle, and a birthday song. Nice touch. I was shocked to see that they charged us for it!  With the prices you charge, could you at least have comped the birthday cheesecake?  And, we obviously fell for the trick that you made watered down drinks so that we paid for more. Could have picked anywhere else for dinner, and next time we will.  Your food is decent and the staff is friendly, but you are not a five star restaurant.  Should be a little more budget friendly. Next time if we come back, we will go elsewhere for the drinks!  Disappointing."
Ria A.,"El Paso, TX",0,3,,3.0,1/8/2017,"I called them twice during the week for reservation to which they don't do.. I had a party of 15 women and wanted to know what to do. I was told on both phone calls that someone from my party just have to come in the morning to hold a table for us for a 12:45 lunch. I had also called in the morning of and was told to head over at about 11. So one of my sisters went over to hold our seats for 12:45 as we were still at church. She gets there and was told that 80% of our party has to show up in order for them to set up for us. She had explained what we were told to do, but still won't accommodate us with just one person there. We all arrived at the restaurant including our guest of honor and had to wait for 3 hours. Like I told the manager on duty, they need to do training and make sure that the information that the staffs are giving out are accurate. Nobody should have to go through all that trouble for nothing. It took more than  an hour for the food, one of my sisters had to order 3 times because they kept messing up her order. But beside all that madness, the food was great."
Paula H.,"Federal Way, WA",0,3,,2.0,3/6/2017,Totally disappointed. This was our first trip to the Tacoma location. We had a party of seven so when we went to check in they told us to go start off to the side and the manager would give us a quote. I was confused we eat at the one in Southcenter all the time and we never had to wait to find out how long we need to wait. So we stood off to the side for 15 minutes finally went up to ask what was going on and the manager came to let us know it would be a hour. So we waited. After we all ordered one of the gals ordered a hamburger medium. It came mooing. I feel they should have comped her lunch nothing ever said to her. I ordered a tostada salad as I usually do. I'm not sure how you can screw up a salad but they did. Not going back.
Vy L.,"Auburn, WA",110,15,22,3.0,12/15/2016,"I went here with my family and I was pretty excited since this is one of my favorite restaurant in WA and now they open one in Tacoma. Well I have to say that the dishes don't impress me much. All the dishes have a sweet taste to them and also plain like the kitchen forget their salt portion today. The 3 stars review is for how nice the manager was and also the serve we had. Even though I got the wrong choice of meat for my dish in the beginning, the serve offered me a side of shrimp for free and kept checking on us if we was doing fine. However the food is really disappointed. I have this same dish in 3 different Cheesecake factory locations and more than 15 times, but this location made it so much different and I'm not a fan of it. We also had 2 orders of steak and shrimp and both dishes are plain with a weird taste of sweetness. The salmon is good though only that wont bringing me back. As much as I love their services, I hate to say that I wont come back."
Susan P.,"Tacoma, WA",0,6,6,3.0,2/2/2017,"This new location still has a few kinks to work out. The food was average at best. I ordered the Sweet Corn Tamale appetizer, and it arrived nearly cold and the cakes lacked texture. The dinner, a combination plate with steak and chicken, was just OK, as the chicken had some fatty spots and lacked flavor. We had two different servers, one who was on the ball, the other, not so much. And the music is WAY TOO LOUD. In a crowded restaurant like that with the noise level already high, pop music screeching from speakers just makes everyone have to shout to be heard. My throat was actually sore by the time I left. One thing they really do right, of course, is the cheesecake. I had the Red Velvet, and it was phenomenal. Overall, not the best experience, but I'd be willing to return for a second try."
Rus K.,"Tacoma, WA",0,3,,1.0,1/24/2017,"Horrible service.  We went there on Tuesday night with my wife and 2 kids knowing it is not busy time to get quick service. By the time our meals were at the table one of the meals was already almost room temperature.  Just a little bit warmer.  It took 35-40min to cook 3 meals on Tuesday night with half empty place.  On the top of that there was one of  their co workers sitting at next table with his family so our waitres would just stand next to them all this time and talk instead of serving.  Our drinks were empty for like 10 min and she'd be standing next to her friends and laugh . enoying. We understand that the place is new and most workers are noobs but we didnt see anyone even trying to give good work.  We always , always tip our servers but not tonight.  Gotta earn your tip,  it shouldnt be automatic. ... Not going there soon again even though its brand new place.  Thats why its 1 star but not 0"
Benjamin O.,"Puyallup, WA",0,18,,2.0,6/19/2017,"My food was great, actually pretty impressive coming from this mega chain restaurant which usually has lackluster food, however, it took an hour to get our food and my girlfriends eggs came to us with yolks hard enough to use as doorstops. We asked for new eggs and it took around 20 minutes to get them, after she had finished the other part of her meal and I had finished mine. The manager came to us several times apologizing, but honestly remaking eggs should have taken just a few minutes but took drastically longer. Our meal was comped but the near two hours we spent there was already gone, and we were overly irritated. The best part was that they weren't even busy, normally there is a line at this location but we were seated immediately. We won't be going back, honestly if it wasn't for the cheesecake this place would be out of business. There are hundreds of amazing places to eat in tacoma, you can remove this one from your list."
Casie C.,"Yelm, WA",0,11,,2.0,5/20/2017,"Facility is gorgeous, wait time to be seated was 1 minute at 4:30PM for a party of 3 on a Friday afternoon, friendly hostess and server BUT our food was served one entrée at a time with at least 6 minutes between the first entrée and the last (third) entrée served.  My husband's NY steak was served first so it was barely warm by the time he started to eat it as he was waiting for the rest of the table to be served.  My daughter's fish tacos were served about 3 minutes after the NY steak was served and my entrée of Angel Hair with Shrimp was served at least 3 minutes later.  Totally unacceptable to have our hot (??) meals served separately.  I'm a retired restaurant manager so I try to give the benefit of the doubt but there's no excuse for food either being prepared in the kitchen and/or being expedited this way.  Also, I had the banana cream cheesecake but the banana slices were all dark in the middle which indicates a worm had feasted on that banana first - yuck.  The darkened slices were very visible - no excuse for it to have been served.  Bottom line, sorry to say, we were so very disappointed in the Tacoma Mall Cheesecake Factory standards of service and, at this point, would not return."
Angie B.,"Columbia, SC",0,7,,1.0,12/14/2016,"Terrible place!! Went here with a group and was told it would 30 minutes over the phone. Got to the restaurant and was told it would be 2 hours! It was almost as if the manager did not want us there, he tried everything to make us say it's okay we will leave....then when we said we will wait he came back and said he will make it less than two hours! After waiting more than an hour, we asked how much longer? We were then told it would be more than an hour wait! Okay...so what happened to it being less than two hours? They said it was because there was another big party! After they eat then we would be seated! Seriously!?! What a way to celebrate my birthday! We ended up just leaving! Not sure if this place will work out! I called to make sure  and even asked if it was over crowded...was then told it was not!! Please don't tell people that over the phone and then have them drive 40 minutes for a horrible restaurant!! Terrible management! I will be calling head quarters soon!"
Mark B.,"University Place, WA",0,4,1,2.0,2/19/2017,"I have been to many different locations of The Cheesecake Factory, most recently in Anaheim California and found both the service and food impeccable. The Sunday brunch menu is ample and the eggs benny is grand. The food at the Tacoma location lives up to the legend but alas, the service does not. The hostess was moderately warm when I told her I would like to sit at the bar. The issue was with the bar staff and supporting bar staff. I got to listen to personal stories of each as they shared their personal lives with each other while I waited for my food. Very inappropriate and unprofessional. What was worse is the fact that there was absolutely no anticipation of my needs as a patron. Always had to ask for coffee refill and food was brought to me without forethought of what I would need with the meal. For example, butter with the waffle, salt and pepper, extra syrup, etc. Being young and inexperienced is no excuse for this kind of service. Shame on management for not carefully monitoring this and applying appropriate training. I'll be back but not before enough time has passed to address these issues."
Melissa B.,"Puyallup, WA",0,1,,1.0,2/7/2017,"Stopped by today around 3:30pm.  No one was in the lobby waiting to be seated.  We were told the bar had open seating and to help ourselves.  3 tables were empty, so we sat down at one only to have someone come over to us and tell us we could not sit there unless a hostess sat us.  I asked if the table was part of the bar and was told yes it was.  Went back to the hostess they said that table was not available to us, so we sat in a tall bar table instead.  Waited 10 minutes for the waiter to stop by the table and ask if we were ready to order, we still had not received menus at that point.  We reviewed the menus and ordered an appetizer and two entrees.  Waited about 25 minutes and were told by our waiter that the appetizer we ordered had been delivered to another table and that he just requested they put in another one.  Our entrees were delivered, we had to flag someone down and request silverware.  One of the entrees was incorrect.  About 5 minutes after the entrees arrived the appetizer was brought to the table.  Waters were not refilled during the meal, and our glasses stayed empty through most of it.  We requested a slice of carrot cake cheesecake to go, the waiter repeated the order, then left to get the check.  I was able to watch as he grabbed a togo bag and place the cheesecake slice in, unfortunately I didn't check when it arrived and waited until we got home only to discover it was not what we ordered.  Overall poor service, I get this location just opened and I understand a mistake occasionally, but seriously this was awful.  We will not be back to this location anytime soon."
Peter N.,"Tacoma, WA",55,1,,1.0,1/13/2017,"I usually don't write reviews, in fact this is my first time. My family and I had a terrible experience. When we arrived we were quoted a 30 min wait. 30 min later the hostess said it would be an additional 30 minute because they had this ""policy"" where they can't push tables together, which also probably means the hostess was lazy. Later the manager, who was extremely condescending, told us they had this policy where it's an automatic 1 hour wait. I mean...I would have accepted an apology but to give us attitude and make up some bs policy is just childish. Even in the orange lights you could see the red in her face wishing she could tell us how she really feels. Either way, this place needs a new manager and new non self-entitled hostesses that can be just a little less disrespectful and quit with the attitude towards customers. Server was slow, but at least nice. To top it all off, when we ordered cheesecake to go it took me asking our server after waiting 15min for her to tell me they forgot about our order. What a way to end our night, after being there for a total for 3 hours."
