Nick B.,"Huntsville, AL",0,1,,2.0,1/2/2017,"To begin with, I will preface this review with the fact I've been in the industry for close to a decade. (Management). The hosts originally told us that it would be between 60-80 minutes for a table (Monday night at 7:30pm.), we were sat within 40. Not to say this is necessarily a bad thing, but in most cases this initial embellished timeframe would have turned us to another restaurant. Our server approached our table within 10 seconds of us being seated and began pressing us for an order.(not attentive service but an impatient Denny's type of style) After her 3rd visit inside of 3 minutes we placed a drink order that she promptly forgot and returned to ask us to repeat. After taking this 4 drink order (that took 10 minutes to reach our table), during which time another waitress came over to give another confusing greeting only to inform us that she was Â helping our server. This appetizer order turned out to be unavailable. After placing a children's order ahead of our main food order, this was also bungled leaving off the ""chicken"" that we had clearly asked for on the chicken quesodillo. The main order took quite a while to receive only to leave off the two things we asked specifically for. Not a big deal considering the side nature of the requests. However the fish and chip meal that one of our party ordered was comprised of tiny pieces of what appeared to be mostly batter. The side of fries we ordered for our son were uneatable (actually thought I broke a tooth on the first one, with the other half a dozen we sampled almost equally as bad). One of the beers we ordered was a Tacoma IPA that tasted as if something were fouled in the line. This was my fiance's first visit to a cheesecake factory and we had raved about the menus, service and ambiance. What we were treated to was a grossly incompetent server who must have cheated on her server training to get on the floor that very day, and an overall experience that shuffled us out the door without bothering to get the cheesecake desert that I had been pining for from the outset. On a redeeming note, my Lua salad was scrumptious and should be commended. This restaurant really needs to tighten things up."
