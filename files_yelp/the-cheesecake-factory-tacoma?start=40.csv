Wang C.,"Lakewood, WA",4,298,122,4.0,1/31/2017,"Connie is awesome as a server! I have had tons terrible servers in the Tacoma/Seattle area, and it seems hard to find a decent one, but Connie provided stellar service and is very friendly. The 3 people working the hostess station are worthless. During our 40 minute wait a manager kept coming up to them and telling them of open tables. We saw one empty for almost 20 minutes. Then when we saw an open booth right next the table they wanted to sit us at, the hostess had to check with front to make sure it was okay. The food came out fairly fast and more importantly was hot and delicious like you expect at a Cheesecake Factory."
Hong T.,"Puyallup, WA",167,77,23,4.0,9/7/2017,Great service! Meals and drinks were quick. We went for a lunch date and our server was wonderful!
Jennifer W.,"Spanaway, WA",23,28,2,1.0,2/3/2017,"Turned in my buzzer to a hostess at the stand who snatched it from me and said ""go stand over there."" Waiting ten minutes and watched people who turned in their buzzer after me get seated. Asked a waitress that how much longer it would be, she turned to the same hostess who I turned my buzzer into and that hostess said I never turned it in. The manager (I assume) sat us at the next available table after I explained that I turned in buzzer number 22 to that hostess who is now saying I never turned it in.  After that dinner was ok but it would have been nice to know that happy hour was bar only (they have signs in the waiting that don't specific bar only).  Maybe I'll return once they've been open for a while and get the sh*t together. Overall disappointed."
Brianna R.,"Tacoma, WA",21,1,1,5.0,6/8/2017,"This was my first visit to a cheesecake factory, by far amazing! Katie was an amazing server, I had ordered the lunch sized meatloaf and did not really like it I asked her if there was a way to switch it (got the Shepherd's pie! Amazing!)  and she was more than happy to accommodate me! She is a very nice and upbeat server with excellent service and was also amazing with my two young children! Thank you Katie for an awesome first experience I will be back with family and friends!!"
Andrea K.,"Southwest Portland, Portland, OR",29,7,1,1.0,8/21/2017,"Poor customer service. Came in on a Monday night a little after 6. Hostess told us our party of 7 had to wait for her manager to talk with us. ??? Weird. After a 10 minute wait, we found out they were trying to figure out where to put us. How hard is it to push a couple tables together? (They were not busy at that time. Several other customers were seated before us.) We ordered and had to wait 45 minutes for our food. 3 of us ordered only cheesecake! Food was delicious, but we had to ask other waiters to bring us items our waiter had been asked to bring several times. This is my first trip to The Cheesecake Factory and I am not impressed."
Erin G.,"Gig Harbor, WA",139,326,18,3.0,2/4/2017,"So a few days after I wrote this review, you will see on the bottom of my last review they asked me to call them.  Although the number only went to the gift card service desk they did give me a customer service number. Customer service was very nice and asked a bunch of questions of the events that led up to my review.  They also sent gifts cards to make amends, which was pretty nice.  Ultimately they did say they would contact the store and talk to the individuals.  They like hearing the feedback and use it to grow to be a better company. So if they actually do that then kudos on them, overall I was impressed they reached out in the first place."
Vincent V.,"Reno, NV",0,6,1,5.0,1/29/2017,The Miso Salmon is my favorite but neither myself or my guests have yet to have a bad dish here. I don't know how they do it with such a big (and a bit overwhelming) menu.  Service is always friendly and attentive. It is quickly becoming my go-to spot for business lunches. Ciao!
Renea S.,"Tacoma, WA",0,1,,2.0,11/26/2017,"I called to place a ""to go"" order where I was placed on hold, after waiting 10 minutes I hung up and called back and told the lady I was on hold for 10 minuets and is that normal? She ignored my question and just took my order. So I get there the girl ringing me up was very nice. I got my food went home and started eating it only to notice after my second bite that there was a piece of hair from someone's beard in my food I could not eat anymore after that so my $20 was wasted  this was my experience and I won't be returning."
Marla T.,"Tacoma, WA",2,2,,1.0,11/12/2017,"I already wrote a long review and I have no idea what happened to it.  In a nutshell we waited almost 3 hours, service was barely there."
Thomas H.,"Empire, CA",138,681,241,1.0,12/22/2016,"Having left shopping at the Tacoma Mall, we stopped in here and were shocked by what we observed. I don't care how good a place is, but as a customer, as they throw uniformed police officers out as they did yesterday, I'm never coming back here ever again. We left. Lousy asshats running this restaurant.  Their attitudes suck. The cheesecake isn't that good, either.  You can find better cheesecake at lower prices elsewhere. Yelp took down this review because they say that it was obvious to them that it didn't reflect an actual customer experience as I live somewhere else.  Here's a revelation for you, Yelp: I'm an airline pilot with 43 years experience.  I know people around the world, and decided to visit friends at Christmas who are very close to me.  I've had a lot of reviews this year from quite a number of cities and towns around Tacoma: look at them.  If you want me to post copies of my sales receipts, I will be happy to provide them to your attorneys during Discovery."
Roni H.,"Banning, CA",20,7,,5.0,7/31/2017,"Our server was Nathan and he was awesome. Place was busy due to cheesecake promo but still wait wasn't too bad. Food and service excellent. Best Cheesecake Factory experience so far and I have been to many. Just want to acknowledge that another customer was mad because he had to wait so long. The manager offered to bring him out some bread to snack on which he declined, and he left shouting that he was going to write a bad review. I chalk this up to his ignorance of the fact it was half off cheesecake therefore you must expect the longer wait. DUH"
Louise E.,"Tacoma, WA",262,46,46,2.0,12/20/2016,"The only reason I'm giving this place a 2-star rating is because I understand that some policies are probably enforced company wide. That being said, I had to wait about 2 hours tonight bc I had a large party (15 people). My family's original meet up time was 6pm but when the hostess said that they would be more likely able to get us at the tables at 6:30-6:45pm-ish, obviously we had to accommodate. Some of my family members were coming from both sides after work PLUS TRAFFIC so even though I had agreed for a 6:30pm ""reservation,"" it would make sense that some of us would be a couple of minutes late, right? NOPE. I knew TCF only takes reservations in person so I planned accordingly since I worked the closest to the area. I ended up waiting for about two hours, as I previously mentioned, only to be told by a manager that they would need the majority of my group in order to keep all of our tables within 10 minutes of my requested ""reservation"". There were seven of us present, she needed 10. I explained that some of my members were really close (2 had just parked and the others were coming up to the traffic light) and tried to ask if she can give me a bit more time - just five extra minutes - to which she said, ""But you told us 6:30pm."" Thankfully the other hostess manage to talk to her and let us have all the tables. This wouldn't have been such a big issue if I had been told about this when I had initially put my name down. Our [first] waitress was friendly but it was odd when she seemed to have left us after she had taken down all of our drink orders. She would be coming by here and there throughout our dinner, but we mostly had two other girls checking in on us. It was nice that she came around our group twice to insure she got the right orders for the right person. Though, odd when she apparently got some orders wrong. Noticing other big groups, it just seemed so chaotic regarding which servers are waiting on which tables.  When I first heard that the Cheesecake Factory do not take any reservations other than in- person, I immediately made a choice not to come here or any other locations on my own. After experiencing this again first-hand, I shall stick to that decision but only agree to come for family and friends.  I understand that this may be all part of their company policy, but I wish the customer service - especially from a manager - was better. I thank all the people that helped us tonight for being so patient with such a large group that also divided up the checks. I ordered a combination of the shrimp scampi and chicken (something). The scampi part didn't come with any pasta noodles. I had asked the waitress if it would have any noodles just bc as a stand-alone dish, the scampi did come with the noodles. The waitresses said yes but NOPE! Disappointed after that."
Andy y.,"Federal Way, WA",95,25,6,1.0,12/23/2016,"Came for lunch around 11:30 and was seated within 5 minutes. We ordered lunch portions of the shrimp scampi and chicken Romano for lunch but had to send the shrimp scampi back to the kitchen because the pasta was unbearably salty. Both pasta dishes were overly salty, in fact.  Our waitress did an excellent job taking the dish back to the kitchen to be remade without making us feel bad about it, but even when the kitchen remade the Shrimp Scampi, it was still pretty salty. It's like the kitchen had taken a cup of salt and poured it in with the pasta while it boiled. We couldn't finish our plates and ended up leaving shortly after, $50 lighter and stomachs still mostly empty.  Other than the incredibly salty pasta, the lemonades were good if a little syrupy and the bread was at least piping hot."
David B.,"Brentwood, CA",23,15,,5.0,12/6/2016,"Made it to opening day today (12/6) and I am definitely impressed with the attentiveness and professionalism on otherwise a hectic day. When I got there I was greeted multiple times and informed them that I was on a lunch break from work and only had 45min to get in and out and if it was even possible for that to happen. The front desk made sure to ask around for me before giving an answer and ensured me that I wouldn't have to worry.  Fast forward to my meal. I ordered the Macaroni and Cheese Burger and a water. I can not express enough how many times they made sure I was good on water. This is perfect! I am someone who drinks my water fast and usually am stuck awkwardly asking for more. I can't appreciate enough that this was something they were able to accommodate on such a busy day. On top of that, my meal came out within 15-20min, cooked to perfection. They entertained us with the best oven baked bread while waiting, which made my wait go by quickly. Lastly, the check. I did have to ask for my check, which is ok as I was socializing with others and they would periodically check in to make sure I was alright and it was my fault for consistently saying no, so I'm sure they took it as a hint of some kind. They made sure the minute I asked for it to promptly get it to my table, as they remembered I was on lunch break. That was a small detail to remember, but definitely made me feel like they were listening. Long story short, I will be here again. I am thoroughly impressed with this establishment, especially on opening day."
Olivia P.,"Tacoma, WA",238,4,,5.0,11/13/2017,Amazing service SUMMER was an amazing! Great service great humor and really helped us out! Definitely coming back and recommending everyone see her! You rock. Also cheesecake was amazing
Jack O.,"Kirkland, WA",0,11,,2.0,1/9/2017,"Their menu is too damn big which causes too much workload for the kitchen. This causes mediocre food and very long wait times. Not worth the wait. Would rather eat at BJs next door and then order a cheesecake to go. I have no problem deciding what to eat, but I do have a problem with a menu that's so big the kitchen can't do a great job on every single thing. Look at places like Purple café or Pacific Grill. What's the difference? Their quality of food is so much higher because their menu is smaller. Yet the prices are the same as Cheesecake Factory. Really doesn't make sense. Cheesecake factory is trying so hard to be an upscale place but shoots itself in the foot with a huge menu."
Seth P.,"Tacoma, WA",30,292,29,3.0,1/9/2017,"First off I have a son who is 9 weeks old. We have a stroller... They're in a mall, with an infant it is almost a necessity to have a stroller... We were not allowed to bring our stroller to our seat. What is more is that the staff was no help in unloading our stuff in the stroller and awkwardly stared at us like we were from Mars as we unloaded it! However our server who was amazing did make up for the hostess and busboy's odd treatment."
Jason G.,"Westport, WA",5,7,,1.0,8/20/2017,"Hmmm I've been to cheesecake factories several times over the years, this one was particularly unpleasant, the waiter took 5 min to even engage us then when he did, it was someone filling in for our waitress who was on break, the food took an unusually long time to be served and one of the burgers we got was uncooked, we sent it back, and they recooked the cut up burger (odd) needless to say it still wasn't cooked. We complained and they only offered to comp the inedible burger, we complained again and they gave us free cheescake...overall a poor experience ill have to say ill be avoiding in the future."
Syn M.,"Tacoma, WA",1,32,13,5.0,12/6/2016,"UPDATE: 3/5 goes to 5/5 after our shortcake took forever the manager personally brought it, apologized, and took it off our bill. Great customer service and the short cake was amazing.  Opening day is as hectic and chaotic as you could imagine but I think the staff did amazing for how much foot traffic there was. Our server was polite but very busy so not as attentive as they should have been but still overall no complaints. The food wait was a little long especially out dessert which took over 25 minutes to come out for shortcake. After voicing my opinion someone assured me it was coming out and that they were behind. Hold on the lemonades because they are super sweet I had to dilute it with my water. As I'm still writing this review I'm contemplating on just canceling our shortcake...."
Kelli T.,"Olympia, WA",51,8,2,5.0,7/29/2017,"We had an amazing server named Brian! He made us laugh and was extremely attentive!!! Give that man a raise!!!! My boyfriends steak came out and it was cold, Brian was on it he wanted to do whatever he could to make it better. The manager Jason was so awesome he came over and we can only assume that Brian let him know what happened. He took the time to talk to us and even without our knowledge gave us our dessert for free!!! Thank you both so much for being awesome and making our first experience with your restaurant a good one!!!!"
