Sophia W.,"Melbourne, FL",17,15,10,5.0,7/18/2017,I've been to many Cheesecake locations in and outside WA state! For this to be a newly opened location their food is on point and expected as the norm of Cheesecake Factory. I would recommend this location just because you don't have to wait an hour plus like many other places around town. I've been here a few times usually on a busy Friday night and haven't felt that I had to wait longer than usual actually I've been pleased  with their service and will be going back soon! I haven't tried the actual cheesecakes yet but don't expect them to be anything less than what you would get anywhere else!
Amanda H.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/20/2017,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory three times with the hopes of it getting better. To my disappointment though, it is always a horrible experience. The first time I ordered a to-go meal. It took over an hour, they messed up the order, were rude about it, and never apologized. The second time, we sat down to eat. The server was awful, our food arrived at different times, and the kids meal took the longest. I had to beg for some fruit to keep her happy, even though 3 out of 4 of the adult meals had already arrived. Once again, no apology, or offer to compensate. Today, we went with a group of three adults and four kids. The restaurant was relatively empty when we got there. It took over an hour to get our meals, two hours to actually leave, the food came out at different times. The drinks took forever. The boxes and checks took even longer. It was horrible. The service here sucks! They need new management and training."
Ashley G.,"Tacoma, WA",8,13,12,5.0,12/7/2016,"Wait time for two was twenty minutes. Not bad considering the hype. I got the angel hair pasta with shrimp. It was delicious. Love the sauce on the pasta. Shrimp was a little bland. Didnt get any cheesecake this time around. Our server was AWESOME. Harold was a great server, he was on top of everything even though they were quite busy and this being just the second day of being open in this location. I'll definitely be back. :)"
Mary M.,"Shorewood, IL",172,70,30,5.0,1/26/2017,"Came here with a friend last night for dinner. It was our first time ever visiting a Cheesecake Factory. The wait time for a table of two was only around 15 minutes. The restaurant was really full for a Wednesday night, so we were happy to be seated as soon as we did. We had the Sweet Tamale cakes as our appetizer & omg it was so delicious! I then had the Stuffed Portobello mushrooms which were yummy, and the French country salad which was really tasty also. My friend had one of their pasta dishes which she loved. For dessert I had their heavenly chocolate tower cake which melts in my mouth. Our waitress was really nice & gave us great service. I will definitely be visiting this restaurant again when I'm in Tacoma!"
Clayton L.,"Fayetteville, GA",2,80,20,4.0,6/26/2017,"I do not care for the lunch menu there.  But the cheesecake is crazy good.  I ordered the Chris outrageous cheesecake. It's so good.  This location is part of the Tacoma WA Mall, very nice and large."
Erica S.,"Lakewood, WA",167,31,30,4.0,12/14/2016,"For being new, they seem to have everything together. Service was great, food was awesome, decor was spot on. I didn't like the Cheesecake Factory in Tukwila, but this location has made me want to come back again!"
Hernandez J.,"Lynnwood, WA",0,3,,2.0,10/28/2017,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever patronized. The wait was normal but as we were seated we noticed the silverware was dirty. Not one piece but all of them on both place settings. We asked for a manager which to a while and when he finally showed up didn't apologize or try to explain why this had happened, he just said that the staff will get you clean ones and walked away. A staff member brought over another setting for each of us and as she was set them on the table realized some  that she brought were also not clean with dried food on them also. Returned again finally with clean one. Form there on the service was slow. It to 30 minutes for our food to come out from the time we ordered it.  The food was fair. Not a good dining experience. Won't go back."
W K.,"Lakewood, WA",7,39,30,3.0,4/11/2017,"Was very excited to know that the Factory opened near me, went on a Saturday Afternoon and it was so hectic and crazy. We came in a party of  5 and they told us a waiting time of 60-85 minutes. Luckily the mall is right next to it so waited as we took a look around. Didn't actually take too long for our seats. Our server was very nice, he offered us complimentary bananas and bread for the kids. The price is a bit high for the quality of the food. I ordered a carbonara pasta with chicken and a chopped salad. The chopped salad was actually very good, but I was a little disappointed with the pasta; It was very bland and the chicken was very tough.  It's the Cheesecake Factory so of course we ordered us some cheesecake, and they were okay.  The only thing I didn't like is that there is no structure regarding the waiting line. People are standing everywhere and we don't even know where the starts or ends, we think they're waiting to get seated but they're just standing around, and there are only like 5 seats for people to sit in and we had an elderly with us so it was kind of hard to wait inside."
Alisha W.,"Yakima, WA",3,7,7,2.0,6/7/2017,I ordered the steak Diane it came with 4 bites of steak.  Literally cut in bite size pieces. Not impressed with this location.
Ron O.,"Olympia, WA",99,171,97,2.0,4/22/2017,"Wasn't a fan of the cheeseburger. My wife & two girls loved thier pizza & mini taco things. 4 meals, 2 cheese cakes plus tip, well over $100. Services gets the 2nd star. The first was for my meal that I didn't care for. Patty was great, the bun felt spongy & old, cheese was runny. Not really my kind of food, however girls loved thier food. Place is clean, bathrooms are clean but small. Really loud restaurant!"
Kristin R.,"Steilacoom, WA",7,10,,2.0,10/13/2017,"We've been to this location several times for lunch, happy hour, and dinner - but started to go less frequently because of the pain-in-the-butt Mall parking lot at those times.  (I wish they weren't located directly inside the Mall !!!)   So we got an email during the week about them offering Brunch items on weekends.  Sounded good to us, we decided OK, we'll bite - and the parking lot is a lot less busy at 10:00am on a weekend.  We walked in at 10:15am and sat at the bar.  We waited for a good 10-15 minutes before we were even acknowledged.  No bartender.  He finally comes and ties his apron on (by now it's 30 minutes past opening) and takes our drink orders.  I ordered a vodka grapefruit and my husband ordered a simple cup of coffee.  I got my drink right away.  My husband went to the restroom and when he came back I went to the restroom too.  By the time I got back, there was still no coffee served to my husband.  (A simple cup of coffee.  At BRUNCH?!)  We ordered our food and the bartender disappeared to find the coffee (finally).  It was probably another 10 minutes before he got it.  (Again, a simple cup of coffee.  At BRUNCH!?) Our food came out.  Our side items included toast and English muffins.  No butter or jam/jelly to be found.  No salt/pepper for our eggs.  We had to wait until the bartender reappeared to ask for them.  We all know how quickly breakfast foods get cold...you get the point. If they had done what other restaurants who serve breakfast/brunch do, there would have been butter, jam, jelly, salt and pepper prior to the food arriving (heck, even Tabasco sauce is usually set in front of you). And guess what?  My husband's cup of coffee was never refilled.  By now we weren't too shocked at that :-(   Bottom line is:  Don't open early for brunch if you haven't fully prepared your staff for it.  You'll lose loyal customers very quickly."
Stacey R.,"Puyallup, WA",0,8,,1.0,12/7/2017,Don't waste your time here except with to go Cheesecake. Stopped in here after Christmas shopping at 7:30pm on a Thursday night. Place was 1/3 full at best. Host barely acknowledged us. After seated server was great. Took an hour for our food to come out. An hour!!! Manager cake by twice apologizing but ultimately doing nothing. Server refilled drinks and checked on us often. Manager served our food which was lukewarm to cold and my shrimp were like rubber. Barely choked it down even though we were starving at this point. Received bill with no discounts taken off. Asked for manager who took off our $8 to go cheesecakes.... really an hour and it's worth $8?!?! For cold food. Whatever won't go back. Also had to go to service bar ourselves to get our to go Cheesecake. Never again. No wonder this location has such poor ratings. To add insult to injury by the time we got out of there a full hour and 45 minutes later the mall was closed and we had to walk all the way around outside in the freezing cold and dark parking lot. Awesome. Thanks Cheesecake Factory.
Rachel L.,"Bellevue, NE",1,8,7,4.0,4/27/2017,"I got the shrimp scampi and it was delicious. Perfectly coated shrimp over angel hair pasta. And the Reese's peanut butter cake cheesecake is my favorite, it has only a little bit of cheesecake in it, and the rest is a rich chocolate cake with peanut butter cream on top"
Bryan M.,"Rocklin, CA",23,28,,5.0,3/17/2017,"Service was great and so was the food! The modern old fashion was amazing! There was a bit of a wait, but all these people need to get a grip! You're not more important than everyone else!"
Rich L.,"Tacoma, WA",38,1,,1.0,3/5/2017,"This place has a 1-1.5 hour wait. I get that, they are busy, the food is good, and they are new. However, I come here for one thing and one goddamn thing only. It is the sweet corn tamale cakes. Sure enough at 6:00 pm on a Sunday they are OUT? I have never been to a restaurant on any continent where they were OUT of food? This is literally the most disappointed I have ever been eating out. If this was the only thing they were out of then I ""might"" be able to understand. Unfortunately, they are out of over 20 different items. This is simply piss poor management. If I ran my classes like this restaurant I would be fired within the week. ""Sorry children I have run out of topics to teach you this week. Come back later and we might have some more information, if I haven't given it to my other students."" FML"
Taus M.,"Tacoma, WA",0,1,,5.0,9/29/2017,"It's September and my wife and I have been very satisfied with CF since our last review in October.  The first visit in Sept was a birthday celebration and the second visit was just a date with wifey.  Our waitress and waiter,  Marta (first visit) and Kevin H. (second visit) were friendly and very accommodating (Excellent service). Food was good and served within a reasonable time. Good job management. There something to these reviews after all. Until the next visit..."
Jaden S.,"Tacoma, WA",176,2,,5.0,1/16/2017,"10/10 great food, great service. Of course there's gonna be a wait, it's a Cheesecake Factory. Well worth it!"
Rebecca K.,"Tacoma, WA",69,2,,1.0,6/6/2017,"We had one of the worst experience at this restaurant. We walked in around 8pm and it wasn't packed or anything. We ordered cheese pizza, gumbo, another entree, and some kind of vegetable pasta. I asked them to overcook the pasta because I wanted to share with my baby. We waited about 30minutes, when the manager came out and told us its going to take longer if we wanted pizza because there was a hole on the bottom and everything fell through the hole(wth??) and told us if we want pizza it will be another 45minutes!!! First of all at this point I was pissed. It took so long, especially when the place was that busy, and she didnt even apologize for what has happened on their end, and just told us it will take another 45 unless we choose different menu. So we ordered two kids corn dogs. All the other meals came out after another 10minutes, my kids were starving waiting for those corndogs for another 10-15min after that. Gumbo tasted burnt, the rice was hard, we had to have them take it back and couldn't even think about ordering another dish because they take so long. The pasta was not overcooked at all(total opposite from what I have requested, ESPECIALLY when we have waited that long!!!!)  We go out to eat a lot!!! But this was one of the worst experience I have ever had. The Tacoma Cheesecake factory has definitely left a negative impression on the reputation of Cheesecake Factory both in service and quality. And I don't think I will ever go back nor would I recommend this place to anyone."
Hune N.,"Bonney Lake, WA",276,51,4,2.0,3/27/2017,"Long waits when I arrived at my seat, crumbs all over my seat, wasn't  wiped down. Had a couple different servers. Food came out, I ordered the pasta it looked good but took a couple bites , it was dry and the sauce stuck to the plate. I order the same dish every time , the Louisiana chicken pasta. They were busy and the server asked me why didn't you say something well, she never checked on me. So when I was ready to pay I told her, I paid for something that's really delicious that was probably sitting in the window underneath the heat drying up. I like the cheesecake factory but Tacoma gave me a bad taste in my mouth.  The south center is a lot better. Drove down to Tacoma location hoping to get service and with it being a new location, but instead had long waits and most likely won't come back again to Tacoma location."
Gale B.,"Roy, WA",0,23,1,5.0,5/29/2017,Went for brunch. Got seated right away. Waitress was very nice. I got the lemon ricotta pancakes SO DELICIOUS! My friends at the table were all jealous and wished they ordered it. The mimosas were YUMMY as well. We'll be back but next time I think I'll try the French toast
