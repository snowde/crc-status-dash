Chelsey V.,"Tacoma, WA",0,7,9,2.0,3/19/2017,"it was my first time at the Tacoma location & the service was awesome. the wait time was more than 30 mins so my boyfriend & I decided to head into the mall to walk for a bit (check in said to come back in 20 mins since their beeper wouldn't work in the mall - understandable). We came back about 15 mins after and waited in the lobby another 10-15 mins. Our waitress was great - suggested some food since we were a bit overwhelmed with the menu (I mean there is a BUNCH OF DIFFERENT FOODS). But we ordered the egg roll sampler - it was yummy but it was EXTREMELY hot & burnt my finger from hot oil that dripped from the egg roll, boyfriend ordered the orange chicken - it was tasty & not your average food chain orange chicken, then I ordered the gumbo with white rice - everything tasted yummy besides my rice. The rice was basically scrapped from the bottom of the pan. It was crispy and stuck together - you know when you cook rice and leave the scraps at the bottoms and you finally scrap the pan clean * that's what my rice was. (I don't think I'd order that again - next time I'll stick to my usual). But other than my meal being a disappointment we had a good dinner"
Colton P.,"Puyallup, WA",100,25,18,4.0,3/19/2017,"Having been a local in the 253 area for my whole life, it was nice to finally see an extension of the Cheesecake Factory near the Tacoma mall instead of having to drive to Seattle every time. I ate with my family and girlfriend and choose this place because of it's delicious food and environment. Having read through some of the previous reviews, we did not experience lukewarm food or bad service. The service was exceptional and the food was delicious. The downsides I could think of were the extremely small men's restroom, small restaurant, and the food took a really long time to come out that even our waitress reassured us a couple times that it would be coming out soon"
Stephanie H.,"Longview, WA",38,17,3,5.0,4/8/2017,AMAZING!!! Bar is your best bet if you don't have the kids. Great service amazing dinner. Cheesecake to go. New favorite place!!
Helo F.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,30,4.0,5/21/2017,"One of the best cheesecake joint. Visited Tacoma WA and had to stop by to have my favorite redvelvet cheese cake. There are so many variety of different flavor cheesecakes to choose from. If you have a sweet tooth, you will not be disappointed."
Haley H.,"Dupont, WA",59,39,17,5.0,4/6/2017,Been here 3x now the food and deserts are always bomb. Service at the bar sucks but the restaurant part is always nice and friendly. I'm a little to into the Bread so I'm restricting myself to only eating here once a month or else I'll be on my 600 lbs life in a matter of a year.
Chris D.,"Corona, CA",126,82,4,1.0,12/21/2016,"Sitting down and observing the restaurant kick police officers out , that are trying to have a enjoyable lunch is absolutely discusting!!!! I will never attend another establishment like this again!"
Danny A.,"Tacoma, WA",0,3,,1.0,5/19/2017,"Where do I start? They have a long way to go before they are up to snuff with their sister stores. The food was literally horrible. My wife's Caesar salad that she has had at tons of times at other locations was gross. Instead of being crisp and awesome like usual it was limp and dripping​ in some mayonnaise mess that they called dressing. My steak, that I ordered medium rare came out burnt to the core. The one they brought to replace it was laden with salt and blue rare. Most everything simply didn't taste the same or as good as any other Cheesecake Factory we've ever been to. Stale bread, burnt appetizers and more. We won't be back there for a long time. Tukwila here we come."
Kevin F.,"Burien, WA",16,3,3,1.0,12/21/2016,We checked in at 5:08 they said the wait would be up to 50 min for us I am disabled and walk with a cane and my father in law is in a wheelchair and my wife . 40 min later I checked and she said we were at the top of her list then 50 min and the man said he was waiting for people to leave at a table then at 6:15 we decided to leave I had been standing the whole time we have watched people be seated with 3-4 people in there party but not us . We left I called the mgr Leslie she said if we come back in she would seat us but how could that be if we had to wait . So I said no we were already in the car . So she offered to get us a table ready the next time we come if I call her ahead of time . And free appetizers . We are at Arby's now . Kevin Farley Yelm WA
John M.,"Spanaway, WA",12,5,,5.0,3/26/2017,My server was Shantelle and she was very attentive and friendly such a wonderful experience we even met the chef that had cooked our food his name is Terrance Harris and his food is perfect i had the chicken costoletta my son had the  mac and cheese burger my wife had the spicy chicken Chipotle pasta. To sum it up it is an experience to be had.
Valeri L.,"Bremerton, WA",49,3,2,1.0,12/18/2016,"Came here to celebrate my moms birthday. We had our buzzer called they told us to wait at a certain spot. We waited for about 15-25 minutes, before we started getting annoyed. Turns out they ""called"" out our name 4 times. They didn't and if they did they did a shitty job at it. Considering they told us to wait and it being packed and loud they didn't call the name very loud at all. Keep in mind we where right by the ""check in"" area. Talked to the manager and she didn't do shit. What a shame we had high hopes."
Selena B.,"Kent, WA",98,7,,1.0,3/25/2017,"Just had the WORST experience here. Was excited to come to this location, but was very disapointed. After waiting an hour to be seated, we were ready to order right away. About 15-20 minutes after ordering, I noticed everyone who just got seated was already eating before us. We kept waiting, and waiting for our food. Then finally the waiter comes with our food. He said our orders got mixed up, and our food was just sitting there for 30min. Also that happened earlier as well. Our food was luke warm and hard. Just disgusting my boyfriend sent his back but I was so hungry and tired of waiting I just ate it. After that the manager finally came after 20 minutes and just kept apologizing. Then we continued to wait for the bill. The bill never came they never told us they would take care of our meal, so we just waited for no reason. So unsatisfied and will probably not come back."
Erin T.,"Tacoma, WA",0,2,,2.0,9/9/2017,"We were wanting to go to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate my niece's and my birthday. They told us that the wait time would be 60-80 minutes.  So we went to BJ's instead, no big deal.  We decided that we would just grab a slice of cheesecake on our way out. I approached the counter to ask about ordering a slice and I was told that I could order it down on the right side. (No one was at this part of the counter). So myself and another lady waited for someone to return, which took about ten minutes. After placing my order, I watched the girl filling orders get pretty overwhelmed, having to basically beg a server to get someone to help her. I saw what looked like a plain strawberry cheesecake with no whipped cream and extra strawberries sitting on the back counter near the espresso machine. I then watched people come to help out behind the counter, every single one of which ignored the slice sitting, boxed, on the counter for 15 minutes. I watched multiple people move it to the side and ignore a boxed slice of cheesecake sitting on the back counter.  One of the women helping finally asked if I had been waiting for something. I told her and it was resolved. I left and the woman whom ordered before still hadn't gotten her cheesecake.  It just seems a bit crazy to me to wait 25 minutes for a slice of cheesecake. I understand busy as a former server and barista, but watching that many people look over food sitting on the back counter (that must be boxed for some reason) was pretty ridiculous."
Levi S.,"Tacoma, WA",2,12,2,2.0,1/14/2017,The food is good (from prior visits) but waited over 90 min so far and no table in sight yet. Place is paced and doesn't have the staff to support demand at this point. Even checked in before 4:30 to try to make it easier but still waiting!
Adam S.,"Schofield Barracks, HI",60,3,,2.0,12/24/2016,"Service was good, but at the end of the meal they boxed our food, and when we got home I went to eat the rest of my meal and it was the wrong meal. They had given us someone elses left over meal. So we were not happy with that at all. Make sure to check that the leftovers is actually yours."
Jason A.,"Seattle, WA",6,8,,1.0,12/23/2016,"Service was horrendous, waitress was impossible to flag down. We were ready to leave 30mins before our food arrived, but I'm not one to leave after ordering, so we waited. 30mins after we were finished our meal, which was over priced for the quality, we still couldn't get the service to bring us our check. I eventually got fed up and walked up to the counter and paid our bill. Needless to say, we will not be returning or frequent any other of their chains. Shortly after, the incident with the custody officers being denied service broke the news and I wasn't surprised... Their incompetence knows no bounds."
Katie R.,"Gig Harbor, WA",0,44,5,1.0,9/6/2017,"I've been here a few times since they've opened. Keep telling myself maybe if I wait the service and food will get better, sadly it never does. I've dined in and placed a to-go order. When I placed my to-go the girl informed me I would have to come inside and pick it up at the bakery when they're supposed to bring it to your car. She never asked for my name so when I got there they had to look it up by the food I ordered. I've been ignored, had to wait 45 minutes to be seated when others coming in are being sat before us. It is pick and choose, not first come first serve here. I took my son here after school on 9/5 the waitress was nice and attentive but the food wasn't good. I couldn't even eat my sandwich it had blood in all the turkey! If you see it on the meat and you still serve it, that's an issue. Workers don't seem to care. I see this place quickly going downhill. Will not be returning and giving my money to such a careless business."
Miguel R.,"Tacoma, WA",75,4,,4.0,12/23/2016,Great staff and not a long wait at all compared to the one at South Center Mall. For an appetizer my fiance and I ordered the the roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread (Recommended). It was delicious and came out in a timely manner.  The waitress was very friendly and attenitive to our needs. The main corse came shortly after and the water glass was always full. I ordered the Cajun Chicken Littles and the fiance ordered the Eggplant Parmesian Pasta. Both were equally delicious in their own special way. The Chicken Littles AKA fried chicken tenders were fried just right. Crunchy and not very greasy  at all. They were complimented nicely by a mountain of mashed potatoes with two sauces for dipping (Honey mustard and BBQ sauce) and a side of freshly steamed veggies.  I would recomend going to this one instead of the one up north just because of the way the food was prepared and cooked. Shout out to the cooks. You all are the real MVPs. The only reason I'm giving this place a 4 out of 5 is because there is always room for improvement. Keep up the great work everybody.
Kseniya O.,"Tacoma, WA",63,86,57,5.0,1/25/2017,The wait is usually pretty long so I suggest to bring distractions for children. The menu has a wide variety of options. The service was surprisingly great for such a large busy place. The food tasted good also. I ordered the chipotle pasta which was very flavorful and the portion was large. The kids menu has a large variety also. My husband had the burger with tomato and onions (which they forgot) but promptly brought out and apologized. The only thing I would suggest is crayons and paper for kids but I should have brought some myself instead of assuming they'd have them.
Baby D.,"Olympia, WA",1,46,1,3.0,3/7/2017,"At the time of writing my initial review I also submitted the same complaint to Cheesecake Factory's corporate office. Much to my surprise I received a call several days later from Leslie, general manager at the Tacoma location. My interaction with her was positive. She listened to my complaint and was understanding and apologetic. She mentioned that she addresses all complaints/concerns that are sent to corporate for that location and appreciated the feedback so they could continue to improve. I really appreciated this follow-up, especially from a large chain. After speaking with Leslie I would be open to dining at the Tacoma location again. I have not returned since my initial post so I rated this based on my interaction with their general manager."
Vivienne S.,"Lakewood, WA",0,11,1,1.0,3/4/2017,Having to wait over two hours just to sit down and eat is ridiculous. They don't even offer you drinks while waiting and barely even have seats in the waiting area. Would not recommend.
