Howard C.,"Land O' Lakes, FL",26,52,232,5.0,1/6/2018,"Fantastic meal! Shared a steak and chicken combo that melted in my mouth! Ann was the best waitress! Now page 2 Just returned for lunch WOW The flatbreads are amazing. Pear with goat cheese. The beet and pecan salad excellent! This visit we had Kim to meet our culinary needs. Friendly, knowledgeable, and pleasant!! 20% tip worthy The chicken piccatta was tender, moist and gourmet level. Definitely a new favorite. For dessert what else but CHEESECAKE Key Lime yummm"
Lindsay L.,"Boston, MA",188,1,,5.0,1/1/2018,"This is a great spot, but more importantly Chase Robert the server is the best!!!! Such a wonderful server through and through - our favourite ever. He made the whole experience perfect from beginning to end. Make sure you ask for him if you can when you swing by. He should be running the joint! And coincidentally his name is the reverse of ours :)  Thanks so much Chase!"
Daniella H.,"Lutz, FL",76,19,178,5.0,10/23/2017,"I have been to this location many times as it is in a great location and efficient too. Don't be too intimidated by the amount of people that appear to be waiting in the front entrance area, as the wait time tends to go by faster than the projected time. Sometimes it is busier on the weekends but bottom line it's always busy, and having a drink at the bar is good too. My family and I love ordering the Thai Lettuce wraps as an appetizer. They are delicious and all vegetables with grilled chicken and some dipping sauces, great if you're avoiding bread or not wanting to feel stuff as before the dinner itself! We like to get a bottle of the cheesecake factory house red which impressively has a great taste and is worth orsering.  Also, I enjoy ordering the Stuffed chicken tortillas every time, which come with black beans and corn tamale cakes which are oh em yummy! My sister ordered the fish tacos which she enjoyed too. We all agree that the portion sizes are huge and bound to take leftovers home with you. Then of course the cheesecake for dessert is a must! I'm a classic girl so I love either the classic flavor or the fresh strawberries cheesecake, and one slice is totally shareable. If you get the espresso coffee,  keep in mind it's like a double shot size of it , so expect a good coffee buzz from that.  Overall, I always get excited to come back and the menu is intriguing enough that it makes you want to try everything."
Karen F.,"Tampa, FL",96,565,1354,3.0,9/25/2017,"My favorite part of my Cheesecake Factory experience was the people. The host was very friendly and extremely helpful in accommodating my party of eight people. The bartender was super personable, and made an excellent mojito - actually one of the best I've had, and I drink them a lot when I go out. Plus our server was so efficient and organized - I feel like it was some of the best service I've had in town, which is so funny that it happened at a chain restaurant. The food was okay. I know they are known for their huge portions, and entrees and salads are definitely meant to be split. I had the Thai chicken lettuce roll ups off the appetizer menu, and the best part of that dish were the three dipping sauces. Sadly, the chicken didn't seem to have much flavor. If I were preparing this dish, I think I would offer more flavorful chicken, and less bean sprouts.  Presentation was beautiful though!   We did not have time or room for cheesecake, but I'll definitely be back for another mojito - and I think I'll skip dinner and head straight for dessert."
Ken L.,"Clearwater, FL",62,133,38,4.0,10/6/2017,"Ok, my review is all about their happy hour. What, they have a happy hour?! I didn't know either but I'm glad I found out. They have the best prices and drink options on Bay street. None of that bottom shelf stuff here. Only top shelf liquors here! Quiet ambience makes this a date place for happy hour!"
Max E.,"Riverview, FL",2,28,75,5.0,12/25/2017,"You really can't go wrong when you go to the Cheesecake Factory because they are not limited by their choices, and on that note, they have like a book for a menu.  You can get lost with the amount of choices they have.  Can be a bit overwhelming if you are one of those who have problems making a choice when presented with so many choices.  I have been here a couple of times, and I normally get the Shepards pie, and my wife normally gets the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp which consist of Sautéed Shrimp with a Very Spicy Jamaican Black Pepper Sauce. Served with Rice, Black Beans, Plantains and Marinated Pineapple.  Prices are under $20 per plate, servings are generous, taste is good.  This last time, I also ordered the chicken taquitos which was only $5 and the Avocado Eggrolls, which were avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion and cilantro fried in a crisp wrapper, it was served with a tamarind-cashew dipping sauce, which was very sweet.  Normally, there is a waiting to get a table, but not that long.  The staff are very helpful and professional."
Boon C.,"Tampa, FL",363,1503,8670,3.0,7/23/2017,"I like our food here but not necessary we have best time. First the wait, the hostess tell us 10-15 minutes. It turn up another ten minutes. I walk around and found empty tables but they are not occupied by anyone. I went to check when is our turn, they lead me to the same empty table that I found 5 minutes ago. The seat is just below the AC vent. I can feel the drip of the water. They definitely need to check this vent on their off hour. Make sure water molecules is contained.  The only thing I like about this place is the service on the table and the food. Which is the most important. My wife has the Thai Coconut-Lime Chicken. It a bit lime heavy at the end. The best is the Hibachi Steak. It is the hunger steak with shiitake mushrooms in slice, caramel onion and sprout. It also included the wasabi mash potatoes and tempura asparagus. This steak is cook with the ginger sauce which is a good match.  Service is good over the dining time. Food come out the right time compare to my last visit. I would said the hostess need to paid attention to the empty table. Customers is less patient when exceed to the wait acknowledge time. The AC vent need to be clean and make not dripping water. Who know what dust has the water has collected."
Vi P.,"Tampa, FL",180,112,261,3.0,6/27/2017,"Short: Mediocre to great tasting food (depends on what you get), extremely popular, so expect a long wait.  Gigantic menu. Long: Honestly, I came here with extremely low expectations.  Normally places like these are overrated and not worth the price.  To my surprise, Cheesecake Factory exceeded my expectations.  Now I've been here a few times already, but the last time was great.  Maybe I ordered the wrong dish the last few times. The last visit I had, we started with the tuna carpaccio.  This was so delicious, it was sliced thin and topped with this delicious togarashi aioli, looks like a mayonnaise based sjauce.  For my meal I got the Steak Diane and chicken Madeira.  Came with a side of mashed potatoes. Both the steak and chicken was season perfectly.  It was definitely delicious, the mash potatoes were a little salty.   I would suggest everyone to try out this meal. The menu is huge.  It is too big.  I believe a restaurant should have a smaller menu, without such a large variety of cuisine.  That way they can focus and improve on that, rather than has so many different dishes/ingredients to keep up with. It feels you are looking through a novel just to find the type of dish you want.  An improvement for Cheesecake factory would be to shorten their menu.  I've notice many customers take a long time to order because it is so hard to decide what to get.  This goes along with my previous experiences. From previous visits.  The food was okay and not worth the price.  One visit, I had the curry dish.  Honestly it felt mediocre and could've gotten the same dish that tastes better and lower price at a different restaurant that specializes in curry.  This is what I mean by the menu is too big.  Sometimes trying to cook too many dishes effects the quality of the meals. Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but I wouldn't be oppose to coming if suggested."
Dotti O.,"Booneville, MS",45,1,,1.0,12/29/2017,"The hostess would not even acknowledge my presence, nor my son's, and we were standing immediately in front of him!!! He looked right at us, turned his head. Then, when another woman walked up (beside us at that) he asked her if she needed to get her name added to the list. I don't know what his problem was, but this was the rudest I've ever been treated in a restaurant! We walked out, taking our business elsewhere! We were visiting family in the hospital in Tampa. I can guarantee you that none of us will come to this rude place again - that refuses to acknowledge customers. If I could give 0 stars, I would!"
John G.,"Tampa, FL",404,162,221,5.0,5/16/2017,"Trips to international mall sometimes need to be completed with a stop at Cheesecake Factory.  Most intense menu ever...literally a novel.  I got the spicy chicken chipotle dish and it didn't disappoint.  What is a definite MUST, however, is the white chocolate macadamia nut caramel cheesecake. Unbelievable. I usually don't finish a slice of their cheesecake in one sitting, but this one.....this one, I couldn't put the fork down. Do yourself a favor and try it out."
Cassandra S.,"Tampa, FL",139,486,15,4.0,11/19/2017,"I was pleasantly surprised that there was an empty seat available at the bar at 6:30 on a Saturday night. I had a glass of Markwest Pinot noir which was pretty good. They were three bartenders which was nice because I never had to wait long when I needed something. They were also two TVs, one with football and then with hockey so it was perfect. I ended with a slice of Adams peanut butter cheesecake and it was amazing!"
Kevin W.,"Ottawa, Canada",11,21,,5.0,12/29/2017,"I've wanted to try this place for years and finally did and was not disappointed.  The bread was fresh and delicious, decor, service and atmosphere was great and the portion sizes were incredibly large.  Terrific experience and I will return."
Orlando M.,"Tampa, FL",56,64,199,5.0,8/10/2017,Fantastic place for lunch. Peaceful than I thought. Never ate at a Cheesecake Factory for anything but cheesecake. Didn't think their food was gonna be delicious but I spoke to soon. Soup of the day was chicken vegetable and it was a a delicious soup for lunch. I also had the avocado bread which was great appetizer/light vegan lunch. (Unless you're cutting carbs). But the avocado on bread is my go to from now on. Mmmm. The beautiful wife had the Evelyn's Pasta. Tasty vegan pasta. Like I said before  did not expect much from a Cheesecake Factory other than delicious cheesecake. I didn't even get cheesecake this go around.
Marty C.,"Clearwater, FL",56,299,490,4.0,1/17/2017,"A trip to International Mall wouldn't be complete without a meal at the Cheesecake Factory.  We were quickly seated.  If you've never been before, their menu's length is quite daunting.  However, they do bring you complimentary bread to munch on while you peruse the menu. For luncheon, I always like to get the Renee's Special which is a soup of the day, salad and one half of either a chicken salad or sliced turkey sandwich. (see pic)  One thing I do that may seem odd is that I always get an order of French fries with whatever I order albeit pasta or a salad entreé.  I love their fries! The service is speedy and friendly.  The food is a bit pricey for what it is but the restaurant is a beautiful venue for a tasty meal."
Jessica R.,"Bronx, NY",0,1,,4.0,12/30/2017,"Went in for Brunch with sister and best friend along with her kids, we were seated at one of the bigger booths which is great because we needed space to put a car seat, we were started with waters and our delicious drinks. My sister grabbed the passion fruit mojito which our waiter Chase raved about! Speaking of Chase, this man made our experience so amazing, truly not only from being super attentive to the table and keeping the water flowing but making sure the baby was happy and comfortable, he was extremely knowledgeable of the menu, and after he heard what we liked to eat he was spot on with the recommendations. People like this make dinning experiences and make people like us want to come back! The chicken Bellagio was really tasty, as always the salmon was nice and juicy and my steak was cook just as I ordered. Would definitely come back and ask to be seated in Chase's section!"
Joey D.,"Tampa, FL",150,336,29,4.0,7/16/2017,"A few friends and I went out the Cheesecake Factory for my buddy's birthday and we had a very good time. Our server came by immediately and was terrific. She interacted and talked with us frequently throughout the night. She also gave us honest recommendations on what to order when we were in between items. I'm not sure how anyone can go here and not be torn between a few items, considering the menu has double digit pages. We placed an order of drinks and an appetizer to start off and everything came out in a timely manner. Drinks here, along with most of the menu, are very pricey for what you get (luckily we had a gift card). My girlfriend looked at the wine list and ordered a $9 glass of wine, which just so happened to be the cheapest on the menu. Both of our entrées were under $20 and were huge. We each got two meals out of them and it was well worth it.  Cheesecake Factory isn't a place that I would come to and simply drink. Drinks are highly overpriced and just not worth it along with most of the menu. We happened to do it right this visit and not go overboard.  Overall, we were happy with our experience. Our food was good and the service was great."
Todd W.,"Tampa, FL",1405,702,282,1.0,6/17/2017,"How exactly does this place stay in business anyway? It had been about five years since I visited any Cheesecake Factory, even though I live across the street from this particular location and walk by it regularly on my way to The Pub or Bar Louie. For some reason, we decided to go there for a late evening dinner on a Saturday night just for convenience. There's just absolutely no value to be had here and the quality of the product is not worth the price. We did not even have an entree, instead splitting a salad with two small plates and one round of drinks that included a draft beer and a weak Moscow Mule that was not even served in the appropriate copper mug. Service was provided by a woman who wore more makeup than the employees at the MAC store inside the mall itself. At least those ladies are selling it. This woman also bragged about how she spends her leisure time acting like a Disney princess. If you don't know, there's people who frequently do this when attending the parks that are not Disney employees. They act like they're part of the attraction, but they're not. They are screaming for attention...just like the guy who comes to a sports bar alone wearing his favorite team's colors and makes a huge production out of anything that happens in his team's game hoping to find a new friend who actually gives a shit. $55 later, I came home hungry, thirsty, poured myself a second drink, made a sandwich and regretted the complete waste of money and time invested in the evening. Thank goodness we did not both order entrees, a second round of drinks and dessert. Clearly a normal dinner here is going to run you around or upwards of $100 and I'd much rather spend that at a place that doesn't feel like it is a half step above a fast-casual lunch spot. I've always said Bern's and Mons live off their overrated reputations better than any businesses in Tampa, but Cheesecake Factory should be the chain representative on that short list."
Tina L.,"Tampa, FL",514,3,,5.0,9/27/2017,Think a place like Cheesecake Factory has no healthy options? Well think again! The Thai  Chicken Lettuce Wraps are super healthy and to die for! Yum! Once again every single day you have the choice to make better choices and this dish has my vote!
Courtney B.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",73,50,25,3.0,6/24/2017,"While I will always love The Cheesecake Factory, this location in particular is subpar. The food is delicious, absolutely wonderful, but I've had several issues here that do not make me want to rush back: - One time there were flies everywhere. They swarmed 4 tables and it was really bad. - I had a very unkind server who ended our lunch by circling the tip suggestion. Service was not good. - I had another server who didn't give us plates for our appetizers (ever) or straws, and she forgot our sauces we ordered with the meal.  - The host is never pleasant and does not greet anyone.  I am confused by these experiences, as I feel Cheesecake Factory puts a lot of effort into training. Perhaps they need to put more effort into it. I will return to enjoy the amazing food, but next time at a different location.  Food suggestions: Cajun chicken littles, corn tamale cakes, turkey club, any salmon dishes."
Kathy J.,"Clearwater, FL",8,37,12,1.0,11/17/2017,"The CCF has gone down down down hill! This place use to be amazing. By now everything is bad, from the service to the food. I don't know what happen to management but they are serious lacking. Let's start of by saying there is something going on with the billing. They purposely don't take meals out of the order so you can get charge extra for it. The wait is super long. Expect to be there for 3 plus hours. Many items on the menu has been taken off. Jamaican pepper shrimp is so salty I almost died from high blood pressure. We will never ever come back."
Christy T.,"Tampa, FL",65,69,21,5.0,5/5/2017,Comma I just love this place. They have such an extensive menu and such yummy choices. Had one of my favorites tonight. Salad as my appetizer and for dinner the Cuban egg rolls. They are so delicious. My friend had one of my other favorites which is the Miso salmon. It is so good.  I know that salmon is good for you and I try to eat it whenever possible. But a lot of times it doesn't really taste all that great. But the Cheesecake Factory miso salmon is the bomb. My sister had the chicken pot pie on the skinnylicious menu which is also really good choice. Of course you get to start off with their delicious brown bread which is so good period I can eat a basket of just that. On top of the delicious food items they also have a great dessert menu. Their cheesecakes are so delicious. My favorite is the red velvet cheesecake. Although the dulce de leche is pretty awesome too. And they have a great drinks. My sister and friend both had the Georgia Peach which is a very very tasty beverage. Although they have really good Mojitos there too I love them all. In addition to the great food and drinks this place is really nicely decorated and has a great atmosphere. You feel like you're doing fine dining. Prices are pretty reasonable as well. And the service is always great here. The wait staff is excellent and they always make sure you're happy with your food. One of my favorite places to eat and I highly recommend it to everyone.
Susan A.,"St. Petersburg, FL",11,62,78,4.0,5/29/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory, of course, has the most delicious cheesecakes in the land! We started off with some decent entrees. My son had their fish tacos, fried cod. Crispy fish surrounded with cabbage and tomatoes. He enjoyed all four! My daughter had a standard chicken avacado bacon sandwich. Served on texas style toast which provided more of a buttery taste than a boring bun. I selected mexican lettuce wraps.  The chicken was a little over cooked and under seasoned, but the salsa added a tiny bit of flavor.  But the star of the meal were the cheesecakes. My son had a compilation of carmel, peanut butter and chocolate.  It was very peanut buttery, but still silky smooth. My daughter's choice was much richer in taste; she had the S'mores. It had sprinkles of graham crackers, melted marshmallows and a huge dollop of whip cream.  So good!"
Zabrinna P.,"Viejo San Juan, San Juan, Puerto Rico",18,12,25,3.0,5/2/2017,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for my birthday dinner with my parents. It's one of my favorite places to eat at but unfortunately for the first time here our service was quite poor.  The waiter was actually not on top of his game there were times where he would forget about us, he wouldn't ask us if we needed refills,  he forgot to give us all the silverware, never asked if we needed more bread... we just felt about neglected lol and it really wasn't that busy the day I went."
Iloveanimals N.,"FL, FL",0,10,,1.0,12/9/2017,"No parking today 12/9/17! Arrived before 1, saw the crazy traffic, so came back an hour later, try #2, got dropped off at Cheesecake Factory (where I had been looking forward to eat all day, hence a second trip by, and was starving by now), I waited in the bar for my husband to park after getting  a pager for a 30 min wait, ordered a drink, only for my husband not able to find parking ANYWHERE. Valet was full as well. Pretty ridiculous when valet lots had spots but they weren't allowing you to park in them and wouldn't take our money for you to park in them for us.  The best part was, right when the the drink I ordered came, my husband called me from the parking lot, so frustrated he said, come back out,  we were leaving because he cannot park the car and it was getting ugly out there. I explained what was happening to the bartender and told him I had to leave - all he did was hand me the bill. I was still expected to pay for the martini, and had I known it was $13 - it wasn't on the menu- I never would have ordered it!!!  Even if he had just said, ""I am so sorry, I can't comp this drink for you, I can't believe the parking today, but I hope you can make it back here again,"" it would have made this sting less.  I understand they are a business and can't be giving free drinks out (esp priced a $13 a pop) and I get that. But I was so disappointed this happened and the guy had 0 sympathy! Instead he told me to take it outside if I wanted while I waited.  I said this is really great, paying for a drink I don't even get to have. Inside I was thinking, I would have enjoyed burning a $20 more. My husband was waiting right outside for me after forever trying to find a spot -  I wasn't going to make him wait any longer or take a glass outside the front of this place! I gulped down a few swigs while the bartender ran my card and had to leave it.  And I still tipped him, since he did have to make it.  Thanks CF, your lack of empathy really let me down today after all hassle, the gas and tolls it took us to get there today for nothing but money spent and a few sips of a cocktail.  Shame on this mall for such horrible parking today and roping off lots people could have parked in!!! I really love this place but after what happened today and the way I was treated, and how embarrassed I felt, I don't think I could ever walk in there again."
Alex H.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",35,125,9,4.0,3/6/2017,"This place confuses me. I feel like they try to make it seem like a 4 or 5 star restaurant and some of the food is priced as such. The atmosphere just doesn't match. The food is what is to be expected, the more expensive dishes are maybe worth it. But bottom line, the cheesecake is just the best. There's just so so many choices and I'm always shocked every time are just how good cheesecake can really be. They don't skimp on the mixins and add-ons. Their signature cocktails are actually pretty good as well.  The location and parking is annoying because it's kinda part of the mall."
R T.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",2,40,42,2.0,6/9/2017,"Disappointing to say the least!  I Went for my birthday as a gift from our son,serving in the Military.  We went between lunch and dinner services thinking it would be a good time, which there was a minimal wait for CCF.  My husband and I were lead to a table on the patio, which was fine the sun was out and not to hot for Tampa.   The problem was they had the portable heaters out and the one next to us was leaking propane and started giving  me a head ache. We asked to be seated somewhere else and the server said she would have to speak to the MGR!!! What?? NOte*** as we could see the patio from the bar, NO manager came nor did they seat anyone at that table Needless to say they never came or the server. So, we left and sat at the bar instead! The food was mediocre for CCF but the service we we received while at the bar was great! We were able to catch a NFL game and have conversation with the other folks sitting there!"
Jim K.,"Tampa, FL",161,251,254,5.0,9/28/2016,We've always had great service here and superb food.  Even the drinks are consistently excellent!! The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and Chicken Bellagio are my favorites.  Don't forget to start with a Strawberry Martini.  It has muddled strawberries!
Patrice F.,"Wimauma, Tampa Bay, FL",31,72,266,3.0,8/7/2017,"Went here for a birthday dinner. Food was ok. The drinks were definitely overpriced but good. Had to get the vegetarian burger. I really wanted the cauliflower ""steak"" but unfortunately they were out. Booooo lol but anyway the waiter was friendly. Food was mediocre. Idk if I'll be back."
Ruth F.,"Ocala, FL",4,17,55,4.0,9/30/2017,"I've been here a couple of times and it's one of my favorite restaurants. I can recommend this place to those cheesecake lovers out there. They have the best tasting cheesecake and their Tiramisu is to die for. Foods are okay, depends on what you order. The only reason I'm giving them a 4 star is that the waiting time to be seated is just way too long."
Emry S.,"Tampa, FL",5,43,153,4.0,9/6/2017,"Awesome Bruleed French Toast! Surprise- The Cheesecake Factory is open Sundays for brunch- 10am-2pm!  Located in the International Mall Plaza, outside the mall, on the Bay Street entrance, plenty of parking, outside entry.  The Cheesecake Factory has something for everyone! They have a massive menu selection - the menu is literally a book. And of course, several of those pages include an array of cheesecakes of all flavors!  I went for brunch with a friend and we both indulged in the Bruleed French Toast - its 2 good sized pieces of french bread that appear to dipped in a creamy eggy custard then baked and grilled so as to form the crunchy crust on the outside. So good! Comes Maple-Butter syrup and a side of bacon or ham!  They have several other brunch items like Eggs Benedict, Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, and Belgian Waffles. If you are not up for breakfast though, they still offer all of their regular menu items!  Service was great for us! Our server did a great job making sure we had everything we needed!  The only drawback for me was the taste of the bacon- it was just not very good and tasted like old oil. The french toast was definitely the star of the dish."
M P.,"Orlando, FL",4,25,46,1.0,10/9/2017,Would not recommend this place due to the bad experience we had. I had family visiting from out of town and they don't have a Cheesecake Factory where they live so I thought what a great idea to take them there! Wrong! We decided to sit outside and it was around 1PM on a weekday so there were very few people there (aka not busy at all). We waited over 15 minutes and no waiter in sight. I had to go back inside to the hostess 3 separate times to ask for a waiter. How embarrassing is that for the out of town guests. Finally over 25 minutes later we finally get a waiter and it took a while just to get waters.  Needless to say it took a while to get the food and forever to get the bill. It took us over 2hrs to eat lunch and we were not counting on that.  Because of that we encountered major traffic after leaving and it delayed our plans for the rest of the day. On top of that the food wasn't even anything special. We never saw a manager and no one apologized for the ridiculous waiting we had to do. Very poor customer service. So due to such bad experience will not be making any more visits to the Cheesecake Factory.
Greg T.,"Palm Harbor, FL",0,10,,2.0,11/21/2017,Disappointed with the food this afternoon at the Cheesecake Factory.  It was probably my error to order fish and chips but it was dripping with grease and the batter was so thin it was peeling away.   So I peeled most of it off and the fish was completely tasteless.  I would prefer a Fillet O Fish sandwich from McDonalds to this and I wouldn't have to pay $17 dollars for it.   I get that people come for the cheese cake but you can't screw people over on their meals.
Leanna C.,"Lutz, FL",0,6,,2.0,11/13/2017,I wasn't impressed!!! It was feeezing where i was sitting and then the a/c unit started dripping but I didn't realize it until my bags were wet. The silverware was dirty and the Food took too long. The prices of the food does not match the flavor.  The cheesecake was good.  The waitress was the best part of my experience.
Alexandra O.,"Sarasota, FL",21,14,,2.0,11/7/2017,"I went here for a late dinner with my aunt from Iceland.  There weren't many people in the restaurant as it was soon closing. The food was pretty good and I got cheesecake to go. As I was enjoying my aunts company, suddenly the lights brightened. As I walked to the bathroom I witnessed a cleaning crew, with trash all over the floor by the tables. I was disturbed to see they started cleaning while we were still in the restaurant. It was very disappointing as I have visited other Cheesecake Factory locations, been there up until closing and they would not brighten the lights and start the cleanup until all the guests were out the door."
Kamilla A.,"Willow Grove, PA",531,19,2,1.0,5/18/2017,"H o r r i b l e to say the least. Just walked in there and my friend and I were made SO uncomfortable that we walked out. We walked in and asked to be seated and asked if there was a wait, the host replied ""yes"" and I simply said ""I don't feel like waiting""--to my friend. She just stared at us and said ""have a great day!"" (In an extremely sarcastic tone) My friend then asked if we could sit at the bar and she replied that high tops are first come first serve. We went over to the bar area and found an empty table that had a set of keys on it. A girl who seemed like she was friends w/ the bar staff and the host quickly walked up and said oh you guys can sit here so we thanked her & sat down... Then she walked over to the host they exchanged conversation and she came back and screamed ""YOU'RE WELCOME!!!"" ...ok I already said thanks... I asked her if she worked here and she said no and then went behind the bar. So...do you work here? Or do you just stand behind the bar and chat up the bartenders? I don't think people who aren't working at an establishment should be behind the bar.... Following that a waitress came to the table and brought bread right away without even asking us if we wanted drinks. I made a comment to my friend stating that I didn't feel comfortable eating there and explained to the waitress the situation...then she asked if we were staying or going and I replied ""I don't know are you guys going to spit in our food?"" ...she replied ""well I'm not going to tell them to, but I don't know what goes on back there in the kitchen"" ....so does that mean that the kitchen sometimes spits and people's food?  The whole situation was handled very poorly by every person we encountered in this establishment. We walked over to Doc Bs and were greeted with a smile, laughs, and kind and polite service. I definitely will not be coming back to the cheese cake factory."

I got the herb crusted salmon and my husband got fish and chips. His mojitos is nice, a little on the minty and sweet side but its OK. The salmon is nice, but its not crusted for sure, more like herb topped salmon. The 30th anniversary will always be my favorite of their selection and that was what we got for our dessert."
Priya P.,"Tampa, FL",45,133,138,4.0,6/6/2017,I know this is a chain but I always enjoy it - the space is huge so never takes too long to get a table - although at night I prefer sitting outside to enjoy they weather. The pastas are always great my favorite is the jambalaya pasta and for apps we like the avocado egg rolls. The cheese cakes are always fantastic so save room for that - red velvet or Godiva are delicious! Personally I'm not a huge fan of chains I prefer independent restaurants but this is a solid place that doesn't disappoint.
Don G.,"Blanchester, OH",0,2,,1.0,3/13/2017,"Food fair, wait was long, service slow, waiter was very rude, put him out for any request you had.  Would not come back or eat at this one again.  Very disappointed."
Amanda H.,"Tampa, FL",59,120,176,3.0,6/15/2017,The food and service was good but the potion sizes have changed. They have gotten smaller and the prices have gone up a little at the same time with my favorite meals.
Judy B.,"Palm Harbor, FL",4,48,6,5.0,5/15/2017,"Went here for Mother's Day. Our wait time, to be expected on a holiday, was 40 minutes -- not bad. I always order a light dish or appetizer so I can have cheesecake. But this time I ordered the Orange Chicken. It was great and the smaller lunch-size portion was very generous. I didn't have room for cheesecake, but there's always the next time! The Factory never disappoints. Our server was very attentive and it was a positive experience all around."
