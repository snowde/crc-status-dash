Dana H.,"Bloomington, IL",0,9,,5.0,4/26/2016,"Always love this place. The food is excellent and even in another state, the service was great and the lunch portions were huge. Will definitely return"
Adrienne W.,"Markham, Canada",197,277,36,5.0,2/26/2014,"I don't normally give awesome reviews to any Cheesecake Factory in general - not because their food sucks, but because I frankly think that the majority of them are overrated.  However, I'm giving 5 stars to this restaurant for SERVICE.   We ordered Potato Bacon tots, chicken fetuccinni w/ sundried tomatoes, and a s'mores cheesecake.  All excellent - although I felt that the S'mores Cheesecake was  a bit too sweet.  The service in general was very laid back, although, I found that on this trip, people are generally more laid back here :P (I'm from Toronto, ON).   While the food was great and comparable to every other Cheesecake Factory, our server, Penny, was EXCELLENT and she's the one who earned these 5 stars at the restaurant.  She was hospitable, friendly, and extremely helpful.  She was able to accommodate to our needs and provide us with speedy service (we had a flight to catch).  She even packed our cake to go nicely and provided us with refills of our drinks to go to the airport.   I have gone to a lot of restaurants and I have to say that Penny has been one of the best servers that I have EVER encountered.  Great waitresses are few and far in between and this restaurant is so lucky to have her!  Keep up the awesome work, Penny!!"
Ric M.,"St. Petersburg, FL",2,20,2,2.0,3/21/2016,"Disorganized, spotty service and the food is just not that good like it use to be.    I had Shrimp Scampi and the Angel Hair pasta was undercooked and clumped.   The smallish shrimp looked lost on the large platter.    It had the feel of a Golden Coral with a wait staff.  I will not go back for a long long time."
Carol C.,"Orlando, FL",81,201,368,5.0,2/17/2014,"Had lunch w/GF today and was sat in Franks section. I was VERY hesitant, but decided to stay put bc of my previous experience, but I'm glad I did.  His service was much better, on point and courteous. Prior to me leaving he did stop me to apologize for the service that he provided weeks (25 days to be exact) prior and that was not typically how he services his customers. I give him props for recognizing the mistake and acknowledging me that he remembered me from that day. Kudos to the server!  Everyone has an ""off"" day, even myself.  (I guess our Yelp reviews are read at the Cheesecake Factory)"
Nikki A.,"Atlanta, GA",117,203,536,4.0,7/16/2013,"I have been to this location countless times. The service is always wonderful. Brunch is so good! I love the Bellinis. The Brioche Breakfast Sandwich is a must, and big enough to share. I have had several of the salads, the Luau is my favorite. One of the best appetizers is the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. My Husband is a big fan of the Peanut Butter, Honey, and Banana milkshake. I love all of the cheesecake, we usually opt for one with some form of chocolate. The menu is about 900 pages long, I look forward to sampling for a long time to come."
Paul P.,"Lutz, FL",99,341,147,4.0,3/2/2015,"Although I am NOT a huge fan of chain restaurants I enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory experience. We went on a Sunday night and the restaurant was really busy.   There was a 30 minute wait for a table.  I found myself frustrated with the lack of space to wait for the table. This probably couldn't be helped because there were just too many people waiting. Once we were seated the waitress was prompt, friendly, and attentive, filling our drinks several times without having to be prompted. The menu if comprehensive and if you can't find something to eat there that you like, you are extremely picky. Everybody in our party enjoyed their meals and of course ordered cheese cake. The cheesecake was terrific. Good service good food great desserts. I recommend The Cheesecake Factory."
Lisbeth F.,"Tampa, FL",0,3,,2.0,7/19/2015,"I usually love eating here, but I'm not impressed with their brunch. I order the simple brunch combo (eggs, pancakes, and bacon). I was extremely upset when they brought the plate and didn't bring pancake syrup. I had to ask a different waiter for some syrup, because ours was nowhere to be found. When the waiter brought the syrup it was not like the regular thick pancake syrup, it was some light sugary type syrup. I couldn't even enjoy it because it was way to sweet and the texture was horrible. I asked our waiter if they had anything else, and he said that's all. He didn't offer if I wanted anything else, he just said that's all they had and left our table.  Needless to say I left hungry and had to pass by McDonald's to get some food!"
C David S.,"St. Petersburg, FL",57,230,321,2.0,1/23/2014,"Over rated.  After a 40 minute wait our seven person party got a table. The ordering process was slow. However kudos to the waitress she was extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu.  Everyone in the party was satisfied with their meals, but no one rated it as a 'wow' or 'spectacular'.  The food is edible and that's all we could say."
Susu J.,"Washington, DC",42,43,42,2.0,2/20/2016,"The service was extremely slow, we waited 45 minutes to get avocado rolls and they were not good, usually it's my favorite dish but today I felt they were fried a lot earlier and heated in the microwave , I couldn't eat them, just disappointed and I think next time I will be there it will be only for cheesecake but not for food ."
Gary F.,"Tampa, FL",82,65,126,3.0,3/15/2015,"Been here plenty of times.  Lots of good to chose from, great variety, like setup of restaraunt.  It's hit or miss here.  Decent thought for being such a large chain. Of course the cheesecake is amazing!!!"
Holly H.,"Tampa, FL",72,34,49,5.0,2/19/2015,"What's not to love about Cheesecake Factory? This is a great place for a date, lunch with friends, meet up  for drinks, or to have a family meal. There's something for everyone on their super huge menu. I usually order their pasta dishes but I swear I've had one of the tastiest steaks ever at a Cheesecake Factory.  DO NOT get me started on the Adams peanut butter fudge ripple cheesecake! I've often daydreamed about the things I'd give up in life in order to be able to eat that cheesecake every week and not get obese. Ahhh!!! Soooooo rich and sooo gooood! I always find the service to be just right. Probably one of my go-to restaurants for life."
Tabby H.,"Land O' Lakes, FL",158,41,241,4.0,10/11/2015,"I'd have to say I love this place. I have ordered so many different things off the menu and not once have I ever been disappointed.  The staff is always great. But I would have to say today was the first time I had a bad experience.  Not qith my waitress or with the food but with the rude host that took me to my table. I decided to take a table that was dirty outside Bc it was the only one in shade. All there was, was some crumbs in the table and the rude host boy decided to drop down the menus and walk away from me without even say anything and just left us there. And also rolled his eyes as he walked away. FYI rude host boy it's part of your job. If you can't perfect being a host and being polite I would maybe suggest a job change. Besides that the waitress saved his day as well as the yummy food."
Tanya C.,"Atlanta, GA",47,24,35,5.0,3/15/2015,"As we were passing through Tampa, FL to show my son the college I attended (UT).  We stopped to have lunch with family members and it was really nice catching up with them...I usually get either the Louisiana chicken pasta or the Jerk shrimp with black beans and rice with mango salsa and plantains...you can't go wrong with that.  Cheesecake Factory is a safe choice for a cheap meal."
Allison N.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",252,688,596,4.0,12/10/2013,"Yes, it's another Cheesecake Factory. No, it's not really special compared to the other ones. Still good though.  Something I really like about this place is that the portions are so big that you can eat it for two or three meals, usually at a lofty price though. I really love the appetizers here, fried mac and cheese is a must. The fudge cake from Cheesecake Factory is to die for and the many varieties of cheesecake are sure to satisfy any sweet tooth!"
James P.,"Apollo Beach, FL",67,459,57,4.0,12/10/2013,"A decent chain place that has a 30-something page menu with nearly everything on it.  Most of it is quite good, too.  Just be aware of the vicious wait times during peak hours.  Dinner waits can be in excess of two hours, and while you can sit at the bar and hang out there, the drink prices will hurt. Prices are a bit high, but the portion sizes are generally huge with a few odd exceptions (burger with fries only comes with a small tin of fries, while a side of fries is an entire basket...  how about a happy medium?).  Service is generally quick enough and friendly enough without being too obnoxious.  And even with such a massive menu, they sometimes change things up - adding a few new items while retiring some older ones.  The classics always remain, though, so get your Factory Burger on a baguette forever.   Although I'm a professional lunchtime beer drinker, I always skip it here.  CF's drink prices are stupidly high, with even the cheap domestic stuff going for $7-8.  Mixed drinks are downright club-priced.   And then there's the cheesecake.  You literally cannot go wrong with a slice, even if you take it home for later.  Always something good here."
Dovy D.,"Milwaukee, WI",3,67,29,4.0,3/7/2015,"Good atmosphere and delicious food, everything I ordered I enjoyed. I'll definitely be back again. Many cheesecakes to try but they're on the pricey side."
Sabrina P.,"Enterprise, AL",0,7,,4.0,9/25/2016,"Our first visit to Tampa, I was looking for a Sephora and the husband wanted food. We were told our wait time we be 40 minutes but it was more like 20-30.Wonderful service and the food was great as well, as always you have to have cheesecake, my husband had the lemon meringue and I had Dolce De Leche, they were both wonderful"
Rachel M.,"Tampa, FL",296,1705,8649,4.0,9/11/2013,"Yum, This is a great location at International Mall. Do you want to eat outside on the patio, or inside in the A/C? It's up to you but they have both. This menu is so diverse. How do they keep up on their wonderful tastes. They do a good job. You can even choose from the skinny menu for less calories. Great. Don't forget your cheese cake, but don't just look on the menu, look in the cheese cake case in the front. Let your eyes check it out, and let your mouth water. The servings are huge here. My husband and I had the chicken madeira. Chicken with a wine sauce with mushrooms, asparagus, mozzarella cheese, served with mashed potatoes. So good. Our cheese cake that we also split was the white chocolate raspberry cheese cake. just the perfect amount of rich and sweetness. Yum. I need to go here more."
Rob G.,"Tampa, FL",64,72,255,4.0,4/12/2013,"Though upon entry it always seems like there is numerous customers waiting to be seated, the wait time is never too bad. In particular on a prime night like tonight, my total wait time was 20 minutes. Upon seating the menu is quite broad ranged as you flip page by page and eat with your eyes, you sometimes get overwhelmed and could never decide on where to start or what do I want for an entree. But fear not, there are some bold flavors and dishes that chefs have taken pride in. So, don't be afraid to try something new on every visit. Specialty cocktails are also crafted with thought and freshness. I think many of their cocktails people remember quite fond in their dining experience. However, these specialty cocktails do come at a pricey rate based on liquor used and juices infused. Tonight I had fried macaroni and cheese in a bed of creamy marinara sauce and topped with fresh grated parmesan. No matter how you spin mac and cheese I always look for that comfort food feeling. This starter definitely hits that note. I also ordered a classic mojito. Upon presentation the clean, citrusy and herbaceous appearance is aesthetically pleasing on the eye. This is one of thee best mojito's out there with crisp and refreshing flavor. For an entree I ordered the miso salmon. Lets just say if you are not or have not been a salmon fan try salmon again for the first time with miso salmon as your entree. Dinner would not be complete without cheesecake so I tried lemon raspberry cream cheesecake. I was out voted at the table, but if you are a fan of tart flavors, this this is your dessert of choice. In the end, a couple drinks later for everyone, made for a pricey meal, but hefty food portions, great company, nice ambiance, laughs and memories makes for a priceless experience. See you next time cheesecake..."
Jason C.,"Portland, OR",97,752,1434,4.0,8/13/2014,Food is generally fine. I've always found it to be decent. They do have long waits sometimes. I also find it curious that sometimes I get this random mix of frankenpasta where I seem to have a mix of all sorts of pasta in my seemingly unipasta dish. I appreciate that they have such a large menu and many options. The healthy choices menu is great as well.
