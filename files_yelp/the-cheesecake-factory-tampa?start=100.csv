Dorene M.,"St Petersburg, FL",132,270,734,4.0,2/3/2015,"Well it's a chain and I'm not big into chain restaurants but their  food is pretty good. I can't say I've always had a great meal, there was one time I ordered chicken enchiladas . They were just ok, not something I would order again. Everything else has been really good, the dish I love and order often is the Tuscan chicken. My favorite.  The service has always been good, they are usually very attentive and friendly. They also are well versed on the dishes and able to answer any questions I've had.  This last trip I tried their cheesecake, I know it's called Cheesecake factory and after 5 visits it's the first time I ordered their cheesecake. Omg it way heavenly, rich but delicious.  Cheesecake factory has an insane amount of items, I'm not sure how they pull it off but they really do a great job."
Matt F.,"McKinney, TX",4,121,63,4.0,9/1/2016,"I have been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory since 1993. Today reminded me why: Consistently great food, service and atmosphere. The Cobb Salad is amazing! Huge, too! I am taking more than half if it to go. Tonya was my server and she was great. Attentive and friendly but not annoying. Lunch is the time to come if you want or need immediate seating. Whenever in town this is one of my go to places. Check it out!"
Mark C.,"Sarasota, FL",27,35,9,3.0,9/16/2016,"Stoped in tonight with my girlfriend Susan for dinner after dropping of my daughter at the airport, Susan ordered the Gluten Free Shepherds pie,  It was very good, I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs the spaghetti and sauce was very good, however the meatballs were cold, I sent my meal back and settled for some cheese cake to go. The manager and waitress were very apologetic and handled the issue with my meal appropriately"
Kristin M.,"Auburndale, FL",44,1,,5.0,8/26/2017,"The manager, Chris, at the Brandon location, went above and beyond to correct a tragic accident for me. I was trusted to keep my brother in laws birthday cake. The Confetti Cheesecake. I forgot it in my car overnight. Chris was able to help me avert the crisis, and was so kind hearted and helpful. I've yet to visit the establishment, but I can assure you, me family and I will frequent the Brandon location from here out, solely based on management and friendly staff. I can not thank you enough for saving the day!"
Emily M.,"Fayetteville, NC",4,84,232,2.0,8/19/2016,Didn't mind the normal Friday night wait. What I minded was slow service once seated and the taste of my dish. Not going back unless I just want a tasty appetizer and a high priced cocktail.
Dianna B.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",847,2344,2388,2.0,8/7/2014,"Let me say this first: I Like Cheesecake Factory, so it pains me not to give them something higher, but when you have a group of 7 people, and the hostess seating them gives attitude, it kind of colors the mood.   We were told our table was ready, so we marched our way up to the podium, a young woman grabbed menus and started to walk off, not saying anything to anyone, so we followed her. There was a general confusion about us because this didn't seem right.  When we got to the destination, I asked ""We were supposed to follow you, yes?"" She actually rolled her eyes and snapped. ""We weren't quite ready for you yet!""  So I was about to have everyone turn around when she gave an exasperated sigh and said ""Ya'll can stay now.. "" and she moved off, shaking her weave.   Look, when you deal with the public, it helps to tell someone. ""If you wait a moment, we'll seat you."" Politeness works. Frankly this girl may have been having a bad day, but her attitude sucked.  Over all, the food was good, the service was spotty. We'd asked for more butter, it never came. A friend asked for the gluten free menu, and waited 15 minutes for it before the waitress had to be asked for it -again-. Another friend ordered two slices of a certain cheesecake, only one was delivered, it was -to go-.  She never came back with it. We ended up having to go to the case at the front of the place and letting them know the delima.   So the service was meh."
Devin B.,"Lakewood Ranch, FL",0,14,2,2.0,9/2/2016,"-INSECT IN FOOD::SEE END- Service was ok. Our server didn't pay much attention to us, just periodically came over to ask if we were ready to order. Various other servers came over with our food when it was ready. The food was good, although the menu is long and intimidating.  The best part of our night was when my boyfriend ordered a slice of cheesecake to share (which he was ecstatic to order) and as we enjoyed it, he took a bite and as he lifted his fork up, a fly-like insect was revealed. I wouldn't eat anymore. When our server came back and we showed her, she just said ""oh. ..ok."" And dropped our check and left.  It wasn't her fault, as she didn't bring us the cake, but some kind of acknowledgment would have been nice! Now I feel like I paid $60 for a nice date at a place that doesn't care for customer service. It makes me not want to spend anymore date nights there.  I am also posting a photo of our cheesecake!"
Michael O.,"St. Petersburg, FL",74,100,117,3.0,7/7/2016,"I hate to say this but I feel like each time we come to this location we seem to have a lesser experience. Our waitress was real nice and inviting but we had to ask to get refills it seemed like she was overwhelmed because she seemed real busy. Our empty dishes were not cleared so our table was chaotic and piled with dishes.  Now the dishes as most of you know are fairly large here, sauces were spilling it was a mess. We ended up getting the buffalo blasts as an appetizer which while very good is still heavily fried. The ranch dressing is some of the best I have ever had. We also ordered he Cuban roll which was very bland and is again fried and almost empty inside. The dynamite shrimp were heavily breaded and bland as well. The miso salmon was good and very consistent.  After we had our 2 ""dud"" appetizers taken off the bill we still paid about $120 for four of us. Which is not a terrible price if everything is good. This place looked like it was steady but not overly busy so i don't feel like there is really an excuse. I have seen this place much more busy in a the past and gotten better food/ service.  I hate to say I will not be soon to return to this location, which is sad since they have always had such good quality in the past and had been one of my favorite ""fancier"" joints to go to. We drive from St. Petersburg and have to deal with quite a bit of traffic to get here.  Sorry guys.... Step it up your ""Yelps"" are showing. (Low rating) like what I did there? Lol I thought it was funny."
Gary B.,"New Port Richey, FL",64,15,16,4.0,5/28/2016,"Super menu (24 pages) got in before lunch menu cut off (5pm), got seated in five minutes, awesome server.  Very fair pricing for the amount of food.  We left with Togo boxes.  No off to the mall to shop 50 steps away!"
Daniela P.,"New York, NY",121,195,100,4.0,5/14/2016,"We were staying at the Renaissance hotel nearby with some family, and while I am not the biggest fan of The Cheesecake Factory, everyone decided this was the spot they wanted!  Here's why I don't like TCF: 1) It is always ridiculously packed. I have never been to a location where I didn't have to wait at least 10-15 minutes. 2) They're pretty expensive, and while they give good-sized portions, it isn't always the best quality.  As I expected, the wait was going to be at least 45 minutes. We put our name down and waited amongst crowds of teens and other families gathering together. Eventually our buzzer went off (we were a party of 7), but we were then asked to wait in another area for a couple of more minutes. We shrugged it off and laughed and were eventually seated at a booth (with an additional chair at the end).  While we perused our menus, our waitress came by to get our drinks. While she was very friendly and attentive at first, she would go on and disappear for long periods of times throughout our meal. To start we ordered a plate of beet and goat cheese salad and some spring rolls. While we waited for that to come out, we munched on warm bread. Their wheat bread is my favorite (and FYI they're totally willing to give you some to go if you ask - don't judge me!).  The starters were good. I only had the salad, but I heard the spring rolls were yummy too.  Eventually we placed our orders. We shared plates (seeing as their portions are always big and we were already munching on appetizers). I shared the herb-crusted salmon which came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Another pair shared the 'Skinnylicious' lemon-garlic shrimp. My younger cousins split the calamari plate and the sliders. The last plate was the chicken lettuce wrap tacos.  It didn't take as long as I thought it would for our food to come out, so that was a pleasant surprise. Before it did, our waitress brought us extra plates and napkins (which was very appreciated).  My herb-crusted salmon was delicious! It was a thick piece, so while it was thoroughly cooked it still was juicy and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were also delicious and the asparagus was cooked well. While I can't really comment on the other meals specifically, everyone seemed to thoroughly enjoy the food. One point: the sliders did look a little bit sad and were mostly bun from what I could tell.  After finishing up our meals, we asked for our check and got two pieces of cheesecake to go - Oreo and Reese's. They were both delicious (I didn't have them now but I've had the Oreo before).  While our server wasn't extremely attentive, she was very friendly and did help us out and the restaurant was extremely busy, so I understand. Other than that, we had great service.  While we were parked at the hotel, parking is easy to find since there's a lot for the mall. The bathrooms were clean.  Overall it was a good meal! The worst thing about it was the wait, but you have to come prepared for that."
Dena P.,"Clearwater, FL",216,349,933,4.0,11/17/2014,"Yum, yum, yum!!! If you haven't already visited The Cheesecake Factory it is a must. The food just gives you the warm fuzzy feeling and there is seriously so much food. You must get the fried calamari, it is one of the best I've every had. All their food is actually all very good.  The only problem is... how do you only pick one item?! I just want to try them all. They have a very big menu from different fusions (asian), a skinny side, great lunch deals and so on. It's impossible to just pick one item. I ended up with the Farfalle pasta and it was delicious. Flavor was on points and the creaminess was not too heavy. The pasta was cooked perfectly (a big deal!). My SO got the Kobe burger and that was also very delicious. I also wanted to eat all of his food. Do not forget about the cheesecake. That's why you're at The Cheesecake Factory, right?  This restaurant does tend to get very busy so there has always been a wait whenever I visit. It's somewhat uncomfortable when they sit you at a tiny two seater tables only two foot away from the next table (or less). Since it's always super busy the wait staff does struggle to get to your table on time. It's not a place for a quick eat because of the wait."
Raf N.,"Tampa, FL",6,107,183,2.0,8/16/2015,"I eat at Cheesecake Factory very often. It's convenient. They are always located in a major shopping center. They have everything from omelet to pasta to Chinese food. And yes, their cheesecake is good. So I came here on a Saturday afternoon after splurging at Louis Vuitton, Hermes, and Lamborghini. Why did I not go to Ocean Prime instead? It was raining and I didn't want to get my Christian Louboutin shoes wet. (I'm kidding) CF is always busy. So busy. Sometimes guests who are waiting ask you if you're finished with your meal. Wth? Anyway, after we sat down we had to wait 5 minutes before a server greeted us. She also didn't give us the complimentary bread (all the other tables she was serving got the bread). Maybe I looked like I was on gluten-free diet. When I asked, the server looked back as if it was my job to ask for it. Look, I understand they are busy but don't give me the sarcastic look."
Dan G.,"Toronto, Canada",62,79,767,5.0,7/26/2015,"Great location, plenty of parking, friendly and fast service and tasty food. The prices are good. One of my favorite locations for this chain if restaurant."
Karen V.,"Lutz, FL",0,1,,1.0,8/7/2017,This was not a good experience and I've heard such good things about this restaurant. Our stuffed mushrooms we're ice cold but they did promply heat them up. The chicken marsala they brought had very hard pasta and  I gave the waitress one to show her manager and seemed to agree but the service started getting worse after that. To make this story short she quickly brought us our bill. I told her you didn't even ask us if we wanted dessert and she said she did. She absolutely did not cause I was looking forward to a piece of cheesecake. Never the less we were so disappointed by then and just payed the bill and left. VERY DISAPPOINTED! I think they should check the quality of the food on the actual plate before it leaves the kitchen.
Fifi H.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",64,58,77,5.0,12/23/2016,This cheesecake factory is so busy you need to show up at least by a couple hours before you plan on eating but the wait was definitely worth it I would definitely go back to the cheesecake factory the food was delicious and the service was great
Horacio R.,"Tampa, FL",0,6,,3.0,1/29/2017,"Nothing too special real basic dining, a jack of all trades and master of none, the mushroom burger was to greasy and the mushrooms were half raw, the philly cheese had a similar problem with the onion the best thing was probably the tuscan chicken with farro and asparagus really tasty. The service was ok but the staff seemed rushed. The cheescake is great which helps this review up to 3 stars. Should try at least once or twice since the menu is so big"
Jia L.,"Tampa, FL",113,62,157,4.0,5/10/2016,"You get really scrumptious brown oat bread, large meal portions and they have so many varieties cheesecake! Thats why I keep coming to the Cheesecake Factory. Also, this is one of the only places I will order a salad from. Their salads here basically redefines salads; they have so many additional toppings and textures on their salads to make it taste so good; I'm not a salad person and I enjoy their Luou salad so much. I gave 4 stars and not 5 because the food and service varies during each visit. I've ordered the same dishes a few times and sometimes they're better than others. But, the cheesecakes and long island here are consistently great."
Erica D.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",4,44,25,5.0,12/18/2016,"This place is one of my very favorites!! Go thete all the time. Huge menu, everything i try is AMAZING!!  5 STAR all the way!"
Stephanie M.,"Jupiter, FL",229,1,,1.0,7/28/2017,"Absolutely terrible!! Just went and was seriously disappointed. Christina was are server and was absolute terrible. Never pre bussed. Took twenty minutes to greet us, twenty more minutes for drinks. Over charger me for my dinner. Took multiple times to bring the right bill. Charged my card twice for one ticket. Asked for a manger, never received one. Never do I have bad things to say about servers due to the fact I'm in the industry but this was just horrible."
Joel H.,"Tampa, FL",247,322,314,3.0,4/18/2015,"It was our regular routine for a few months to meet up with Bob B. and Elizabeth B. somewhere in Ybor late on Sunday for dinner, get a craving for dessert, realize the crepe place was already closed and then make the trek to the Cheesecake Factory for sweets. But recently (with recently being the last two years or so) J-Fur and I have actually wound up at the Cheesecake Factory a number of times for meals (out-of-towners and their fear of trying something new, sheesh). I have to say, despite the fact that it is a gigantic chain, the Cheesecake Factory does a lot of things right. They have an extremely large and extensive menu. This may be overwhelming to someone who is free to eat what they want but for those of us with diet restrictions (vegan, vegetarian, gluten free) this means that we don't have to settle for just a veggie burger (although they do have a tasty version of a veggie burger that includes brown rice, farro, couscous, mushrooms, black beans, and onion). The Cheesecake Factory offers salads, appetizers, main courses, pastas and sandwiches that can cater to the vegan and gluten free crowds. On our last visit J-Fur and I decided we weren't hungry enough to order main courses so we stuck to the appetizers, salads and sides. I went with a side of fries and the avocado eggrolls. Both of these items were pretty expensive. The avocado eggrolls were in the price neighborhood as a lot of the vegetarian main courses that are offered by the restaurant. This seemed like a definite ripoff, until they brought them out. That's when I saw why they cost so much. The portions at the Cheesecake Factory are ridiculously big. I could've (and should've) skipped the ""side"" of fires (which was actually a big basket) and gotten by with just the eggrolls.  The avocado eggrolls are made from avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion and cilantro fried in a crisp wrapper. They are served with a Tamarind-Cashew dipping sauce. I thought the eggrolls were phenomenal. They were super crispy, creamy (thanks to the avocado), bitey (red onion) and the cilantro was undetectable by my tastebuds (thank God!). The only downfall of the dish was that the dipping sauce was way too sweet. Too much tamarind for my liking. Maybe I have just been programmed to want salty with my Asian fusion food, but I kept thinking the entire time about how good it would taste with some soy sauce to dip into. I wound up leaving most of the dipping sauce and just eating the eggrolls plan (I never got around to inquiring about a side of soy sauce).  My wife ordered the Kale and Quinoa salad. It is chock full of kale and quinoa, grapes, sweet red pepper, sunflower seeds and parmesan cheese (which she lovingly got on the side). The salad was tossed with a lemon vinaigrette dressing. Again, expensive. Again, huge. Again, had a really good flavor to it. Loved that a chain jumped on the whole quinoa and kale bandwagon. For the little one, it was pizza (from the pretty extensive kid's menu). She had no qualms about that as she nearly ate the whole thing. If she hadn't loaded up on the free bread at the beginning, I bet she would've finished the entire pizza. There were no desserts for us. J-Fur was too stuffed and I'm holding out for a vegan cheesecake. As soon as they get that, I'm there. I won't go out of my way to visit the Cheesecake Factory, there are too many other amazing places in Tampa. But if an out-of-towner visits and suggests eating there, I won't grumble as loud as I might've in the past, now that I know they have more to offer than just a veggie burger and fries."
