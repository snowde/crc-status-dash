Kim Z.,"Bradenton, FL",33,14,8,2.0,1/11/2017,"This is one of our favorite restaurants but the one at International Plaza has issues. My son ordered a Kobe Burger which he has had many times. This time there was some type of dry seasoning POURED all over it under the top bun. My son couldn't even eat it. We asked the waiter about it and he said ""Yep, that's the way it always comes"". And then walked away and came back with the bill! Never even looked at it the burger! That has never come like that before! Never tried to fix it, didn't offer something else, and didn't get a manager. I immediately sent the corporation an email through their website and they never responded. This is place is expensive! You could at least act like you care! Very disappointed!"
Marion M.,"Lakeland, FL",0,133,,1.0,12/27/2016,"Emailed the Cheesecake Factory on 12-17-16 and never got a response and I had to give them lots of my information. So since they didn't reply I will give this location a bad review but remember the Brandon & Winter Park, Florida Cheesecake locations are really good. My husband and I had lunch at the International Mall Cheese Cake Factory on 12-17 and both of our dinner plates were dirty when we told our waiter his response was ""that happens in the mornings"". My husband cloth napkin was stained and dirty and the spoon that came with his soup had dried food on it. We didn't complain about the spoon or napkin since our server didn't even care about the dirty bread dishes. The food wasn't fresh and if this had been our first time ever eating at Cheesecake Factory we would never return instead we just won't return to this location. To bad the main office doesn't care either"
Lawrence B.,"Owings Mills, MD",15,3,3,4.0,12/17/2016,"Great restaurant,  the staff is excellent and the food is superb of course the cheesecake is out of this world..... I will be coming back, but I wish they wouldn't turn down the lights so low that you couldn't see your food while you were eating, also the doings could be a little stronger not watered-down."
Taylor M.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",223,6,,1.0,11/27/2016,"My boyfriend ordered steak cooked medium and it came out well done, the spinach and artichoke dip was horrible, I was served the wrong drink and we had awful service. HUGE disappointment considering Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. Probably won't be going back to this location."
Robbie C.,"Wake Forest, NC",306,610,1747,4.0,3/21/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is conveniently located near the airport at international mall. Parking can be crazy on a Friday night. We had a 15-20 min wait for a table. Any longer and I would've walked, but I do have some patience.  Haven't been here in a long time so I guess we were due. Was pleasantly surprised at how good our server was. Sorry but I can't remember her name. The menu is filled with pages and pages of choices. I opted for the herb crusted salmon over mashed taters and asparagus. All was good but asparagus wasn't even slightly warm. Told the server and she immediately put in another order which I thought was nice. They came out only slightly warm.  Table mates got the grande burrito which is appropriately named. Will be good for at least 3 more servings. Crusted chicken was enjoyed as well as a huge Mac n cheese on a burger. Prices are high but you will have lots of left overs.  Split a Reese's cheesecake between four of us and had leftovers to take home too. Not a New York style cheesecake for sure but you have to get one, it's the law isn't it?"
Michelle W.,"Tampa, FL",41,5,,5.0,12/28/2016,"This was my first visit at the Cheesecake Factory, and definitely not my last.  We got there at about 5:00 and we're seated right away.  The server, Amanda W., was so friendly and made some great recommendations.  I had Sheila's Chicken and Avocado Salad, which was tasty and more than I could finish.  We ended with a slice of Salted Caramel cheesecake, which was excellent.  Can't wait to come back."
Arlene H.,"Lutz, FL",261,61,113,5.0,4/16/2016,Everything was excellent.  Karly was our waitress and she was very attentive.  Normally we enjoy their cheesecake but today we were stuffed.
Tia S.,"Tampa, FL",710,244,1754,4.0,6/4/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is my go to place when I have a cheesecake craving. With the variety of options available I can always find something to suite my taste.  If you're a fan of rich chocolate desserts the godiva and turtle are perfect. The carrot cake and dutch apple are amazing for those who don't like it quite as rich.  The cheesecakes are awesome, but the ever increasing prices and ever decreasing size of the slices are not!"
Erica G.,"Tampa, FL",152,168,72,4.0,2/12/2017,"Stopped in for a late lunch today with my boyfriend and our four month old and the place was packed, but surprisingly we only had to wait about 10-15 minutes for a table. We were seated towards the back left at a table which was very convenient for us since we had a stroller. I forgot our first servers name, but she was very nice and started us off with drinks and took our order. Once the appetizer came out our new server came and introduced herself. (A shift change had occurred at that time.) After our new server introduced herself we didn't see her again.... Well, we saw her at other tables just not at ours. Our complimentary bread, flatbread appetizer, chicken sandwich and salads came out in a timely manner but our drinks sat empty for quite some time. Finally, our server came by after we sorta flagged her down with a hand wave and stare down (I used to work in hospitality and hated when people would do the flag down) but I felt I had no other option as to get her attention. All within that visit to our table we asked for extra sauces and dressing, drink refills, a to-go box and the check. We would have loved to stay for dessert and get a slice of cheesecake but we didn't want to be ignored any longer. We paid our bill and left."
Carey H.,"Tampa, FL",13,74,36,4.0,5/24/2015,"Sometimes the food is really good, but they are very inconsistent. For a chain restaurant I would expect little difference in a meal, but I've ordered the same sandwich 5+ times and it's very different each time.  The service is good and it's great to order to go. The service is good and the people are friendly.  So many delicious cheesecakes, too!"
Teresa M.,"Melbourne, FL",36,16,4,5.0,10/8/2016,"First off, I couldnt believe how quickly our party of 5 was seated. This is a beautiful and clean restaurant with a sweet and helpful waitress who was attentive to our needs. We love their kids menu items. Enjoyed the avocado egg rolls-try that dipping sauce-and spinach dip to start. Most of our party had some sort of salad with falafel or chicken or a chicken/pasta dish. Servings are generous and we appreciated the leftovers for lunch the next day. If I'm back in Tampa, I would return here and recommend it. Go for a walk through the outdoor/indoor mall after. It's beautiful."
Hwal L.,"Roanoke, VA",24,415,1142,4.0,5/3/2015,"Their Tamale Cakes are what we have always come back here for, and everything else does not matter. They deserve each of my four stars on the Cakes only. Always colourful and tasteful, and perfectly cooked and put together. The cakes are piping hot and crisp, the blend of sauces are cool and fresh, and so is the relish on top. Smash!"
Rebekah T.,"El Cerrito, CA",4554,2003,10334,4.0,11/12/2013,"For a late night dinner, we decided to head to the Cheesecake Factory because in our years of being together, we've never been to one together. We sat at the bar with great company provided by the bartender. He let me in on the little secret that most of the cocktails can be made to be a *SKINNY* cocktail. This is fantastic news, i celebrated with a *skinny* Long Island Ice Tea that was about 150 calories. Hell YES!  For dinner, me and my honey decided to split the steak lorraine, which was a pretty big plate. We often like to share plates or order appetizers because these plates are huge and didn't want leftovers.  Except for the cheesecake. I always want to bring some back with us. We took a slice of the Reeses Pieces Cheesecake and the Kahlua Coffee Cheecake. *mmm* The Cheesecake so rich, it's best to enjoy over spoonfuls and maybe right before bed and then again in the morning. *wink*"
Nicole M.,"Tampa, FL",13,76,11,1.0,2/3/2017,"I highly discourage anyone from ordering to go from this location. I've been going here for years and I always loved this restaurant however I've never tried to go until recently. Today I ordered curbside to go. When the girl answered she said hold on for just a second I'll put you on a brief hold then you can order. Their brief hold is apparently 7 minutes long. When I was about to hang up and re-dial (thinking they had forgotten about me) they finally answered. I quickly placed my order as I knew exactly what I wanted. I also asked to do curbside and they said ok but I realized when I hung up the phone that they never asked me about my vehicle so I'm not sure how they would know who to bring the food out to. They told me it would take about ""20-25 minutes"". I showed up at roughly the 20 minute mark after I hung up the phone and I went inside to let them know I was there since they didn't know what vehicle I'd be waiting in. I paid for my order and the woman said the food wasn't ready yet but she'd have them bring it out to me. Now I understand that it was a busy Friday night but everyone knows the cardinal rule of customer service is to under-promise then over-deliver. (Not vice-versa).  So I waited for about 30 additional minutes in my car (mind you, it's now been 50 minutes since I placed my order and hung up the phone, roughly an hour since I initially picked up the phone if you include the long hold). I finally decided to go back inside. My order was sitting at the counter and they apologized that no one had brought it out to my car yet, she said it just got there.  So roughly an hour after I placed my order I got my to go food. I left unhappy but didn't feel like dealing with the hassle as it was very loud and crowded in there. In the end the food took about 3 times as long as the promised amount of time it was supposed to be ready, which is extremely ridiculous if you ask me. Additionally I rushed home and got home very quickly to eat and my food was cold. So I can't imagine it just had come out of the kitchen when I finally received it. Not to mention, in the half an hour I was sitting in my car, they could have been polite and told me what the hold up was but they did not. Overall, I was highly disappointed with the whole episode. Again, I understand that it was a busy weekend night but staff should be planned accordingly and a restaurant that's been around for this long should be able to give a better pick up estimate and when they do not properly estimate they should be providing updates and/or at the very least, comp my meal. Highly dissatisfied with my experience here. I will certainly not be going back to any to go meals or curbside from this location!"
Vanessa R.,"Clearwater, FL",6,1,1,2.0,4/20/2017,"Surprisingly, the soup was cold!  Apparently they didn't turn the burner on the right temperature... ugh.  Thought a manager might have come by to apologize but no!  The waitress microwaved our soups ... brought them back ... no clue who got whose soup!  Good customer service is harder and harder to find these days."
Marisa H.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",267,112,40,4.0,12/10/2016,"I've been coming here since the day they 1st opened. We don't have a Cheesecake Factory in St. Pete. so its a good 30 minute drive each way from home. Normally I come here for lunch and the wait is never that long, on the weekends usually 15 minutes is normal. What I like about this restaurant is the selection! They have good Italian, really good Cuban sandwiches to a variety of finger foods. Its hard not to come here and not order a slice of cheesecake, usually I order snickers cheesecake but their red velvet cheesecake is to die for. Today we ordered a pizza and smoothies, both were very good but the service was extremely slow, our waitress did not bring a plate for the pizza so all we had were the small plate our bread was served on, she never once came to our table to see if we needed anything, like a plate to eat on Lol. Luckily were very laid back people and did not really care, we were more shocked than angry, but I'm sure some customers would have a shit fit over something like this. I work in one of the busiest Pediatric hospitals in Florida, so patience is key and I guess that I carry patience with me everywhere I go, life is 2 short to complain over every little mistake. When you go to such a popular and crowded restaurant, mistakes will happen from time to time, what really matters is value and quality when eating out and I'd say The Cheesecake Factory has both."
Jana A.,"Barbing, Germany",1,4,2,5.0,4/24/2016,I'm a big fan of cheesecake factory! each slice of cake is a pleasure. everything else is delicious. try it out and I hope you will love it as much as I
Camille P.,"Lexington, KY",25,65,14,1.0,1/15/2017,"This has to be the worst location that I have EVER dined at. First off, my party and I waited for 10 minutes before a server even showed up to take our order. Meanwhile I stopped another waiter and asked for the manager. The manager apologized and offered to take care of our appetizer and our drinks. I thought that this was nice and it would rectify the issue with the wait but this was just the beginning. We ordered our food with a server that acted like he was afraid to stay by our table longer than 3 minutes. The food took almost 30 minutes to come out! The problem was that they made a mistake with my meal and had to recook it but instead of someone coming to explain this to us, they just made us wait. We complained to the manager again and he agreed with our concerns and gave us our meals for free. We didn't eat them there we just asked that they be made to go. I wanted dessert but was so displeased with my visit there I decided to just leave. The worst experience ever and I will never return to this location. The service was unacceptable for paying customers. And to think I used to love going to The Cheesecake Factory."
Samantha M.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",82,206,12,4.0,3/27/2015,"Chain restaurants are a dime a dozen...but CCF always has good service and amazing cheesecake.  It's hard to stay away from that cheesecake...really.  :) Their food isn't the most gourmet, but it's good.  Big portions...way more than I need...and although I wish the menu was a little healthier what restaurant is realllllly that healthy anyway?! I only have two complaints about CCF (and I am talking about any of their locations)...1. The menu is HUGE...way too many option...I find myself staring at the menu for way too long trying to figure out what to get. (Sometimes less is more.) 2. The floors are allllways so dang slippery...definitely not for dates when a woman would wear heels.   Otherwise, we like coming here for a good but cheap meal...especially when shopping over at the mall.  It's a perfect stop!"
Hope K.,"Gainesville, FL",0,7,,1.0,4/22/2017,"Ordered a to go order from this location and had terrible customer service. We waited at the 'pick up' location for over 20 minutes and when we asked other staff for help, they told us to continue waiting as the staff who was SUPPOSED to be helping us was apparently in the back. I stand here now as I continue to wait. Ridiculous and upsetting. I will never return and will advise all others to stay away from this location"
