Christina G.,"Tampa, FL",1322,988,1475,4.0,12/13/2015,"I've come back to this Cheesecake factory a couple of times just to get cheesecake.  I love how nobody ever judges you for just coming in to eat a giant piece of cake.  I love the peanut butter one.  I always get that with a giant amount of whipped cream.  You'll leave in a sugar coma, but it is so worth it."
Taylor A.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",28,97,33,3.0,3/15/2016,"A-OK is exactly how I'd describe The Cheesecake Factory. Pretty dang good, but nothing you can't find elsewhere. There's just nowhere else you'd find ALL those options in one. I've had mixed service experiences here, which is what's keeping this at a 3 star review, but it's still a place I love to visit every once in a while. That may just be because I have an addiction to cheesecake, though. If you've been to a Cheesecake Factory, then I don't need to explain the decor. It looks like every other cheesecake factory out there (Eye of Sauron included). Unfortunately the design of this particular location has left them with almost nowhere for people to wait for their table, resulting in having to stand while you wait almost every time, and also resulting in there always being a large, loud, difficult to navigate crowd directly between the door and the hostess stand. Like I said, service here has been mixed. Most of the time it's been as good as you should expect at any big chain restaurant, with attentive but busy waiters and relatively fast food delivery. This particular location seems to be really skimpy on the bread, which is unfortunate because Cheesecake Factory is one of the few places that has table bread good enough that I let myself have some. And once or twice I've gotten particularly slow service, or had waiters that seemed to forget for about 20 minutes that our table was even there. It's bound to happen occasionally but it's always unfortunate when it does. The food at the Cheesecake Factory is probably one of the better options when it comes to Big Chain restaurants. The variety definitely helps, as there's almost definitely SOMETHING on the menu that you want. And the fact that they have a Light Fare menu is always great for someone watching their waistline like me. It's also nice to find that the Light fare options still give you a hearty meal, unlike at a lot of places where salads or half portions are your only chance to stay under 1000 calories.  Price is, unsurprisingly, the same as every other Cheesecake factory. Due to having higher quality food than most chains, it's more expensive than some, but only by a dollar or two. you can definitely have a reasonably priced dinner here with no problem at all. Just make sure you get some cheesecake. It should be a crime to go to a place called the Cheesecake Factory and not have at least a bite of cheesecake. Just... come on. And if you don't want some, get some for me."
Foo D.,"Alexandria, VA",2,14,,1.0,3/26/2017,"Worst Cheesecake location I think I've been to yet and I've been to locations all over the country.  The floors were greasy and slippery as I walked to the restrooms.   When we arrived at our table there were crumbs all over the table, despite having silverware, bread plates and glasses set on the table.   Upon closer look there was bits of found on the plates and the silverware wasn't clean.   I asked my sweetheart if we should leave, he said we should stay.   Our waiter brought us all new place settings and wiped our table while his manager watched.  I appreciated their effort to get the table clean and to provide us with clean dishes.   However, I saw that the table was still greasy even after our waiter wiped the table.  This place needs a good cleaning with soap!   ...Soap on the dishes, soap on the tables and soap on the floors.  When our food came our my rice wasn't cooked and was like hard pellets, gross!   It seems this restaurant is not well run, not clean, and not good at cooking food.   I'd recommend you take your time and money elsewhere."
Matt C.,"Hampden, MA",0,5,3,1.0,5/20/2017,Manager was very rude and had zero accountability.  they lie about wait times. This is the trashiest Cheesecake Factory I have ever seen.
Mark C.,"Washington, DC",27,52,6,4.0,10/25/2015,"I will say I have had my fair share of thoughts negativity towards CheeseCake Factory, primarily the INSANE menu that never seems to find an ending . I drove my GF INSANE because I had no clue what I was feeling, or what to get. I will avoid this joint if I can because of the menu.  The quality of the food is on point. Great. Will make another mention as the servers never seem to know or be on the right page in terms of recommendations or suggestions. My man had no idea what he biggest portion entree was or what to get. No big deal but being a waiter is a package- you must know the best on the menu no matter how big it is. My last two visits have been the best. Enchiladas and the Southwest Grilled chicken sandwich were fabulous. I technically give this place a 3.5 but again with the teacher rule I give them the bump to 4 stars. I just don't see myself going there though. It's way too much for me personally, but with a big group or family event you might be able to compromise if you don't know where to eat, because this place has a lot of solid options."
Lynne F.,"Damascus, PA",119,6,,2.0,4/27/2017,"Bad, bad day at the Cheesecake Factory. We got seated by one waiter, drinks taken by another ""filling in"" until our totally overworked server finally took our order 20 min later. There must have been a managers' conference here today, because at least 4-5 men in ties stood around conferring, but not actually doing anything. My companion is vegetarian, and was absolutely RAVING about how good her Guacamole Salad was... until 6 bites in, she found a piece of turkey in the salad. NOT COOL! The server was efficient & quickly brought another & asked if a manager had  come over? No. Still they stood around in conference. I expected that salad to be comped off the bill BUT NO! Instead they offered a free dessert. Definitely NOT COOL. It will be a while before we come here again."
LeeAnn T.,"Lutz, FL",0,5,,1.0,4/23/2017,"First of all, we had not been to this restaurant in quite some time and now I can remember why.  The parking there is so so bad.  Handicapped spaces are almost nil.  We got there at 12:20 pm on Sunday.  We placed our name, and it was withing 8 min. they took us to a seat.  Near the bar.  We ask if there was any other seating, because a small child and baby was very close to the table they were about to seat us in.   In a very rude attitude this blonde ponytail host stated after all you know we are a family restaurant.  We told her we did not mind waiting longer if she could see if there was something else.  About 5 min. she came back and walked us to the far end of the dinning room, with the domed ceiling, and sat us there.  As we looked around, there was 10 small children seated in there.  As we passed other places in the dining area, there were several that did not have small children and echos of noise.  We feel that she purposely sat us in there because of our request.  One mother was putting a napkin on her head to entertain the crying child, and others clapping talking loud etc. to entertain them who  were just as unhappy.  As two left in came more. It was like the child care area of this place. Our time there we counted 12 children.   There was only 2-3 tables that did not have a kid at it making our dinning very unpleasant.  We ordered drinks and appetizer.  It came at  good timing.  Orders were placed at that time.  We did not think that we ordered anything that would take 40 min. to prepare but it did.  All the time sitting here and enduring the crying, unruly children of others.  As big as this place is you would think that there could be one area that children & parents could be seated so they could equally enjoy all the crying kids together and not ruin everyone's dinning.  This  eating facility may want to consider separate seating areas for the above reasons.  We considered this a waste of time and good money on food and service which was average at best."
Sheryl K.,"Tampa, FL",0,5,,1.0,10/21/2016,"Tonight I ordered take out. My Santa Fe Chicken salad is no longer available so I tried the tostada salad. Terrible. The bakery attendants didn't include bread, and the salad wasn't even prepared completely. No one checked. I called to voice my displeasure. The person who answered the phone was not understandable. No one cares. What was once my favorite restaurant I will never visit again."
Bal N Shawn H.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,20,18,2.0,9/27/2016,Cheesecake Factory used to be really nice. Ate at the Tampa restaurant. Service was generic. Its sad The Cheesecake Factory brand has gone the way of most chain restaurants. Inferior food quality and mass produced flavor. Cannot recommend and won't be going back.
Michael Z.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,140,,3.0,2/28/2017,"The ""avocado rolls"" and cheesecake offerings were delicious. However, many of their entree items were simply too rich and overly-decadent to enjoy beyond a few bites."
Keyser S.,"Port Richey, FL",0,38,,3.0,4/25/2017,"Fish tacos were awesome!!Cheesecake was awesome!!! Waitstaff was awesome!!! So why 3 stars. Rice,blackbeans and fries were cold and for 2 people to have lunch was 65 w/tip. They have changed their menu. No onion rings or pretzel chix anymore. We sat in the bar otherwise it was a 45 min wait for a booth. Perhaps togo is a better option but prices are still high compared to most."
Meaghan A.,"Orlando, FL",47,120,13,3.0,10/17/2015,"Mehhhhh.... my friend and I popped in for a girls lunch and to be honest I wasn't very impressed. We had the mini corn dogs as an appetizer and the dough wasn't fried long enough so it was a bit raw in the center. We also ordered the fried mac and cheese appetizer which I sent back because it was extremely salty. We both ordered the pizza/salad lunch combo which was good, nothing spectacular but decent. I know lots of people love the Cheesecake Factory but I don't know, it seemed pretty overrated to me :-/ Maybe the dinner entrees are better."
Thomas Z.,"Tampa, FL",1,14,3,5.0,2/21/2016,"It's really good . If you want to eat a good burger , pasta , or pizza this is the place for you!"
Kimberly N.,"Spring Hill, FL",0,144,118,2.0,7/25/2016,"Went here for lunch the weekend of 7/23/16. Received a kids meal for my child in which the chicken was overcooked(dry to the point of being inedible)and the green beans were nearly raw with no seasoning whatsoever. Mashed potatoes were fine. We told our waitress about the issues and she basically said she would tell the kitchen, and that sometimes it's hard to get things cooked right. No offer to redo the order, no offer to comp our child's meal. Disappointing and a waste of money."
Faizal E.,"Tampa, FL",369,105,118,4.0,11/14/2015,"I don't normally review chain -- but this was a really good experience.  I am heading out, but this review will be short: - Their appetizers are on point. - I asked for my Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp to be as spicy as they could make it, and they underpromised and overdelivered. Heading out to the Epcot Food and Wine Festival!  Will update review!"
Sara S.,"Tampa, FL",314,415,1671,2.0,2/8/2013,"Cheesecakes = Great! Everything else = Not so great :-( After years of supporting and defending The Cheesecake Factory, I'm sad to say I had my last meal there last night. We're only taking cheesecake to go from now on. My husband is thrilled he won't have to suffer through another mediocre meal and it's bittersweet I won't have to deal with incompetent staff and a slow kitchen, because I enjoyed the anticipation of knowing I would soon be indulging in what I think is the best creamiest cheesecake...but it's not worth it.  The menu is just too big for the average waitstaff to manage and apparently, the restaurant is too large for the kitchen to keep up with. The last few times I've eaten there they delivered the wrong food approximately 20-30 minutes after being seated.  By then, I'm starving and irritated. My husband finished his dry pork chop and overly salted and oiled spinach long before my correct salad (simple salad!) arrived....exact same thing that happened last time except my husband was eating some other entree hoping he'd find something he'd like in their catalog of food.  He has literally tried dozens of things and everything is either bland, dry or salty.  My favorite was the skinny pear and endive salad, but they changed the once drinkable salad dressing to a gooey, gelatinous goop, and they can't seem to deliver it right. The corn cake app and lettuce wraps were pretty fail-proof items too, but once again, the wait time for the kitchen and wait time to correct the item isn't worth the stress b/c chances are from the time the words leave your mouth and travel to the wait staff's brain and into the computer system, something will get miscommunicated. Order a cheesecake to go and enjoy your day!"
Patty S.,"Tampa, FL",46,35,4,2.0,4/26/2016,"My friend loves the Asian pear Martinis that is pretty much the only reason we go. This is the second time in a row our lunch took 45 minutes to be served and wasn't made right. We made no modifications and the kitchen still could get it right. Tony ordered a turkey burger and they forgot the sautéed mushrooms. He asked our server for them and after 15 minutes he just ate it without. When he finished here comes the mushrooms. The server said they were having problems in the kitchen, which is the excuse every time. I think we need to find a new place to hang out. It's not worth the aggravation for a martini. The last time we both ordered omelettes and they were extremely over cooked. Can't believe I wasted $42 there"
Shoba R.,"Tampa, FL",96,71,257,5.0,7/26/2015,"I was very satisfied with the service at the Cheesecake Factory on west shore. I had a party of 14 people when I called to determine the process of making sure we get a table, they were extremely helpful. Cheesecake Factory doesn't do reservation so they recommended that someone from the party come in about 2 hours earlier and check in. They were very accurate about then estimated wait time. The dinner was set for around 8pm one guest went and checked in at 6pm and were seated around 815pm.  We had a very kind and helpful waitress who made the whole dining process very seamless.  I usually order the Thai lettuce wrap or the steak Diane which are both amazing but this time I tried the chicken bellagio which was a little too salty for my taste. But some people might like that.  Overall, great dining experience could not have been happier. Very happy that they were able accommodate such a large party."
Gaganpreet S.,"Tampa, FL",2,12,12,4.0,4/3/2015,I went here for the first time on my birthday party and found the menu to be pretty exhaustive. I had heard from my colleagues that if you don't find anything on their menu won't find anywhere else. I found that absolutely true.  I ordered for Herb filled salmon and it was served with mashed potato and asparagus which was nicely served and was delicious.  Giving 4 stars as found the prices to be a bit on the higher end.
Mark T.,"Land O' Lakes, FL",2,5,1,1.0,10/4/2015,"Do NOT eat here. This is the second time i get food poisoning from this location. Their kitchen is not cooking their food properly, or is mishandling peoples food. I want to rate this location lower but i cant. Please do yourself a favor and eat somewhere with clean food."
