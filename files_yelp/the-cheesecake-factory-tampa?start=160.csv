Heather S.,"Tampa, FL",423,266,842,4.0,7/18/2015,"This is one of those places you come to for a major cheat day! Always familiar with so many options there is something for everyone. Even though there are so many options I always end up eating the same thing. I guess I am afraid to try something new because I come here when I just want to eat something I know I will like and that will be good and glutinous. I always get the house salad to start,BBQ burger, sweet potato fries (extra charge!), and Adams peanut butter cheesecake. We came here on a Saturday night for our girls outing and this is the perfect place to pig out have drinks and laugh. Plan ahead because on a busy weekend the wait can be 30-45 min. I got there before everyone to plan for this and we got our table within the time agreed. Service was fine. I tried my friends red velvet cheesecake but I will just go with my regular Adams peanut butter. The red velvet was underwhelming to me. It was good but it didn't scream red velvet. This is why i don't deviate here lol When is want something familiar I come here. There is nothing overly special about this place so I gave it 4 stars."
L J.,"Palm Harbor, FL",0,2,,1.0,3/11/2017,Food was cold. Service is extremely slow. I would give this place 0 stars if I could.
Kevin K.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",1,23,3,2.0,1/31/2017,"Dynamite shrimp app was good. Chicken parm sandwich was overcooked and dry. Ordered a side of marinara to make it more edible. Good bun, however. Supposed to receive a side salad, but received fries instead. Finally got the salad halfway through the meal. Service was average at best. I didn't bother to take the other half of my sandwich home as I knew it wouldn't be good leftover. I don't feel I got my $26 worth..."
Tony G.,"Riverview, Tampa Bay, FL",84,7,2,4.0,3/25/2016,"Today, 6 of us from GTE Financial decided to spend the day completing the 'Random Acts of Kindness' challenge.  We started our day at here and had a great meal together while completing a couple of ours tasks like buying the lunch for a couple sitting alone. Madeline was a wonderful server for us!!"
Ammy H.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,5,,1.0,6/5/2016,So I've decided this place is not even worth sitting down for. Second time I've been here and neither time has been pleasant. First lets start with the miserable hostess who didn't say one word to us. And who clearly hated her job. Then on both occasions our servers were just as miserable not chatty at all. Not even a hey hows it goin. Didn't get bread till after the appetizers. Never got refills on our water. They messed up my girlfriends salad. We never even got a sorry for that. Mind you this was a Wednesday afternoon. So its not like they were crazy busy or anything. The only thing good about this place was the drinks and food so at least they got that goin on..the only reason I gave them 1 star is because of the repeat shitty service. Everybody knows the cheesecake its self is always on point. So keep that up.
D. A.,"Tampa, FL",34,49,246,4.0,5/7/2016,"Not too long of a wait. Overall food was ok, I've had better quality at Cheesecake Factory in the past. The taste of the food here here is inconsistent. I've ordered the terriyaki chicken previously and thoroughly enjoyed it but another time that I ordered it, it just didn't taste good. I opted for the pasta today and it was just alright, I would've liked it better if it wasn't as greasy. In the end, I gave 4 stars because we got good service, yummy drinks, the bread was delicious as always and  the cheesecake at the end makes everything ok."
Crystal H.,"St Petersburg, FL",435,435,1503,2.0,11/5/2012,"The 2 stars are for this location only. I normally love the Cheesecake Factory, but the International Mall location always seems to mess something up. They also have horrible seating and we are normally seated practically on top of strangers. I have also noticed the slippery floor someone else mentioned and almost fell once.  My visit yesterday was pretty awful. My menu was covered with chunks of food (eww..). Our waiter seemed to be on his A game until our food arrived. My Husband ordered Jambalaya and was brought Chipotle Chicken. We had to wait about 10 minutes for our server to come back from the kitchen. When he arrived he basically called my Husband a liar and said that he ordered the Chipotle Chicken (which is not even something my Husband would consider from the menu), but agreed to bring the correct dish. I think someone saw that I was upset and the manager came and apologized (but did not offer anything to make it better). My Husbands correct food didn't arrive until after everyone else was done.  They are getting 2 stars based solely on the fact that the food is so darn good."
Sara J.,"Riverview, FL",43,98,410,4.0,7/26/2014,Waited 45 minutes to be seated!  We walked around so really it felt liked 15 minutes.  Appetizers: avocado rolls 3/5 the sauce was ok 3/5.  Fried calamari: good. 4/5. The sauces: 2/5. One was literally mayo and relish and more mayo. The other tasted like cheap cocktail sauce.  Drinks: mango mellow: heavenly... Enough said! 5/5. Mai thai: 5/5.  But both very pricey for chain drinks....... Yo sorrrrry.  Entree:  Miso salmon with brown rice. We both loved the salmon. It was his first time eating salmon and he loved and he would order this dish! I didn't really like the brown rice. Salmon 5/5. Rice 3/5.  Parmesan chicken pasta. Wow! 5/5! So goood! Yum! The pasta was perfectly cooked and the spiciness was just perfect! Omg! Let's go back!  The complimentary bread: forget the white bread.... Just ask for the multigrain one..... Yummy..... Heading back now .....
Mel K.,"Tampa, FL",4,29,10,4.0,1/5/2016,"I have eaten at many CF across the country.  They are all the same... They look the same, the food is the same, even the wait for a table is the same... That's a good thing, you know what you're gonna get before you go.... This location is no different.  The food is very good not great, the desserts are great.... The service is always good.  Nothing more needs to be said....."
Gary L.,"Whispering Pines, NC",8,5,,4.0,8/3/2016,"We have been travelling for the last two months and frequented this restaurant at several locations during this time. The food is good, not great, as is the service. The main detractor is their high prices. But they have a great deal more than just cheesecake, so definitely worth giving a try!"
Olivia R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",249,48,22,5.0,7/18/2016,"I love this location of the Cheesecake Factory. I have visited numerous times but have not come across service like I had with our server Quintin in a while. Quintin was extremely knowledgable about the menu, had great food/drink suggestions, he was patient and had a good personality. I really appreciated him yesterday and felt the need to give him a shout out. Thanks again!"
Thu P.,"Tampa, FL",0,6,,2.0,2/18/2017,"I wanted to love the experience so badly but it was just so awful. There were fruit flies swarming my food. I didn't love the fact that my server took my order with dirty dishes in her hands either. A fruit fly landed on my table and my server killed it with her hands, this grossed me out a bit considering the fact that my silverware was set up lying in the table. I ended up getting really bad food poisoning and regretting the visit. The Cheesecake Factory back at where I'm from was so elegant and so professional. I was very disappointed after visiting this one."
Jeffrey E.,"Tampa, FL",0,26,3,5.0,8/17/2016,"Awesome happy hour and fast service. Julie the server did a great job. I know we were a just a couple doing happy hour appetizers but Julie was giving the same attention she would a party of 8 ordering entrees. Great job Julie and great job management. Thank you for making our experience fun. We ordered the avocado egg rolls, chicken sliders and hot dog. The strawberry lemonade was great. Love this chain."
Mailoha A.,"Tampa, FL",518,567,9992,3.0,5/5/2015,"I had dinner at this location last night. Our waiter was great - very attentive and friendly. Unfortunately our bread was not fresh and our appetizer (avocado egg rolls) were not as good as they usually are but my dinner plate was good (Thai glazed salmon). I also had cheesecake, of course :) The Snickers one was not good, I would not get it again. It was also a really small slice. The Chris' Outrageous was very tasty."
Mary M.,"Thonotosassa, FL",37,3,,1.0,8/15/2016,"My family and I went in last night for my son's birthday. I knew we would wait and that was fine. So after sitting down, drinks and appetizers took quite a while. We made a point to put in our dinner order at the same time as our appetizers. At least 45 minutes to an hour later our food arrived, separately. Not by our server either. Food was mediocre. The server could have been a little more attentive. I even told him that I worked in the restaurant industry. I knew the bill was going to be high,because everything is extremely overpriced. However, the drinks we ordered had no price next to them. So $46 of the bill was for four drinks. Ridiculous. We sat down at 715 PM and left at 9 PM. We will not return for average, overpriced, mediocre service and food."
Anna D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,45,,1.0,6/28/2017,"Normally I love the Cheesecake factory. There is something for everyone and the desserts are beautiful. Our family has been to Cheesecake factory restaurants all over the US. This particular Cheesecake however fell short on just about everything, indeed it was the dirtiest, worst Cheesecake Factory we have been to. To begin with we were served wine in a dirty wineglass, with some other customer's lip marks on it. I had to wait ten minutes for a new glas, that was moderately cleaner, still not that clean. Second, we were served old, stale, congealed macaroni and cheese (you know, with that top layer that food that is forgotten out gets after a long time standing around). Rather than apologize, the waiter started arguing with me about it. Seriously. Then we had an overdressed, as in drenched, inedible sallad. At this point we talked to a manager, who did apologize, but after that crickets. We were left alone, Completely. Our waiter disappeared, no on cleared our table, no one came to see us.  We waved and waved yet we were ignored. Finally we had to get up and go find the manager again to get the dessert order in. At this point the original waiter is back, none the better, he is grumpy and unhelpful and he completely ruined our sons birthday. Nothing at this place is what is should be. While I am at it: the fried zucchinis were overcooked, almost burned, dark brown, served with yet another congealed item, the normally super delicious  sauce. Our wantons were cold. The wings, normally the best thing ever, were dry and not spicy what so ever. We didn't bother telling anyone about anything else that was sub par at this point as we didn't feel any one cared. Oh, and the restrooms...they need to be cleaned. badly. Our son had been looking forward to this for weeks, and he was so disappointed with his lunch."
Virginia G.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",286,788,879,4.0,3/26/2013,"I see a lot of bad reviews for this place but my experience was actually quite nice.  Went on a Monday evening about 9:00 and waited about five minutes for a table for two. Ordered a couple Stellas, why yes we will have the 22oz size! Took a few minutes to come but server was really busy and very appologetic so no biggie, it took me that long to figure out the menu anway.  Then ordered some chicken nachos. Wow, that plate was huge! More then two could eat, Although we did prove formidable opponents.  My friend had a monster burger for dinner, don't know what it was called, but it was huge. I had the banh mi tacos, delicious little critters with some nice crispy/spicy/sweet pork and uber fresh toppings. Quiet noshing from my friend tells me he enjoyed his meal as well.  I don't know what the total bill was as my friend grabbed the tab but the food prices looked really reasonable, especially for portion size.  Don't forget to hit the cheesecake counter for a slice on your way out (Where I found my friend drooling over the case when I returned from the ladies room) 15 different cheesecakes enough for you? Is there such a thing as too much cheesecake? I'd have to argue that point. Would I come back here? I'm already planning on it!"
Terry M.,"Clearwater, FL",1,32,,4.0,7/24/2016,"I used to love this place, but over the years it seems to have gotten a little commercial. The food is still good, but it seems like it is more pre-prepared than it used to be. But, on the bright side, the cheesecake is still to die for!"
Lindsey B.,"Tampa, FL",14,3,1,1.0,7/22/2016,If 0 stars were only an option... I have been to this location two times and both times experienced horrible (or lack there of) service! I am always willing to give a place a second chance but I would recommend staying away from this location and go to the one in Brandon. Where you actually are greeted when you sit at the bar vs. sitting and staring awkwardly at the congregation of servers standing around staring back at you and then eventually deciding to come to your table just as you are ready to call it quits and take your disposable income somewhere else. As a whole this is a good restaurant but this location is garbage.
Justin D.,"Tampa, FL",24,79,136,3.0,3/16/2015,"I've been going to this Cheesecake Factory location many years now and I got to say, it's starting to lose its luster.  The food, while yummy and filling, is never consistently presented well. And unless you get a pasta dish, everything just looks thrown on.  The big factor for me was the lack of quality service. I felt like my group was labeled as those college kids no one wants to take care of... Which I can emphasize with because they can be loud and rowdy, but with server experience under my belt, I know it's all about how you approach people that gets you good customers. The service I experienced was ""Great, a bunch of young people who probably aren't going to tip me, so why even try?"" Plates and cups were literally just dropped onto the table and the server would walk away as fast as possible. 4pm on a Monday night so I don't buy the ""restaurant being busy"" excuse because I could just tell by watching the servers, it wasn't busy at all. She would talk polite when speaking (only if spoken to) but her blunt actions clearly spoke louder to me.  Also~ my dynamite shrimp appetizer took 25 min to get to me. For those who don't know, it's just small battered shrimp with sauce on the side...  Honestly Cheesecake Factory is just a good place to pay a lot of money to be stuffed. I wouldn't classify it as fine dining because the way the plates are brought out, you can see the lack of passion put into it. Accompanying this is not the best of service either."
