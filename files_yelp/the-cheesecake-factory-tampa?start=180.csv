Ann R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",62,101,234,4.0,8/29/2015,"Other than the wait for a table and the price of the cheesecake, there simply isn't anything not to like about the Cheesecake Factory! The food is always delicious, the atmosphere comfortable, and I've never had poor service. In fact, most of the servers have been downright hilarious, which tells me that they are happy. I like that. Nothing worse than a grouchy server. :)"
Ed S.,"Largo, FL",0,14,,1.0,7/8/2016,"Food was actually good, but took too long to get it. But the biggest thing was when I got my 24 oz beer at first glance it looked under 24oz (I know my volumes). I asked the waitress to confirm it was in fact 24oz and she insisted it was (of course, she is given whatever the bar prepares for her, and she knows that glass size as the 24oz size). BUT, hold on there, just a second, I was not done. I measured the inside dimensions with a tiny millimeter collapsable ruler which I have on my key chain (yeah, freak thing), and when I got home I calculated volume using some calculus along with geometry (I am a scientist, and do this stuff all day long), and dang, the glass contained ONLY 22.1oz!! Sheeesh! And that was up to the tippity top edge- they stop the fill about 1/2-3/4"" from top edge usually! So I got even less! I wrote the restaurant about this and complained (e  mail from their contact us page) about a month ago and so far they completely ignored my inquiry apparently, as I got no e mail reply. Bad Cheesecake factory!! Shame on you! They are cheating beer consumers. Beware of your beer (or even soda, wine etc) orders!!!"
Jessica S.,"St Petersburg, FL",81,186,311,1.0,3/21/2016,"I will start by saying that we use to love the Cheesecake Factory. The quality and service has taken a serious nose dive. We went here for lunch today. My wife got a salad that came with no dressing. She asked for salad dressing and the server said with an irritated voice ""you want MORE dressing?!"" She told him there was none at all, so yes. I had the chicken avocado bacon club. Please see my picture. It was pretty much all tomato. It was suppose to have an herbed mayo but was completely dry. The fries were cold, soft and overly salted. The iced tea was so sweet it was not consumable. I asked the waiter to add some not sweet to my cup so I could drink it and instead he just drops a cup of unsweet at the table and walks off. At the end he was pushing cheesecake. He could see we hardly ate a bite of out $45 lunch and said nothing except to ask me 3 times why I didn't want cheesecake. Will never go back again."
Lena L.,"Manhattan, NY",35,424,30,1.0,2/25/2015,"This is a chain so there is a level of consistency you expect. I expect an oversized three star experience in a certain atmosphere.  We had the worst service experience for our party of 6. We arrived and they told us 45 minutes, there were tons of others waiting no big deal. After over an hour and no one else waiting (even though others had show up since) we were finally seated with apologies. I swear they forgot about us and it was a continued trend of the meal.  Our server came over and took a drink an appetizer order, we told him we were starving and wanted to order quickly. Another half an hour passed and they finally brought the appetizers on crazy hot plates, we all know what that means. They had been forgotten on the hot plate for a while. We finally get to order entrees and had some changes to items and there were six entrees in total. Server doesn't write a thing down, we all noted that given the experience so far we think there is no way things are coming out correct.  Oddly enough too he only gave my friend the dressing options of ranch or blue cheese for her Asian salad and when we walked out we noticed a plethora of Cheesecake Factory branded dressings that would have actually gone well with an Asian salad. Ugh.  Another 45 minutes and again raging hot plates and we get our meals minus the sauce, forgot this forgot that. It took another 15 minutes to get it all straightened out. We start looking for our server to request the check and he is nowhere in sight. We tried to flag down another server who blatantly ignored us until a manager saw us waving and he motioned for him to see what we need and out loud he goes ""that's not my table"" so the manager walks over and asks and we explain we can't seem to ever find our waiter and we need our check.  Server comes over huffing and puffing talking about some emergency in the bakery. Really what emergency could happen with a million pre-made cakes?  We paid and tried to get out as quick as possible, which even felt like it took a century. This ended up being a three hour plus dinner with crappy ass service that the manager never even attempted to figure out or apologize, he even avoided me on my way out. Probably because he knew I wanted to talk to him about our service. Piss poor."
Alex G.,"Pompano Beach, FL",184,74,566,1.0,6/10/2015,"One thing that we can say about this is that it's consistent. Same cheesy to court and saying tasteless food.This restaurant is drowning in monotony  and it's overdue for a change. My meal for today was the Pit Roast Beef Sub on Whole Wheat . With au jus - and Fontina -Beef was extremely tough and dish lacked flavor. This restaurant is a consistent let down , food looked great but only thing that was great was our server .So let's talk about her shall we.... Absolutely professional,witty, and attentive. Out of a lot of servers we have had she is absolutely the paramount of the pinnacle . Gregarious would describe her and horrible would describe our food experience today . This is a definite no revisit unless it's one of those days where I'm not with a clear mind and my pallet is sleep ( very sleep ! ) lol. Great server but horrible food ."
L T.,"Tampa, FL",0,51,3,3.0,7/21/2016,"Food portions are generous, but then again you are paying $16-$20 per entree. However the food quality and the prep quality leaves lots to be desired. The service is ok, not as attentive as they should be. Could be that they are either staffed on the light side or just too crowded. There always seems to be a wait. Their cheese cake never disappoint. It's in the mall plaza so if you want to have a sit down restaurant then this is an option. I'd say there are so many options in that area, unless you are dying for cheesecake be adventurous and try something new."
Melissa M.,"Tampa, FL",140,385,209,4.0,2/7/2015,"The hostess station was a complete nightmare. Lobby was packed. Hostess continued to call parties in even though there were several parties stuffed in the way waiting to be sat, thus causing all of the old ladies to repeatedly ask what place in line they were. Oy vey.  I noticed a waitress start to pick up the line and help run customers to the tables obviously not her job. Luckily, she was our waitress.  After we were sat the experience improved 200%. Drinks were out fast (yummy pineapple jalapeño margarita for me), app order in immediately and food out as we were finishing apps. The kids were parched for some unknown reason and the waitress kept the waters coming! It's actually amazing how attentive she was as a rush was starting.  Everyone enjoyed their food and the break from shopping. I had orange chicken which was modified to be slightly healthier (brown rice and grilled chicken). One dish is almost enough for two meals.  3 stars overall, bumped to 4 for the 'above and beyond' server."
Bernice B.,"Lutz, FL",37,70,11,1.0,6/7/2016,Not impressed at all. I had a Caesar chicken salad and I think the dressing was spoiled. In addition the cheesecake was not very good. Not impressed at all.
Cassie P.,"Tampa, FL",227,465,286,5.0,2/23/2014,"It's not often I give a major chain restaurant 5 stars- but, I do believe that Cheesecake Factory deserves it. I hadn't been here in a while (mostly because I hate everything about International Mall), but a friend and I had a late lunch here after having to make some mall purchases.  I think this was the first time I had been where I didn't have to wait for a table (Friday at 3pm). We were seated immediately and our server came over promptly. Our server was the right amount of attentive and helpful, our drinks (yes, we were day drinking- don't judge) came quickly from the bar.  The regular menu indicated a Gluten Free menu was available so I asked for that- expecting it to pretty much just have their salads and  meat dishes listed. Was I wrong!  Their GF menu is spiral bound like a normal menu- and includes sandwiches with GF buns (what??) and most of their pasta dishes available with GF pasta (what??).  Suddenly the world felt like my oyster!  I ordered a delicious eggplant sandwich on a delicious gluten free bun (not crumbly at all).  My friend had a grilled chicken club with avocado. Also delicious.  The regular and sweet potato fries were cooked to perfection.   We skipped out on the actual cheesecake this time- but my favorite has always been the Dutch Caramel Apple Streusel.   I am so delighted about the extensive GF menu that I look forward to returning again soon!  I am willing to brave International mall for Cheesecake factory- and that is why it gets 5 stars!"
S V.,"Manhattan, NY",165,24,,1.0,11/28/2016,"They take the word 'factory' pretty seriously here. Apparently the cheesecakes you order are sent from somewhere else, frozen then defrosted and sold to you. The staff is extremely rude, curt, and unprofessional. No legroom for customization. Overpriced and low quality service at least. Went with a mom and pop instead. Where they put in so much love and effort as opposed to cookie cutter frozen cake!"
Kathy W.,"Anaheim, CA",363,175,240,1.0,1/28/2016,"Very disappointing, ordered take out today @ International Mall's CCF not only did they leave out the chicken the bacon is burn which makes everything taste burnt. From beginning to end the experience was terrible.  They said 15 minutes it was 43, they said they would bring it out, it was raining after another 10-15 minutes my sister went in. Got home opened it up and couldn't believe they would send this out. Whoever plated this up should be ashamed.  It even smells burnt. My sisters order was fine. Then to make matters worse we called to speak with manager was put on hold for 11 minutes, girl came back on and said she couldn't find one for me to call back in a little while. We did not take it back yet because we live 20 minutes away and it's still raining."
Jillian B.,"Tampa, FL",56,76,1,2.0,4/29/2016,"The cheesecake is amazing.  However,  I cane with my husband for lunch and waited an hour for our food,  a salad and a chicken sandwich.  Our waitress was unapologetic about the wait, and the food was ok. My salad was soggy and my husband's sandwich came out wrong.  Would not recommend to anyone,  outside of getting cheesecake to go."
Matt B.,"Palm Harbor, FL",14,163,558,4.0,6/17/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory never disappoints, food is always delicious.  We eat here about 6 times a year and it's one of my favorite places to bring the kids.  Try the fried Mac N Cheese....it's delicious, and not just for the kids!  Obviously dessert here is a must so make sure you pace yourself when you order dinner, or skip the appetizer so you have room to rock one of the 200 different cheescakes.   We stopped by tonight for dessert only and had the Godiva brownie Sunday.  It's was good but not at the caliber of the cheesecake so next time I won't stray from the usual.  Had a nice time and sat in the bar.  Service was good and the manager came over to check on us. Make sure to get there early because it's always a wait at the peak dinner times.  Be prepared for a 30 min wait any day of the year. The biggest issue in my opinion is the menu.....does CCF need a 100 page menu?  It's a bit rediculous and it takes everyone 45 minutes to decide what to eat because the choices are a bit over the top..  Throw in the advertisements on the menu and it might take all day just to order."
Kevin M.,"Phoenix, AZ",208,116,59,4.0,2/19/2014,Service here wasn't up to par. Only reason not 5.
April W.,"Tampa, FL",54,11,2,5.0,2/11/2016,"When coming here i didnt exactly have the BEST EXPERIENCE. But, the servers and managers were so over the top in customer service! That that is what made my meal amazing! Love the service love the food!"
Darrell A.,"Clearwater, FL",92,131,264,3.0,1/29/2016,Service is very good and natural. With natural meaning not forced and seamless. Our server was very nice. Prices are high for drinks. Food is good tho.
Brooke K.,"Tampa, FL",89,128,83,5.0,2/18/2015,I stop by the Cheesecake Factory occasionally to pick up some cheesecake to go but I had never eaten here. My husband wanted to try it so off we went. We went in right around opening on a Saturday and we're glad we did. By the time we left they were on a wait and there were lots of people waiting. The service was excellent. Our waitress helped with menu selections and she was attentive without being overbearing. I got the salmon (I forget the name but it came with asparagus) and my husband got the (forgot the name) french dip sandwich. We were surprised by how good the food was. My salmon was perfect and the meat on his sandwich was very tender without being too chewy. We'll definitely be going back.
Sheila L.,"Tampa, FL",49,3,,1.0,2/4/2016,THE WORSE SERVICE YET. If Yelp didn't restrict me me to actually picking a star I would give them 0. We got there and were told about 10 minutes which turned into about 30 minutes . The waiter checked on us twice and we had to stop another waiter walking by to actually order our food. We did not  get refills until I asked for the check. We waited way to long for our food. & just to top everything off there was a sharp object in one of our dishes. Defiantly will not be going there again.
Elly L.,"Land O Lakes, FL",3,53,9,5.0,7/3/2015,"Absolutely amazing as always! It was super busy but we were seated in about 15 minutes and our waitress greeted us almost immediately. We got our orders in and everything came out fairly quick which surprised me!  I ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp, and it was almost like the food baby of thai + hawaiian curry. The portion was so large that I only managed to finish about 1/3 of it but I'm also happy because that means I get to eat more later! I think I have enough of it left over to have lunch and dinner tomorrow. I definitely will be coming back whenever I'm in Tampa to enjoy more of the many many options they have."
Steve E.,"Tampa, FL",201,1582,5019,3.0,9/3/2013,"I needed to run to the airport post office tonight, and then stop by International Plaza to visit Nordstrom before next week's business trip up to Philadelphia. I parked near the Bay Street (outdoor food court) section of the Mall, and figured that I'd grab something for dinner after I finished shopping. I thought I could find a nice entrée salad or a light pasta dish, and not blow my budget in the process. As I'm wandering along past all of the eateries and drinking establishments of Bay Street I spotted a long-lost friend at the end of the walkway -- The Cheesecake Factory. I haven't eaten at a CF in ages, but I had heard they now have a ""lighter"" SkinnyLiscious menu as well as some small plate specials, and I figured that was worth a try. Lots of things looked interesting on their menu, but I ended up with a plate of Sautéed Shrimp served over Angel Hair Pasta. My entrée was 5 large shrimp sautéed with herbs, lemon and garlic, and then plated atop Angel Hair pasta, sun-dried tomatoes and fresh basil. This was teensy bit more than the 450 calorie offerings on the SkinnyLiscious menu, but it was very tasty, and not coated in oil or a heavy sauce. The menu at the Cheesecake Factory is positively huge with a little bit of everything to appeal to a wide range of tastes. On the weekends the wait to be seated can be up to an hour, and plenty of people are determined to stand there and wait for their table. I can't get excited about waiting that long to get seated in a standard chain restaurant, but that's just my opinion. Now the main reason that people flock to the Cheesecake Factory is for their desserts, and if you hope to maintain any dignity and self-respect, you'll skip right over this section of the menu and just order a small luncheon salad and a glass of water. Unfortunately, the vast majority of their patrons flip right to the two page listing of the various types of cheesecake (I'm guessing 50 or so), and fixate on dessert as they wolf down their meals. Not to fear my friends as you can walk to the bakery counter and order your slices of cheesecake to go, and take this delicacy back to your office or to your home, and savor every morsel in complete privacy. Half the fun is watching your fellow diners drooling over all of the choices as they try to decide which one (OK, maybe two) slice(s) will be going home with them. Thankfully I maintained my composure at dinner and just had the pasta. But I sure would like to know how that to-go bag with a slice of Key Lime pie cheesecake ended up on the front seat of my SUV as I pulled out of the Mall's parking lot...."
