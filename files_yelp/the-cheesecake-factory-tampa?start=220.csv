Elspeth F.,"Tampa, FL",47,42,,5.0,10/4/2014,"Let's be honest, has anyone ever had anything bad at the Cheesecake Factory?! Be prepared to wait! There are no reservations and this place is always pretty busy, but it's always worth the wait!  Must haves: Stuffed Mushrooms (small plates), Skinnylicious Asian Lettuce Tacos, Thai lettuce wraps (Appetizer), pasta da Vinci, miso salmon! Cheesecakes to die for: anything with actual cake or fruit in it! In particular: Pineapple upside down cheesecake, lemon raspberry cream cheesecake, and Dutch Apple cheesecake"
Anthony A.,"Dunedin, FL",55,23,1,4.0,2/21/2016,Ive been here many times and i always get the classic burger. It is the best burger i have ever had when its cooked right and its large. They did over cook it two visits in a row though which is why i gave it 4 stars. They did give me a free slice of cheesecake the one time and took it off the bill the second time. They handled the situation the right way and thats the reason i have gone back after those screw ups. The cheesecake is great but overpriced in my opinion.
John L.,"St. Petersburg, FL",219,279,16,4.0,9/7/2014,"I've come here twice and it was better than I expected both times. Never been to a Cheesecake Factory before I moved to Florida. Simply because I hate cheesecake so I assumed my hatred would carry over to the other food items. Not the case.  The first time I came here, I ordered the Chicken Strip platter. It was sorely misnamed as something like Chicken Li'l Dippers. Misnamed because I was the served the most gargantuan stack of chicken fingers I've ever seen. Like I was starving and couldn't even get through half of them. Leftovers galore.  The chicken tenders were very good, which was a relief because I would've hated to received a plate stacked with gross chicken tenders. They had the perfect batter and they were crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Cooked perfectly.  I also ordered the mashed potatoes but again, little bits of stuff infesting my mashed potatoes. Don't like that. The potatoes were very good and had no lumps, except for the aforementioned bit invaders. $15 too. Not a bad deal whatsoever. You could easily have three meals from the amount they serve. Easy four star lunch.  Second time I came here and ordered the pizza. It again was better than what I expected from this place, but it wasn't a standout. Cheese, pepperoni and sauce were good, but the crust wasn't to my liking. Seemed frozen, not freshly tossed. I probably won't order the pizza again, unless I'm drunk and already had chicken fingers that day.  Service was great the first time, a little slow the second time, but nothing to get excited about. It's a very good place and I'll probably be back someday, especially if I'm preparing for a chicken finger eating contest."
Lauren C.,"Dunedin, FL",124,740,216,4.0,10/2/2013,"I've been here for dinner and dessert on many occasions and have always had a good experience. I like the environment inside as it feels very relaxing but also has an upscale feel, also they offer a nice outdoor patio for when the florida weather cools down a bit. There are plenty of booths and tables to accommodate large groups which is a bonus as well. I went last night for dinner and was delighted to see they have a ""skinnylicious"" menu option with a ton of choices now. In the past, I have always felt like there dishes are an extremely large portion size, more appropriate for sharing than just for 1 person, so it's nice to see they have some more reasonable dishes now for those watching the waistline. On my most recent visit, I got the chicken samosas and stuffed mushroom ""small plates"", both were excellent and are one of my favorite dishes here. My boyfriend got the chicken marsala which was really fabulous too and as always it was way more than enough food. To finish off the evening we shared a piece of lemon raspberry cheesecake, yum! My only complaint here is they never have any drink specials and their drinks are pretty pricey, for example I got a 22 oz yuengling and it was $8, I know this is international mall location, but that's still a bit outrageous. Regardless, I was satisfied with the food, service and overall experience and will be back again"
Jillian H.,"Ithaca, NY",154,22,3,3.0,1/11/2015,"My experience at The Cheesecake Factory at the International Mall was good, but tainted by an unimaginably long wait times. We were told our wait would be 40 minutes, but over an hour and a half later, we were still waiting! Definitely a bummer.  After our LONG LONG wait, we were welcomed in and had a good experience. My sister and I both got pasta dishes, and I got a glass of wine with mine. The pasta portions were huge, definitely enough for 2 dinners. For an appetizer, we got the vegetable fries made with zucchini, mushroom, and avocado. The fries were good and reminded me, unsurprisingly, of vegetable tempura.  Overall, decent food and good service INSIDE the restaurant, but a disappointing wait time."
Lucy P.,"St. Petersburg, FL",9,56,44,5.0,12/30/2015,Despite the mass of people it's worth the wait. We got seated within 20 mins the drinks are amazing seriously Asian pear martini was so good !! My food was on point steak was the bomb. Our server was awesome and super attentive. All the people always turned me off about this place so I never bothered to go till now. 10/10
Rita C.,"Osprey, FL",1,36,2,5.0,9/7/2016,"Had another lovely lunch at this restaurant.  Today there was no wait and the manager greeted us with a smile and warm welcome.  Then we had superb service from Ree.  She was efficient, friendly and spot on with customer service.  I enjoyed my Thai Lettuce Wraps as usual and my daughter liked her chopped salad!  We will return!"
Big D.,"Tampa, FL",3,17,9,2.0,1/14/2015,Food not all that great good deserts and drinks nice place to sit outside and people watch. Check it out but bring your wallet kinda expensive
Garnet-Travis B.,"Plant City, FL",1,115,4,1.0,1/3/2016,"Food and service were fine. The place was filthy. Dirty table, dirty seat, spots on the silverware, sticky menus and food stuck to the glass. Disgusting."
Eva P.,"Clearwater, FL",82,168,432,4.0,12/17/2014,Love this place. Just need to check calorie menu before coming so you don't eat 2000+ calories in one sitting.  4 stars because of the calories in everything! No reservations so keep you party small otherwise you'll wait awhile!
Steve H.,"Tampa, FL",32,1,,1.0,8/27/2016,"I was excited and pleased when I received an email from the management team about my initial review, and contacted them per instructions in their reply. I guess the fact that I filled out their contact form was good enough for them... I am now to the point of not going to ANY of their locations."
Stephanie G.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",2,16,,4.0,7/19/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is always a safe bet for a girls night or a date night. It definitely doesn't skimp on the calories, so make sure you're coming to EAT! Last night I went here with a few girlfriends. I got the Kobe Beef Burger with sweet potato fries and an apple pear martini. Service seemed a tad slow, but the food was good as usual. And of course I had to finish my meal with a piece of cheesecake. I opted for Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake. If you have a sweet tooth this one is sure to cure it! I gave this four stars because service was slow and this place is just a chain restaurant--nothing super special."
Farah H.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,9,,5.0,7/30/2016,"Great customer service, the manger Joe did a great job handling a bad situation, great customer service!"
Jeanne P.,"Tampa, FL",1,9,1,1.0,3/28/2016,"Went to Cheesecake Factory in Intl. Plaza this evening with my daughter for dinner. The wait time for our food was extremely long with the service staff apologizing to all of the tables in our section claiming they did not anticipate being so busy so the kitchen was understaffed. When our food did finally arrive, my daughter's meat was raw...not rare, but raw. Our server was no where to be found so we finally flagged down another to ask for the meat to be cooked. 10 minutes later our missing waiter came to ask how dinner was apparently unaware of the return. He walked away, then 5 minutes later asked us ""who did you send your food back with?"" He then came back again to say they burned the meat when recooking it...so another 5 minutes passed. The Manager came over to apologize but never offered to remove the meal from the bill nor did he offer to buy a desert, a drink, nothing! When I got the bill (which we had to request from the hostess station because our server disappeared AGAIN!) we were charged full price for everything!  I have worked in the restaurant business before and to charge for a meal that took almost 30 minutes to produce and was actually edible was the worst customer service experience EVER!  We will not go back, nor will I refer any of my business clients and I will dissuade anyone from dining at this restaurant in the future."
Colin A.,"Tampa, FL",37,13,,2.0,1/3/2016,"The food is always spot on, so that is for the 2 stars. But the way I was treated while trying to treat my father for his 68th birthday was nothing short of obnoxious. Tried to call ahead to reserve a spot for his birthday, they wouldn't accept despite me living 5 mins away. But that isn't that bad since it is ""company protocol"", imagine that being told to you by someone similar to Bill Lumbergh.  Upon checking in we are told it is a 30 minute wait. Great. So we go outside and realize that outdoor seating is wide open, being from Michigan the 62 degree weather isn't all that cold so we asked to sit there immediately rather than wait. It takes them 20 mins to seat us in the outdoor spot... As we are walking out we see a plethora of options to dine inside. At this point, might as well sit inside!  The nincompoops that work as hostess' should learn a thing or two in customer service since any time I asked them a question they gave me blank stare. Overall, this place might need to hire some new people to run the from cuz this was a shitty way to say happy birthday to my dad. Smh"
Carlos H.,"Tampa, FL",3388,792,1522,2.0,12/23/2010,"I don't know what is happening to this Cheesecake Factory location at the International Mall, but my last few visits here have been plagued with bad service. One time I came in for lunch and the server took about an hour to come and take our order. He was nowhere to be found for half the time and we were seated in an area where all the customers were his. When he did appear he darted past our table faster than we could grab his attention. The food took forever to come out and I was left trying to explain to my friends who I had told Cheesecake Factory has excellent service what had happened. They are busy throughout the day, but it's no excuse for spotty service...The Westfield Brandon Mall location is just as busy and still manages to provide quality service on my visits there. A few other visits have had the same issue. Today we came in at around 3pm and were seated near the bar area. They seated us right next to a birthday party of about eight people. The waitress came up to us to take our orders and we never saw her for the rest of our meal until the birthday party left. We never got our bread and we were starving. Just when I was about ready to just get up and tell them to cancel our order another waiter came out with our food and brought us some bread with our meal after we mentioned never receiving ours. It wasn't until this waiter saw the look on my face that our waitress decided to appear again. The Monterrey Cheeseburger was pretty appetizing and made me feel a little better about the service. The Honey Mustard Mayo sauce and cheese were made well. The burger was cooked medium well as requested. There was a good amount of fries, but it looks like they served less than usual.   The food was good, but the waitress simply wasn't making a good name for the Cheesecake Factory and honestly I'm sick of the bad service here. Probably won't be dining here much in the future. The Brandon one is closer anyway."
Alex C.,"Tampa, FL",0,2,,1.0,2/9/2016,"Placed an order for curbside to go at 7pm. They said the food would be ready at 7:25. Called the curbside number when we got there to get our food. Called two more times over the period of an hour. Got our food at 8:30. Figured it was backed up in the kitchen because we ordered during peak hours. NOPE. Everything was cold. Steak was cold, chicken was cold, and the sauce in the pasta had begun settling. Worst takeout/to go service ever."
Sunshine 1.,"Tampa, FL",2,9,1,4.0,1/19/2015,"Just stopped in for a slice of the Tuxedo cheesecake, yum. I usually get it to go. I was pleasantly greeted with a pretty presentation. Cake surrounded by  chocolate swirl and looking delicious!  Needless to say it was great."
Misty B.,"Tampa, FL",138,135,282,5.0,8/19/2012,"Normally I wouldn't bother writing a review for one of the most consistent and successful chains in America. But that new Skinnylicious menu has pushed me over the edge.  Since its release, I have visited this Cheesecake Factory more times in the past month than the past five years.  What's always worked for Cheesecake: all-around crowd-friendly menu. Want standard American fare? A nod to Asian or Mexican? Steak, seafood, tapas, bar food? Just great drinks? Check, check, check and check. Perfect for large parties, kids, energetic (read: loud) groups and finicky eaters.  Portions are mammoth, and service is friendly, well-timed, knowledgeable and consistent from location to location.  But for us trying to keep our girlish figures, we'd have to use this spot for our ""cheat day"" or resign ourselves to the half salads. Blech. Now there's the Skinnylicious Menu, which delivers on flavor, variety AND portion size -- no easy feat. In fact, the only place that does it equally well is Seasons 52 (but Seasons manages a 480-calorie max compared to Cheesecake's 590). I haven't tried much yet (keep ordering the same things!), but my favorite items on the Skinnylicious Menu are the Chicken Enchiladas and the White Chicken Chili. The escabeche veggies that come with the enchiladas don't replace the regular menu's black beans and rice flavor-wise, but it's a small sacrifice for the opportunity to indulge in All. That. Cheese.  Yum and thumbs up for a menu that finally addresses the dining-out quandary!"
Evelyn C.,"Brooklyn, NY",34,22,21,4.0,8/26/2013,"After being shocked by how early the malls close here (6pm on a Sunday), we found our way to the Cheesecake Factory. Having eaten at many other cheesecake factories,  was wondering how this one compared.  Wait time..very short considering it was a Sunday night at 6pm.  For a table for 2, we waited about 20 mins, not bad.  I ordered the Carlton salad which comes with grilled chicken, cranberries, pecans, and feta cheese. It came with a heaping plate of it.  Hubby ordered his usual of steak Diane and chicken Marsala. Both of which were delicious. It came with mashed potatoes and two spears of asparagus.  For dessert, we were tempted to get the new s'mores cheesecake, but ended up getting the chocolate mousse cheesecake which was yummy.  Great food as always and the waiter was super friendly. Would def come again."
