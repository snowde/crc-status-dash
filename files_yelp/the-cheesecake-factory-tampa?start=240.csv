Marco D.,"Tampa, FL",9,21,1,3.0,1/30/2016,"I'm going to go with three stars, because the waiter was awesome. He forgot my fries and when he noticed brought me two portions. The cheesecake wasn't to die for, when I go out I ignore the hype and other people's opinions. The cheesecake was the classic one with strawberries which the size of the cake to fruit ratio is off and the cream the put on cake was to sweet. After eating I felt as I needed and insulin shot. Will try again and update review when I do."
Amy W.,"Gibsonton, FL",39,3,2,4.0,11/8/2014,Very good service. Highly recommend the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Delicious and so much flavor!!
Becky F.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",65,159,262,5.0,5/10/2014,The food was fabulous chicken Madeira and buffalo blasters. Went with family for mothers day lunch. mom really enjoyed it. cheesecake Chris outrageous beyond good.
Ameesh P.,"Tampa, FL",295,594,269,4.0,2/22/2013,"This is by far one of the best places I've ever been to for a chain.  Regardless of what city I have been in and dined here it has been a great experience.  Their waitstaff is always on top of it and the variety of their menu alone gives me a food coma.  I've never had a bad item of the varied items I've tried and I'm truely impressed by the advancements they have made to offer more nutricious and health conscious offerrings.   Their beverage menu is also varied and has a lot of specialty cocktails to fit any mood you may be in.  Not to mention if you're not into drinking they have Coke Zero, so they pretty much sold me at that.  Now as far as their desserts, I don't think you have to look very hard to find something that will satisfy your sweet tooth.  The hardest part is narrowing down your pick to just one item unless of course you are with others who will indulge with you!"
Eileen B.,"Tampa, FL",5,26,4,1.0,1/24/2015,I went for my birthday they were terrible Quickly took our order brought bred and water and tea The appetizers never came we stopped waitress after 20 minutes She said she would check never came back We called the manager over after30 min Still no food he was polite and professional went over to the cooks then came back he said their cooker broke they should be back on track now it's my birthday drove one hour to eat there and no food now it's an hour and I am starving so we got up and walked out  The manager was nice and the waitress rude Never will go there again One star not food but for the manager he was polite
Brittni L.,"St. Petersburg, FL",45,112,107,2.0,5/15/2016,"I have been here many times and loved it. My birthday was yesterday I wanted to come here. They won't take reservations so I was prepared to wait 40minutes later seated. App was delicious but very greasy had the Cuban eggrolls..Our table was bused while we were still at it. My entree chicken marsala was cold in some places warm in others,  not much marsala but my boyfriend's Shepard's Pie had a whole bunch of marsala which blew my mind. Shepard's Pie was chunks of cut up burger was really disappointed in initial service our server was sweet but her manager didn't care he ruined my birthday meal he offered to have them remake it but after waiting 10mins for it i just asked for my check and passed on the whole meal.They use to be 5 stars in my book. If you can't handle a large capacity and serve meals timely and up to code maybe you shouldn't. AGAIN VERY DISAPPOINTED WON'T BE BACK UNLESS IT'S CHEESECAKE TO GO."
Ron V.,"Manistee, MI",11,22,6,4.0,12/1/2015,"Food is always fantastic and the drinks are amazing. These restaurants are always located in upscale areas. Wait times can be excessive. My only gripe is that the menu is so large that making a selection can be challenging. The good part is that you really can't go wrong. Lastly, the desserts are decadent - good luck saving room.."
Gilbert R.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,15,,5.0,11/18/2015,"As always, excellent place for lunch or dinner. A little more pricey, but the quality and quantity is far superior then any other chain."
Leigh S.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",82,105,87,5.0,8/1/2014,"I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner. I was on a date and the waitress didn't rush us. We stayed for quite awhile. Our meals were delicious. I ordered the Chicken Madeira - my favorite.  I also enjoyed the key lime cheesecake.  It was light, creamy and not too tart."
Duane D.,"Clearwater, FL",77,554,211,3.0,12/27/2012,"The problem with the Cheesecake Factory is that there is always a long wait.  That is a good problem to have, but I think it is driven by the location (International Plaza) more than the restaurant itself. Don't get me wrong, it is a good restaurant--its just not so much better than other places that it justifies a 30-60 minute wait.   The prices are kind of high, but the portions are very large.  I recommend splitting a meal for most people --it's just a crazy amount of food."
Alisson B.,"Tampa, FL",43,107,121,5.0,8/22/2015,"Very very very busy. Long line but, surprisingly, not that long a wait. I got the cuban sandwich rolls and stuffed mushrooms appetizers. Those Cuban sandwich rolls are quite possibly the yummiest things ever! Sinful. The only other things I ordered were 2 slices of cheesecake: Godiva chocolate and White chocolate raspberry truffle. I loved them both so much that I would given my firstborn for another slice. j/k :) Tried to look up the calories online. They don't post them on there site and they don't have the info in-store. Searched an searched and found some sites that claim to have them and they are the Moby Dick of calories so beware. What am I saying? Gimme summore of that cheesecake-y wonderfulness!"
Jennifer G.,"Clearwater, FL",0,242,93,1.0,11/15/2016,"We finally got a chance to try a place we were so excited about and could not of been more disappointed!!! First off, we asked for a table with 2 high chars. They were on a wait and said 30 minutes. This was just after 7pm Sat eve. At 8 we asked how much longer and were told that they could not put 2 high chairs at a table. We said fine, we will take one highchair and one booster. They finally got us a table after 8pm. Then the real disaster began. Not only was our server terrible, we received part of our order wrong. The server never stopped to ask how the food came out. My daughters orange chicken was hard as a rock. She could not eat it. My food and my older daughters was actually good. My granddaughters Mac n cheese looked like soup. She would not eat any of it. We had to ask for bread twice and then the guy brought 3 pieces for a party of 7. Our margaritas tasted like straight sour mix and were served in rocks glasses for 10 bucks a piece! There was a large party that sat after us but had a different server, they were gone before we paid our bill. We did order cheesecake to go and that was amazing. Then it took another 30 minutes just to pay the bill! It was after 11pm when we finally got out of there! The bill was almost $200 and it was terrible! My suggestion is to go elsewhere! Do not waste your time at the restaurant. It's definitely nothing special.  From terrible drinks, mediocre food and the worst service ever.... additionally, the bathrooms were gross! The women's bathroom has 4 stalls.... 2 of them were out of order and one did not have toilet paper! You might expect that from a fast food chain but from this place!? The Cheesecake Factory screams disappointment!"
Tim W.,"Lancaster, PA",16,634,819,3.0,10/1/2014,"I had a decent meal here but service was a bit lacking since they were busy.  They brought my tortilla soup out after they delivered my entree, only I had to ask for it.  The tortilla soup was not very good as they didn't puree the tortillas very well.  However, my burger and the Oreo cheesecake were amazing. While the Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant, I usually receive an above average meal here.  Tonight was an off night for service as our waiter was running around like crazy.  I probably won't be back to this particular location."
Caitlin V.,"Tampa, FL",58,18,26,4.0,2/24/2015,"Although I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, I. Love. Cheesecake Factory. No matter if it's a random day or special occasion I think this restaurant is perfect and their food is always so scrumptious!  I think the biggest complaint I hear is that it's overpriced and I have to disagree. I think the prices are fair especially considering the portion sizes.  Their huge menu is tremendous and although it can be overwhelming, you can pick from any kind of cuisine! They start you off with little loaves of white and wheat bread for the table, the wheat is to die for I L-O-V-E their fried Mac and Cheese Balls as a starter, they are unlike any other and trust me, I've had a lot of mac and cheese! My favorite dish, Crispy Chicken Costoletta, chicken breast lightly breaded and sautéed to a crisp golden brown, served with lemon sauce, mashed potatoes and fresh asparagus. It's so good that I found the Copy Cat recipe and whipped it up at home! It's definitely enough food to take leftovers and enjoy the next day at lunch... if you can resist waiting to finish!  I'm always stuffed to the max by the end of my meal but I rarely skip out on the chance to have some delicious cheesecake; by far my favorite is the fresh strawberry cheesecake. It is perfection every single time. As far as environment, it's pretty relaxing. The lights dim in the evening and there are candles on the table for a nice ambiance. The service has always been good; they are usually very attentive and outgoing. They also are well versed on the menu and able to answer any questions. Cheesecake factory has an insane amount of items, I'm not sure how they pull it off but they really do a great job."
Natalee F.,"Philadelphia, PA",111,250,49,4.0,5/2/2014,"Living in Philadelphia, I'm not used to going to chain restaurants.  Or big restaurants.  But I was visiting my mother and after picking me up from the Tampa airport she said she had a few giftcards for this place that she wanted to use. We pulled up to the mall on a Friday night.  Holy shit, this place is PACKED.  The closest parking spot is at the end of the parking lot.  Insane.  We walk up to the hostess stand and was told it would be about 20-30 minutes.  There were mobs of people standing around waiting, even though hundreds of people can fit inside.   Once you get inside, you can see this place is gigantic.  It's insanely big.  And there's also outside seating.  Even though I had a sweatshirt on and pants, I was shivering as soon as I walked in, so we decided on outside seating.  That is really the best place to sit here, because eating aside, this place is a true cultural experience, especially if you're coming from a Northern city. People here DRESS UP to come to the Cheesecake Factory.  It's crazy.  I mean seriously dress up.  Short tight dresses, everyone in 5 inch stilettos, hair and makeup done, all fancy.  I just couldn't believe it.  In Philadelphia, people don't even dress up this much for actual fancy restaurants.  It reminds you that even though you're in the same country, there are significant regional cultural difference.  The parade of people walking by was people watching gold. The food actually was good, to my surprise.  I wasn't super hungry and got the asparagus with cheese and egg and also the beet salad.  Both were very good.  We made the mistake of ordering dessert.  I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake, so ordered the warm apple pie ala mode.  Holy crap, this thing was easily enough for 6 people to eat.  It was pound and pounds of ice cream and pie.  Kind of offputting.   Our server was very attentive and sweet."
Nat W.,"Kapolei, HI",241,1882,1401,4.0,2/14/2012,"I like Cheese cake factory!  Not bad at all considering it is a chain restaurant! I am not a big fan of their cheesecakes since they are so rich and filling to me.   One exception tho, I do like their Tiramisu cheesecake! I like thier appetizer Calamari.  Miso salmon and Hibachi steak are awesome! The one I remember disliking was Cajun Jambalaya pasta.   Their portions are huge just like any other American franchaised restaurant.  If you are going to have a slice of their cheesecake after your entree, you are looking at 3500- 4000 kcal a meal.   But hey they are all so tasty, you can indulge yourself in diet killer at Cheesecake factory once in a while, right?  ;P"
Sue C.,"Tampa, FL",3,87,3,2.0,9/29/2015,Nothing above average for this restaurant. Average food that's overpriced. Most seating is communal. Not enough private seating. Long waits to be seated.
Camila M.,"Northport, NY",42,227,44,4.0,2/4/2015,"Wow, talk about Southern Hospitality.  This is the best Cheesecake factory I have ever been to!  The service is EXCELLENT (and this is coming from a true foodie/food-snob, Michelin Star Restaurant Fanatic), the food was perfectly made and presented, with choices that I have not seen on other menus in other cheesecake factories.  I was floored by the quality of this restaurant, and I have always loved Cheesecake factory, but never was I do well treated, seated right away - no wait at all even though it was a weekend, and surrounded by such a nice ambiance in a partly indoor/partly outdoor mall in beautiful Tampa weather (in the middle of December).  The menu at Cheesecake is definitely a crowd pleaser, with high-calorie staples like chicken madeira, as well as low calorie tapas like tuna carpaccio and beat and goat cheese salad - both my favorite dishes there.  It's almost as big as the bible so you are definitely going to find something you love there.  But at these particular location the presentation of the dishes was above par.  Just excellent."
E F.,"Tampa, FL",55,186,4,4.0,3/22/2015,"Because of the previous good meal and great service earlier in March, we went back for lunch before going to the show at the Strazz.  We had lunch here on Saturday, 3/21, and our waiter was Richard D.  Congratulations to Richard D for being as professional and good as Thomas S. To ""TCF"" Management - you've got two gems of waters in Richard D and Thomas S! The food was very good and extremely bountiful. Congratulations to management and to Richard D for catching that the one entree came out of the kitchen as a lunch portion rather than a dinner portion and adjusting our bill accordingly.  This is outstanding professional customer service!!  And it turned out the small portion was actually better for us. Highly recommend."
Michelle M.,"Tampa, FL",358,1149,1892,3.0,1/11/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is not my favorite restaurant, but it is a great option when no one can make up their mind of what they want to eat! My number one gripe is the wait to get a table.  A 25 minute wait at 2:30pm on a Saturday seems excessive...especially when it is not lunch rush.  Because the restaurant is always packed the service is always slow at one point in the meal.  Whether it's waiting on the check or waiting on dessert you will be searching for your waiter at one point or another. The food is really hit or miss.  The menu is huge so can you really believe that the restaurant serves good burgers, salads, pastas, sushi, chinese, steaks, and home cooked meals???  If they would simplify the menu the kitchen would run so much faster (and their would be fewer let downs on the menu).  On my last visit I ordered the BBQ ranch chicken salad and got four piece of chicken on my salad.  I was lucky if there were 2 oz of chicken on the salad.  I do love their bread, but I surprisingly am not a fan of the cheesecake.  How can you call yourself the Cheesecake Factory and offer the worst cheesecake?!?! That's right, 30 +/- different flavors of poorly flavored cheesecake.  The texture is just off.  Reminds me of one of those no-bake Jell-o cheesecake mixes. The food isn't terrible, it just isn't great.  The restaurant is covered in strollers which is great for families, but not so great for single couples. For the prices and the lackluster food I would skip Cheesecake Factory."
