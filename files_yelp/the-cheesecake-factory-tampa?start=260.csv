Melissa W.,"Tampa, FL",0,18,,5.0,6/9/2016,"If you've never ordered anything from here, you'll wanna start with the Burrito. It's. Gigantic. Money well spent lol."
Paris H.,"Tampa, FL",3,7,15,4.0,8/29/2015,"Great atmosphere. I really liked the music. It was modern but smooth, bands such as Keane, the 1975, and coldplay were playing throughout the night. It wasn't too crowded or loud, especially compared to the neighboring restraunts. The wait staff is friendly. It's a really big place. If you're a vegetarian, there is a few options, such as the kale quinoa salad or the veggie burger. The veggie burger is what I had, and it was pretty good. I'd give it 3/5. It's mostly a rice patty so it's very crumbly. I would have preferred a black bean burger. Over all though it was really good, and I was pleasantly surprised to see multiple vegan/vegetarian/healthy options."
Dorivaldo C.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",45,8,1,4.0,8/23/2015,"Great food like always. This site a bit busy, but was seated quickly. Chicken piccata and herb crusted salmon was perfect."
Morgan A.,"Gainesville, FL",66,24,2,1.0,12/29/2013,"This place is nothing short of a cluster&*^%.  Some highlights included being told it was a 30 minute wait, but we waited 60 minutes.  The hostesses we encountered there treated us like we were homeless people waiting for a soup kitchen line.  No pagers, just people shouting out names in the foyer...tacky.  Then we had the unfortunate luck of getting Christopher as our waiter.  Burgers were average at best and, OK, no problem my sister-in-law's sweet potato fries never showed up. She was fine with it....just take it off her bill.  After lengthy conversations....not only would ""his manager"" (whomever that is - I guess they don't like interacting with their guests) not credit our bill for something that never showed up - Christopher tried to argue with me that ""sweet potato fries come with your dinner so we can't take it off.""  What kind of sense does that make?  The fries never showed up dude! We just don't want to pay for them.  They tried offering us a piece of their sh*tty cheesecake but we declined.  This place needs help.  Wish we just went to Five Guys....would have been waaaay better."
Jo Ann M.,"Tampa, FL",1,15,,3.0,10/6/2015,"Had lunch there last week. Our server (Thomas) was very rude. He looked over-whelmed too.  As for the food, my chicken was rubbery and the pasta came out in one big hard ball. Not very appealing. However, the Picata sauce was delicious"
Thomas A.,"Gulfport, FL",218,431,115,4.0,7/10/2012,"A chain that delivers the goods (all of them) consistently!  You gotta give it to Cheesecake Corporate...they know how to handle a restaurant. The food is very good, the service as well...and the cheesecake of course is over the top. The interior of the place is gorgeous and comfortable - if a bit loud from being constantly packed full with a line at the door. The new ""Skinnylicious"" menu is a huge score - more places should have this option. The normal menu consists of portions the size of horse troughs. All of the food is interesting and there is really something for ANY taste imaginable. Chains CAN be done well, there's obviously a reason they become so popular that they start to multiply like rabbits. In some cases, like Olive Garden - they produce bland but predictable dreck alongside unlimited breadsticks and salad - and that combo equals success. The Cheesecake Factory provides top level service, high quality (interesting) food with deep flavors, and an entire menu just for cheesecake (certainly one of the finest desserts ever created)."
Jess D.,"Asheville, NC",49,88,24,3.0,3/8/2015,"So, I've been here quite a few times. Every time has always been great. This time was a little off. My girlfriend and I came for dinner. Our wait was about 30 minutes which was normal for a weekend evening.  She ordered the pepperoni pizza, and I had the sweet corn tamale cakes, like usual. Her pepperoni pizza was under cooked and the smell was off-putting.  We sent it back, and the server apologized and was more than happy to take it back. The manager brought out her second pizza, which was not cooked all the way.  We sent it back one more time, and the manager as well as the server apologized again.  So they took off the pizza from our tab, as they were very understanding. I ordered the sweet corn tamale cakes like I normally do. There was double the onion this time, which was odd. It tasted fine to me, but not like the other times.  So all in all, we got the pizza taken off our bill, and they didn't charge us for the piece of cheesecake we ordered. My girlfriend left hungry and just ate at home."
Kelleigh M.,"Tampa, FL",119,909,712,4.0,6/25/2012,"It's the cheesecake factory, standard chain restaurant. I am very excited that they rolled out a skinny menu. The CF has always made the naughty list when it came to nutritional value.  I'm a big fan of their lunch portion salads. Plenty big and full of flavors. I love the Carlton Salad."
Timothy W.,"St. Augustine, FL",0,7,,4.0,9/18/2015,"As always, The Cheesecake Factory lives up to my expectations. Delicious food and cocktails at a reasonable price with large portions; very hard to find in Tampa."
Theresa H.,"St. Petersburg, FL",11,71,37,5.0,7/1/2015,"Its the best restaurant, have been going for years, when I lived in California and now in Florida. There food is always delicious, tasty, big portions and a huge selection. No matter what item you order they prepare it with flavor and quality. We had the barbeque chicken salad that comes with black beans, corn, avocados, cheese and topped with crispy fried onions, enough for two people, so delicious, and we ordered their avocado egg rolls with this yummy cilantro sauce. They are always a huge step ahead of any restaurant I have eaten at, and I have been too many, many places!!!!"
Nicole P.,"Brandon, Tampa Bay, FL",7,43,4,4.0,1/21/2015,"Went for happy hour from 4-6 mon-fri the menu was pretty big for happy hr most of the apps were 5$ and a double decker burger was $5 plus $2 for fries. The drinks Range from $4 for a beer to $5 for a mix drink, by far one of the best happy hours in Tampa highly recommend."
Traci R.,"Tampa, FL",0,3,1,1.0,9/6/2015,"I'll start out by saying that I love the Cheesecake Factory.  I have gone there for years and they do a good job with the huge menu selection that they offer. With that being said I will NEVER order take out again from them.  This is the 3rd time that my meal has been beyond disappointing.  I got the skinnylicious beef medallions with rice and they looked like 4 pieces of old dog treats. They tasted as such as well.  I actually took a picture of the food it was that impressively horrible but unfortunately, or fortunately for the Cheesecake Factory, I can't post it."
Jamie O.,"Dunedin, FL",8,10,4,3.0,6/20/2015,"We ordered to go, the skinnylicious tacos lacked flavor and the sides, we also ordered our cheesecake slices without whip cream, instead they were slathered with melted whip cream. We were also disappointed in the Oreo explosion cheesecake, it was rich in chocolate but had 3/4 broken bits of Oreo toward the crust. Usually the food is filling and delicious sadly this time I ended up throwing away my food"
Rob B.,"Kaneohe, HI",227,1086,877,2.0,3/11/2014,"Sunday Brunch 10:00 AM. Nice outside seating but variable servers created a variable service experience. The kitchen must not have been ready either as getting our brunch was as painful as getting the check at the end. To make matters worse  my Huevos Rancheros eggs were more rare than ""sunny side up"" as most of the whites except at the yoke were clear. I love a runny egg but not when the whites are see through. Most disappointing"
Will C.,"Suwanee, GA",166,124,475,2.0,10/22/2013,I have never had a good meal here! There's always something wrong.   By the way if you are wearing black anything! Ask for a black napkin.  Their white napkins are soooooo cheap that will leave your clothes looking like crap. (Just a friendly advise). Their Ice tea its just water flavored with a little bit of tea. Very disappointed again.
Jennifer R.,"Orlando, FL",143,524,67,4.0,3/3/2014,Cheesecake Factory never disappoints. Ive been a frequenter of CF for years and always love what ends up on my plate. The pear martini I happened upon in this trip was so damn good I may make it a regular order along with my usual Chicken Piccata. Mmmm
Salvatore M.,"Palm Harbor, FL",6,59,8,5.0,2/7/2015,"Friday night and this place is packed. One hour wait. Well worth it. Very nice waitress. Everybody at our table loved their meals. I had the chicken mediera. Excellent. Others had a kobe burger, pasta divinci, kids pizza, and the ""italian"". Excellent. We are about to have dessert. I don't have to tell you about their cheesecake. Good place."
Chris S.,"Tampa, FL",0,21,,1.0,6/3/2015,"Horrible food! Went for happy hour had appetizers weren't bad. 5$ happy hour deal at the bar. My wife loved the cosmopolitans. The best part should have stopped there. Had to wait 30 minutes for a dinner table when there were plenty available. My mother ordered the shepard's pie and it was uneatable. No taste and looked like beef stew on top of mash potatoes. I had the meatloaf and have had better from a frozen dinner. The waiter and manager were nice but the food there is terrible. This was not my first time there and I remember the the other was horrible as well but this time my mother had a gift certificate. Well we got what we paid for, nothing."
Jeff D.,"Tampa, FL",9,23,,4.0,5/4/2015,Never had a bad meal there.  Did carry out.  Shepard's pie and burrito were very good.  The dulce de caramel cheesecake was awesome.
Eric J.,"Tampa, FL",0,42,9,2.0,12/18/2014,"I had the pulled pork sandwich. It was tasty, but like all chain restaurants of the type, they use WAY too much salt. The service was great, though, thus 2 stars."
