Francesca L.,"Tampa, FL",45,172,8,5.0,1/10/2014,"I know it's just ""The Cheesecake Factory"" but, guess what?  One of their menu items is on my Yelp profile as ""last meal before I die""!! Forget the service and ambiance--you come here for the extensive menu and yummy food.  I am going to review my FAVORITE menu item(s): The fried mac and cheese balls-holy yum. These cheesy, ooey gooey macaroni balls are deep fried to perfection and served with a warm marinara sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. The avocado eggrolls- second only to the Mac and Cheese balls, these eggrolls are VERY avocado-y so if you like that, you're golden.  White bean hummus with pita-- good hummus and comes with A LOT-great for sharing, and it's pretty cheap. Chicken Salad Sandwich-OH MY GOD. I may drive over and pick one up now that it's on my mind. I am a chicken salad snob like you wouldn't believe and this is MY ALL TIME FAVORITE chicken salad sandwich.  It's real chunks of chicken with celery, mayo, and other goodness served with tomato and shredded lettuce on buttery Texas toast.  Order with the side greens with house balsamic instead of fries. WOW My husband likes: the chicken and avocado sandwich, the Philly steak and the chicken quesadillas. On Sunday morning they offer brunch, and their eggs Benedict are really great too Top cheesecakes: Carmel apple streusel, snickers, Adam's peanut butter cup, banana's foster Ok that's it...we are going for dinner tonight (seriously)!"
Tim K.,"Fraser, MI",261,289,51,1.0,9/30/2013,"I had every intention of giving this place a semi-positive review (the service was extremely slow which at the time was the only bad part of our meal) until I got back to my Hotel and started eating my leftovers. What I found literally almost made me throw up.  The side of potatoes that came with my meal had a few large chunks in them. None of which I ate while there unfortunately. As I bit in to one back in my room I noticed it tasted really funky. I pulled the fork back only to see pure blackness in the form of a rotten potato staring me in the face. I started to gag as I spit the rest out in to my plate. Upon cutting in to the others I found that two more were just the same.  I attempted to call and speak with a  Manager and was put on hold and the line was never picked up. After five minutes I just hung up in anger and frustration. I had every intention of calling back the next day, but as I was on vacation and had a busy schedule I never got around to it. Now that I am back home I am debating on whether to still call and let them know."
Brad R.,"Frederick, MD",45,12,1,3.0,4/6/2015,"Generous portions, good service, chicken dish a bit dry this time.   Menu can be overwhelming, all and all a good Easter dinner."
Natalie Y.,"Tampa, FL",3,8,,3.0,6/7/2013,"I have been to this one many many times, and everytime I go I have had different experiences. The food is really good. There are a few items I have had, such as there pasta dishes, that are always to die for. But there are other items as well, like their fish tacos, that are not to die for. It's a good idea to ask the waiter what they recommend. Now the service can be really good, or really terrible. It just depends on the waiter you get. I also don't recommend going here if you hate crowds. Especially on a Friday or Saturday night. It gets very busy, they do not do reservations, and you can be waiting up to two hours for a table. Overall, at this place, you're time can be awesome, or just really bad."
Michelle M.,"Tampa, FL",0,7,6,5.0,6/4/2015,One of the best place around Tampa just can't say anything bad best place around favorite spot
Daniel B.,"Huntington Park, CA",30,137,13,4.0,3/20/2015,I tried the cashew chicken for the first time at this particular location.  It was very delicious and a big portion.
Marielle T.,"Clearwater, FL",8,6,,5.0,7/5/2015,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Tampa, the food is magnificent,  the staff is great, and the prices are not bad. The only problem is the long waiting; well, I guess I'm not the only one who loves this place."
Lina F.,"Tampa, FL",2,19,5,5.0,11/9/2014,"Who doesn't love the Cheesecake Factory? Usually a solid place to get great food. This location is no exception. It can get crowded but for a late dinner on a weekday, there was is usually no waiting at all. The chicken piccata is always great but this most recent visit I tried the Jamaican black pepper shrimp and it was amazing!"
Josiah G.,"Tampa, FL",405,405,29,4.0,11/24/2013,"This is obviously a huge chain....but it's a huge chain that does most things right. I went here with a party of 4 on a Friday night and we were seated in about 20 minutes. The server was on top of his game and took our drink order as soon as we sat down. The drinks were made very well. A few minutes later, the drinks arrived and he took our app order. Apps came soon after and he took our dinner order just before they arrived.  The avocado egg rolls were crispy and tasty, and the nachos were nice and thick with plenty of toppings. My girlfriends Cuban sandwich was surprisingly good and my DaVinci pasta was tasty and al dente.  With no room for desert, we packed up our leftovers, which seems to be common there, and headed out. Really great experience and a great go-to place at International."
stefanie v.,"Palm Harbor, FL",10,35,39,2.0,10/20/2014,Don't go here if your dining alone. The servers will pay u no mind. I placed my order got bread & a drink but no butter. I waited about 5 or so minutes thinking he would come with some & nothing. I finally catch him again & ask him. He comes back minutes later & gives it to the table next to me. Then he takes there orde
Lance C.,"Tampa, FL",121,91,15,1.0,2/3/2013,"Not a fan. Overpriced gloppy food, $8 for glass of house Chardonnay (with a lovely lipstick stain on the glass that they server acted annoyed about replacing, very loud, weak service.  At this price point there are tons of better options.  I suggest looking elsewhere."
Desiree M.,"Apollo Beach, FL",117,19,103,3.0,10/26/2014,"Meeting your daughters  new  beau for the first time seemed stressful enough we wanted a place - halfway point to meet- we chose International Plaza(Tampa)-cheesecake factory-(CF). The kids had never been to CF so they were thrilled. We took our time with Menu (as it is extensive) and placed our orders- everything took a long time to get- from drinks to dessert. Food was fabulous but overall experience could have been better. Waiter was nice, but never offered suggestions to what to order with such a large menu. Didn't offer any drink specials, so we didn't know if there was any (hubby got a Margarita) that was very small and even commented to me (wonder how much this is)- it was all a take your order and we didn't see him again- it's a busy place- we get it- but it took a long time to just get tea and water. We enjoyed Factory Nachos- all my recommendations as I had been there the most times of the four of us. None of our Food came out at the same time. Which is annoying. Kids didn't navigate well with menu after I gave them several suggestions- they ended up with some quesadillas and a Caesars Salad. I enjoyed the SantaFe salad- I should of gotten dressing on the side- but forgot to ask and since waiter never really talked he didn't ask if I wanted it that way- it was great as always but I'm dieting and the less dressing option would have been a better choice. Husband ordered Rene's Special and I tried all of it- it was awesome- now this I remember my husband asking the waiter what do you suggest as a sandwich choice and he told my husband the chicken salad- that was the only suggestion he made (when asked) - we ordered deserts and coffees and the desert came to us with nothing to eat with- we couldn't find waiter to get forks so we waited for coffee to arrive which took quite some time to even ask for a fork. We ordered two slices of cheesecake- Godiva and Peanut butter something my husband wanted- when the Cheesecake arrived it didn't even have the Godiva Chocolate on it- hence the name! So since I couldn't eat without a fork I just stared at it knowing it was wrong (only b/c I get it every time I have visited). When he finally came back with just two forks-(never asked if we needed four) we asked for two more forks and I mentioned that the chocolate was missing. He then left and promptly returned with two pieces of wrapped Godiva chocolates. That really disappointed me- just the thought that if it was my first visit I wouldn't of known about the chocolate. And there was no apology - or discount or apology for making us wait several minutes staring at a Cheesecake we couldn't eat. Food was great but unfortunately the service not up to par this time."
Janine J.,"Meriden, CT",3,22,1,4.0,5/6/2015,"The waiter Blake was nice and funny.  The atmosphere was nice. The food was good, the alcoholic drinks are very good."
Ryan M.,"Allen, TX",69,7,,1.0,9/22/2015,"Sunday afternoon my family and I went to this location with a couple of friends who were in town and wanted to try it out. After a small table change due to being sat at a way too small table we re sit and proceed to order our drinks, after this however we waited for 3 different trips to our table before our server would take our order. Finally we had to stop her and tell her we needed to order as it had been 20 mins since we had sat down. After waiting for another 50 mins we finally received our ice cold food which our guests refused to eat since by this point they were completely fed up. Finally we asked to see a manager and to her credit she did try to offer other meals but at that point I think my guests we're just tired of being in the building for more than an hour without food. While I appreciate that the manager offered us new meals after an hour, as a person in the business I know that your management should be involved with talking to the table after 25 minutes is waiting for good, let alone double that time, at 50 minutes without a manager coming by to assure us that the food would be out in a prompt manner we were finally fed up. This is unfortunate as these people had come from over an hour away just to dine at this particular restaurant and their entire trip was basically ruined because the thing they came for they didn't get to do. This is a major dereliction of duty by the management and the server involved, but I'm not naming anyone because we all have bad days. I hope you fix this!"
Colleen Z.,"Ann Arbor, MI",54,337,12,2.0,12/1/2015,"Hubby and I chose to eat lunch outside. It was a beautiful day and sitting inside was just wrong. Here are the problems: 1) table was really wobbly and no matter how we tried to adjust it was still wobbly, wobbly as in my hubby had to keep pressure on one side during the entire lunch or our drinks would have spilled. 2) my first set of silverware was dirty, as in pieces of food on the utensils. I asked for another set and yes, one of the three pieces was dirty. I cleaned it myself rather than ask for another set. 3) Frozen pina colada. Gross. The drink was a straight corn syrup with frozen pineapple on top with toasted coconut on the rim of the glass. Gross. 4) Asian chicken salad. It was ok, not great but just ok. It is obvious that the manager does not pay attention to small details which would make the dining experience better. I've eaten at this particular Cheesecake Factory on several occasions but after yesterday, I won't be going back. The mall has too many other choices which will get my future business."
Amy A.,"Largo, Tampa Bay, FL",100,374,177,3.0,10/1/2014,"I love Cheesecake Factory, it is one of my absolute favorites, you can always get a good meal here, there is something for everyone and I've never been disappointed here. Brandon had never been so we decided this would be good for date night last week once I landed, since it's so close to the airport. YUM! Our server was super pleasant, only complaint was that we didn't get one of each of the breads we only got the brown bread which is sort of weird tasting but we didn't ask for the other so that's our own fault. I ordered the pasta Di vinci which is always amazing, chicken noodles and mushrooms in a wine sauce how can you go wrong. As usual I had over half my meal left to take home with me.... seriously the portions are huge here! Brandon ordered the meatloaf,..... I think you honestly have to be starving to order this.....it came out with 3 huge slices of meatloaf, mashed potatoes and he substituted  for macaroni, so much food! He enjoyed the meal and had enough left over for two lunches later that week. We were so stuffed we didn't have room for cheesecake but it's my favorite part, i highly recommend the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake :)"
John N.,"Houston, TX",92,59,60,1.0,10/4/2014,"Of the many Cheesecake Factory chains we've been to, this has to be the worse one. Lack of execution , 2 burnt orders of sweet potato fries, forgetting side dishes, and subpar service. Lets pick it up Tampa!"
Shenia J.,"Brandon, FL",30,88,391,4.0,9/9/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory,  specifically because of the different flavors of cheesecake.   It's a great place to go have a meal with a group of friends.  I can't think of any other place that serves pumpernickel bread.   The portion sizes are humongous.   However,  there is a skinnylicious menu for those who want portion control.  My only complaint is that the menu is too extensive.   I know that sounds crazy but you could get a headache trying to figure out what to order."
Mike M.,"St. Petersburg, FL",1,30,2,2.0,11/12/2012,"I have always enjoyed Cheesecake Factory.  They are a very consistant reliable staple in the lunch/dinner rotation.  Usually, you know what your getting when you go here regardless of the city.  In Tampa at the International Mall location it is a very different story. After the 40-50 typical minute wait, you are seated.  But... the restaurant seating is atrocious.  You are either on top of someone or in a cavernous corner somewhere off the beaten path. The floors are more slippery than the ice at the Forum and you would think that if 3 different people fall in the span of a 3 hour period that they would do something about it. As with most places there are good and bad servers.  Our waitress this weekend was great, but swamped.  The issue we had was that a server/runner dropped a plate of food in someones lap at the table and then just decided to run away..    The manager came over and apologized, but in an unfortunate sort of ""I'm here because I have to be"" type of apology.  No offer for a free dessert or to take care of the peanut and soy sauce dry cleaning bill...  Just ""oh well""  With such an amazing variety of items on the menu, you expect better.  It's hit or miss with the dishes here and it shouldn't be.   You can do better Tampa!"
Michelle G.,"Pinellas Park, FL",70,16,2,5.0,7/14/2014,"I have had the pleasure of enjoying this restaurant twice now, and I have one word...WOW !!! I had lunch & dinner on these diff visits.
