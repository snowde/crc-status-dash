Debra C.,"Spring Hill, FL",1,4,,5.0,4/12/2015,They have excellent chicken pot stickers and crispy wontons. I love there Adams cheesecake :-)
Ivette R.,"Miami, FL",268,1047,251,1.0,10/4/2014,OK I'm highly highly disappointed this Cheesecake Factory is the worst and I mean worst the staff is rude and could care less.Also the Women's bathroom always has a line they only have 3 toilets in the bathroom really and I saw one boy who pissed on his mom because of how loud the automatic toilet flushed yuck the bathroom is not properly clean this particular location is humongous but our waiter was extremely rude and our food was bland this is the worst Cheesecake Factory ever don't go to this one go to the one in BRANDON way better food.
Rachel H.,"Nashville, TN",200,206,47,4.0,9/10/2013,"It's a chain, I get it.   You have to wait forever for a table, I know. But they are consistently delicious.   Get the beet burger, it is one of my all time favorite foods and I feel like I've eaten a lot of great food.  It comes with french fries, I think it was under $10 and when you've spent all day shopping, a meal, out the door, for around $15 is a steal at International Mall.  If you add a peach Bellini to salve your stress after waiting for an hour to get in, that is okay too and no one will judge you for spending the money. Every fall, CF produces (that is what baking is called when it's a large company) a pumpkin cheesecake that is exactly the same as you remember from last year.  It is the best, it never disappoints and I look forward to a slice when the air gets even a smidge crispy.  Perfection."
Brendan C.,"Tampa, FL",246,123,4,3.0,8/3/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is the same every time, although their prices range from cheap to expensive, at least you have the largest menu on earth to pick and choose from. If people actually took a look at the menu they'd realize most of their food is quick order (fried, sauteed, pasta, etc) so it's no wonder they're able to get away with a cheap menu despite the fact the food can be found at a fast food restaurant.. Although I have to admit some of their menu items (avocado rolls, fried zucchini, veggie pasta, etc) are always a good staple food, I don't think any of the food here can be considered healthy. It's overloaded with fat, grease, oil, etc to boost the flavors of the food but not always the best of quality. This CheeseCake factory is large, usually there isn't much of a line considering the number of other gourmet restaurants in a quarter mile from this location. I've never had a bad meal but never had a amazing one. I'd say it's the 'last resort late night dinner' place in my book when most other restaurants in tampa are closed."
Eric C.,"Sarasota, FL",0,4,,5.0,4/24/2015,Soo good!  Everything I've had was great! Don't have a single complaint! and the cheesecakes!!! highly recommended! Won't regret it
Jean E.,"Tampa, FL",54,8,3,4.0,1/24/2015,"Absolutely delicious . Went lady night with my husband.  Had crab bites YUM, dynamite shrimp TASTY Cuban rolls DELISH Clam chowder GREAT . And then some coffee and cheesecake.  Great job. Will return shortly when possible."
Kim D.,"Tampa, FL",0,2,,3.0,3/9/2015,"This was the first time I've ever been here. I have heard great things from this restaurant. But I didn't let that make me biased. The food here was delicious, but the wait and servers I can't rave too much about. Our waitress seemed like she was purposely avoiding us. She would toss us our menu and rush off to lean on the wall. We have been there for quite some time, ready to leave. All we needed was to ask for the check but she headed over to a table with people who just sat down. Also, the other waiter that brought out our food seemed to be really pissed off. Overall, the hospitality wasn't that great, but the food made up for it. I would go again because I suppose everyone has their bad days. But I expect not to have this happen again for it to be a good restaurant."
Pamela M.,"Sarasota, FL",224,257,52,4.0,7/3/2011,Always a winner with some massive full meal salads! The portions are so big that there is never enough room for the Cheesecake. If your planning on having cheesecake make sure to share everything else to leave room. You can't go wrong here and even if it looks like a lot of people waiting I've never waited more than 30 minutes. Enjoy!
Dana S.,"St Petersburg, FL",217,117,92,4.0,7/5/2014,"I am a fan of the cheesecake factory mainly because their cheesecakes are so damn delicious! Last time I was here I got the herb crusted salmon lunch and the salmon was cooked good, but the asparagus and mashed potatoes seemed a bit undercooked, and I didn't really like the lemon sauce that came with the salmon. I got the banana cheesecake and it was pretty good. I think my favorite thing to get here is the Bistro Shrimp pasta, and the Thai lettuce wraps. I also love their green tea. It's a great place to come with friends, good to go early because this place does get packed fast."
Diane H.,"St Petersburg, FL",45,378,214,4.0,11/19/2012,"I love the food here. Everything is awesome. Beware of those delicious drinks though, they ad up in price, as well as those desserts!"
Bob B.,"Lafayette, IN",18,6,,2.0,7/19/2014,"I am normally a fan of this chain restaurant, but this place was abysmally horrid. The night started on the wrong foot when we waited 25 minutes for our drinks. After that fiasco we were given old stale hard bread that had the consistency of settled concrete. We finally were able to order our food and had to wait about 30 minutes. When our food arrived my shrimp tasted a little sour but I ate them any way, an act that i would regret the next morning. After all of this our waitress apologized and was very courteous which is why two stars instead of one. All in all i wish that our experience here was better."
So Rene X.,"Gretna, LA",3,24,2,5.0,1/6/2015,"Always good, and never disappointing. Good food, and to die for cheescakes!!! I've compared these to Copeland's Cheesecakes and there is simply no comparison, the namr Cheesecake Factory speaks for itself. Also found out they have the best homemade Sangria's I've ever tasted. The only problem you will have is how to decide between the red or white, because the both were delicious!!!!!!!"
Kurtis P.,"Matawan, NJ",56,435,2,4.0,9/10/2014,"We stopped in for lunch before our flight home and got exactly what we expected...your typical Cheesecake Factory experience, in every sense. The options are endless, the place is nicely kept, the atmosphere is relaxed, the food is great and the service is adequate at best."
Noel T.,"St Petersburg, FL",4,25,3,2.0,11/20/2014,"I have always been a satisfied customer at the Cheesecake Factory, until last weekend.  DO NOT order the shrimp club sandwich!  I barely tasted the shrimp and paid $14.95 for toast, lettuce and bacon.  Very disappointing...My boyfriend's chicken madeira, on the other hand, was delicious and worth every penny!"
Vickie J.,"St. Petersburg, FL",94,145,21,3.0,9/17/2014,"Decent food and a large amount of food, although the meal is pricey. With this location at least, they add so many tables and chairs it's hard to get around because there's no walking space. Overall a good time though - just pick somewhere else if you're looking for an intimate quiet meal."
Frances Z.,"Toronto, Canada",1,40,,1.0,4/15/2016,"Horrible service, more specifically customer service. I popped in here last night to get a single piece of cheesecake to go. Pretty straight forward, right? Wrong. I walked in and there were 5 people behind the desk. They all did an excellent job ignoring me. I didn't understand why? Were they busy - no. Did they see me - yes. I made sure by saying hello to them, but still no response or a cool nod. The more I stood there, the more annoyed I became. Another couple showed up wanting to get a take out order. I was happy because I figured between us for sure someone would serve us. Finally someone else showed up and took our order and advised that the only person who could cash us out was on the phone. Can you imagine? The cashier had been on the phone this whole time. Well she cashed me out. My order was 8 dollars and change. I gave her $10 and the exact change hoping that I would get back 2 singles. She gave me one single and 4 quarters, no wait she substituted a quarter with a nickel. Like really how stupid do I look. I called her out on it. What a dumb cashier. She gave me 4 quarters so I had change to tip her, no wait, in anticipation that I might not tip her, she tipped herself 20 cents. Wrong she got nothing because like I said the service was horrible and a dumb young cashier took me for a fool. I'm giving one star because the cheesecake was pretty good. Too bad no one wants my business bad enough to serve me with respect."
S R.,"Spring Hill, FL",0,3,,1.0,1/18/2016,"don't waste your time, poor poor service. First of all we arrived at a non busy time @4:40 pm and were told ten minutes. We waited over that ten minutes. We are a family of five, mind you they had no issues seating parties of two or three. So when the hostess went to seat us, she did not see the big booth in back they asked to be seated at, clean, so she sat us back up front. Did not see anyone go clean it either. Then another hostess five minutes later asked for us again to be seated, again the booth was not ready for us. I asked to speak to the manager and she said we would have to go up front again. We didn't want have to do this for the third time. We think this manager of this restaurant needs to get on his staff better and not them just walk around aimlessly. Never got this kind of service at the Brandon one!"
Precious J.,"Arlington, TX",46,273,861,4.0,5/7/2013,Great food and desserts. At this location it's best to call ahead due to popularity and long wait times on the weekends.
Rachel F.,"Land O' Lakes, FL",5,34,11,2.0,7/23/2013,"A few years ago, a relative brought my family, including visiting relatives here for a gathering.  The restaurant was very busy and other patrons were often disrespectful.  No one was managing the floor and the wait was long. We all considered the meals to be bland.   The few who ordered dessert had them to-go.  I never considered returning.   I was recently asked to go here for a business gathering.  Managers were present and the overly rude customers to other patrons were asked by managers to behave or leave.  This reduced the noise level and reduced the tension.     The menu is now different.  As I've always thought, no fish dish on the menu is fresh, but the prices will make you think so.  The calamari is good   Granted, the better management is appreciated, but I would recommend The Palm over Cheesecake Factory."
Patrick Q.,"St Petersburg, FL",4,20,,2.0,5/24/2014,"Food is pretty basic. Cheesecake is amazing, but they won't take reservations or call ahead seating for large groups. They told us Wed just have to wait... 2 hours! Ridiculous, and although the portions are huge, the food certainly isn't worth a 2 hour wait. I don't think I'll be coming back after being treated this way."
