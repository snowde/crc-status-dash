Anu R.,"Camp Hill, PA",2,19,,1.0,1/22/2016,"Food was ok, service was real bad! The waiter we got didn't have common sense to ask us for drinks, didn't bring us the bread. We have to ask for water and drinks, he is weirdest waiter I had seen in my life. Can't complain about food though! I am not going back to this place at any cost."
Athena C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",27,22,1,2.0,3/7/2015,"Let me first start by saying I love Cheesecake Factory! With that being said I have to talk about a few things that they need to fix at this location. The bathroom......yuck. Someone needs to check it periodically to make sure it's not gross which it was the night I was here. Also my menu was gross. Had slimy food inside on one of the pages. Not too hungry after first going to bathroom and then opening the menu. The bread, Hard and was put on our table a little later than expected but it did help me get over the disgusted feeling I was dealing with from the first 2 issues lol. Our waiter was very nice but could have been a wee bit more attentive. Our food was delicious though as expected. I was just a little thrown back at a glass of pink lemonade costing $5. Is that normal? We spent $25 on lemonade alone. It's not like a lemon is a delicacy or something. Overall, I still love Cheesecake Factory but this location left me feeling... EH"
Phillip G.,"Reno, NV",286,275,90,2.0,11/17/2012,"Our server was very nice and attentive (and new) so don't  let the two stars mislead you. This low ranking is because of the excessive time it took to get our food. One salad, one sandwich, and a plate of jerk chicken took more than 30 minutes to deliver from the point of order. When we actually got the food, it was all quite tasty. The wait soured the overall experience though."
J J.,"Bridgewater, NJ",21,638,81,3.0,8/11/2014,"Service was great.  Food was pretty good for a change.  For the most part, Cheesesteak factory has been mostly miss.  On average I usually don't get a very good meal here."
Corey G.,"Tampa, FL",279,80,41,2.0,2/25/2013,The food really is middle of the road okay.  If you like oversized portions & astronomical calorie counts though this place is for you.  Not my cup of tea.
Jenny L.,"Tampa, FL",0,3,,3.0,11/26/2014,"We waited forever for our food and when the food came, the steak was over cook consider that we ordered rare steak. The only think that good about this place is cocktail."
Grace C.,"Tampa, FL",313,350,218,4.0,11/11/2012,"This is one of my favorite chains to visit but the wait is normally extremely long. Thankfully, most of the chains are located near a mall so you can kill time while some sad person in your party waits within tracking distance of the beeper :) Ever since I've changed my lifestyle to adopt healthier habits, I've paid close attention to the calorie counts of my old favorites. Cheesecake Factory has gotten a really bad rap (with good reason) for their large, salty, fatty and caloric portions. I'm really happy to see that since my last visit to the chain, they've included a Skinnylicious(C) Menu that is separate from the main menu.  Each section marks a guesstimate of the calories. I ordered their lettuce wrapped chicken tacos in the ""less than 490 calories"" section. It was extremely flavorful and I loved it! I chose the Mediterranean Chicken Lettuce Tacos that had a side of Tzatziki sauce which was thicky and tangy. Everything was delicious and I finished the entire thing. The table was also served complimentary bread which was hard to turn down since it came warm. I did avoid the side of butter that it came with. My boyfriend ordered a Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club Sandwich that came with a side of fries. I may or may not have taken a few bites of his fries. He enjoyed his sandwich and finished it completely. My brother ordered the Smokehouse BBQ Burger that was bigger than his head. He had no problems finishing it though and he loved every bite. It seemed extremely juicy and flavorful. It was piled high with fried onion rings which my brother raved about.  After our savory dishes, our table shared the dessert. How can you not save room for dessert when you are here?  It was hard to pinpoint which cheesecake we wanted to try since all of them sounded fantastic.  We ordered the Hersey Chocolate Bar Cheesecake which was delicious and perfectly creamy. We managed to finish half of it before we asked our server to put it in a to-go box.  I'm a huge fan of restaurants aiming to be healthier.  This location had a nice outdoor patio that I saw plenty of people outside enjoying the Florida sun. We opted to sit indoors though. Service was prompt and helpful without being intrusive."
Nicole M.,"Orlando, FL",15,117,6,4.0,12/29/2012,"I really enjoyed my visit today! I thought Saturday at lunchtime would be crazy busy but we only waited ten minutes to be seated. The boyfriend and I got a regular and pomegranate mojito while we were waiting; they were pretty good, but not the best ever.  Our waiter was so professional; before he even came over with menus he noticed that we had cocktails and brought over ice water and lemons in a dish, I really appreciated that. Took our orders and put it right in, and then brought warm bread out, yummy!  The boyfriend got a Cajun burger with the house salad. He liked the balsamic vinaigrette but thought his burger could have been spicier, since it was touted as cajun (but his family is from Louisiana, so he always has high, spicy standards!) The highlight was definitely my entree, which was the four cheese pasta with chicken. Aside from the small fact that I think there could've been more chicken, talk about a ton of food! I even ordered the lunch portion and I ate maybe a third of it (granted, I ate my fair share of bread, but even with that, this was a ginormous portion). There was fresh cheese everywhere; it made this Italian girl happy! Topped off the meal with cheesecake; boyfriend got the Kailua cheesecake and I got the cookie dough cheesecake. Divine. And we had enough to take home with that too. And our bill came to under 60 dollars for lunch, which I find pretty darn good for alcohol and three boxes to take home and enjoy later."
AaronErin D.,"BOCA GRANDE, FL",29,178,92,5.0,6/25/2014,"We love the Cheesecake Factory, simple as that. It's hands down one of the best ""chains"" out there. They have an excellent selection of speciality drinks and they even offer a ""skinny drink list"" with many delicious  options. The menu is a tad intimidating, you will probably have a hard time deciding or you may change you're mind more than a few times.  Keep in mind the portions are massive, check out the small plates section of the menu if you aren't looking for a huge meal out before a day of shopping. The servers are extremely polite and friendly here , we have always had a great experience at this location. We personally enjoy their tacos, white bean chili, burgers and chicken salad sandwich. Enjoy!"
Sam Q.,"Tampa, FL",223,350,2362,4.0,2/5/2012,"I'm a big fan of Cheesecake Factory.  They used to have a dish with skirt steak and white rice that was yummy, but for some reason they took it off the menu.  They have an AWESOME menu.  If you can't find something to like here, you just don't like to eat! :)  Portions are huge, and the salad dressings are rich and delicious.  And, of course, there is the cheesecakes.  All I will say on this topic is that one slice of red velvet cheesecake is 1250 calories, clocking in at 18 Weight Watchers points.  Worth every single one. I find the atmosphere very clean, modern, and inviting, and the service has been great every time I've been.  I try to avoid rush hour because it gets packed, despite being a large restaurant.  I'm a fan!"
William T.,"Lakeland, FL",88,39,34,5.0,5/26/2013,I had the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club and the wife had the grilled Pork chop with potatoes and spinach. Both were ample in size and had the right balance of taste. I ordered a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup CC 2 go which looked marvelous. Thought about the Oreo but succumbed to my favorite candy.
Sharen U.,"Tampa, FL",6,11,15,5.0,8/8/2014,"Went with my daughter last night to Cheesecake Factory at the International mall. I have only been to this chain in Ft Lauderdale, it has been a few years, so we were ready gor a visit. We went about 7:30, boy was it busy for a Thursday night! We decided to sit at the bar. I am so glad we did. our bartender was Tracy P. She was so cheerful and friendly. We were drinking, just tea totelers for the evening, but we had a couple appetizers. I highly recommend the Thai lettuse wraps. They were delicious and a huge portion. We also split a small plate option...crab cakes. 6 meatball sized crab cakes. It was a great evening!"
G G.,"Tampa, FL",18,22,7,1.0,3/14/2015,"If you have a large party GO ELSEWHERE!!! The Cheesecake Factory doesn't want you, your money or a good review. Called to make a reservation for 9 people and they refused to take a reservation because it's  a Sunday?!  Not talking about their brunch this was for dinner. They said we could come and stand in line and they would try to accommodate us?! What?  Now if you're smart you know this would be a nightmare. Any other restaurant would have jumped at the chance book 9 people. We will have to go to a restaurant who wants the business."
Danan C.,"Clearwater, FL",123,301,83,4.0,9/17/2012,"As with any chain, the food value/taste is fairly similar across the board. This one I think the chefs value the art of food a little more than others.  The issue with this place is that it is JAM-PACKED during dinner time. Good for them, bad for you when your wait is 40 minutes."
Katrina P.,"Las Vegas, NV",923,276,186,4.0,7/12/2012,"I have to say that I never have a bad experiene when I go to cheesecake factory. I do think that some of the prices are higher, but if you go weekdays before 6 there's a happy hour that includes $5 apps! The potstickers are fabulous! (this coming from an Asian chick ;) Their fruit teas are splendid & the free bread is an added bonus! The menus is very varietal with something for every body!"
Michelle P.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",1,17,14,5.0,10/2/2014,"My husband and I ate at the Cheesecake factory for the first time last night.  Out waitress, Penny, was super friendly and very hospitable!  My drink never became empty and being almost 9 months pregnant, I consume a ton of water! My entree had a little mix up, (we are all human and make mistakes) and both Penny and her manager Brad were very attentive in making sure it was corrected immediately.  Not only did Brad rush over to apologize and fulfill my needs but he offered me a free piece of their cheesecake.  I was unable to decide if I wanted the regular pumpkin or the pumpkin pecan so he brought us both kinds to try and it was on the house :) The food was delicious and I was very impressed. I will definitely be back to that location very soon!"
Kai R.,"Elgin, IL",125,345,55,5.0,6/25/2014,"I love Cheesecake Factory, as the food is always excellent. The server this time, even got our food wrong, but it was still good. Try the Lulu salad, it rocks! I would tell you to arrive early, as this place gets busy and the parking will make you walk in the desert for 40 days and 40 nights."
Donna A.,"Naples, FL",5,66,23,3.0,8/16/2014,"Food at Cheesecake is always great. That's one of the reasons I love coming here and this this time it was equally yummy. We were  seated right away, but service was very slow. Arrived around 3:30 for a party of 3 and didn't leave until 5:30. Drinks were served right away and then everything slowed down. Took 25 min before we got bread. From the time we sat down to when the food came out it was over an hour. We were on a time limit and that made it an extra frustrating experience. In addition to the fact that 3 of the tables around us with larger parties were seated after us got their meals all in a reasonable time."
Danny S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,1,,3.0,9/30/2014,"The food is nice and tasty. Service was good. but the soft drink regular price shoud be ~$2, they charge ~$4"
