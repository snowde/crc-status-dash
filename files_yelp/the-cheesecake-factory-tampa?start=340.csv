Lis R.,"Tampa, FL",0,1,,2.0,9/27/2014,Where do I begin. The restaurant is so dark I had to use my phone light to read the menu. We order Baja chicken tacos which by the way were cold..we send it back and I guess they forgot the chicken the second time. My partner had to sit and watch me eat because they took so long. Her chicken should of have a butter sauce.. there was no sauce. . Cheesecake factory for me went from 10 to 1 ..not a good experience
Nolan R.,"Tampa, FL",111,295,94,5.0,8/23/2011,"This restaurant has a little something for even the pickiest eaters.  We all know TCF is very consistent and their food is pretty high quality. However, I wanted to write this review about their little known Happy Hour. Talk about value. I order the Southern Chicken Sandwiches and Onion Rings. Well...for $5 you get 4...count 'em 4...sandwiches. They're a TCF version of the Chick-Fil-A original sandwich. The Onion rings come in a 1ft stack @ $5. They have a ton of other stuff on there for apps too. I really think that this might be the best deal going for HH in Tampa. The drinks for HH are pretty good deal, but they don't price them so you can get hammered for $10. That could be dangerous anyways...being intoxicated at the mall could get VERY expensive. I should add in closing that the HH is only offered in the bar. Like always, the seating in there if first come, first served. So, if you walk in...look to your right, if there's a free high-top table - it's yours."
Jennifer R.,"Clearwater, FL",27,13,,4.0,9/3/2015,"the food here is awesome!  we ordered steak and shrimp combo and it was perfect, the sauce was delicious!! i had chicken with mozarella cheese on top and it was good too, .  and yes their cheesecake is great!  i love the variety they have.  only reason i dont give it 5 its because they r  always ssssoooo busy its insane!!! and they dont take reservations.  they should have enough seats for the people amount of people that stand both inside and outside waiting to be seated."
Phillip O.,"Tampa, FL",1,9,2,5.0,7/17/2015,"Went there tonight on a Friday night. Got there around 745. Was told wait is 45 mins, kinda sucks but it was super slammed! So we hung out at the international plaza walked around the mall and went to the bar and got beers. Suddenly a table right by he bar opened up and we sat down. Immediately a server came up and told us if we wanted to sit there and order! Yes please!! 45 min wait turned into a 20 min wait. We ordered the guacamole appetizer-Delicious with big avocado chunks and perfect spice. The menu is huge so it was hard to pick but I ordered the steak Diane with mushrooms, onions in some amazing brown sauce with homemade mashed potatoes! My friend ordered the chicken biscuit and loved it. Parents had the fish and chips and mom had the shrimp rice dish. We all loved it! Of course for desert we had to get a cheesecake. We split a key lime mango slice with whipped cream and coconut shreds! Everything was amazing, I will definitely be back!!"
Magaly V.,"Toa Baja, Puerto Rico",0,30,5,2.0,7/12/2015,"I don't get what people find so awesome about CF. Huge menu, impossible to read under such dimmed lights. Uncomfortable chairs, so-so Service, Mediocre overpriced chain restaurant food. Cheesecakes in every possible flavor...yes, but again... overpriced! Sorry...not a fan."
Danesh J.,"Jersey City, NJ",174,379,463,2.0,11/25/2011,"So many tables. It's very cramped. You're basically eating with another party if you sit inside in the bar area. Good thing is they have tons of options. Bad thing, most of the food tastes the same. I found the thai wraps to give the most bang for the buck on variety of taste and portion size. In general, if we go, we get a variety of small plates or one small plate and a pizza  to share with a cheesecake for dessert.  If you're looking for a romantic spot or a place to have a conversation, go elsewhere. Also, I find the cheesecake options pretty limited."
Tommy C.,"Round Rock, TX",0,7,1,1.0,1/30/2015,"First let me say I know food.  I know how to cook good food and I know great food from gross food.  I was not impressed at all with the food.  I ordered Jamaican Pepper shrimp and chicken and it was no where near as spicy as it should have been.  It was rather boring and just plain not properly seasoned.  The chicken pieces were not fresh, they were obvuously previously frozen chicken tenders, they were soggy and were actually difficult to get down. The place was extremely busy which probably leads to the poor quality food.  It has the name recognition which is about all the CF has nowadays.  The menu has way way too many items on it for any of them to be great.  It was my first and last ever visit to the Cheesecake Factory.  Their cheesecake is good, I've had it before from takeout but that is where they need to stay focused because the food is not in the class of foods on which they base their prices. If you want dessert go here, if you want dinner go somewhere else."
Jessica B.,"Kansas City, MO",122,193,1,3.0,10/26/2011,"I've been avoiding Cheesecake Factory for as long as I can remember.  There was something about it's carefully manufactured elegance and novel-length menu that just made me think that nothing good could possibly come from this place.  And the hype.  My god, the hype.  I don't know how many times I've heard ""OMG, you've never been to Cheesecake Factory.  You HAVE to go to Cheesecake Factory!  It's sooooooo good!"" Well, I've now been here.  The menu is extensive, which makes me think there's no way a restaurant with a menu of this size can possibly do ALL of these things well.  I think the should trim some of the fat and focus on doing a few thing really well as opposed to a lot of things in a mediocre way. The ambiance and elegance were not as cheaply done as I thought.  Even I will admit, it's a damn pretty restaurant. And the food?  Good, but there's something about it that feels off.  It tastes like it's mass produced.  Again, it's good, and I ate my leftovers the next day but there's something about it that just feels like it isn't authentic.  Not to mention, my entree (Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp) could have easily fed a family of four. And this may come as a shocker but I did not have any cheesecake.  I'm a picky cheesecake person.  And after the entree I just wasn't up for tasting anything else that felt like it was made in batches of 1000 servings."
Chad Z.,"Tampa, FL",3,16,3,4.0,11/22/2012,"I love the atmosphere that The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) offers - it is semi-upscale and classy but at the same time it is casual. It has a classy aura to it right when you walk in the door with the decorations. The servers even look like they belong at a super upscale restaurant.  Once you are seated and you are able to look at the menu you can tell that you aren't at an ordinary restaurant. They offer many types of food - italian, to me, is most prominent. The cheesecake is obviously phenomenal!  This location didn't get a 5 star vote from me for 2 reasons. First, there is always a long wait to be seated. My primary issue with this is the hostess told me they didn't accept reservations, but I just read here on Yelp that they do. I've been there three times and I've asked each time and they told me they didn't. The second reason why this TCF didn't earn a 5 star rating is because of the seating arrangements. After you've waited forever to be seated you might as well be sitting with strangers. Each time I've been to TCF I could clearly hear what the table to the next of me was talking about. The seating arrangements are entirely too close to each other.  Overall, I love The Cheesecake Factory. The waits and the seating aren't enough to stop me from going there. I personally think the food and the desserts are well worth the wait!"
Jennifer K.,"Bradenton, FL",84,189,183,4.0,10/22/2011,"If you come here, you must leave with a piece of cheesecake for later.  My absolute favorite is the keylime cheesecake.  Second favorite has to be the caramel turtle.  I recently tried the pumpkin pecan which was very good.  Note: the pecan pie portion is ice cold though. In regards to the food, there is so much to choose from.  I like the orange chicken dish and most of the pasta dishes.  My husbands favorite is the four cheese pasta.  Service is very good.  I have never been disappointed.  There is always a wait for a table unless you are an early bird and eat at 5.   I recommend NOT to eat outside unless you are a smoker.  I came here for dessert one night and we decided to sit outside because the weather was nice... But I was coughing and covering my mouth the entire time so if you do not smoke, don't seat outside."
Endia K.,"Tampa, FL",1,4,4,4.0,7/29/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. The last time I went I had to wait about 45 minutes before being seated. Despite the long wait, my waitress was very sweet and attentive. I ordered the Chicken piccata. It was really good and of course to top it off, I had to have some cheesecake."
Rae R.,"Sarasota, FL",10,7,2,1.0,11/2/2013,"One star is doing them a favor!!  Waited for over an hour for an order I called in. I called upon my arrival, waited giving the benefit of the doubt that it's a busy Saturday night. Finally I went inside..see my food sitting on the counter and asked then spoke with a manager!  Another hour later...finally received the food. Bad job Cheesecake Factory!!!  And I was still nice enough to pay for the food...thanks for the desserts, iced tea and a long waste of 2 hours!!"
AM S.,"Lutz, FL",103,1,,1.0,3/22/2013,"Begin rant.  No photos.  Just commentary: Cheesecake Factory, International Plaza, Tampa, Florida - Let me begin by declaring that I'll take a Carnival Cruise before I ever go back there. The GM is an assclown, the Middle Manager is an assclown and whoever prepared my LETTUCE sandwich with the hint of almond chicken salad is too.  Tipped the sweet waitress well because she tried to give us good service and it's not her fault she has horrible bosses.  So ... you heard it here first... I firmly believe that you either belong in the hospitality business or you don't. Don't make the mistake of doing it if it doesn't fit you. It's as simple as that ... and when any of my friends come for a visit, it won't be on our itinerary... Promise!  End rant."
Dave H.,"Boca Raton, FL",1176,675,784,5.0,7/4/2013,"ok, ok, 2 TCF (or CCF as some acronym it) visits in one trip, but MAN how can you drive by without stopping? Mojito with agave rocks pre-flight, btw...5 minutes from Tampa Intrntnl. Parking lot for mall is abit of a nightmare, but worth it, of course."
Mike H.,"Federal Way, WA",115,119,216,4.0,2/17/2014,"Our waiter Manny was delightful and catered to our needs. Very polite and personable. The manager on duty Sunday night brought my pregnant wife a free bowl of soup for the longer than usual wait. Food was classic factory good, and service was exceptional. Well done Cheesecake Factory. Thank you."
Vilmaris C.,"Clearwater, FL",1,10,1,4.0,6/26/2014,Love love this place for their huge selection of cheesecake ..as for dinner it was OK waited a long time for our food to come and the bread we got while we waited was cold and stale as well as very hard the butter was too frozen to smear on the bread a mess but I ordered the chicken bilagio and it tasted amazing the pasta cooked perfect the Parmesan sauce was to Die for but you have to order extra because you only get a little on the plate!!!!!  and the chicken perfectly breaded and crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle it's become an instant favorite all topped with an arugula salad so amazing!!!.
Rob B.,"Zephyrhills, FL",26,242,109,2.0,2/15/2012,Why can I never get a good meal here? Ordered the wasabi crusted rare tuna expecting a bold pop of flavor from the wasabi and the damned thing tasted like there was no seasoning whatsoever. The rice and veggies were bland too. I was so heart broken by my entree that I didn't even want the cheesecake which I know is good. I would recommend eating at one of the other restaurants in this section of the mall and treat yourself to the cheesecake at the end of your evening.
Domenic M.,"Mountain View, CA",7,67,,3.0,3/18/2012,"Our trip to The Cheesecake Factory was with a party of 14. If your party is of a more reasonable size, your mileage may certainly vary. I will update my review if we decide to return to this business with a 2- or 4-person party, and the experience is different. Valet parking was prompt and secured our vehicle right in front of the restaurant (which elicited no complaints from us!). The wait was 30 minutes after we arrived, although we had called ahead an hour before to let them know to expect a largish party. After they were unable to produce a table in a reasonable time, we agreed to sit in the bar area. Bar service before the meal was excellent: fast, humorous, and attentive. Service was slow but our server had a good personality and made no mistakes on any of our orders or drinks. Recommendations were provided and appreciated for first-timers. Our meals ran the gamut from bland to excellent, and no one had any ""major"" complaints, or had to send anything back. Personally, my meal was shockingly tasteless for the amount of ingredients. One thing to watch out for: the automatically-included gratuity wasn't clear on the receipt, leaving some of us to accidentally tip 40% or more. Oops!"
Renee M.,"Tampa, FL",48,87,23,2.0,1/11/2014,"There has got to be something that this location can do to help with the wait-time problem. I visited Cheesecake Factory last night for a friend's event. My friend showed up an hour before the scheduled dinner time to get on the waiting list for a table. We showed up on time and it was another hour and a half before we got seated. 2 and a half hours for a table! If it was up to me I would have walked out and enjoyed another dining option at International Mall. The problem is worse because there isn't a lot of seating while you're waiting. Stand outside, stand inside, but likely you'll just be standing for an hour or two.  The menu is way too big for my taste. When you serve just about everything (breakfast, pizza, Mexican, Asian, Italian, etc.) nothing is really going to be that great. The food is just mediocre. You usually get two portions of one dish, but you're paying for two portions too. This isn't the cheapest place in town.  The cheesecake is their only saving grace. At almost $8 a slice, do yourself a favor and just buy a whole one if two or three of you want cheesecake.  I will not be going back to Cheesecake Factory on a voluntary basis, unless it is to walk in and get a piece of cheesecake to go."
Laura G.,"Tampa, FL",13,29,3,5.0,2/7/2014,"Love this place. We went here for my mom's birthday dinner. What a great choice! The hostess was very friendly and when I asked her about what they do for birthdays, she told me they had a free dessert (which was very small) or we could purchase cheesecake and have them write Happy Birthday on the plate. Our server was patient, came to our table a ton of times throughout our visit to ensure that we had everything we needed and allowed us to take our time while my mom unwrapped her birthday gifts. Food came out fresh, hot and to order."
