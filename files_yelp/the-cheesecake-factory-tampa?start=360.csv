Irene W.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,8,,5.0,5/30/2014,First time eating at a Cheesecake Factory and it was great. Service was fast friendly and very helpful. Can't wait to go back.
Jim B.,"Tampa, FL",59,599,138,4.0,4/16/2011,"OMFGnomnomnom.  Lunch was great. We were seated immediately, and the server was truly on top of things, even as our group was there for a loooong family nosh and chat. I remember when this place was *always* on a wait - seems those days are past, and now I can start popping in here once in a while. I detest waiting more than 15 minutes for a table -anywhere- so in the past this place was never on my list. Now, why yes please. Quibble: I had the chicken picata - the sauce was more butter and very little lemon, making it heavier than it should have been - the acids were missing. Also: Capers! Where were the capers? I found a few, but really... needs more capers. The lunch portion (at 11 bucks) is generous, I took some home... but next time - put in some damned capers and lemon! (there is where start #5 disappeared...) ON to the main event: The cheesecake. Yes, we had 3 slices at our table, and all 3 were superb. Can't do that very often or I'll end up floating above a stadium somewhere. Mmmmm good. Service was snappy, perky and efficient. Top notch there. Too bad it wasn't Penny or Bernadette."
Jay Y.,"Tampa, FL",107,214,87,3.0,7/23/2013,"I think when it comes to the Cheesecake Factory, their desserts (obviously Cheesecakes) are awesomely good and I have never had a bad experience with the dessert menu.  The restaurant itself is large and elegantly designed.  The wait is usually long if it's past 7PM and usually only gets worse as the dinner crowd grows, but its sort of expected given its size, variety of the menu and overall popularity.  The service is usually excellent and the staff are friendly and helpful.  Now, the food I think is a slightly different story.  The food in my opinion has never been the highlight of the experience.  They have a huge menu to choose from and the phrase ""jack of all trades, master in none"" is more than accurate to describe my experience at the Cheesecake Factory.  Nothing is particularly bad, but nothing is particularly good either.  Again, there are many positives in coming here, but as the kid in me would say, I'd rather have dessert..."
Poch K.,"Palm Harbor, FL",12,24,50,4.0,1/9/2011,"This is probably my favorite ""chain"" restaurant...EVER however, the service we had the other day was crap. We got stuck with some bitter queen of a gay man who was less than amused to serve us. Other than that, the food is always yum & the Skinnylicious menu rocks!"
Bob B.,"Tampa, FL",225,318,310,3.0,9/20/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is alright.  It's your typical chain.  It's successful because it appeals to a mass audience of people who like huge portions and super sweet desserts.  The coffee drinks are massive, just too big for after dinner.  It's convenient because they are open pretty late, so if you want a late night dessert you will be in luck.  This city has very few places that stay open late, so they have the market cornered on that one.  I like the outdoor seating as well.  Service is usually pretty good, sometimes a little slow."
Michael G.,"Orlando, FL",60,261,506,4.0,6/1/2013,This place always seems to be crowded with a great vibe. Cheesecake Factory is the type of place that you get cravings for. I love the huge variety of cheesecakes - there's a type of cheesecake here for everyone!
Andrew V.,"Marlborough, MA",1,21,,4.0,4/5/2014,"Stopped by this place for dinner on a Wednesday night before my girlfriend dropped me off at the airport and finally discovered what they were talking about in The Wire all those times they mentioned a Pit Beef sandwich. It was good! She even stole half of it despite usually trying to be a vegetarian! :p We sat outside, enjoyed the breeze and watched the planes from the airport and people go by. Service was good and the prices were OK. Free bread was nice. I guess I'm giving it four stars because I didn't feel blown away or like I got a fantastic deal."
Rochard Y.,"Largo, FL",8,14,9,5.0,2/15/2014,"the food was wonderful. Our server was jimmy never once waited for a refills and oh my god cheese cake from both haven and hell, was so freaking good. Ask for Jimmy u will be glad you did!"
Maria G.,"Atwater, CA",27,91,60,4.0,11/30/2011,Tuscan chicken... great chicken protien meal... service was great and waitress was attentive.
Bret A.,"Tampa, FL",51,667,140,3.0,8/10/2013,"Everything on the menu is excellent and the servers are very attentive - especially given the number of tables. Thai Letti's wraps, pizzas and salads always receive rave reviews and come in very, very large portions. Cheesecake is wonderful! In nice weather sit outside for a nicer, quieter experience!"
Heather S.,"Keene, NH",46,66,3,2.0,9/17/2012,"Did anyone else notice how slippery the floor is? I'm not sure if it was just that night, or if its like that all the time. If it is always that slick then girls in their heels must fall ALOT.  That being said, watching someone fall would have been the high light of this meal. Because it sucked.  I am not complaining about the massive crowds of people, the 45 minute wait, the noise level, any of that. That's all expected and tolerable.  Service from a nice blonde woman with an accent was just fine. She obviously had quite a few tables and was busy but she seemed cool under pressure and gave us as much attention as needed. Here is the problem: with a menu of that size, there are going to be dishes in there that don't get made often enough for the cooks to really bring them to their full potential. A place of that size probably has a massive turnover rate for employees, so chances are if you order something a little off the beaten-10-page-menu-path, you may find that your meal is being prepared by someone who doesn't know how to properly make it. Large menus are never a good sign. It may seem very exciting ('ooh, look at all my options!') but trust me... quality over quantity.  The $12 strawberry martini I got was definitely $12 worth of vodka, but it was so strong it was not enjoyable. Maybe I'm particular cause I work at a martini bar, but it was a tough time choking it down. Or maybe I just chose the wrong drink. We were seated at a little two top in sort of a nook and there was a four top table next to us. It was a decent spot that gave us shelter from the noise and all the passerbys but the size of the table quickly became a problem once our food came out. We ordered the papas bravas (which were the best thing we had besides the bread), a Greek salad (which was good), the fried macaroni and cheese (the breading was a little too thick, the mac and cheese a little dry, and not enough of the creamy marinara sauce on the plate to pick up the slack) and the spinach and cheese dip. The dip we didn't eat. Something was just off. The spinach to cheese ratio was off, the spinach was quite stringy and sticky... blech. And the tortilla chips were too thick and tasted cheap.  With all that food on the table we literally had to eat over the dishes. There was no room for my appetizer plate. And then once the customers next to us left, they pulled the tables apart and now we were in a row of 3 two tops all stacked up next to each other. One couple that got sat in the middle table complained and asked for a different table. When we left they were still waiting for another table that was up to their standard. (cough*stuckup*cough) Ok so the food wasn't that great, but maybe they could make up for it with dessert. I ordered the vanilla bean cheesecake. Some bites tasted good and some bites tasted like playdough. I just recently started baking my own cheesecakes and I thought I'd be blown away by a place that is named after it... nope. Maybe I could give them some pointers. I wouldn't say my expectations for this place were set very high. But I did have a glimmer of hope that somewhere out there would be a chain restaurant that lived up to its hype. All I saw here was just another factory churning over mediocre product after mediocre product."
Renay P.,"Tampa, FL",15,141,208,3.0,6/29/2014,"I don't get why they're so busy. I really don't. The only reason we were going there is because the birthday girl wanted cheesecake and it was close to us all. I called ahead on both Friday and Saturday about reservations for a and both times I was told they didn't take them for either the times I chose or the days. According to the female phone person, they don't take reservations on busy days or nights. She also literally laughed at me when I asked if they would be busy at 4:30pm. After my stunned silence, I asked why they say they take rezs if it's not to avoid the insane lines and wait times on weekends? She said she didn't know. Allow me to tell you why: Because they don't care about the customer experience, they only care about profit. Sadly typical of big chains is their ""turn a fast table to get more asses in seats"" mentality. And for what? The mediocre tasting, typical recipe combos of frozen then microwaved food that's served in oversized portions? Don't get excited. You'll only get lots of cheap pasta and canned sauce or other plate fillers, not more meat. The food's overpriced for the quality. Anyway, from bad customer service to meh-worthy food, there are better places in the mall to eat at. The Pub and Gallery Bistro to name two."
Desiree L.,"Tampa, FL",2,35,1,1.0,8/15/2014,Long wait...even at 6pm... Spent over $200 and service was mediocre... Food had a hair...  And manager didn't seem empathetic :(
Kristen O.,"Tampa, FL",12,24,47,4.0,7/15/2013,"I'm not usually the type to choose a chain restaurant over a mom & pop place, but sometimes there is a small comfort in going to a restaurant where you know what to expect. Cheesecake Factory always seems to deliver with great food selection for all members of your party, delicious dessert, and good service. Especially when traveling with kids, this is a nice place to have nearby in bigger cities or when at a large airport. I always go for the cheesecake. I could eat dessert here and skip dinner. :)"
Teresa H.,"Tallahassee, FL",53,8,,5.0,2/16/2015,"We have eaten here SO many times. Every time we stop in Tampa we head to the Cheesecake Factory.  The wait was very quick since we came right after it opened. The food as always was great. I LOVE their fish tacos.  The strawberry shortcake and carrot cake were DIVINE, so they make other amazing desserts besides cheesecake. Can't wait to go back!"
Roxanne H.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",1,16,1,4.0,2/16/2014,"We went here for lunch with my daughters volleyball team at noon on Sunday with 21 people. We waited maybe 7 minutes to be seated. We had 2 servers who were awesome!  The food was delicious, I had a Cobb Salad with Salmon. Excellent choice. The happily split our checks. Great time."
E. T.,"Tampa, FL",0,4,,2.0,3/21/2014,"I have to say that this restaurant experience seems more like a cattle call then a dining experience. We were literally right on top of another family and we had two small children with us. The menu is sooo large, but everything we ordered  tasted just okay. Maybe if they reduce the menu size they could improve on food quality. It was so loud, we could not even hear each other talk and it was a Monday lunch!! Probably wont be back. Expensive and left with a headache."
Amy Z.,"Tampa, FL",349,780,18,2.0,7/14/2012,"Overrated!  Again, I know it's a chain...and I generally loathe chains so I may be biased.  Anyway, there was a group of 14 of us on a Saturday night.  We stopped in a week before to see if we could make a reservation since we knew we would have a large party.  Nope...no reservations.  Got there an hour before everyone else that evening and was informed that it would be a 3 hour wait with the nastiest holier than thou attitude from the hostess.  Hey whatever, I get it.  It's Saturday night at a high volume crappy chain, we're going to have to wait.  Honestly though, it's not Spago honey, it;s the friggin' Cheesecake Factory...at the mall.  People are in here in t-shirts and cutoffs...get a grip on your level in the hierarchy of the world. Pardon me while I dismount my soapbox to continue my review... Anyhow, I wasn't super hungry so I ordered white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake and some coffee.  It was marginal.  That is what the Cheesecake Factory's motto should be...overpriced food of marginal quality.  Oh, and tell the gatekeeper I said hello should you care to waste an entire evening waiting in line for crappy food and service not even worth mentioning..."
Thuy H.,"Tampa, FL",53,175,25,2.0,9/16/2012,"HORRIBLE service.  We sat in the bar area and the place was packed.  I am normally understanding when it is busy, but I am not so understanding today.  The table next to us had faster service and they turned over that table 3 times while we were there.  You figured if two women spending close to $100.00 for lunch we would receive a little more attention.  We ordered appetizers and it took forever to come out.  When the entrees finally came, the waitress attempted to give me a dirty spoon but I looked up and saw her trying to wipe the crud off the spoon.  So I sat there for 10 minutes waiting for a spoon.  NO one came back with a spoon.  So I had to use the teaspoon because I hate eating cold food,  About 10 minutes after starting on my gumbo, I see a wait staff come walking by.  The person didn't come back until 10 minutes later.  When dessert came out, they only brought out 1 spoon for 2 slices of cheesecake.  It took another 5 minutes for someone to bring one.  I miss the customer service I usually get it this chain.   The gumbo that I ordered was ok.  The shrimp was hard and chewy.  I ordered brown rice and white rice came out instead.  I didn't want to send it back because they are so damn slow here.  The food isn't as good as I remember it."
Lydia L.,"Sarasota, FL",178,107,51,5.0,4/30/2013,"Get the fresh strawberry martini, and pick TWO of the small bite apps, skip the entrée and pick out our favorite cheese cake.  Ahi Tartar is my fav, and I also always get the Asian chicken lettuce wrap.  I leave there totally at peace and not stuffed!  You are welcome :)"
