Dwayne S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,18,1,5.0,7/9/2011,"Sorry this just got updated, I didn't realize that it was still in my saved  reviews.  I don't Yelp too often, but when I come across something worthwhile, I Yelp from my Iphone, but I guess it doesn't submit until I sign in online?  Any suggestions on that?   This is from August/September 2010. If you LOVE cheesecake like I LOVE cheesecake, this is the place for you! I ordered the Original and Vanilla Bean cheesecakes to go, and let me tell you, they are to die for! I was in heaven everytime I took a bite! I don't eat the whole slice at one time, I like to take my time and really savor every single bite. If you've never been here, the food is great also, although I didn't eat here this time. I loved the Original cheesecake more this time around. Wish we had one closer to Pensacola though!"
Amanda E.,"Tampa, FL",258,111,50,5.0,2/28/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a solid choice. So many options, hearty and light. I always feel like it's a splurge to go here, but so worth it every time! The service was top-notch and very friendly. Even though it's usually really busy, they seem to have a great system to get you in and out pretty efficiently. I love this place and can't wait to go back."
Joe R.,"Tampa, FL",7,4,3,1.0,8/22/2013,when you go to the cheesecake and the hostess seats you make sure they actually wipe the table down. I was wearing a white dress shirt with french cuffs and next thing I know i have all this nasty yellow stuff all over the bottom of my sleeve. I was entertaining a client so I did not want to make it awkward or uncomfortable for them so I just kept my arms on the table. It was pretty disgusting and most likely i will never eat there again!
Antonio D.,"Manhattan, NY",33,65,,3.0,3/7/2013,Good place to go on a weekday weekends you can forget about. Oh and if your a wrestling fan you can spot some FCW (WWE) kids running around between here and  champs or any of the bars... Ring Rats need not apply.
Tony R.,"Clearwater, FL",13,136,15,5.0,7/27/2012,"Yesterday was my bday so I decided on CKF since I haven't been there in a while and I'm glad I did. I missed you baby. Love the sourdough bread and the Chicken Simosas. We ordered skinny rita's and the Chicken De Pani to share. I swear this is the best chicken breast I have ever had. I don't know what they do but its so good. Lighltly breaded with this awesome lemon butter sauce and a stack of mashed potatoes. For dessert we shared the Adam's Peanut Butter Cheesecake and the Red Velvet. They came out and sang happy birthday and wrote it on the plate in chocolate sauce. SWEET, Great experience like usual and I'm glad I decided to go there.  If you go get there early because it gets packed. Also, the skinny ritas $9.50 and they were weak, only complaint."
Bonita B.,"Tampa, FL",47,299,172,4.0,1/27/2013,"The food, dessert, and server were top-notch at this location even during their late-lunch hour time (before 5 PM)."
Michael P.,"Tampa, FL",108,152,118,5.0,1/22/2013,A tampa favorite! Always come here to get great food and great service
Beth B.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,13,,2.0,9/23/2013,"Where to start, maybe from the lousy service to the nasty food. I got a simple ""4 cheese pasta dish"" and with the nasty boiled chicken they added $3. There was hardly enough sauce and there were huge raw onions throughout. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because of the cheesecake. I won't be back. Food is NOT worth the price, at all."
Holli D.,"West Palm Beach, FL",112,205,39,5.0,5/9/2012,"Cheesecake Factory always meets & most of the time exceeds my expectations!! I LOVE their menu! The Thai lettuce wraps and splenda cheesecake make me SMILE and my belly happy!!! I have never had a bad experience at a Cheesecake Factory anywhere! Service here was great! We went on prom night, so there was a wait, but once in things moved right along!"
Karen G.,"Sussex, NJ",3,48,3,4.0,3/8/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is terrific. We went on a Sunday night around 5pm and had to wait approximately 20 minutes for a party of 3. Not bad, considering its The Cheesecake Factory. The restaurant was clean, the staff friendly and attentive. Considering how busy they were they did an excellent job. Never had to wait for anything. I had my usual Pasta Carbonara, which was as usual GREAT! My husband had the Hibachi Steak, which, when it came to the table smelled like heaven! He loved it. The portion was big and there were no complaints! My son had, guess what, chicken! Teriyaki to be exact. If there ever was a conossieur of chicken it would be him. He never tries anything different. Except for an occasional filet mignon. But, I digress, he loved the Teriyaki Chicken. Again a large portion and the white rice portion was huge! It looked fluffy! I don't like rice, but I would have eaten that! Great place, great food - the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because whenever you go to The Cheesecake Factory you always have to wait :) However, we will definitely go back!"
Don G.,"St Petersburg, FL",11,13,2,3.0,1/26/2013,"My friends and I met here for lunch and had high expectations as the reviews are mostly good.  Things started off great with our server Manuel J. being pleasant and attentive throughout the meal.  I ordered the Ahi tartar which tasted fresh and was tasty.  I next had the chicken marsala.  This was a disappointment.   The chicken was cooked properly, but the pasta was slightly undercooked.  I like my pasta al-dente, but this was not quite there.  The sauce was thin, which was made worse by the fact that the pasta was tossed in brown butter ( which, if done properly, could have made the dish phenomenal) that just made an already thin sauce oily.  There was also not much of a taste of marsala that one would normally expect.  In all we had an enjoyable time and would go back.  I would like to see a better job from the kitchen, but the service was great."
Nadia Fern C.,"Dallas, TX",2359,268,130,3.0,8/18/2009,"Cheesecake Factory really doesnt overthrill me in any way. Their menu is ridiculous. Absolute overkill. It makes my head pound just flipping through all ten pages of the junk they have on there. The only thing I ever eat from here is the chicken salad sandwich. And surprisingly enough, this is the only chicken salad that I will eat besides my own. I hate when theres too much drippy mayonnaise or too much junk besides chicken and they have a perfect combination of all the things I like in there. And the toast they put it on is to die for. Yummmm. It is so gigantic that my fat self can barely half! The salad that comes with it makes me want to vomit. I hate those schmancy weed greens that taste like sour dirt. The only reason I choke them down is because the dressing that comes on them is wonderful. Very tasty. I went with a friend and he got herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The salmon looked really good but there was a minor herb overload. But he ate nearly all of his lunch and the other half of my sammy. Boys... (: Even after all this, he still wanted cheesecake. Craziness. He ordered the turtle cheesecake and although I am not much for caramel, it was quite tasty. The chocolate mousse on the top was incredible. The Redi-Whip dollop on the side was worthless. You would think, with their prices and their massive menu, they could stand to have homemade whipped cream. All in all, it was a pleasant lunch. (:"
Danny B.,"Tallahassee, FL",21,25,,2.0,5/20/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory succeeds only in being average because of its outrageous prices and merely decent food.  I'm usually fairly pleased with my meal there, but my $15 bowl of pasta is really only worth $9 and my $11 burger is really worth $8.  A slice of cheesecake will run you at least $7, which is a ridiculous price for any dessert that only serves one. Every time I go to Cheesecake, I leave somewhat disappointed with an overpriced meal that wasn't anywhere close to being worth the cost. Note to self: do not return."
Kirstie C.,"Tampa, FL",4,4,,1.0,7/19/2014,"Disastrous evening started off when we arrived at 7:00 and were quoted ""an hour to an hour and a half"" for our party of 12. We were extremely misquoted. The hosts would tell us that our table was paying out, or that it was being cleaned for us. Long story short, after talking to numerous hosts, and a manager, we were finally seated at 10:00, three hours after we arrived. Our waiter was extremely sarcastic and told us that ""a three hour wait is nothing."" He also made fun of our guests' accents from England saying ""sorry I can't understand your strange accents."" He would ask us ""can you hang on a second"" when we asked for something. Food was great and timely. Prime example of how inexperienced hosts, and sarcastic staff, can take a night from fine dining to horrible. My recommendation: teach your hosts how to manage and judge time. Don't misquote, if it will be a three hour wait- tell us that!"
K C.,"Ruskin, FL",7,52,5,4.0,1/24/2013,"We dined at this location for a late lunch/early dinner and was not disappointed.  The food is always great but the service can sometimes be questionable. This we lucked up and had a excellent server,  Amber, even though she was handling far to many tables."
Anthony A.,"Spring Hill, FL",35,64,44,4.0,8/14/2010,"Lots of stuff to choose from. That could be good or bad. I suggest taking a look at the menu on-line before you go. The menu is like a book. Pasta dishes are great, the Burgers are very good as well. You may have to wait a bit during the weekend and at the dinner hour.  Food overall is very good for chain fair."
Jim Z.,"Bradenton, FL",0,209,106,1.0,10/20/2012,"We went on a Friday night about 9pm so the Mall stores were closing and the Cheesecake Factory was starting to get slower with only about a 15 min wait for dinner. We chose to sit outdoors as it was a nice night with a light breeze. I'm thinking this was a mistake as we may as well have been the bad children in the corner.  Ordered a Chicken Bellagio and my wife got a Chicken Di Pana. We got our bread and drinks waited for about 20 minutes. Then, my wife's meal comes out and I am told it will be a few minutes for mine. Almost 10 minutes go by when mine finally arrives. The girl asks if I want Parmesean cheese and I say sure. She says that will be out in a few minutes. I find that kind of weird.  Another 7 or 8 minutes go by and I finally get Parmesean but my wife isn't offered any and the waitress is gone.  Oh, and I am still waiting for a drink refill at this point. Finally, our waiter Ryan comes back and gets us a drink, after being out for over 20 minutes. Everything felt out of sync and being outside made me feel llike we were a lesser priority than anyone inside. Not a good way to feel at the end of a moderately expensive dinner ($35 for 2)"
Ally B.,"St. Petersburg, FL",2,14,,2.0,8/8/2014,"This is one of my favorite places to eat, but I will not be returning to this location after two really bad experiences. My boyfriend and I are both servers and always try to ignore little stuff, because we get it, it's an incredibly difficult job! That being said, this service sucked! The first time our server treated us very poorly. She was oddly mean and seemed annoyed at our presence almost?? I do not know if she was having a bad day or what, but it was vastly uncomfortable for us. What was ever odder is how she was treating the tables next to us! She was so kind to them and normal? It was really odd. We didn't say anything out of the usual and thanked her for our drinks and whatnot, so I still do not understand what merited the poor attitude. At the end of the meal she circled the suggested tip amount multiple times??????? This is way too nice of a restaurant for that!! We assumed maybe this is what merited the attitude- she thought we wouldn't tip? We are young, but as I said, servers! We tip great! We still tipped 20% but goodness, be nice! Our next experience there, we had the SAME girl! This time she was nice and I think she remembered us (or at least that we tipped,) because we were treated normally. Annoyingly, we were seated in this big communal booth with two other families even though the place just opened and they were pretty empty. That was frustrating, but what made it worse were flies swarming around us. It was DISGUSTING! The family next to us were feeling icky about it too. Since we were in the middle, the flies seemed to focus on us? Haha, I don't know, but it was terrible. We moved seats and there was still one or two.  Needless to say, I will not be back for yet another weird issue."
Emily H.,"New York, NY",0,126,,4.0,7/18/2010,"Brought my relatives here or a birthday and the server, Frederick V. really knew how to make it very special . I would love to criticize the food that we ate but it was pretty delish including an artichoke appetizer that was so tasty. We mostly had burgers. The chopped salad looked a little sad but it was fine. Really, in Tampa if you have relatives and need to find a happy place that is cool and nice- this is it. Try the dulce de leche cheesecake!"
Svitlana M.,"Sarasota, FL",16,57,3,4.0,7/15/2013,"Visited this place two days in the row: had great experience. Loved their fried zucchini, paired so well with creamy garlicky dip. On the first day I shared them with my boyfriend, on the second - I made a double order for myself  (of course later I realized that  it was too much and I have a little room left for a main meal). Bread was very good too - freshly baked. Try dark one too - I did not eat it on the first day fearing that it may have caraway seed, but it does not, do not judge the taste because appearance. It is yum-yum. On the first day had a rib-eye steak - it was cooked the way I wanted it, the only issue with it was too much black pepper on it. Even my boyfriend supported me in that - they need to either warn the customer or ask how much to use. The carrot cake was good too - despite that I generally do not like anything with cinnamon in it. On the second day I had grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and  steamed broccoli. Salmon was good but seasoning did not penetrate the fish throughout so if not dip/sauce aside, just on its own - it was somewhat tasteless. Broccoli were steamed to my liking: not raw but at the same time not overcooked: just right amount of crispiness. My boyfriend had their pasta with meat sauce - the plate got empty too fast - so it was too late for me to remind him about the amount he should eat if he wants to lose weight :))) Overall it was nice experience, good food and good service, clean restaurant. Food is priced reasonably what is a great plus, also variety of food served. Somewhat noisy place but I would go there again during my next Tampa visit."
