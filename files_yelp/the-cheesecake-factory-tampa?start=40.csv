Valentina L.,"Clearwater, Tampa Bay, FL",2530,705,2664,4.0,2/25/2017,Always seems busy around 11-2pm. So plan accordingly. The outside seating is always nice and offers heat lamps if need be.  The food is always plentiful and amazing.  My faves: CORN Tamales And then the AVOCADO ROLLS
Marissa D.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",198,14,9,5.0,3/11/2017,I had the Chicken Madeira and it was amazing. It's one of their most popular dishes and i can definitely tell why. The flavors in the sauce and mashed potatoes were so tasty. I had to go back the next day and get the same thing. I also had the moscato which I recommend. 7 Daughters is the brand. Slightly sweet. And the Caesar salad is definitely one of my faves too.  Also my boyfriend recommends the honey fried chicken said that was tasty as well. I don't know why this Factory has low ratings but every time I come it's delicious.
Shannon P.,"Reading, PA",3,185,109,5.0,8/19/2017,Scored big this trip. Hubby enjoyed his burger very much and my black pepper shrink was divine.
Robby B.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",76,22,,1.0,1/29/2017,"The food is quite good, but the service is reprehensible. I absolutely refuse to go here to the Tampa location unless I'm going to celebrate with other people. That's how bad the service is. Today I got the bacon bacon cheeseburger and when it was brought out the bun was absolutely drenched in something from the kitchen. As in falling apart soggy as something had been spilled on it. I had to ask for another bun that took forever to get out to me. I had to ask repeatedly for beverage refills. The server screwed up the checks and took absolutely forever trying to sort out her mess. I'm not sure why they keep Sarah B. On as a server. It's very apparent that she does not want to be there. No apologies for mistakes, nothing.  Even though the food is good, the service ruins the experience every time. I understand places get busy, but if management cannot properly staff to meet the needs of patrons, they need to put people in that can do their jobs."
Kathleen M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,21,26,5.0,7/1/2017,My first time being at this place very very packed but great service great cocktails great food overall excellent place love it
Steven T.,"Bradenton, FL",0,4,,2.0,12/5/2017,"My 1st experience at a Cheese Cake Factory - ordered pasta with shrimp & sausage- $18.95 - there was literally 1 shrimp in the entire bowl - but not to worry I got 3 1/2 pieces of sausage all of which easily filled the spoon with one bite ! When brought to the attention of the server "" quote "" I'll try and get  you some more shrimp ! The manager came over 20 minutes later "" quote I heard you were complaining about the shrimp "" my response was when was the last time you paid $20 for a bowl of pasta with one shrimp. I think you may want to discuss the quality control in your kitchen his answer was yeah I'll probably mention that to them. Overall service by the waitress was excellent"
Helen L.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",68,178,199,3.0,7/19/2016,"This location is always busy! I don't think I've ever been here and not had to wait for a table. Although the food here is pretty good, this isn't my first dining choice at International Plaza. I'm not a fan of super busy and loud restaurants. The service here is also inconsistent. One time at dinner, I had to ask for bread and the waitress gave me a nasty attitude.  Some of my favorite starters are the Portabella, Avocado & Zucchini Fries and the Roasted Pear & Blue Cheese Flatbread. I usually order the Chicken Di Pana as my meal. The chicken is thin and crispy and the mashed potatoes are very buttery.   Even though I occasionally crave The Cheesecake Factory's high-calorie greasy food, I won't be coming back anytime soon. The wait is ridiculous and the food isn't worth the price."
Amy K.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",310,449,1708,4.0,1/1/2016,"Yay review #100! And it goes to the Cheesecake Factory of Tampa. I've been here before and I went here New Year's Day around 3pm. The wait was about 20 minutes for a table for two and we were seated rather quickly (considering the crowd!) We were promptly greeted by our waiter who was very attentive, filling our waters regularly and checking in on our table.  I ordered a ""skinny"" Long Island iced tea which had no sugary additives and used Sprite Zero instead of Coke. Delightful! For food, I asked for the turkey and Avocado sandwich but the waiter informed me they were out of turkey. He offered to substitute chicken and I took him up on the offer. It was very tasty, although a little dry. Needed something more than just mayo. There was bacon luckily so that helped with flavor :) It was served with a side salad that was a bit over drenched in some kind of balsamic dressing. Still tasty though. Overall a good meal and nice atmosphere. Personally I loved the soothing music while recovering from an eventful New Year's Eve! Next time, I'm simple going for dessert because those darn cheesecakes looked amazing!!!!!"
Brian M.,"Tampa, FL",1609,504,7664,4.0,12/16/2015,"The Cheescake Factory is located at the International Plaza Mall off Westshore Blvd and Spruce Street right next to the Tampa International Airport. Aside from being the employer of Penny from the Big Bang Theory, the Cheesecake factory is famous for a large variety of over 20 pies that they serve. They also have a 10+ page food menu with food of every different type from Italian, Japanese, Thai, Chinese, American, Mexican, and other regions. I was dissapointed that the Cheese Cake factory got rid of the Thai Chicken but I recently  enjoyed Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp with Curry,  Peanut, Chile, Coconut, Sautéed Vegetables, and steamed white rice.   For Dessert, my favorite cheesecake is their Caramel Turtle Cheesecake. Other honorable mentions for best cheesecakes include: Adams Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake, Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cheesecake, Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cheesecake, Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake, and Strawberry Cheesecake. The Cheescake Factory also serves 9 different kinds of specialty cakes and 4 different ice cream desserts. Sometimes my office orders a couple pies for everyone. I really like how the pies are precut with plastic in between so that slices can be easily taken out. I Look forward to my next visit! There is plenty of parking available in the mall's private parking lot. Our server was friendly, quick, and courteous, and we got our food in a timely manner. Usually the wait times are kind of long to get in here because it is such a popular restaurant. It's better to check-in, go shopping, and then come back when you are notified that you can be seated instead of waiting around and being bored."
Mike O.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",12,68,42,2.0,7/8/2016,"I have been several times in the past and the food was always fair. We where going out for a special dinner and since we had not been in a long time we headed over to tampa. We waited a short time and were seated quickly. Our waitress came to the table quickly and took our drink order. From here on in it went down hill from there. My wife sent back her dinner tons of breading and deep fried. My dinner was ok. We had a hard time getting our table cleared of plates and even more trouble get drink refills. So many times we had to flag down our server.  The food was poor, i never could understand how a restaurant can have so many items on their menu and expect to keep up with quality. We will not return not worth the trip for the low quality."
Danielle D.,"Bradenton, FL",131,411,96,4.0,2/18/2017,"Came in to get cheesecake to go.  Love how they have a to go counter with all the cakes right to the side when you walk in, making it very easy to grab a piece of cake to go.  All slices are around $8, but that's ok because they are so big.  I had the chocolate tower and it was HUGE.  Layers upon layers of chocolate with some whipped cream on the side."
Meghan L.,"Toronto, Canada",13,105,19,4.0,8/20/2016,"We came here for dinner on family vacation because it was family (baby) friendly. Being a very large chain in the states and having never heard anything but negative humour about the place I wasn't expecting much. But I ended up being very pleasantly surprised! The starter bread, in two varieties, brown rye and white sourdough, were both so good. The main dish I got, the almond-crusted salmon salad, was not only delicious but super healthy too with kale, brussel sprouts, quinoa, cranberries, almonds, and salmon. And of course, the cheesecake, it was super delicious. I had a taste of both the banana cream and salted caramel varieties, so yum!"
Ali W.,"Tampa, FL",36,52,1,4.0,8/30/2017,Run of the mill franchised food. Ordering off of the happy hour menu is getting your money's worth. Drinks were good and the food was as expected. Server was nice and the banana cheesecake was yummy.
Carrie K.,"Orlando, FL",0,45,,1.0,11/17/2017,Walked in on Friday night. About 8 workers standing behind host booth. All looked up at us with cat eyes. We finally said two please and her response was oh ok. Always loved going here but they just lost our business. Cannot believe what we just experienced.
Anj N.,"Tampa, FL",230,114,1095,4.0,1/14/2017,"We had a great time at Cheesecake Factory! I really enjoy that they have different variates  of everything you can imagine! The picky person in your group of friends or family will not be disappointed; from burgers to different types of pasta. Cheesecake Factory will please the pickiest member of your group of friends or family! The menu is around 20 pages!!!!!This time, we had  the grilled cheese with fries, the Renne special, which had half of a sandwich, salad, and fries, and Cajun littles (which are basically chicken fingers. All of us were happy with our meal. I did not like the lighting of the restaurant! I barely saw my menu!  Of course, by the time we we were done with our meal, we had no room for desserts! Usually, I get the tuxedo cheesecake, unfortunately I couldn't eat anything else after dinner!  Next time, I come by ill just come for the cheesecake... especially the tuxedo cheesecake!"
John S.,"Webster, FL",0,8,3,5.0,4/1/2017,"I don't normally give very man establishments 5 stars, however,  The Cheesecake Factory at International Mall in Tampa earned it today.  This was my first visit ever to a Cheesecake Factory and I must say the experience was astounding.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is extremely classic.  The bar area is somewhat secluded from the dining area.  David was our server and was very knowledgeable of the menu and served us well. I had the Herb Crusted Salmon with asparagus and red mashed potatoes.  My wife had the Renees Special.  Our food came in a timely manner, well played and had great flavor. The portions were more than ample. We did not have any cheesecake but I have had their cheesecake before at parties and they are awesome.  I will frequent this establishment often. I suggest you do the same."
Alan W.,"Clearwater, FL",8,134,73,3.0,7/29/2016,"A small group of 4 of us went here today for lunch to celebrate a birthday.  The food was very good tasting & the service was excellent.  My only complaint was that the pricing seemed very high.  Most items seemed to be priced about $2-$4 higher than they were worth.       I ordered the veggie melt with a side salad, & I also ordered an appetizer for the table of fried macaroni balls.  The appetizer was extremely tasty, & there were 4 balls in the serving, but the price of over $10 for this app was way too high.  Similarly my veggie melt sandwich tasted good but should have been maybe $4 cheaper.      We also had cheesecake for dessert.  They tasted great but again were priced quite high.  I'd say this restaurant is great for a special occasion, but their pricing makes it tough to be a routine customer that comes often."
Rose W.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",29,5,,3.0,11/12/2017,"Meh just ok, not the Cheesecake Factory or years prior.  I remember my first visit I fell in love.  Sat with a table of 15 while visiting back home in Framingham Mass and every single dish was amazing the chef even came out to talk to a friend who had a lot of food allergies to recommend and create a dish for her.  The Cheesecake slices were almost comical they were so big-dessert for 3 for sure but as a Cheesecake lover I was pleasantly surprised.  Fast forward to now and after a good 10+ visit to my local rest in Int'l mall went last night at my daughters request for her bday and it just seems like with each visit it gets worse.  Service was great, wait was 2 1/2 hours-ridiculous!! But waited... Got seated felt rushed, ordered Salmon which was barely a sliver and Cheesecake was about size of pinkie finger and honestly isn't even a really tasty Cheesecake anymore and trust me I'm a Cheesecake expert-grew up making them in commercial kitchens for my mom.  I'm not so excited to go anymore last night was kind of a last straw for me. Left with a $300 bill for mediocre food, uncooked pasta and dishes that the only activity they got was being pushed around their plate. Ended off with Cheesecake to go for 8 and none were really impressive taste or size. Theyre finally living up to that ""chain"" restaurant mentality of yeah it's ok but nothing special!!"
Nancy T.,"Tampa, FL",0,13,1,2.0,8/29/2017,"Food was very good but service was awful... Over an hour to get our food at 5pm on  a Tuesday... Waitress blamed it on the burger that was ordered.. Seriously???? Waitress was AWOL most of the, never checked in on us.. Everything we asked for she said was in the back... Very disappointed.. Manager offered free dessert but we were there an hour and a half at that point and just wanted to leave. Never had this problem at any other location.."
Wayne C.,"Manhattan, NY",419,19,36,4.0,5/1/2017,"This place is always busy, love the cakes, the food is always good, just not memorable. It reminds me of a upscale diner. I have dined her several times and the only thing that is consistent is the wait for a table. Service is ok, the meals are good, convenient location, just not on my favorite places to dine list."
