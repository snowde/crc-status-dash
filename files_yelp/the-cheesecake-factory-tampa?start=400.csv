Kent P.,"Astoria, NY",121,568,360,5.0,12/24/2007,"So we show up about 20 minutes before they close on a Sunday.   First off Bay Street is POPPIN!!  Maybe its just cuz it was a Sunday night, but the club / lounge in there had a line deeper than BLVD on a Saturday.  The club was mixed, mostly black...top 40 and southern tunes from the DJ. Eye candy everywhere...so many luscious black girls in super tight / low cut / high rise dresses and skirts...anywho...I filled up on eye candy and had... -BBQ beef ribs with fries (delicious, some ribs are really meaty, others are just tasty but mostly bone) -BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad (so dope, I've had it before, chicken, corn, black beans, avocado, tomato, onion crisps) -Shrimp Scampi with Steak Diane and mashed potatoes (divine sauce over steak medallions, great shrimp, the potatoes are marvelous, use the shrimp's sauce on the potatoes) We all shared these dishes and mixed and matched.   Good food, lovely help (even though I know they wanted to be home, they never rushed us) and great great surroundings to walk the food down, or wander as your table gets ready."

L H.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,4,,1.0,5/15/2014,"My girlfriend and I were here on a Saturday evening.  We arrived around 9pm and were told we had a 1/2 hour wait.  Well, in a 1/2 hour our device buzzed.  It was time to sit.  Tons of people were standing elbow to elbow in the lobby.  We had to avoid the area near the hostess station where an employee was mopping--why?  At the hostess station, there are four girls with a pile of menus and no-one addressing us.  When I asked if we were going to be seated, we were told that our table was still being cleaned off.  Then I saw that there is another waiting system at the hostess desk..they put paper tickets in a row and you are now in a queue to be seated.  When we make it to the front of this queue, one of the four girls starts sorting through the menus to get the proper number of drink menus and regular menus for our party.  First of all, there is only two of us--it shouldn't be that hard. Second of all, the four hostesses could keep these menus sorted out and ready for seating instead of ignoring people and chit-chatting. After getting seated, we had PLENTY of time to decide what we would order, so when our waitress, Penny, (not kidding) shows up to take our drink order, I told her that we were also ready to place our order.  She said that she'd be back in two minutes.  I told her that we'd like to order our food at this time not in two minutes.  She honestly, slammed the plastic pitcher of water that she was carrying on our table.  So, with that, we ordered and you could see her back-pedaling from her rudeness at that point.  However, after she left our table, instead of putting in OUR food order to the kitchen, she went to another table and took THEIR order also.  And, of course, our food took forever to show up and the other table had their food before us.  Penny apologized.  Penny actually asked if my coffee was hot enough.  She said that she had told them to make sure that it was extra hot.  What?--trying too hard now!?  She also said that people had been complaining about the kitchen and food was coming out 1/2 hour late for the past few weekends, but SHE tried to get her food to her tables right away--so Penny was passing the buck to the kitchen staff.   Overall, the service was horrible.  They act like they are inconvenienced that you arrived at their restaurant."
Kimmy S.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",62,71,3,4.0,6/24/2009,"Chains scare me.  The institutional type foods they crank out are deadly to my tummy and I generally don't care for the screaming toddlers and barking parents.  It's a culture clash all around. But since Cheesecake Factory is not INSIDE the mall, and it's at International Mall at that, I am never afraid to dine here.  I know it's a chain and that the prices are a bit up there, but it does have its virtues and I've yet to eat here and be disappointed.  (And that's a lot more than I can say about some other places NOT associated with a mall!)  When portions are this generous and well made, who can fuss??!!  Besides, if I can't afford 20 bucks for myself for an excellent lunch, I'll eat at home.     The wait staff is always cheerful and helpful and patient.  That alone garners 4 stars for me.  The bartenders are equally gifted.  In fact, I've always had pleasant and fun times here and that's why I continue to go back.   The grilled salmon is always cooked to perfection, not over cooked and not gummy, either.  The mixed greens salad is always fresh and perfectly dressed; I prefer the oil and balsamic vinegar myself!  All portions are GINORMOUS and you WANT to take leftovers for lunch or dinner the next day because it's just that good!  All desserts are freshly baked and top off any meal.   It's a trip I look forward to each and every time and the fact it sits at the edge of a totally cool mall is the icing on the cake...walk and shop off those extra calories!!!"
Lani R.,"Westshore, Tampa Bay, FL",6,5,,1.0,9/3/2013,"I just don't understand why so many people love this place. Waaaaay over priced for mediocre food. Fish tacos were very bland. Salmon salad was also disappointing. Nothing special, again just plain and boring."
Rebecca S.,"Tampa, FL",117,357,4,2.0,3/29/2011,"I only went to the bar here, but I was less than impressed with the skills of the bartender. If all you know how to make are the drinks listed in your cocktail menu, and only the way they're listed in your cocktail menu, then you need to invest in bartender school or a good bar book or a few hours online or SOMETHING. I've usually had really good experiences with Cheesecake Factory barenders, but these were less than stellar."
Sterling L.,"Roswell, GA",615,161,21,5.0,11/29/2009,"While Cheesecake Factory is one of wifey's favorites, so this review couldn't be too bad, no matter what, this location was particularly nice for us. Service was extra friendly, quick and helpful, and everyone's dish was scrumptious. We went in for lunch and I had the Chicken enchiladas, which I really enjoyed. Everyone finished their plates, though, so we had to take the cheesecake order to go. Of course, everyone enjoyed their cheesecake too. In general, cheesecake factory is one of the pricier chains, but a happy family can be priceless, especially when you really need it, which we did. This meal was a fitting cap off to a Thanksgiving week where we really needed, as a family, to be reminded of all our many blessings."
Gretchen L.,"Tampa, FL",0,12,3,3.0,4/16/2014,"I love the food here! My favorite is the chicken pasta but I get it with penne instead of fettucini. Sometimes it depends on the server you get, but for the most part the service is great. It can be a while to wait if you go during lunch time too."
Mariya K.,"Tampa, FL",3,13,,2.0,6/23/2012,"All good about this place. It is so good that you will be waiting to be seated for an hour. Friday or Saturday - forget it!! And this place is soo good, that they don't take reservations. No personal touch, no smile, you going to be treated just like anybody else. And without you - this place will continue its ""chain self oriented"" existence. Sad, but what-u-gna-do! Never going to go there again!!!! No stuck up places which make me sad!!! No More!"
Sean S.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,45,2,4.0,10/12/2011,"Okay, this place gets 4 stars for a couple of reasons.... familiar menu no matter where you are in the country, great service and sweet tea.... Ahh I love visiting Tampa Bay. When will you import the sweet tea to California? Stop hording it in the Tampa!!! Or keep it and make me keep going out to vivst."
Donald W.,"Tampa, FL",115,70,129,4.0,1/8/2012,"I think if you take a gril there on your frist date, you will be..... The Man!"
Anish Z.,"Tampa, FL",232,166,12,4.0,5/28/2011,Yeah it's a chain but it's consistant good food with a wide selection. I ordered the Kobe burger medium came well. Told the waiter who promptly returned and gave me another comp'd it all together. Yeah I'd rather get it right at first but they did the right thing and I'm happy. Remember open seating at the bar if the wait is long be a vulture
R M.,"Lakeland, FL",6,258,4542,4.0,5/30/2009,"We've eaten here several times but never have had to wait long, in part because we won't stick around for long waits. Timing is everything; we try to go early enough in late afternoon to avoid the crowd. The food is consistently good and the service is fine. Save room for cheescake!"
Chris H.,"Beaver Falls, PA",2,16,1,4.0,7/21/2011,Long lines at night. You can get in and out if you want a carry out desert. Cake is awesome.
J W.,"Lutz, FL",0,3,,2.0,10/18/2011,"We went here late night last weekend, and quickly got a table in the bar area.  We ordered dessert and coffee.  The coffee was okay, but $3 a cup?  It was just brewed coffee.      We thought the dessert would be top shelf, and although it looked pretty, they use fake whipped cream, and lots of it.  Please just give us REAL whipped cream.  You can give us less; just make it real, please!     Sadly, as tasty as it looked, it was not good Tiramisu at all.  Cheap ingredients were used, and it tasted way too sweet.  It wasn't even close to authentic Tiramisu.   The waiter kept our change (which was 40% of our bill) and our receipt like a street hustler.  That was very unprofessional.   The whole isle to the restrooms, which has access to the kitchen, was greasy like someone buttered it to cook on.  I was shocked employees were walking across it and not mentioning it to the folks that clean the floors.  It was slippery and dangerous.  I told a front end manager, who said he would take care of it. We left, most likely never to return."
Caroline M.,"Atlanta, GA",78,33,,2.0,2/27/2013,"We stopped here to meet a friend and have dessert. It was an off time 4:00 pm. We were seated in the bar area which was fine with us.  We ordered coffee and it arrived cold.  We let that go.  We ordered dessert and as usual it was good. A Cheesecake Factory dessert is just that a Cheesecake Factory dessert!  At no time did the waiter stop back at the table.  We waited for him to offer more coffee, but it didn't happen. I tried to catch his attention and he would look right through me. After. A little while it became a source of amusement for us, how could he not see me trying to catch his attention?  Finally, I started holding my coffee cup in the air. He took our cups to refill. When he returned we asked for more milk because it comes in this teeny tiny little pitcher. Then we waited and waited. Finally he returned but with the check not the milk. That's when he remembered the milk. He went to get it but of course by this time the coffee was ice cold and I was super annoyed. I would have complained about him to the manager, something I rarely do but since we had ""company"" with us, we paid and got the heck outta there. We don't live in Tampa so it's easy to say, I'll never go back to that restaurant again."
Sue G.,"Spring Hill, FL",181,82,1,4.0,10/23/2008,"Ok, so I work in an office full of women... It was a bitchy day... I'm thinking,,,,, how do I make them cheer up?   CHEESECAKE!!!!!!!!!!! So I called in our lunch order and went to pick it up.  It was Bliss! Nirvana! They were content, happy and the smiles came out!!!! YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!"
Eugenia M.,"Orlando, FL",0,1,,1.0,7/5/2014,"Went tonight with my husband for dinner and drinks. The place was very crowded as it usually is on Saturdays. We sat at one of the small tables at the bar. Our waiter was very polite and attentive. However, when the appetizers arrived (I had ordered the Mexican style lettuce tacos), I noticed that there is something wrong with the chicken inside - it was very tough and it tasted somewhat sour. I thought it was perhaps due to the sauce or preparation and kept eating until on the last taco I actually smelled the chicken - it smelled like spoiled chicken! I also asked my husband to smell it and he agreed that it definitely smelled like rotting meat. The waiter carried the plate away and got the manager who did not seem to believe we were telling the truth and did not bother to check with the kitchen - she explained that they have perhaps mistakenly used fish (clearly not the case!!!!). Anyway, they deducted  the amount for the affected food and we left. I did not think this was very good customer service fro the manager and I hope I do not get sick."
M. L.,"Tampa, FL",0,71,,5.0,1/21/2010,"Regardless what hour of the day it is, what difficulties the economy is in, what Florida's weather has in store, Cheesecake Factory is always busy! From experience, to avoid tedious wait time, arrive at Brunch hour and your max wait is 15 mins, oh yeah! The interior is modern, sophisticate, ""heavenly"" & romantica feel with a Roman-Euro artsy style. Servers are very quick and friendly ... considering how the place is always packed and exceptionally clean. The menu is merely a book, pages and pages filled with different types of cuisine catered to everyone's taste. Personally, the price is very reasonable, considering how large the portions are and the great service you're getting. You're served with bread (wheat & white) with butter first. One of their most popular dish is the Teriyaki Chicken is absolutely yummiclious! The sweet teriyaki is marinated into the chicken so well that it's completely absorbed to the center of the chicken meat, leaving the center just as tasty and tender as the skin outside. And of course the pineapple and banana(ew, not a fan) are flavored and grilled with the sauce. Another favorite is the Spicy  Chipotle Chicken, perfect amount of spice to get you kickin'. Did I mention that their portions are huge (again)?! So big that you can catch everyone leaving with a to-go box or more. And how can you leave Cheesecake Factory without trying their famous cheesecakes! Located in the back of the menu, the list of different toppings and types of cheesecakes are endless. Original Strawberry Cheesecake is one of the best. Unbelievably soft, rich, and creamy, top with their whole sized strawberry and syrup + whip cream = Divine!!! Pricing is $6-$7 per slice(big enough for two) or $24 for a small-med whole size cheesecake.  Absolute LOVE."
Josh M.,"Tampa, FL",28,67,,4.0,7/27/2009,Ok ok it is a chain restaurant but probably the best chain restaurant around. The menu is huge with lots of options. My fav. is the Mac&Cheese. And of course the cheesecake. The only complaint is the wait. My God the wait can be absolutely bonkers. But other than that it is worth it.
