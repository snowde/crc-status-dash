Ian L.,"Clearwater, FL",150,7,,1.0,1/8/2009,"Last Time I ate there the service was horrible, as well as the food quality. Let me clarify: I walk in to this restaurant in International Plaza from the 5 minute walk from parking spot i found the 3rd row down roughly a quarter of a mile away. Once getting to the restaurant I notice the nice atmosphere and feel relieved i've made it to a fairly nice place. Decorated with rich colors and comfortable tables and chairs. A little big for my taste but still an all around nice atmosphere. No sooner am I impressed that i notice the line. After 10 minutes in line I ask for a table of 2 and am told the wait will be roughly 30 minutes. I decide to wait as I've heard the Cheesecake there is to die for. So I sit outside with my date and have a conversation over a cigarette and coffee at the Starbucks just up the street. We decide to walk back to Cheese Fact. and when we get there I ask the host if the table is ready. Yes she says. She has us wait on the side for our escort, and to my unknowing turmoil to come. After 5 minutes we are finally seated in the back right corner of the Restaurant and immediately i notice the the table is exceptionally small. and the space between the tables is smaller then my dates ass and she bumps the table next to us. And is immediately embarrassed as its an older couple after some  nervous apologies we get back to our date. By this time I'm pretty hungry as its been almost an hour and we have yet to order our food. After waiting another 10 minutes our waitress comes back and asks what we'd like to drink? My date and are have been talking about ordering so I let her know we are actually ready to order. She says great what would you like? I order the Chicken Alfredo dish and a appetizer and my date orders a similar meal with water to drink.. She says great and we will have that ready for you in no time. 10 minutes go by and our waiter hasn't returned. Finally she comes bringing the water and an appetizer. I realize immediately as its the incorrect appetizer that is gonna be down hill from here. I tell the waitress politely that there must have been a mistake as i ordered a different appetizer. She disagrees with me and says this is what I ordered. Now, I'm not one to be a asshole to people who serve me my food. But when I'm told i said something when i didn't that really gets me heated. I refrain from snapping at her and say well can you bring out the other appetizer. She turns and i catch a her eyes rolling. I almost loose it but my date keeps me cool by holding me back. After 20 more minutes without our waitress, She returns with a forced smile saying how is the appetizers. I let her know that we are still waiting on the others. She apologizes and leaves us. About 5 minutes later she and another waiter bring over the carrying trays with the food. I make a mental note: (Why the fuck would i want my appetizer with my food) Starving and uncaring about the poor service I start eating my food. For the next 10 minutes I'm interrupted ever 2 asking how everything is and now I'm livid.  About the food: The Chicken was dry and under seasoned and the noodles were over cooked. My date took two bites and couldn't eat another. Even the bread sticks were cold and stale, the appetizers tasted like they had been microwaved hot. After another 30 minutes upon completion of our meals our waitress returns asking us if we'd like desserts. We order a slice of Cheese Cake. and get it in about 5 minutes. Its not bad but a little bland for a Chocolate Covered Strawberry cheesecake.  Another 3 times asking if its good and our waitress finally gives us our check. its now been about 3 hours and I'm ready to bail on this horrible meal. The check says $55.68 which isn't bad but for the food and its quality maybe worth $30 at the most. I was so mad at this point I left 5 dollar tip. I also wrote on the receipt, ""If I was the owner you would be cleaning the toilets to keep your job. Thanks to your service and demeanor I will never be coming back to this chain ever again!"""
Lana A.,"Kapaa, HI",8,332,1,5.0,4/14/2010,"I'll make this short and sweet. We found this Cheesecake Factory to be great for a quick and luscious dessert. Well, it would be quick if the dang cheesecakes weren't so rich. ;-) Service here is friendly, helpful and efficient even though we had a messy toddler in tow."
Nikki J.,"Tampa, FL",0,40,,5.0,12/9/2012,"I know the Cheese Cake Factory is a chain but it's my guilty pleasure. I love their food, I love their cocktails and of course I love their cheese cake. Some Good Notes About The Cheese Cake Factory: Hands down best mojito I've ever had - The Pineapple Mojito. I rarely do cocktails at chain restaurants becuase they use cheap mixes that taste like crap. So one day I was out celebrating with a friend and we decided we were going to have drinks. The waitress suggested the pineapple mojito and I have yet to find a mojito anywhere that tastes as amazing as this. Not only is this a fresh handcrafted cocktail but their is no funky ""mix"" taste, they use fresh pineapple and it's not overly sugary/sweet. I have sampled many items on their menu, they are all very good, I've honestly never had anything bad but I really love their Chicken Bellagio. It's a fried chicken cutlet over a some pasta in a basil cream sauce that has a prosciutto and arugula salad on top. It's often slightly too salty for me so I always get a small bowl of marinara sauce on the side. Their brunch is delicious and never disappoints! I've had their eggs benedict, crab hash, steak and eggs and my favorite by far is the baja chicken hash. It's tortillas loaded with chicken chorizo, chilis, potatoes, cheese, peppers and onions. On top of that it's covered with eggs and a hollandaise sauce. It's so smoky and flavorful and just all kinds of yumminess. You must try this if you go there. Of course their cheesecakes are amazing too. I have yet to try a flavor I didn't like. Some Not So Good Notes: Let's face it, it's a popular chain so sometimes the wait sucks and it's at a crowded mall. Also I do find their drinks are a little over pricd. Other then that I can't say I have any complaints. Bottom Line: Typical chains offers great food for brunch, lunch, dinner or dessert and has really great cocktails."
LA A.,"Miami, FL",1,68,,1.0,7/25/2011,"Nasty dry food that took forever. One meal was raw, so sent back, it to arrivedraw! Servers change mid shift??? What thee hell is that all about!  Place sucks."
Naj A.,"Tampa, FL",2,8,,1.0,7/7/2012,"I love cheesecake factory..however, recently I noticed a problem with the waitresses..for some reason they have an attitude and makes you feel unwelcome, some are great but my recent experience was horrible. Our server was a careless gay who said oh im sorry after looking around and talking to people while taking our order? table was dirty and smelly and we had to ask to get it cleaned? then the order comes wrong? we reported our concerns to the manager as he came out to solve the issue, we ended up paying for the drinks and appetizer and did not get our order!"
eliza b.,"Haddonfield, NJ",232,406,67,3.0,2/9/2009,"the cheesecake factory, for me, is never amazing. it's overpriced and the menu is daunting, the decor is silly and the service is average. however, when you're traveling and you want something that you know will be good & consistent from city to city, the cheesecake factory is an excellent choice.  i visited this location and wasn't disappointed. i've only ever ordered one dish from CF - the luau salad with grilled chicken, no wontons, add avocado.  this place didn't disappoint - it hit the spot, and it was nice & fresh.  however, usually since i'm removing the wontons, the avocado are added at no extra cost. this location charged me an extra $3! what the! i wasn't going to argue but it really stunk that they did that."
Robin W.,"Maryville, TN",35,97,15,4.0,6/21/2011,"Okay I give this place a 4 star (I really expected a 5 star in this place, I have waited for many years to try this place). I loved the ambiance of the place it is a beautiful upscale restaurant it was very inmate and romantic. We went on a Sunday night with a party of 3 the wait was about 15-20 mins which the was not bad for a weekend night (Fathers Day to be exact).  I had Wild Mushroom Burger, it was good but not as good as I expected it was really greasy and the fries were very ordinary. Our party also ordered the Memphis Burger which looked good and the Pepperoni Pizza which was huge and look as good also. I also ordered the Strawberry Lemonade .. fantastically good. The service was good and prompt our server was really good and on point. After dinner we each ordered cheesecake, I had the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake yummy and so rich I had to take half home with me. I tasted the Cherry Cheesecake and it was delicious. We also took home a 6in White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle to take home and it was over the top good. I suggest going for dessert alone.  I plan on going  again I really want to try the Brunch. A Yelp on how Brunch is coming soon I hope."
William K.,"Savannah, GA",36,142,290,4.0,7/26/2009,"Great food and friendly service.  The Cheesecake Factory has a menu that is like a small book, anybody can find something they will like.  I recommend the Kobe Beef burger, it is great.  Save room for the cheesecake, its worth the trip alone."
amber s.,"Lutz, FL",1,15,,4.0,8/30/2011,"Great company to work for - always has amazing collection of items to choose from, everyone will be satisfied! Also great for accommodating large parties, unlike most local restaurants"
Ms. Review S.,"Salisbury, MA",23,294,16,5.0,6/3/2008,"I went here on a Sunday night, waited 30 seconds for a table.  The service was excellent, food was delicious!  Chicken Madeira was great, the portions are huge, I shared it with my mom and there was enough for both of us.  I tried a new drink, the Gin Rickey, amazing, the perfect summer drink."
DONNA S.,"Seminole, FL",0,3,,1.0,8/28/2010,"this place has great cheesecake, but the food has a lot to be desired.  It has nothing fancy, like a TGIF.  Not sure why folks flock to this place."
Maresha M.,"Macon, GA",0,4,1,1.0,8/29/2011,"As all Cheescake Factories are, this one was busy.  We had a moderate wait time.  We noticed as we were walking to the table that the floor seemed a little slippery and as the light was cast across it, you could see what looked like a film of grease on the floor.  As it turns out, it was ""a film of grease on the floor.""  We were seated at a large booth.  The table was not clean, and my husband mentioned it to the person who seated us.  A bus boy promptly arrived with a cloth to wipe the table.  It was gray and dingy.  He could not reach all the way to the far side of the booth, so I offered to wipe that end.  As I grabbed the cloth, I was repulsed to feel that the cloth was cold and very greasy.  It was disgusting.  My husband mentioned this to the waiter who arrived very shortly thereafter, and he was very professional in his response.  He disappeared and reappeared with a warm cloth to wipe the table, but it was just too little too late.  We left without ever ordering.  This place needs a huge cleanup."
