Michelle M.,"Tampa, FL",0,33,47,5.0,4/25/2017,Had a wonderful time with my daughters food was good and all love to go back again soon cakes are so yummy too 3 people and appetizers and deserts 77.96 can't beat that love it
Kelsey H.,"Hoboken, NJ",139,79,843,4.0,12/30/2015,"Service was less than stellar (as it has been in the past) due to ""a shift change"". The soup, salad and 1/2 sandwich dinner combo was more than enough food for two. I should of ordered dressing on the side and did not so that was my fault bc the leaves were over saturated. The mushroom soup of the day wouldn't normally be my first choice but it was very tasty. We ordered nacho appetizer but wouldn't get that again if with an older crowd (dining with multiple children).  The salted caramel cheesecake was divine but OH. SO. SWEET! Split with another and still had extra. There is always a line no matter the time and there is no call ahead or reservation options allotted.  All in all, I would go again but recommend sticking to smaller plates for more variety."
Jennifer A.,"Reunion, FL",0,14,1,5.0,8/4/2017,Cheesecakes are always great! Got a take out here while vacationing. I've had some cheesecakes that are better but it's The Cheesecake Factory! I've been to so many cheesecake factory's. I have to go to one whenever I'm out of town because we don't have one in my area.
Dani G.,"Orlando, FL",0,3,2,1.0,7/22/2017,"If there was a way to utilize a negative star that's what I'd do. I frequent this same establishment in Winter Park, FL and have never had any complaints in all regards. I don't even know how the employees can work in such a nasty environment. Sadly I'll never know because after sitting in almost empty restaurant for 10 minutes I didn't even get to meet my server. That was it for me. Please do not come here to eat unless you've got closed toe shoes on,  bring your own silverware & Windex for both the table and the walls."
Sofia D.,"FL, FL",460,223,1034,5.0,6/1/2015,"Why do I go to Cheesecake Factory? To get consistently great food every time, that's why. They never disappoint me. One of the best chains out there. There is something for everybody  ... an extensive variety of food options, awesome drinks and of course delicious cheesecake. It's hard to leave without ordering a slice.  Now if they would just get rid of PF Changs at the Countryside mall and replace it with Cheesecake Factory my life would be complete:-) P.S. Amanda...  Best server ever!!!!"
David C.,"Chicago, IL",102,415,460,2.0,6/6/2016,"Came here with the family for lunch on a weekday and was surprised that it was so busy. It had been awhile since I had come here...and I couldn't remember why?? I had the Bang bang chicken and shrimp, and my family got the garlic noodles, the chicken and spaghetti, the chicken marsala, and of course some cheesecake. We had a pleasant time and thought the good was ok. The problem was later in the day...I got indigestion which I rarely get and my dad got really nauseated and sick. Days later we were still complaining about not feeling well. Now I remember why I haven't come back. Will be avoiding this place for awhile. The 2 stars are for the cheesecake...neither my dad or I had any but my family said was great!"
Caryn B.,"Durham, NC",4,21,1,2.0,6/24/2017,"I used to be a big fan of Cheesecake, but my last experience was unsatisfactory. I got a takeout order, a simple one, and drove 30 minutes to pick it up. It seemed correct, but after eating some of my pasta it became clear that they had put meat in it, and I'm a vegetarian. The pasta doesn't normally come with meat, so I'm not sure why it was added. In addition, the timeframe for our takeout to be ready was 25-30 mins and it took almost an hour! When I emailed Corporate with my complaint, nobody ever got back to me."
John B.,"DeLand, FL",6,12,10,1.0,8/20/2016,After 25 min on a Tuesday night I got my meal. Let me just say a 5 yr old could have made a better salad.  It looked like someone pulled it from the washing machine and threw it on a plate. The mushroom burger came out way over cooked  The mushrooms were way over cooked as well.  For the price that you pay for a patty that Burger King offers you would expect better quality of meat and meal. I'm sorry to say but we told the waitress 3 times that the meal was bad but never did anything about it. When we left the hostess that the experience was bad her reply was have a good day.
Michelle U.,"Orlando, FL",145,13,1,2.0,12/26/2016,"The food was very good, nicely prepared and presentation was well done. The service was not up to par and disappointing.  Sad to see the tables around us, that were seated after us, get served first."
Andrea C.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,17,2,3.0,7/30/2017,"This was my first time here and I gave it 3 stars because everything was ok.... just ok..... it's wasn't terrible but wasn't great.... everything seemed to take a long time to get, drinks, food, desert. I work in a restaurant so I know that sometimes things take long but everything took long. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."
Chris S.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,6,3,3.0,7/30/2017,"Place is alright. Had the Cajun jumbalaya over linguine noodles. I wasn't blown away by the dish overall. Service was fairly slow but it was Sunday lunch during national cheesecake day, so I'm sure that had something to do with it. All in all it was decent but I wouldn't go outta my way to visit em"
Amanda Nicole M.,"Tampa, FL",195,56,24,5.0,12/4/2016,"I always love the Cheesecake Factory. The fact that they are a well known and established franchise already makes this place great. With that being said, the largest factor that will differentiate one location from another is service. I believe I have been to this location three times now. Once was to have some drinks and eat at the bar, another was to go, and the third was just to get cheesecake. The best experience of the three was definitely while I was dining in. The bar tender I had was very kind and attentive and of course, my food was great. The one thing I would criticize thus far is that, especially on busy nights or busy seasons, the area in which customers go simply to order cheesecake needs to be better attended. I waited for probably 10-15 minutes before someone even acknowledged me. Not to mention, I was the next in line with several behind me. I definitely understand getting busy, but a quick ""I'll be with you in a just a moment"" will make the world of a difference to customers who are perhaps less patient. Other than that... love it as always!"
Reba P.,"Tampa, FL",183,11,2,4.0,4/18/2017,"Very slow service at first, we sat at a high top and weren't greeted so we went back to the hostess and asked for a table. We sat at the table and it took a good 10 minutes before we were greeted, I will say it's probably because of the shift changes. But still atleast have someone take our drink order or something. We found out that happy hour is only allowed near the bar... stupid. We asked to be moved and our waitress seemed nice about it. The apps were awesome and our new waiter was also pretty awesome, he definitely saved the experience. He was super quick and friendly."
Paul M.,"Punta Gorda, FL",31,5,,3.0,5/7/2017,Ordered the pasta with chicken. First bite of chicken had a huge piece of gristle of it. I expected much more from this restaurant.
Ren C.,"Tampa, FL",170,245,152,4.0,2/28/2016,"Why 4 star?? I could have given 5 however our server was not that great at the beginning of our dine in experience. My cousin that is visiting from Canada told his girlfriend that this place is one of the best and he wanted his girlfriend to experience this place as they don't have them in Canada. But he was disappointed at first just like me. But towards the middle of the experience our server became more pleasant and active.  To tell you honestly the bread that they give out before your dinner/lunch is the best especially the chocolate bread (not sure of the name, but I named it Ren's bread. Lol.) I ordered the skinnylicious steak medallions and it was the perfect serving for me coz sometimes other places have this huge servings.   Better service would go long way. So my suggestion is that give a better service to get more costumer coming back."
Diana G.,"Tampa, FL",0,5,5,1.0,10/13/2017,"We couldn't really have had a worse experience here this week. My husband and I went here for dinner on a Monday night - it wasn't crowded at all, empty tables all around, and yet it took us over two hours start to finish. Our dinner (the first round) took 45 minutes to come out. My husband ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp and the chicken was dry, there was no spice - all coconut, and the rice was undercooked and hard. The server even mentioned when they messed up the order that they make it too sweet with coconut. I ordered a spicy pasta dish and the ""sauce"" was more like watery soup. So when our server was nowhere to be found, we had another server approach us because we were looking for our original server. She took our orders back and put in the order for replacement meals and assured us she let her manager know that it was unsatisfactory. The manager never came over to speak with us and our original server only showed up to say here are your new meals maybe 30 minutes later. It was just so disappointing overall - it was like we were a bother, not paying customers. And for that matter for the price you pay at Cheesecake Factory for this level of service and quality its just insulting. Do yourself a favor and have a great meal two stops down at Brio instead."
Tiffany J.,"Tampa, FL",15,30,28,4.0,5/27/2016,We came for Happy hour and sat in the bar area. They have a special happy hour menu with $5.50 prices on food and drinks.  I ordered Tex mex rolls as an appetizer and a burger. I love the fact that the give you full portion meals at the reduced price.  The burger was absolutely  delicious. The bun was buttery and toasted to perfection.   I loved having the option to choose good dishes on a happy hour menu. It's not like most places where there are only a few options. The reason I gave 4 stars is because they forgot to bring out my fries with the burger. The waitress said they would be coming out later but they never came. I ended up cancelling them because I was half done with my burger and full.
Sam C.,"Delray Beach, FL",0,10,,1.0,8/17/2017,"My wife and I stopped here after a 4 hour drive from Delray Beach for a late lunch.  We both ordered the fish Tacos. They took quite a while to come out, we asked about them twice, and when they did, they had tiny bits of dry over cooked fish on them.  We started eating, but they really were too ridiculous today.  We called over our server and asked if this was how they were supposed to look.  He said no and said he was embarrassed.  He then said he would get more fish and a manager.  Again it took awhile for the manager to show up, she apologized and said she would resolve and left.  Then the extra fish the server ordered arrived.  From tiny to small and still over cooked.  We asked for manager again, and again it took awhile, while waiting the fish we assume, the manager ordered arrived and it was appropriate, but the Tacos were now cold and soggy.  We ate some of the fish, and we were not charged, but what a mess.  We had not been to a Cheesecake in about two years, since a salad I was eating had staples in it, and I don't think we will be returning.  Cheesecake used to be one of our ""go to"" restaurants across the country.   Not any more.  Sad to see the deterioration in the chain."
Devindra P.,"Tampa, FL",14,12,,2.0,12/17/2016,"Been here several time and they are not the consistent with the service or food quality. Last night was the final straw for me it took them 45 minutes to bring out their number one chicken dish along with an easy taco salad for two people and this was not even prime time. Also, a table of four people sat down next to us 20 minutes after us and they got their food before us, but our waiter finally showed up and said hmmmm I wonder where your food was. The food finally came out mashed potatoes were cold and looks like they are cutting back on the serving size of the chicken breast that came with meal which they charge almost 20 Bucks for just one plate . This place is mess and I will not be back!!"
Deke M.,"Tampa, FL",39,1169,1194,4.0,9/16/2016,"I had a great ""virgin"" experience with Cheesecake Factory.  This one is a high volume restaurant with a valet parking option and ginormous lot.  I was not impressed with the two hostesses and the ""clog"" at the front door at 12:30 on a work day-they did not seem efficient and seating though there were empty spots.  I was seated in the bar area after 10 minutes (and could've walked in and sat myself there in 1 minute). They have a large menu of options and the presentation was impressive on items passing my table.  I decided to go with their light starters on their ""Skinnylicious"" menu so I would have room to try the cheesecake.  I enjoyed the summer rolls, full of shrimp, served cold with TWO great sauces, one ginger and one peanut.  It was crisp and flavorful (cilantro-y).  $8 I chose the pecan pumpkin cheesecake newly out for the season, also $8.  I enjoyed the flavor and the ""real"" whip cream.  I found the pastry crust bottom too tough to cut with a fork. Service (by Heather) was excellent despite the crowds.  I was surprised to see so many college kids (eating such an expensive lunch) and they created too much ""noise"" (who taught them to laugh so the entire restaurant can hear them?)  I would not rate ambiance high here. I can't make my lunch a $20 bill every day, but this was a nice treat overall."
