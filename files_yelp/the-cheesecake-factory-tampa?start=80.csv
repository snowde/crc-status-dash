Bill K.,"Rumson, NJ",0,14,5,3.0,3/20/2017,We got some of the small plate appetizers the food is always pretty consistent at Cheesecake Factory but it's never great three stars because I believe the service is good
Vivian N.,"Tampa, FL",75,136,1373,3.0,4/7/2016,"Went in for a Sunday brunch. Ordered ""Breakfast Monte Cristo"" & ""Chicken & Waffles Benedict"". I recommend both because they are flavorful!  However DO NOT order side order of ""fresh fruits"". There's nothing fresh about it! btw do save room for a cheesecake  =)"
Alicia T.,"Tampa, FL",0,3,1,1.0,3/5/2017,Worst customer service ever! Even if you place your food to go. Called the first time one and a half hr before they were closing and the lady in the ph said hello once didn't eve waited for me to respond and hang up on me. I end up calling a total of 5 times and no one responded when my husband went the restaurant was empty and there was waters talking and didn't even helped him. Never again!!
Kathy D.,"Tampa, FL",267,1207,2174,2.0,8/7/2016,"I'll freely admit I have had a few good experiences at the Cheesecake Factory. They definately have something for everyone on the menu....a vast variety. Service is never really good. It is like the employees have an air of entitlement & you are lucky to be getting their time. This isn't once....it's pretty much across the board. I don't know maybe they had a meeting about being pretentious. This in & of itself is more than enough to keep me away. Unfortunately friends, etc. always want to meet there, so I end up back there, not by choice. Gotta admit I love the unique & quirky interior. That is the 1 thing I always find enjoyable about this establishment. I have had so many different & varried dishes from the menu, details are unimportant. Overall, it is obvious it's a chain restaurant.  They definately are not happy with you when you try to change up a dish, just a little, it really has thrown more than 1 server into a complete tailspin. I have learned to just stick to basics, keep my expectations low & concentrate on the company I am in & the ambience. Truly, I am at a loss as to why so many people love this place. What's a girl to do? Go with the flow, enjoy the company you are in & have an extra cocktail!"
Tom T.,"Clearwater, FL",0,123,3,2.0,7/20/2016,"Tom Terrific here with another honest restaurant review. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I'm pleased to say that my reviews apparently have some weight as I've been asked for an interview from THE TAMPA BAY TIMES newspaper about my Yelp columns/remarks. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~` right off I want to tell you this is only my second visit to the CF with my first being in Pittsburgh. take this review with a grain of salt because I don't care for these restaurants and did not want to come here. but someone gave me a $25 gift card and it's been sitting there in my glove box forever so I was near the International Plaza and hungry so... I walked in and was not greeted. no one was at the desk. a woman came in behind me and asked where the hostess was. I looked around at the attempt to make the architecture resemble something Romanesque. I just found it phony, overly ambitious and distasteful. parts of the ceiling near the entrance appear to be 30 feet high.  I was finally taken to an area where there were a bunch of people and it was loud. i'm hearing impaired and with the cavernous ceilings it was echoing and reverberating in my hearing helpers like Jimmy Hendrix at Woodstock.  I asked for a quiet area and was given one. I ordered Steak Diane medium with mashed potatoes for $20 and just to use up the rest of the gift card I asked for a side of French fries for $5. the steak was served very warm and tasty, perfectly prepared medium with grilled onions. but the mashed potatoes were not only unremarkable and NOT warm but they were so rigid that I put my heavy butter knife into them handle side up and it stood up straight then finally fell over after 30 seconds. I hit the mound of ""mud"" with my spoon and I hardly put a dent in it. the fries looked nice but had obviously been made first and were sitting (along with the mashed potatoes) under a heat lamp until the sirloin was done cooking. they had little warmth to them. I find The Cheesecake Factory to be pretentious and way overpriced. tipped the server $3 and got the hell out of there with having only eaten all the steak, two fries and one bite of mashies for $25 plus tax. like I said at the beginning take this review for what it's worth."
Alexis M.,"Baltimore, MD",59,30,66,3.0,11/2/2016,It's been hit and miss as we like their Cobb salad and last visit there was no chicken in the huge mound of lettuce- had another issue on previous visit and manager made things right but last time we just ate part of the less than usual salad and didn't have time to get manager
Erin B.,"Tampa, FL",0,1,2,5.0,6/7/2017,"I had the filet mignon, and fiancée had the Sheppard's Pie. Both were fantastic! The service was a little slow, but it was busy so maybe that was the reason. But food was perfect and tender, as ordered. Very good!"
Melissa R.,"Manhattan, NY",202,6,12,1.0,1/5/2017,"I am a huge Cheesecake fan, but it takes just one horrible experience to keep me from going back.  It started from the rude and demeaning hostess, and continued through to my soggy appetizer and burnt salmon.  I appreciated the manager coming out and attempting to right their wrong...  but this was after we asked for the manager for the third time.  Still, he was kind and professional, and acknowledged our concerns.  I still was not impressed and do not plan to go back."
Louis D.,"Palm Harbor, FL",90,68,,4.0,11/2/2016,"I had no interest in going here, we went with another couple.. - it is just not my type of restaurant but I was pleasantly surprised.  Our waitress, Jitka, was efficient, timely and professional. the overall pace of the meal was perfect.  Everyone at the table was satisfied with their option.  I had the Fish and Chips and they were perfect.  The fish sometimes can be soggy and limp but, here it was flakey delicious, and the breading tasted kinda like Arthur Treachers (old school New York).  The cole slaw was homemade. Prices were a little on the high side but you expect that in that type of location.  Nothing bad to say... Will return... overall, it was a great experience!"
Genie S.,"Tampa, FL",46,20,7,1.0,2/12/2017,"Overpriced and slow service. It took over 2 hours to eat around 3 on a Sunday. Our drinks and food were wayyyyy over priced. It cost $130 for two entrees, a couple beers and a couple margaritas. Never again, as the food was not special. The drinks were Miller Lite and a poor tasting margarita. Save your money and go anywhere else to eat."
Charles U.,"Tampa, FL",5,11,,5.0,5/19/2017,I would like to extend a thank you to Jessica the night manger. We had a party of ten bowlers. She help set up a table for us and provide excellent service. We had another great time. We always have our year end bowling party at the cheesecake. Looking forward to next year. Thanks Jessica.
Shannon Q.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",53,5,,3.0,5/13/2017,I work in hospitality in HR actually so I understand the value of good service. Whoever Melissa is that answers the phone she needs grade A customer service training. She not only is rude she tries to be curt and sarcastic when you question her lack of customer service. Great ToGo service though really wish I had her name because she was excellent. Maybe she can train Melissa and give her a few tips.
Katherine Y.,"Tampa, FL",127,115,202,4.0,12/30/2015,"Whenever I dine at the Cheesecake Factory, I always anticipate a bit of a wait to get seated and served, but this location seems to take especially long. My friend ordered a salad with chicken and it took 30+ minutes and reminding the staff about 3 times. The staff is really kind and friendly, so it kind of makes up for the slow service. I would recommend curbside pickup for this location instead.  However, the food is constantly delicious and of course the cheesecake is so on point, it'll put you right in a food coma. I love the dulce de leche cheesecake, FYI.  The last time I was here, I went straight to the cake counter instead and the women working at the time were so nice and fun!"
Frank F.,"Tampa, FL",96,59,66,4.0,6/3/2016,"Usually great. Place is almost always BUSY, so be prepared to wait especially at peak times. Menu has plenty to offer everyone. So many choices!! Clean and pleasing atmosphere. Great surrounding area as well. Reccomended for sure."
Lei J.,"Lutz, FL",0,3,3,1.0,9/15/2017,"Terrible service, idiot manager, food took forever, was cold, and we saw our waiter 2 times the whole meal."
Christopher M.,"Gainesville, FL",66,296,294,3.0,1/15/2015,"I was going to give them 4-stars, then I saw that 3-stars was A-OK, and that's exactly what you get from The Cheesecake Factory.  First off, for what you get it's expensive. Most of the food seems to be           pre-made, thrown into a microwave, and then served. I usually get the chicken marsala, which the chicken is always bland, but I get it because I love bow-tie  pasta. This time I tried the Spicy Chicken Chasew, which was really good, except the chicken was scalding hot on the inside (a tell-tale sign of microwaved food). There cheesecakes are great. My all time favorite is the Red Velvet Cheesecake, which is ~1200 calories per slice. PER SLICE! As amazing as it is that is too much, maybe after I run a marathon or one a day you treat yo' self."
Shani Z.,"Brookfield, CT",20,18,8,4.0,3/8/2017,"Looking forward to have more vegan options on the menus... and I'm very surprised there isn't one vegan cake, step it up guys!!"
Cynthia N.,"Oldsmar, FL",54,70,31,5.0,2/27/2016,Excellent! No long wait Excellent service by Katilynn My salmon potatoes and asparagus excellent The tea perfect  Of course if you know The Cheesecake Factory you know what to expect.  Good Eats
Gunther L.,"Largo, FL",2,2,3,2.0,9/13/2016,My wife and I came to The Cheesecake Factory in Tampa for the first time and unfortunately the LAST time. The host greeted us and sat us right away. Our waiter took a few minutes to greet us and take our drink order. When he finally did come to the table he smelled like he had just been smoking. We have no problem with smokers but my wife is pregnant and very sensitive to smells.  Our appetizer was okay. When my meal came it did not look very appealing and I realized that I had ordered the wrong thing. It took the waiter about 10mins before he came back to the table and when I told him that this isn't what I had expected and wanted to change my meal he sigh and took the plate and walked away. He never came back to the table until we were done eating. He never asked my wife if she enjoyed her meal-which she didn't care for it.  The waiters/waitresses are the face of the restaurant and we do not plan to come back. I was surprised that the manager was no where to be seen nor did he/she come to check that everything was okay after I changed me order. A little table touch by the manager would have defused the problem some. We decided to not order any cheesecake and just left.
Tian Z.,"Tampa, FL",0,11,1,3.0,9/13/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is a monster of a restaurant that has so much potential to be an amazing restaurant. Unfortunately, the only thing good in this restaurant is the cheesecake. I wish that the service and food could be better. Every time I've visited, I've had to wait an extended period of time for a server to greet us. In general, they just don't seem to be very happy working there.  The food is nothing to write home about. The menu is huge though so I'm sure there are some hidden treasures that I just haven't tried yet. Finally, the cheesecake is just incredible. The crew at the to go station is great every time I go in. And I will continue coming back for the cheesecake for sure!"
