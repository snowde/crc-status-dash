Elle G.,"The Woodlands, TX",132,97,193,5.0,1/7/2018,"So many options!  There is something for everyone. Portions are generally large enough to share which is perfect for us.  Don't forget to leave room for dessert... again, lots of options.   Wait staff was very attentive and friendly.  A big factor for us.   Great location, with quick walking distance to mall, Cinemark movie theater and other shopping.  Can't ever go wrong with Cheesecake Factory."
Elena A.,"Harrisburg, PA",40,15,3,4.0,11/29/2017,"I have ALWAYS loved The Cheesecake Factory but I hardly ever get to go. Visiting with friends we decided to hit this spot after a day of shopping in a local village.  We were originally told our wait time would be about 20 or so minutes and 10 minutes later we were being called to sit down. YAY!  Our server was amazing...  Andrew, I think his name was...  he was kind and helpful and he even put up with our tired crazy silliness.  He joked right in with us.  Drinks were YUM. Food was YUM. Appetizers were YUM. Atmosphere was amazing. We just had an all around fantastic experience!  Thank you!!!!! Keep up the good work!"
Amanda S.,"Houston, TX",116,2,,1.0,7/22/2017,"My husband and I came in to eat after an afternoon of shopping. It's also our anniversary and we wanted to have a nice dinner.  We were seated in a section and basically became the ""forgotten table"" of the section and received the worst service. I'm being generous giving one star--the one star is for the entrees ordered and the cheesecake. I am not one to give a negative review, but this visit warrants one. Things that went wrong: -Seating two people at a 4-top table when there were several other groups of 4 people that could have sat at the table -Staring at an open two-top table for a total of 20 minutes that we ended up being seated at -server taking a while to get our drink order  -server checking other tables but failing to check on my husband's drink (which was empty)FOUR times.  -Refilling his Dr. Pepper with sweet tea after being told he had a Dr. Pepper -Server being a little rude and asking ""if we were ready yet"" twice. Ask if we have any questions or if we are ready to order not ""Are you ready yet?"" ESPECIALLY when one of us has worked in the restaurant business. -Server seeming like she was in a huge rush to get us out of the restaurant yet being accommodating to the other tables in the section Next time, ADEQUATELY train servers to serve this section properly and train your hostesses to seat sections correctly. There's a possibility of returning but that possibility is very slim."
Jane I.,"The Woodlands, TX",345,352,823,4.0,6/12/2017,"While a gift certificate led me to its doors, the food (and its ample, generous portions) were what won me over. The ornamentation and decorations were over the top and even a little gaudy, but that was really where the negatives came to a screeching halt. Much like other Cheesecake Factory franchises, seating was ample and service was relaxed and unhurried at the early dinner hour we arrived. That's not to say we were ignored; our hostess and waitress were spot on throughout our meal to make sure we were well attended.  I ordered the fried shrimp and fries, expecting a standard boardwalk basket-sized meal. Instead, my husband and I both goggled at the site of a plate that took up half our two-seater table. Best of all, it was well done. The shrimp were fresh, well-battered, and piping hot while some fries even had residual oil bubbles, signifying their swim in the baptismal fryer only seconds ago.  There was enough of my meal to be enjoyed both at the restaurant and later for a second dinner at home, which was much appreciated in the age of tiny courses and big plates. Prices are surprisingly reasonable, considering the sheer volume of food on the plate, and the menu is straightforward, approachable American fare. With both the mall and Waterway within walkable distance, there are some great options for postprandial walks.  We unfortunately didn't have a chance to partake in the namesake dessert but with our first visit being so positive, I'd be happy to make a return visit in the near future."
Karyn K.,"The Woodlands, TX",271,463,2372,3.0,2/14/2017,This review is based on a weekday Happy Hour: Joint to ourselves.... Good service ..... Nice H2 menu .... Satisfying fare .... PS:   per Consumerist (part of Consumer Reports) The Cheesecake receipts have incorrect (inflated) recommended gratuity amounts ....
Barbara P.,"The Woodlands, TX",78,104,214,4.0,2/18/2017,I love this Cheesecake Factory! Simple food nothing too frilly. The peach Bellini is my favorite  ( and yes I'm a lightweight)  We come here often since this location is so close to the mall and other great shopping and movie options.
Cornelius S.,"Houston, TX",141,197,225,5.0,10/15/2017,Wow.  This place was so nice and friendly.  Superb service.  The food was extremely good.  The food was so good that I had to get some dessert.  And it was UNBELIEVABLE.  The steak was one of the best I have had in awhile.  If you every go you must try the Turtle Cheese Cake.  Thanks for the great food and the great customer service.  Ask for Blake
Rachel L.,"Spring, TX",18,172,,4.0,6/17/2017,"Giant portions, good food, and great cheesecake.  I've probably been to this location two dozen times and the only times I have had poor service have been when the restaurant is slammed, which does happen all day Saturday and Sundays. But sometimes I have great service then, too. They probably have over 30 appetizers to choose from. Four different types of egg rolls, buffalo wings, quesadillas, samosas, fried mac n cheese balls, flatbreads, etc. They have 20 different pasta dishes, 10+ different sandwiches and burgers, fish, steak, salads. You get it. They have a lot to choose from, including their amazing cheesecake. My favorite is the Oreo Dream Extreme. There are plenty of seats inside and a covered patio outside for people watching.  It can be pricey but once you consider how much food you received you definitely get your money's worth. I would suggest splitting a small plate, entree and slice of cheesecake with your date and you will still take some food home probably."
Chan'tel G.,"Spring, TX",442,470,1366,5.0,10/6/2016,"I'm finally reviewing this amazing location and I smile at the thought of the burger I ate. I typically go for the pasta here but I  was hungry and wanted more of a bite. Oooh weeee...yasss. My soul was happy. So happy that I seriously only want to come to this location to order this burger again. I didn't even get fancy with it either. It's the Americana with no onion, medium well with a side of sweet potato fries. Oh, and the sweet potato fries were one of the best I've had period. The other place is at a restaurant in Dallas. Oh, I also ate a bite of my friend's choclate hazelnut cheesecake...yassss. You can't marry restaurants, huh? I've been through many, in many locations and I think I finally might have found the one. Looks like others I know, but nah, they're something special."
Mary V.,"Spring, TX",106,415,182,4.0,2/20/2017,"A very gratifying luncheon experience, particularly since this was my first venture to The Cheesecake Factory. Bustling on a Sunday right around noon, I thought surely it would be difficult to snag a table, particularly with a toddler and a stroller with an infant in tow.  A five-minute wait was all it took:  high chair provided automatically and booster seat provided upon request. Service was gracious and accommodating.  Drinks were served quickly with our lunch order arriving shortly thereafter.  Advice:  if you are not a heavy lunch eater -- order from the Appetizer menu.  Even those portions are huge, but nothing compared to the regular meals. Tex-Mex Eggrolls were good (albeit slightly greasy) with a flavorful avocado/sour cream dip.  A big thumbs-up on the children's menu offerings:  good eats for the kids with and optional side of fresh fruit.  Fresh fruit it was:  small diced pineapple, sliced strawberries and blueberries.  Lucious! The cheesecake selection is, quite obviously, their signature line.  When I saw the consistency and presentation of the slice of cheesecake my son ordered, I knew why this was a favorite spot of his.  Definitely eat lightly if you want a slice of any of their cheesecake for dessert, that's for sure."
Sarah B.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,5.0,12/31/2017,"I am skeptical of these types of franchises. However, the Cheesecake Factory has (for the most part) given me exceptional service at an affordable price. Just yesterday I went there and had such amazing service and food. John Beck made sure that we were taken care of, when it was obvious that the place was packed. The chicken Alfredo melted in my mouth, and thankfully my friend let me taste the carne asada. Amazing! Thank you, John! And thank you Cheesecake Factory"
Lisa R.,"Spring, TX",130,94,143,4.0,9/10/2017,I'm super impatient and never want to wait. As you may know that the bar has self seating. This is the second time my family and I have sat at the bar to avoid the wait time. I felt I need to give kotos to the bar tenders. There were only two of them working on a busy Saturday with a good twenty people in their area. I really appreciated how customer oriented they were. They both tag teamed and provided great service and apologize for any delays. There friendly warm smiles forgave any delays in service. Thank you!
George W.,"Humble, TX",9,15,7,5.0,11/6/2017,"This place is incredible! Staff is always friendly & attentive. The food! OMG the food! My wife & I have been here at least 6 or 7 times & get something different every time. It's so good we're wanting to try a wide variety, but it's hard because the burgers are my weakness. Lets not forget about the cheesecake. The cheesecake is ""last meal"" worthy. My personal favorite has to be the Oreo cheesecake & the Reese's cheesecake. The price can get up there for 2 people if ordering apps, meals, & desserts, but it's so worth it. Also, don't go here if you're counting calories. This is a place you go if you're wanting a serious cheat meal. Even the salads are high in calories, but like I said, worth it!"
Reagan O.,"Houston, TX",58,13,19,1.0,10/1/2017,From the moment we walked in the door the experience was awful. This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory and it was not pleasant. When we sat down our table was dirty as well as our silverware. We ordered fried cheese as our appetizer with a side of ranch & they forgot that.. then we ordered shrimp Alfredo for our meal and that was awful as well.. the shrimp was over cooked along with the pasta. We also asked the server before hand what shrimp would be better to order (grilled shrimp vs sautéed shrimp) and she recommended the sautéed which then came out horrible. We called a manager over and he was responsive but needless to say we will not be back. I was excited to try this place since I had never been and it was a waste of time.
Elisa M.,"Houston, TX",50,58,107,4.0,7/23/2017,Came in on a Sunday afternoon and the wait time was only 10 minutes but was actually seated in 5 minutes. The menu is really diverse and their is a lot of choices to pick from. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. The food came out pretty fast. We ordered a lunch special and a pasta. They  were both really good. We didn't get to try a cheesecake since we were so full since the food portions were so a pretty good size. Will definitely need to come back to try a cheesecake.
Melinda L.,"Houston, TX",790,66,21,3.0,7/24/2017,"They have a huge variety of course that everyone who has even eaten here knows. However, the quality is just that of a chain restaurant. I had the cobb salad. They chop up everything so fine that I can't tell how much I get as I dig through the mound of lettuce. The chicken is usually dry. I also got the chicken lettuce wraps in Mexican style since I have a gluten intolerance. They were not good at all. The flavors did not meld well and has a weird bitterness.  The good news is the service is excellent here."
Rewa L.,"Humble, TX",87,59,118,1.0,10/16/2017,"Subpar  service! My aunt's preference to celebrate her 66th birthday and it was a downhill slippery slope. My coffee, when presented to me was cold and old. I asked for a fresh cup. Our waiter said no problem. However, what I didn't hear him mumble was that he would heat it up. He brought it back heated up. I ask for a fresh cup, and he explained it would be awhile, a bit later he brought me a ""fresh"" cup only it still had an old coffee taste to it. Moving on to dinner, our entrees where served and all was well. We ask for additional bread, which did not show up until half-way thru our entrees. Our waiter showed more interests to the parties all around us. I was never asked if I wanted a refill on my coffee or water. We did inform our waiter we where celebrating my aunt's 66th birthday, his reply was ""Uhhh Happy Birthday"". He turned from us and gathered other staffers to sing happy birthday to that table. Then, turn back to us and asked of we needed to-go containers. No offer of desert. For heavens sake, I would have thought he would at least offer for us to buy what the restaurant is named after. We paid our bill and tipped him 15% against our better judgement.  We met up with the manager at the Cheesecake display and informed her of our service. She did apologized and offered my aunt a slice if cheesecake for the inconvenience."
Gabriela E.,"Fort Worth, TX",3,59,7,1.0,4/23/2017,"30.06 sign  No guns= no service  planned on trying this place for the first time but protecting myself from rapist, murderers and kidnappers is more important than any dish of food. Why would you take away someone's rights?"
Loren W.,"San Diego, CA",3,63,9,2.0,10/3/2017,"The food is good, cheesecake is yummy, but, the service is very subpar and the place is quite noisy. All in all not worth the price."
Maria D.,"Lewisville, TX",0,40,6,1.0,4/22/2017,"The food was good, but they made a HUGE mistake.   Our daughter has an actual gluten allergy, so we were pretty excited to see that they had gluten free pasta for the kids.  We ordered all of our food, ate everything, and only after we were done did the server come and tell us he accidentally grabbed actual pasta, not the gluten free one.  He basically just said he screwed  up, but didnt even act apologetic or anything. He asked if she just wanted gliten free, or had an allergy.  Im not one that looks for free things, but I feel, at the least, her meal should have been taken off.... he did not handle it well at all.  To me, it just sounded like he assumed we were just being health nuts. Allergies should always be taken seriously....."
Charles F.,"Spring, TX",1,3,18,5.0,10/24/2016,We had a fantastic night at the Cheesecake Factory. The bartender a young lady with blonde hair made the difference! She meticulously explained my options for a brownie ala mode and suggested instead a chocolate cake and added some custom features that made my anniversary dessert absolutely delectable. It's a shame that I do not recall her name but she went above and beyond and deserves recognition for making our night absolutely wonderful.  Other than that it was loud and packed as usual... 40 min wait so we ended up at the bar (we got lucky though ; ). I definitely recommend you make a reservation.  But everyone there was enjoying their meals and company from the looks of it. It's a great spot in The Woodlands!
Bridgett M.,"Cleveland, TX",0,4,1,2.0,3/18/2017,Went for the first time on St Pattys Day 2017. Server was great. Waited about 10 mins to be seated for 3. Didn't care for the food and not just because it was over priced. None of us were satisfied with our food. We were very disappointed. Would go back for the cheesecake though. Key Lime Mango!!!! Yummmmmmmmmmmmy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ChelleBelle V.,"Houston, TX",7,58,151,5.0,3/8/2017,"What a great way to start any day with the family.  The menu is slightly overwhelming however EVERYONE can find something they like and even try something new!  Great service, delicious food and overall great experience. A little more attention to refills or requests would be nice. I know it gets busy but its hard to eat without utensils. Another waiter eventually took care of us though and the rest of the meal was great! Always enjoy looking forward for another visit when we are in the area again."
Candayce C.,"Mesquite, TX",11,2,,3.0,10/7/2017,"Might be better because we love it, but don't make me and countless others stand for 30 minutes while you have numerous a tables open.  Per mgt, might overwhelm the kitchen!"
Christina B.,"Huntsville, TX",11,23,45,4.0,9/17/2017,The food is really good here. Everything we have ordered here has turned out to be delicious. My pet peeves would be that the menu is gigantic!! If you are an indecisive person it's going to take you an extremely long time to get through. Also when it's two people they tend to place you on the tiny row of tables. They are close together and you can hear and witness everyone's conversation. Today we had young girls busy taking selfies of themselves. The lighting really sucks as well. During the day not bad. The cheesecake itself is Awesome can't go wrong with whatever flavor you chose.
Bunny G.,"The Woodlands, TX",840,1160,3986,4.0,12/18/2015,My sister was in town and we couldn't decide where to eat. If this is your dilemma then Cheesecake Factory is the answer.  Conveniently located at the mall you can have the excuse that you'll walk off dessert afterwards. The wait on a Friday for lunch was 20 minutes. So if you're a couple go sit at the bar to avoid a long wait.  I'm sure due to the holidays it was extra crowded. A lunch menu is available with items such as soup and salad.  The portions are smaller and the soup is always delicious.   We all opted for soup and or salad or both.  The warm bread basket never disappoints.  The chopped salad was a winner.  Too full for dessert but maybe next time. Service was great.  Now off to do more Xmas shopping!
J K.,"Cypress, TX",0,6,5,1.0,7/28/2017,"All I ask is for clean table, clean silverware and good food. I got none of that. Table had crumbs and rings of water from the last guest. 6 of the spoons and forks at the table had dried food on them, my glass had dried food on it. Food had a hair and was just sloppy and rushed. I guess the late afternoon crowd gets the crappy attention to detail. Server seemed unsurprised at the dirty silverware and made no apologies for it, just slapped down some new forks."
Lisa K.,"The Woodlands, TX",231,965,2392,2.0,2/4/2016,"I used to love coming here for lunch or dinner and made it an annual birthday spot for celebration years ago! It's just another commercialized chain! There's so many places to eat in the Woodlands/Houston area!! We came in for dinner to use a giftcard.  We had their sampler and wasn't impressed. Too fried, making my face super oily. No thanks. I wouldn't get this again....I used to love their southwest eggrolls, but it's too fried! Our waiter raved about the new salmon eggrolls. Not impressed. Can't even taste the salmon!  There's 4 different dips that come with it. The light green sauce is super spicy AFTER you swallow. At first it taste bland... I ordered off the skinnylicious menu for a Caesar salad. It was a HUGE plate! What's skinny about it? It's the dressing. Oh. I was looking for a side salad, thinking that's what ""skinnylicious"" means. You can't come and not get a cheesecake. We ordered the Hershey bar chocolate to go! Still, fresh after an hour!  Service was great! My low rating is the food."
Hannah C.,"Upper Kirby, Houston, TX",501,58,22,3.0,1/4/2017,"Ordered the crunchy chicken lettuce wraps to leave room for our ulterior motive--getting cheesecake. The flavors were good, a light peanut sauce drizzle over the chicken with  fresh vegetables cradled by crisp lettuce. The two sauces it came with were more than enough, though a bit overwhelmingly sweet. However, preparation of this dish was lacking, as I soon realized the tacos were loaded with another secret ingredient--water. As much as I appreciate crisp lettuce, I also appreciate dry arms and sleeves. After learning from the first taco, I made sure to pour out the water before taking a bite with the last two.  Of course, the meal ended on a sweet note when our table shared the vanilla bean and the kahlua cheesecakes--decadent enough to satisfy any craving of rich dense cheesecake for a good stretch of time. The mousse-topped vanilla bean was a good balance to the denser Kahlua slice. At the Cheesecake Factory, sharing is caring when it comes to dessert :]"
Lisa B.,"Peoria, AZ",0,41,1,5.0,8/2/2017,"I know Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant,  but again and again we have consistently good food here. Tonight I ordered a BBQ bacon burger. I never order burgers, but this felt like a burger night! It was delish. Very fresh bread, juicy burger, tangy sauce -- it was excellent.  Sometimes I actually crave their tropical iced tea. It's so refreshing. We shared a slice of Dulce de Leche cheesecake -- it's my husband's favorite. Service was great."
Richard J.,"The Woodlands, TX",60,138,282,5.0,11/8/2016,Stopped by for lunch on a Tuesday. Not crowded and no wait to be seated. John was our waiter and was very attentive while refilling our bread and drinks. The lunch BBQ Chicken Ranch Salad was out of this world. I could eat this salad daily and feel healthy :) This is a very comfortable restaurant with delicious food and great service. I will be back!
Lauren N.,"The Woodlands, TX",13,39,1,4.0,4/19/2017,Went here yesterday with my grandma for lunch. Great salads. It was so nice that it wasn't so busy. Usually at night inside it's super loud so I usually try to get a table outside.
Marie B.,"Spring, TX",0,6,5,5.0,8/12/2017,"Love this place, although I don't come very often because the wait is always long. Avocado egg rolls are awesome and the caramel pecan turtle cheesecake is the best!you've got to try it."
Bethanne A.,"The Woodlands, TX",108,391,279,3.0,4/16/2016,"As large a menu as they have, I can see why the food may have been off tonight.  Really busy.  The Southern Catfish is described as ""lightly battered, fried crisp"".  Well, see picture, of the lightly battered fish, and the one remaining piece.  It was fried crisp allright and was overcooked.  My Endive Salad was good as it always has been.  The Potstickers, see picture, were bitter and overcooked.  I have had them before, many times and they have always been good.  Our Waiter was very busy, but we asked him about the dishes and the manager adjusted the bill. Very nice of him to offer to do that, but it was a bad experience for a birthday dinner, by gift card, from my grandsons.  We will give them another try, but will make sure we ask more questions on the preparation status of what we pick."
Troy M.,"Houston, TX",2,21,12,2.0,10/29/2016,"1st time to eat here (or any Cheesecake Factory). Our waitress was prompt to greet us, but was very quick to say she didn't know why they gave us a kids menu, they are only for 10 and under and that my youngest daughter could not order from it. Pretty bold considering she never asked how old my daughter was (she is 11).  I told her that we have never been prevented from using kids menus in the past and that my daughter doesn't eat large portions and prefers the kids menu choices. The waitress responds ""I don't make the rules"" and tells us the lunch specials are discounted and match the kids menu portion size, but reiterated she cannot have anything from the kids menu.  My daughter is a picky eater and so the only thing she could find she wanted on the adult menu (not offered in a lunch portion) was the eggs/ham/etc plate.   When the food came she had to ask for another bagel as hers was burned. The waitress did acknowledge that by apologizing and saying ""they never should have plated that"". The portions sizes are huge so of course my daughter ate only 20% of it and was full. I had the Louisiana Chicken & Pasta dish and it was absolutely fabulous (5 stars for the food).  When the waitress picked up our plates I pointed out the extreme food waste on my daughter's plate and mentioned again why the kids menu would have been a better choice. She double downed that she didn't make the rules she only follows them.  We had all ordered waters with our meal because we like to eat healthy and avoiding soda is a good way to offset the amount of sugar we were planning to have trying cheesecake slices for desert.  Unfortunately after the tiff over the children's menu I was regretting that we even stayed and ate so I didn't want to pad this waitress's tip anymore than I had to.  She still got close to 18% tip because I understand that may also go to other staff who had nothing to do with this.   I liked the atmosphere & my food was great, but the hard line policy that creates food waste and limited choices for my sweet 11yo presented with a little snarky attitude from our waitress sealed the deal on a lower score and us never returning to Cheesecake Factory.  The girls enjoyed Marble Slab for desert just up the mall.  PS: I'm sure this is completely unrelated but I'll post just in case it happens to anyone else here (which would then be something to investigate) - after I ate here for lunch I was a victim of credit card fraud on the card I used later that evening. It is a Citi card that I had never used online."
Traci M.,"Montgomery, TX",23,6,,5.0,5/10/2017,"We have dined at this location many times. The food has always been excellent. I'd recommend the orange chicken, Thai lettuce wraps, chicken marsala, scampi shrimp pasta, and of course the cheesecake."
Julio A.,"Magnolia, TX",33,21,11,5.0,3/28/2017,"Am not a big fan of big chains restaurants, but I was highly impressed with this place. I stop by recommend it by one my clients. Service was good, location perfect, cleanest was good, food was excellent. I can't wait to comeback an try other items"
Dawn W.,"Humble, TX",0,9,,2.0,4/11/2017,"The draw for this restaurant is definitely the cheesecake, which is awesome.  But when it comes to eating a meal too, consider eating elsewhere.  The prices are way too high considering the portion sizes.  3 of us had dinner there the other night.  3 cheese pasta with chicken, $20....no bread or salad included.  Pit boss sandwich & fries $15.  California cheese steak sandwich & salad $14.  Both sandwiches, when 1st served were pitiful.  Only had a couple slices of meat.  The California cheese steak was literally 1/3 of the size shown in the picture on the online menu. The sandwich too was also served on the same skinny bread that they put on the tables. Both sandwiches went back and the manager had them redone and didn't charge us. The fries were served soggy and had to be redone as well.  The side salad was just mixed greens and 1 tomato wedge. All in all, next time we will only be returning for the cheesecake.  We will be dining elsewhere."
Tuyet L.,"Houston, TX",15,52,64,1.0,9/9/2016,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory ever! I work nearby so stop by often for lunch only because I love the food. We always have to wait over 40 minutes to get a table and even longer to get our food. In my mind I figured, it's really busy so I guess it's acceptable.  Went back again 2 days ago and it was EMPTY. There was probably less than 7 tables in the entire restaurant during lunch hour. Service STILL sucked!! It took 30 minutes to get bread and butter. The server told us it's baking right now but when we got our bread it was stale and cold not even a little bit warm how did it just come out of the oven?? Expect to take 2 hours lunches if you ever plan to come here whether it is busy or slow.  I will never come back to this location ever again. Management really needs to step it up."
Alexandria B.,"Houston, TX",194,50,134,5.0,2/26/2016,"NOBODY ORDER THE RED VELVET CHEESECAKE FROM THIS RESTAURANT!!!!!  I need it all to myself. You can order any other type though, i won't mind. I love coming to this Cheesecake Factory to sit at the bar and eat dinner. There's usually a pretty good crowd and the bartenders are attentive. I've found that on a Saturday night you can expect about a 30 minute wait at this location."
