Shannon B.,"Spring, TX",0,13,,4.0,1/31/2014,Menu is so expansive there has to be something for everyone.  And the cheesecake is amazing.  Get the KOBE burger. Just do it..go.    It is the best burger I have had (outside of real Kobe in Hawaii) and even husband and son(burger gurus) agree it is the best.   Of course there is always a wait if you go at peak times so we avoid those.  My one complaint is they allow pick up phone in orders BUT when they are very busy they will transfer your call to pick up (cheesecake desk) and never ever answer it.  I assume they know pick up is not a priority and I get that.  .  I just wish they would just forego offering pick up rather than be rude to a customer on the phone by refusing to pick up the transfer  Service is usually phenomenal once you are seated.
Laurie S.,"Tomball, TX",268,129,8,3.0,2/16/2011,"I went with a group of about 40 women, all needing separate checks.  Considering that, our service was fairly quick.    If the 40 people factor wasn't involved, I think I would have given few stars. I had the avocado eggrolls, as those are one of my favorite things on the menu.  They were just as good as I had remembered, and was very impressed! It is hard finding much else to say about a chain! :)"
Jenny G.,"Antwerp, OH",0,12,,5.0,12/30/2014,"Visiting from Ohio and this is my first time dining at the Woodlands Cheesecake Factory.  Atmosphere is over the top amazing.  The service was great.  Everything from the bread to the appetizers, to main course was excellent.  Of course the endless choices of cheesecake is breath taking.  A 5 star experience for this restaurant. If you're in the North Houston area, take the time and eat out at the Cheesecake Factory.  You might wait over 30 minutes for a table but much worth it!!:)"
Angie L.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,5.0,10/3/2014,"Great food, decent prices, service wonderful - Jennifer was fabulous!"
Laura B.,"Spring, TX",0,34,,5.0,2/3/2013,The Cheesecake Factory is awesome! The only problem I've ever had is having to wait for a little while but I don't mind. The food is great! I will admit that re menu an be a bit overwhelming but you can always find something you like. The stuffed mushrooms and buffalo blast appetizers are to die for! I love this place.
Robyn H.,"Houston, TX",4,80,35,3.0,12/19/2012,"I've visited Cheesecake Factory in many different locations in many different parts of the country and I'd say that this location was not bad, but also not the best location that I've been to. It might just come down to the fact that it was really loud. I know that Cheesecakes are usually on the loud side, but this restaurant was especially bad. Seemed like everyone was having a birthday and getting sung to for it. This was actually my birthday too but the dh was told in no uncertain terms that he would find himself walking home if he even thought about it. ;) Anyways, the service was good. We only had to wait 10 minutes and there were open seats at the bar. Although I felt for the bartender because it was just her for the entire (and packed) restaurant. CF for pete's sake, get 2 people behind the bar! Our server was friendly, possibly too friendly and too in the weeds because he talked so fast that it was hard to keep up. He really seemed to enjoy his job though so I can't fault him for enthusiasm. He got our orders perfect as well. Everything was very efficient. Now for the food: that's why you go there right? Anyways, so I've been craving french fries and saw them on someone else's table so I got them as an appetizer ... very unoriginal I know, so sue me! They were seriously the best fries I've had in a long time and they came in what seemed like a never-ending bowl! They were served hot ... excellent! They were nice and crispy but not overcooked. No soggy fries here. And they were lightly salted. Let's just say that I filled up on fries so that by the time the food arrived I was already full! Oops! Good thing they make to-go boxes. For the main course I had the Romano chicken with pasta. I have to say that I've had better versions of this. There was waaaay too much sauce and the chicken was not well presented. When I had it for lunch the next day ... yes I did ... there were pieces of bacon on the underside of the chicken. It's a good thing that I'm not against eating pork. They should really clean the pans before cooking each food item. The dh had a pork chops and he said that they were okay. Not bad but not great. I tried something different for desert and got the cheesecake with strawberries. I didn't realize that the strawberries would be the glazed kind, so they were too artificial tasting for my preference. I'll stick to plain from now on. All in all, it was a good experience even though the food was only so-so. Then again those fries ... I'll be back for them!!"
Carmen M.,"Houston, TX",58,175,25,3.0,1/1/2010,"Pappasito's Cantina may be my first choice for chain restaurants in Houston, but The Cheesecake Factory runs a very close second.  We went for lunch the day after Christmas (or Boxing Day for my Canadian friends) and ended up waiting 45 minutes for a table at 2pm, but it was worth the wait. Baja Chicken Enchiladas that were to die for, giant glasses of sweet tea (which takes me to my very happy place) and for the finale, Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake. O.M.G. I don't even like cheesecake, but I could eat this every single day if I didn't have to worry about my girlish figure. It is seriously divine. The service was excellent. The portions are for, like, a family of three, and the quality is always good."
Keef J.,"Spring, TX",0,9,15,4.0,2/21/2013,"I have been here several times and the experience is always pretty good.  The wait staff seems to have their jobs down to a science.  The food is always top-notch, but a little on the pricey side."
Wesley S.,"Conroe, TX",9,13,,5.0,10/11/2014,"Excellent service, amazing food (had the spicy chipotle pasta) and of course, the pumpkin cheesecake is to die for! I even ordered a full cake for the family. Would definitely recommend this restaurant."
Ryan V.,"Spring, TX",11,234,3,2.0,7/23/2010,"The Restaurant: Nice enough, decent atmosphere.  Loud.  Unnattentive, way to many things on the menu.  I've been a few times over the years, but it just doesn't ever beckon me back, I've only ever gone on the bequest of friends really... The most recent experience: I ordered pasta, no chicken in it.  They gave it to me with chicken in it, and then tried to charge me for it. Server also seemed to take extra long because I wanted the receipt fixed.  Humph.  I tipped well because I didn't want to seem an ass. But in general the service here has never been great for me.  Food is ok, poor value in my book. I don't anticipate being back soon.  I've already declined to join friends there on multiple occasions since CF's last stupid issue. If my order was wrong, do not stand there and argue with me about it when my fellow dining compatriot confirms that I said what I said.  Sheesh. Will not go again without seriously good friend related reason."
Natasha S.,"Pinehurst, TX",1,13,3,2.0,3/18/2012,"WhEn they first opened they were good, and now I am not impressed at all. I had the lemon salmon with capers and it was plain didn't taste lemon at all not good!!!"
Henry D.,"Richmond, TX",7,59,88,2.0,8/7/2012,"Food is good.  My low marks are because the service leaves much to be desired.  I stopped going to the Sugar Land location 6 years ago after several lengthy waits for service.  On my last visit I vowed never to go back, and haven't.  We waited for 13 minutes at this location before we were even acknowledged. My wife had already gotten up to talk to the manager when the server asked me for our drink order.  I will say that once we got his attention, our server did an excellent job.  It is a shame that we got off to such a bad start, because I don't believe I will repeat this location either."
Deanna C.,"Spring, TX",1,15,,5.0,5/21/2013,"We eat here at least 2-3x a week. It's nice to walk there from our apt, have a drink and eat at the bar. The bartenders are our favorite servers. Never had an upset stomach from their food in over 2 years of eating there. The kitchen is run expertly! Try the stuffed chicken tortillas, Louisiana chicken pasta, fried zucchini, and oreo cheesecake! YUM!"
Gabriel G.,"Houston, TX",23,19,21,3.0,8/20/2012,This is a great place to meet large groups since there is something for everyone on their menu.
Pete B.,"Pearland, TX",0,124,2,4.0,8/9/2014,"We dined at the bar, and our food and beverages were great! Bartenders/Servers were top notch too! Just a great afternoon !!!"
Midnite G.,"Buena Park, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/17/2014,"We had our lunch last Sunday and found out all the utensils on our table are dirty.  My Son-in-Law talked to the Manager and showed him how dirty the utensils are,  Our server was so sorry and replaced everything but to our surprised there is one spoon that we saw a food mark."
Chris R.,"Conroe, TX",0,5,,2.0,1/17/2013,My daughter wanted to celebrate her birthday here. Food was good but waiter was terrible.  Turned what should have been a fun night into a frustrating one.  The waiter who brought out our food was great.  Wish he could have been our waiter all night!
Richard A.,"Austin, TX",224,210,489,5.0,12/1/2009,"Indeed this is one of my favortie restaurants. I celebrated my 60th birthday there with friends at The Woodlands location and had my favorites, Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon with the house white wine and then the Godiva Cheesecake along with a double espresso and a shot of Drambuie. FABULOUS!!!!!"
Ana L.,"Houston, TX",148,127,22,4.0,1/1/2014,"I love cheesecake factory. Went here for my 2nd wedding anniversary and it everything was pretty good. I asked for a special cocktail made for me (Blueberry lemon drop, my fav), and they actually made it really good here! Our server was awesome, even though she lacked the enthusiasm, she still got the job done! We shared the steak diane and salmon. It came out pretty good, but it seems that we can never find a place that can make the steak at the temperature that we ask for. It always comes out one degree higher. (We asked for medium rare, it came out medium). We also had the ahi capracio (pardon my spelling), and it was delicious! The only thing was that, it was definitely not fresh! Tuna is supposed to be red when raw but this was dark brown! The lights were dimmed down so you didn't have to think about what you were eating, just taste it! The brown bread is awesome too! I wanted to get dessert, but we were too full."
Dan D.,"Spring, TX",23,21,8,3.0,5/26/2012,The Cheesecake Factory at the Galleria is definitely better than this location. I've been here twice. The first time it wasn't as packed and service was pretty good. The Chicken costoletta was great. I ordered a carrot cake to go and it was not fresh. Second time we ate here service was slow. I much prefer the layout of the Galleria location since tables are more private instead of being in one huge square room.
