Ashley M.,"Huntsville, TX",3,61,15,5.0,3/23/2016,"I hadn't been in a long time but it's still just as good as I remember. The bread was fresh, our mozzarella bites were delicious. I ordered the fried shrimp and Mac n cheese it was soooo good the Mac n cheese is def worth trying at least once. I got some red velvet cheesecake to go it was good but next time I'll prob go with strawberry. Overall great experience and service."
Gabrielle C.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,29,3,1.0,10/17/2016,"Ew. Recently moved to the area with my family and was happy to visit a Cheesecake Factory. Back home (NorCal) we'd frequent two different CF's both had good service and were very clean. This (in the woodlands) Cheesecake Factory was so nasty I had second thoughts on staying and eating. Either Texas standards are lower (in this case MUCH lower) than California's when it cleanliness and sanitation OR the general manager is lazy. The floors were smeared SO thick of grease and stick that it was evident they hadn't had a proper clean (and I don't mean mopped with greasy mop and blank water) in a long time. The display for the cakes was full of fingerprints not just on the outside but on the inside of the glass  so gross. The bathrooms. Ew ew. Same disgusting floor situation- used toilet paper on ground, the trash can in the handicap was a broken rusty larger can that was overflowing. The gunk build  up at the sink can only happen if it's not cleaned often and by often I mean at least once a week. So not only was it gross but we waited 40 mins for soup, salad and three kids pizzas. Seriously. There was no wait to be seated cause one was there. No wonder. So sad our go-to place is no longer an option now that we're living here."

Lynn T.,"Spring, TX",0,19,,1.0,12/7/2015,The food is like most chain restaurants like Chilis or Brio - nothing special. They also were not dog friendly for the patio even though my dogs are better behaved than children and have been accepted at every restaurant in Vintage Park and The Woodlands Waterway both have such high quality food in comparison as well!
Gwen W.,"Columbus, OH",381,1097,2553,4.0,12/28/2013,"I've been craving some good cheesecake for a while now, so I thought hey why not splurge while on vacation! I ordered the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes and Tiramisu Cheesecake! Plans changed, so I was forces to take the food to-go. What'd I get? Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. Three decent-sized corn pancakes topped with a very yummy southwestern sauce, chopped tomato, avocado, and onion. The contrast of the sauce to the sweet corn taste was very tasty! I also decided to indulge in a slice of Tiramisu cheesecake - I personal favorite of mine. Oh, and yes, I also give the dessert two thumbs up ;)"
MellyJim H.,"The Woodlands, TX",1,154,108,5.0,1/14/2015,We had another great dinner here with two extra dirty martinis.  The service was right on also.   My only tip would be that next time I will make sure not be seated at one of the two person little tables.  They are all in a row so close to each other that you can clearly hear the conversations at the tables on either side of you.  This makes it hard to hear the person you are with.  Next time I will make sure to get a booth or table with a little more space around it.
Robin H.,"Waller, TX",2,35,14,1.0,3/1/2016,Horrible!!! Service sucked... im still starving and food was terrible. What has happened to this place??? Uhhh never again
Darris J.,"Humble, TX",16,332,14,4.0,2/18/2015,"Outside of the hostess being rude, the experience was good. Not great or excellent but good.  Service wasn't the best, and the expedition from the kitchen was off. We had a party of 5, 3 ordered pizza and salad lunch.  The two others salad only as the entree.  Everyone at the table ordered the same salad.  Yet, the side salads with the pizza came out 15 minutes before the entree salads did. I mean it's the same friggin salad, you mean 50% more salad takes 15 minutes to prepare?"
Claire M.,"Spring, TX",39,1,,1.0,4/30/2016,"Terrible, no reservations on the weekend, can't sit in the bar area while you wait. Food mediocre at best. Won't be back."
Alvin C.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,1.0,4/2/2016,By far the worst service I've ever had here. It took 10 mins for a waiter to come to our table they acted like they didn't want to serve us. Food wasn't as great as my last visit. The Cheesecake Factory have really lost touch in the kitchen. Poor.
John D.,"Lubbock, TX",5,240,117,5.0,8/24/2013,"I hate giving a place like The Cheesecake Factory 5 stars but it without a doubt, honestly deserves it. The hostesses, the wait staff, the service, the decorations, the food and the cheesecake were all absolutely perfect and I couldn't of asked for more. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it, and I left with it being my favorite restaurant, hands down forever. The Chicken Bellagio was to die for and my Kahlua Chocolate Cheesecake was scrumtrulescent to the max. Combine that with the service and the environment with the reasonable pricing and The Cheesecake Factory is amazing. Again, I hate I love it so much, but all I want is more."
Kevin V.,"Spring, TX",45,134,257,2.0,1/25/2015,Food is bland and the service is mediocre at best or even below average. Only plus side to eating at the cheesecake factory is the cheesecake which you can make at home.
Josh S.,"Conroe, TX",78,8,1,5.0,3/22/2016,"A few days ago my friends and I came here to eat dinner. It nice to have the waitress that we did! Her name is Gina m. She was relaxed, cool and very understanding of our orders. She was just an all around easy going and nice person to be around. I've been here a lot to eat and the service was amazing but this time it seemed the best by far. It's because of people like her that give restaurants good reviews. I definitely recommend eating here because the whole staff is amazing and I have no doubt that whoever you get won't let you down."
Dan F.,"Spring, TX",147,385,417,5.0,6/26/2013,"I straight up love it here.  The service is very good, the food is decadent, and the cheesecake is divine.  Let's skip right to the divine stuff:  my daughter and I always get the Godiva cheesecake and she is a fast eater, so it is sometimes a race to get any.  I am adaptable, so I have found my own favorite, fresh banana cream with chocolate sauce (this is an extra cost but soooo worth it)."
Evan W.,"Ada, OK",23,5,,5.0,6/12/2015,"Had an early birthday dinner here last night and it was top notch. The fried mac & cheese was surprisingly awesome and my burger came out perfectly cooked to a beautiful medium rare. But let's talk about cheesecake... Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake is the best I've ever had. If you're a fan of German chocolate, do yourself a favor and give it a try. You won't be disappointed! As busy as it was, there was almost no wait time whatsoever and the staff were very attentive and friendly. I wish I'd gotten our waitresses name so I could give her a shoutout, because she did a great job of taking care of our party. And a big thanks to everyone else that came out and sang happy birthday to me! Yall are great! Truthfully, I can't think of a single negative thing to say about our visit. It was the epitome of a perfect dining experience and worthy of every one of those 5 stars."
Kathleen M.,"Spring, TX",7,19,54,3.0,2/1/2015,"The food here is good depending on what you order but I don't come here often but what was pre-ordered for me was the spaghetti and the chicken Alfredo, it wasn't as good as I would expect it. Spaghetti was a good 5 out of 10 but I would have to rate the chicken Alfredo 3 out of 10, the pasta didn't have as much flavor, I had to add salt and pepper to get some satisfaction out of it. The drinks and the cheesecakes are actually better than the meals! But if I were to return to The Cheesecake Factory I would just stick with a drink and dessert."
Carol C.,"The Woodlands, TX",152,432,4582,4.0,1/13/2011,"Avocado eggroll appetizer is one of my favorite.  Made a nice lunch entree.  My passion fruit tea was weak.  Wish they had the mango version(was stronger/better tasting with unique appetizers and entrees).  Service was better than the normal mediocre.  Our waiter honestly admitted to no substitutions for my friend but she was accommodated nicely.  Yes, many entrees have the crave factor Yes, please excite your waitstaff so they don't flatline from blahness."
Krystal P.,"Houston, TX",112,72,19,5.0,12/15/2015,Went this past Saturday to enjoy a nice dinner with my boyfriend and not to mention it was his first time to The Cheesecake Factory and we both enjoyed our meals. He had the Hibachi Steak which was very delicious and conveniently cut up (no A1 sauce needed). I had the Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon also very tasty. The salmon was cooked just right and seasoned proportionally. The mash potatoes were on point. We both ordered martinis he had the apple caramel and I had the strawberry. They were strong but went down smooth with our meals. Lastly the waiter recommend the Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel cheesecake which was to die for! We will definitely be returning in the near future.
Alexander H.,"Spring, TX",9,101,567,4.0,12/9/2014,really had a great time at this place.   Our waitress was super nice.   I had Southern Fried Cat fish and it was excellent.
Gerry N.,"Spring, TX",13,40,14,4.0,8/23/2014,"Talk about a generous portion, this place will give you more than you can handle. Starting with the bread, it's plentiful. Crabcakes for appetizers is more than an appetizer by itself. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio and sure enough, I had to take half of it to go. Rich in flavor and cooked to perfection. Now, the dessert -- you really have to try their dessert, it's the best part of the meal here. Not sure which cheesecake is better but you just have to try them all to find out. Right now, I'll take either the red velvet or raspberry cheesecake!"
