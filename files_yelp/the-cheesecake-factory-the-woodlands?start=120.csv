Rachel E.,"Manvel, TX",0,11,4,1.0,2/14/2016,"After hearing about the great desserts here we decided to try it out. It was a twenty minute seating wait which was great being it's Valentines day. We ask to be seated outside because the inside was loud, hot and packed with people needless to say being on the patio was like walking into hell without ice water AHH. Apparently they have these heaters overhead which could have been nice just to take the chill out but no this was instant I just finish working out and just stepped into the dry sauna to relax (this was not relaxing). So after sitting down for twenty minutes literally sweating we decided to leave without ever being acknowledge ooh wait here comes the waiter.. Boy thanks sir for finally coming over but we are leaving now"
Robert H.,"Tomball, TX",0,31,4,3.0,1/8/2016,"Went in for a good meal, the cook or chef must have been having a terrible night.  Appetizer of dumplings were overcooked and extremely salty.  My simple pizza was simply tasteless and way undercooked.  Not happy and not impressed.  Hopefully next time will be better..."
Amanda C.,"Conroe, TX",12,17,5,4.0,1/3/2015,We went at about 2 on a Saturday and only waited about 20 minutes. My husband had the Renee's Special with turkey sandwich and Caesar salad. I ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps and we finished with Tiramisu and the Toasted Marshmallow smores galore. Everything was amazing! My husband did get the wrong salad ag first and they brought out the Tiramisu cheesecake but both mistakes were remedied quickly. We will definitely be back.
Livia T.,"Houston, TX",25,20,71,2.0,10/16/2014,"Food here are delicious as always, I never walk out without a slice of red velvet cake, that's my favorite. Service was inefficient and unorganized at this location. They are very slow..."
Heather F.,"Houston, TX",32,158,11,3.0,10/14/2014,"Summary: Skip the food, go for the cheesecake!  With such a large menu and different types of cheesecakes everyone is surely to find something they will like. With so much variety you also get a variety in the prices. This is not a cheap place. Most entrees were over 12 dollars, but I did notice most meals were very large and people took leftovers. The service was okay. I think we got a new guy who wasn't very familiar with the menu or the prices. The food was average. Everyone seemed happy with their meal. I probably wont go back for a meal just because the food wasn't anything special. With so much variety it is hard to perfect a type. What they have perfected is the dessert!! I would go back for a piece of cheesecake . They had so many types and the classic we had was very good and very large."
Brent C.,"Houston, TX",26,9,,1.0,11/21/2015,530 on a Saturday. Somewhat busy. Wife ordered chicken Diane salad-hold the nuts and I ordered bistro shrimp pasta.  My wife received salad with extra nuts and no chicken and I had a total of 4 shrimp. On the plate. Not quite the $40 meal we were expecting. Did not even order a cheesecake. That would probably come out awful also. Never again
James F.,"Houston, TX",210,35,25,3.0,5/12/2015,"Meet business associates and friends here. The waiter seemed extremely busy. Ordered a simple burger, as well as my buddy too. Our burgers had blood leaking from them. Although they were steak beef, still tough to get down. Told my waiter and he seemed to just apologize and nothing else. Finally after speaking with manager we thought we would get a new burger, we were not expecting our money back. However, instead of a new burger, he took both our burgers, that had a bite out of them and we're now sitting on the table for 20 mins (our waiter was busy) and put the, back on the grill. I was ok with this until I saw that the burger was now burnt on the outside and and still under cooked in the middle. Frustrating, but not a bad eat. No health concerns and great deserts. Just avoid during certain hours. Will go back, but won't host a business meeting here again."
Annette F.,"Spring, TX",14,33,24,3.0,8/9/2015,Not really coming back simply because I can get the same food elsewhere with a better dining experience and less expensive. Meh...
Jennifer G.,"Houston, TX",39,7,5,1.0,8/8/2015,"Lol Thank you for reminding me why I do not go to chain restaurants. Service was terrible with a capital T. We literally had to ask for EVERYTHING multiple times, the fries that came with my sandwich did not come until everyone was finished eating, my friend got a salad with no dressing which took forever to come, and although my sister enjoyed her salmon, she did not receive the salt and pepper she had asked for until just before she was taking her last bites. We didn't even get bread until we pestered the waiter several times, and when our meals finally came, a grumpy busser lady quickly snatched our bread away (??) I guess we were finished? Overall just no. Never again."
Clint B.,"Conroe, TX",156,21,4,5.0,7/25/2014,"It goes without saying that the dessert menu is incredible! I recently took my daughter and her friend here and we thought we order a reasonable amount of food for one meal. Turned out we all had to take food home with us... plus we absolutely HAD TO order dessert. We could only manage a couple of bits of dessert since we were soo full. The OREO Cheese cake and Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake was off the charts outstanding! Definitely going back, but going back very hungry!"
Anna B.,"Spring, TX",53,8,,1.0,8/20/2015,"Horrible service at this location. Took forever to get bread (which felt like rocks), drinks and our food. Had it been busy, I would understand, but it wasn't so there's really no excuse. Won't be back."
Elad T.,"Spring, TX",15,16,24,5.0,11/15/2015,Me and my wife we going there for at least once a month we tried many variety of food over there and everything came out beautiful and delicious if somebody like steak I really recommend Steak Diane if somebody like chicken they have an amazing orange chicken in for an appetizer everyone to try the avocado eggrolls DeSilva always know the menu by heart so when you ask him a question he did give you an answer right away
tania m.,"Houston, TX",36,20,14,2.0,7/2/2015,"I had been here multiple times for several years. The food is always good and so is the service. The low rating is due to the amount of gnats! We sat inside, no where near a door and the gnats where everywhere. It made the meal suck! Having to swatt them away every 5mins. Sad!"
Amber C.,"Spring, TX",14,24,,2.0,1/20/2015,"After my disappointing experience at lunch today I feel as I need to review this restaurant. Normally I would give this restaurant at least 3 1/2 stars. The food is usually fairly good - not excellent - but good and the service is usually fairly okay as well. Enough that I return from time to time to enjoy the skinny chicken enchiladas which prior to today have always come out hot and delicious. HOWEVER, it may be a long while before I return to this location. Today, we were attended to by a server with zero energy or personality. No smile - just rote, monotone service. Okay, whatever, I don't need to be entertained anyway but it is nice to have a pleasant server. The disappointing part was that while my husbands shepherds pie came out piping hot and tasted delicious (to be fair), my skinny chicken enchiladas were barely lukewarm. We brought it to the attention of the server who took it back to the kitchen to take care of it. The manager shortly came out and stated that they were remaking them right away. Great - I'm hungry. Anyway, I had the pleasure of watching my husband enjoy his entire portion of shepherds pie before my food returned. It was very hot and good but by then I was pretty full of bread and veggies so only was able to really eat a little of the enchiladas. When the manager followed up to ask how it was my husband reminded him that although it was much better, it still came out very late. The manager simply apologized again lol. He offered no discount - nothing- not even a free dessert or something. Most restaurants won't even make you pay for the meal in a case like this. I hope they weren't waiting for me to ask for them to take it off because if I have to ask, then this is not a restaurant I will continue to waste my money and time with. Next time I will vote with my wallet and choose a different location to eat."
Linda N.,"Houston, TX",1,16,5,5.0,9/19/2015,"Stopped in for lunch on a Friday at 11 am and was quickly greeted and seated. Hostess & ""seater"" were engaging and upbeat.  Our waitress was Diane and she was spectacular.  We would wholeheartedly recommend her.  Our meals were served promptly and they were delicious.  We had the fish & chips and the skinnylicious turkey & avocado sandwhich/salad combo.  We've eaten at this location many times before but were uncertain what we would encounter after seeing the most recent posted reviews.  There was absolutely no reason for us to have been concerned.  We will be back!"
Kera G.,"Shenandoah, TX",145,137,111,3.0,3/15/2014,"Always good. Favorites: Chicken Pot Stickers, grilled shrimp and bacon club and the red raspberry martini. We sat outside yesterday and the employees kept moving around the tables which made a screeching noise . . . It was very annoying to the customers. Helpful tip: Pick up the table with the assistance of a co-worker."
Angela V.,"Spring, TX",45,1,,5.0,5/15/2016,We enjoyed our experience and Sonya is a very sweet manager that took care of us with excellent treatment!
Spencer C.,"Huntsville, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/5/2014,"It's one thing to not take reservations for 20 people on a certain day, it's one thing to wait 2 hours for this table, and it's one thing to not kick a group out from this table even after they paid out over half an hour ago, but to have both your host and server be rude to multiple members in our group when we ask for updates is beyond acceptable."
Steven H.,"Cypress, TX",9,4,,1.0,5/11/2016,"Went for Mother's Day, and the service was not good.  I ordered steak Diane cooked medium with shrimp scampi. The food came to the table, (3 shrimp on the plate), mashed potatoes, with well done steak, so I sent it back after eating the shrimp, scampi sauce was good.  20 minutes later a waitress brings a small plate with just steak medallions on it, and asked me if i wanted the potatoes? I cut into the steak and it was again well done, someone else brought out a plate of mashed potatoes shortly after and i asked them just to take my meal off my ticket, they obviously can't cook steak. I could not find my waiter for 20 minutes during all this also. We finally got the check and someone brings out a whole new dish plate with everything on it! Why didn't you bring it out 30 minutes ago when there was an issue in the first place, it must have been sitting in the kitchen this whole time or something, I don't know what was going on.  And please take the Cajun out of the Shrimp and Chicken gumbo on the menu, "" Cajun style broth with cream, cream?  This is not gumbo, it is not made with tomatoes, and it is usually chicken and sausage OR seafood but usually never together, nothing Cajun about it.  Thank you, Steven C. Henry"
Anita G.,"San Diego, CA",261,123,1002,4.0,12/1/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is my guilty pleasure when it comes to chain restaurants...I generally avoid chain restaurants and try to pick local places...but man do I love the Cheesecake Factory.  It's surprising too...because their menu is ginormous...so you would think for a place with such a large menu...they would have a lot of dishes...but nothing so great.  Incorrect.  Despite having an overwhelmingly large menu, I have yet to have a dish there that I hated...and most I love...specifically the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  I crave those suckers...and keep going back for more.  The other diner with me at the Cashew Chicken...which I think was a little on the salty side...but it wasn't bad...just not the most authentic Thai Cashew Chicken I've ever had.  Service was meh...mostly because I think the waitress was kind of an airhead...but everything came out quickly with no issues...so I really don't have any major complaints there.  It is large...and loud...so not the most romantic place...but good for groups...and I will be back."
