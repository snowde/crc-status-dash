Stephanie A.,"Humble, TX",11,18,12,2.0,8/21/2015,"Last night (8/20/2015) I went here with my mom and we had a waitress named Laura. She was a nice girl, but the service was not great. At first we got the pizza and it had a really bad taste to it so we asked for a burger instead and it took her almost 40 minutes to get us it. We proceeded to just have it boxed up because we were sitting there for almost an hour without eating dinner.  I'm really surprised a manager never got involved with the situation. Plus she kept disappearing for a long time that it was hard to get a hold of her. This is the last time I'm visiting cheese cake factory. I've never had a great experience here and the price is ridiculous for the quality of the food. I'd rather people eat at Pf Chang next door than here."
Linda T.,"Houston, TX",445,537,423,4.0,6/20/2013,"What I love about cheesecake factory is it is def. family friendly, good service, a huge menu  to satisfy any craving you have, from American to Asian to Mexican. Portions are large here! I love all the salads they offer from their small plate items, and wow the Vietnamese tacos there are the bomb!  My two all time favorite dishes there, Jamaican black pepper shrimp served with black beans plantains, white rice AND the hibachi steak, cooked to perfection served with shitake mushrooms, onions, two fried asparagus & wasabi mash potatoes. Woowee, talk about mouth watering. The shrimp is loaded yummy carribean flavors and the steak is tender, succulent and has a touch of terriyaki sweetness to it.  If you're having trouble deciding where to eat, this is the place to go and will be sure to make everyone happy. Be prepared to wait if you go during peak hours, i.e. lunch, dinner, weekends. :)"
Jamie M.,"Spring, TX",333,329,450,2.0,6/18/2013,"Draft Beers - $4.75  Fried Zucchini - $4.95 Lightly Breaded and Topped with Parmesan Cheese. Served with Ranch Dressing Roadside Sliders - $9.95 Bite-Sized Burgers on Mini-Buns Served with Grilled Onions, Pickles and Ketchup Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake - $7.50 Banana Cream Cheesecake Topped with Bavarian Cream and Fresh Sliced Bananas Going on Father's Day, yes I know gluten for punishment; we opted to sit at the bar, which at first proved to be a task, since families with their children were still attempting to utilize the bar as though their mini people were not there.  After finally getting around the little people obstacles, we arrived at our bar seats, to sit for a bit and watch the chaos that was the bar staff. They seemed a bit disorganized, and after a few minutes or slightly more acknowledged us and put down place setting, which to be honest a cloth napkin placed down on the bar top as a placemat seems rather insulting, just let me eat at the bar top and you can wipe it down after I'm done or better yet you should be any ways and not rely on the ""placemat"" to do the job for you. Mine was already nicely strawberry stained, really nothing that mattered too much to me.  We placed out orders in, I'd really only wanted to come here for dessert but after browsing the menu found I wanted a few light bites. The Zucchini and Sliders were the perfect amount of food to be split between me and my company. The chopped zucchini pieces were great not overly breaded. The sliders were a bit greasy, and the meat was charred to burnt around the edges, there was close to no grilled onions on them, though a note you could add cheese to them if you liked.  After the light bit of munchies, I finally awaited to place my order for my main reason, dessert. I think I went through about 2.5 glasses of water until finally someone asked me if there was something else I wanted. I kick myself because I could easily make a whole FRESH cheesecake of my own taste and liking from scratch at home for about what they charge for a slice, but eh everyone is entitled to be lazy. My dessert finally came, being sick I tasted nothing, Oii, and yet I so wanted nothing more than dessert, though my other half said it was good, his taste buds are questionable, haha!  The bartender had went on a banter when I got there about the amount of tipping was conducive to the quality of service, needless to say one I don't think you need to say that out loud and two don't provide less than stellar serive to the next patrons based on what your last guests tipped, just saying! Another mental note we were offered their complimentary bread.... I'm still waiting!"
Christina N.,"Houston, TX",633,490,1260,4.0,9/13/2013,"That sausage and ricotta flat bread was delicious!! I would go back for that again. It's been years since I""ve back to a Cheesecake Factory. I think I had a bad experience with the location by the Galleria - Houston but I recently visited the Woodlands location and it blew my mind. Everything was so clean and polished. The menu was more appealing to me and the service was on point. Excellent choice for a lunch meet up or dinner with friends/family."
Matthew R.,"Spring, TX",73,15,76,5.0,6/19/2015,"The crusted chicken was so yummy, and even though I was stuffed, I couldn't leave with out a strawberry cheesecake to go!  I recommend this location, and it's conveniently located next door to the Woodlands mall.  Unless you are using the valet service, the parking is the only negative..."
Maurice S.,"Lake Forest, IL",0,6,1,3.0,1/1/2016,"What's your first impression based on when you walk into a restaurant?  The hostess, right?  One word:  terminate.  I would fire that sour-puss so fast it would make your head spin.  But, let's face it, who hasn't eaten at Cheesecake at least once?  You know the food won't disappoint  so who cares about the miserable thing at the hostess stand.  What was kind of a bummer, however, was it seems the miserable, crap attitude was contagious as we sat in the bar area and god forbid ANYONE crack a smile let alone offer any type of service.  The food was great as were the drinks but I sure wouldn't schedule anyone to work on New Year's Day if they didn't want to be there - which had to have been the case because just about every employee looked like they wanted to be anywhere else but at work today."
Angelique H.,"Humble, TX",3,170,15,2.0,3/1/2015,"I normally enjoy coming here, but my last visit was crap. Arrived around 9:30 on a Saturday.  Told there would be a 30 minute wait. Almost 50 minutes go by, and someone finally calls out to what we were waiting for. Handed over the waiting buzzer, and was told it wasn't working.  After being sat down, our drinks were ordered, and we wanted to see if the waiter was even going to bring our bread. Gave our order for the food, and he still didn't bring it. Finally decided to tell him, only to have brought to us 5 minutes before our food came. All the waiting was what killed the visit for me. Not only that, you get a watered down alcohol drink if you don't ask for light ice. Waste of money on the alcohol portion. Other than that, food was okay."
Rosie V.,"Lubbock, TX",1,24,1,3.0,6/24/2015,"Place is decent. Been a handful of times, the recommended best chicken of the restaurant is not all that great, (chicken Madeira) but the hibachi steak was great. The stuffed mushrooms are also a plus. Service is average. Strawberry lemonade is good! Place is too loud for my liking, overall it's good for about 2x/yr"
Harrison L.,"Caldwell, TX",5,115,121,2.0,1/25/2015,Location is nice but is always very crowded. Took 25 minutes to get seated and the floor next to our table had a lot of nasty food smashed on to it. Unsettling to look at skid marks of food while trying to eat food. My beer was flat and my girlfriend did not like her wine. The Shepard pie is not really Shepards pie; the pie there has ground beef instead of lamb. The ground beef was really greasy. Waitress took forever with drinks and my salad. Meal for two with two drinks was $70! Pretty pricey for below average food and really slow service.
Vicki K.,"Cumming, GA",43,8,3,1.0,8/10/2014,Awful doesn't even rate this place! Paid $60 for dinner and felt like I was eating in the food court at the mall. Food was mediocre. The white chocolate macadamia Carmel cheesecake had soggy nuts. Extremely disappointed.
Sandra M.,"The Woodlands, TX",9,49,1,1.0,8/25/2014,Very bad experience this past Saturday night for a party of 12.    A parade of folks  brought out are food after a long long long  wait with 1 order wrong and missing 2 others.    Original waitress never came back to check on us so after flagging others including 2 managers (1 with a condescending attitude)   are 2 guest in our party  finally got there meal but only after everyone else was finished!  After taking the manager off to the side for a private conversation he compensated the missing meals gave us free cheesecake and a NEW waiter who knew what he was doing!   That was nice and all but I would rather have had a good experience and pay for my meal!!!   Also this is the second time to happen  with this location getting are food wrong.   Plus let me warn you my meal was Factory Burger which was  missing ingredients  and bread was hard as a rock and   others said there meals were not good either  including pasta dishes being under-cooked..   Not worth the money not worth the stress!!!

Ashley S.,"Spring, TX",27,15,,1.0,3/25/2016,"Took my son there for dinner last night. Absolute worst costumer service I have ever seen. We saw our waiter a total of 3 times UNTIL we got our check. Of course once he saw my card and check was ready he came. It's been a long time since I've been there but I won't be returning back anytime soon. Our food was cold, service was horrible and the cheesecake was so cold it was hard."
Cory S.,"Indianapolis, IN",89,501,18,3.0,10/24/2011,"Seen 1, seen them all.  Great cheesecake, good food with HUGE portions and wonderful bread.  The rest bowls down to service which is hit or miss at any place.  I'm sure the people make good money, but sometimes they are miserable.   This particular location does seem a little smaller than some others that I've seen.   They would get 4 stars, however we catered in lunch for the team and the service was not good.  They said the food would be ready at 12.15.. We arrived on time but didn't get out of the restaurant until 12.45.  The food was good, but not timely."
Brandon A.,"Conroe, TX",114,23,19,4.0,1/25/2013,"OK this Cheesecake Factory is like a well oiled machine when it comes to service. I've been here a dozen times or so and not once have I gotten poor service.  My food was on point I had the Jamaican blacken shrimp dish witch I thought would've been a bit more spicy; but hey everyone wasn't raised on whole milk cayenne pepper like myself. Over all a nice meal, good service and jovial atmosphere makes for a good time."
Karen R.,"Spring, TX",5,6,,2.0,4/30/2015,Went to Cheesecake Factory to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary hostess was rude waitress was unattentive husband's order was incorrect and what i ordered off skinny menu was nothing more than a  deli sandwich and cold. ..really Cheesecake Factory?  I am disappointed.
Scott Y.,"Austin, TX",104,221,546,4.0,11/21/2014,This location in the woodlands has great service in addition to their good food!  I highly recommend it
Stacey O.,"Houston, TX",2,12,4,1.0,9/24/2014,"I normally love Cheesecake Factory, but this location really failed me. The free bread they give you when you arrive came out cold, the Caramel Macchiato I ordered was also cold, and the Miso Salmon my husband ordered had no flavor and almost no Miso sauce.  The calamari we ordered as an appetizer was also devoid of taste. We should have known something was off when we saw that the restaurant was half-empty... I have never been to a Cheescake Factory that wasn't full to the brim with people. In fact, the last one I went to had a 1 hour wait time... Anyway,  lesson learned. We'll continue to eat at Cheesecake Factory,  but we won't be back to this location."
Emilye S.,"Beaumont, TX",2,12,21,4.0,2/26/2014,This is a beautiful and inviting place to eat. The food and service were great and staff were friendly. I was surprised at the variety of choices on the menu. There's a little something for everyone...and who doesn't like cheesecake? This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory but it won't be my last!
Luke E.,"Spring, TX",1,19,5,5.0,2/8/2015,Craig is the manager at the woodlands Cheesecake Factory his staff in to go always makes it a quick easy experience with no up selling except the Chesecake! I have been coming here for years and still can't believe how great the food is every time we go. My daughter was 6 when we started coming here now she is 17 and loves a Friday night Chesecake factory dinner with her parents and then a movie at Tinseltown. Lastly I have never missed a movie even when we're cutting it a little close. I tell them when my movie starts and they do everything they can to get me in and out with the best service possible while still Making it quick!
Amy W.,"San Antonio, TX",40,49,8,1.0,8/2/2014,Worst Cheesecake Factory dining experience! We have dined in Cheesecake Factories from Hawaii to Florida. We stopped here while in Houston on vacation and it was terrible! Bathrooms were disgusting. Our waiter was rude and unattentive. We had to keep asking him for drink refills and waited forever just for him to stop by to check on us. When we asked for warm drinks because it was freezing in the restaurant he gave us a hard time and took forever to bring them. Our kid's pizza was drowning in grease and my skinnylicious Asian chicken salad was so drenched in dressing the lettuce was translucent. So disappointing. We won't be back but we won't hold this experience against the chain because the rest of our experiences at Cheesecake Factory have been awesome!
