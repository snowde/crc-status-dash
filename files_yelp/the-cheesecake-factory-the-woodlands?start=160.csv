Mandy M.,"Navasota, TX",0,31,,1.0,2/7/2015,"We will never return to this location. Our table was filthy. The service was TERRIBLY slow. Our waitress was nice but everything took forever. The 2 tables seated near us got bread right away but we waited almost until our food arrived and she apologized that it was only a partial basket. Our plates came out a few at a time and we were halfway done with our meal before we were offered cheese for our pasta. We ordered dessert but after waiting 25 minutes, we gave up and had to go into the hostess station to ask for our check. The manager was nice too but we still had to wait forever to pay and get our cheesecake to go. Not what we were hoping for our birthday celebration. :("
Juliana O.,"Paia, HI",98,43,119,3.0,7/15/2014,Nothing spectacular. The miso salmon was very bland. Server was REALLY sweet but the food was a major letdown. Tempura shrimp was not deveined. Kids Mac and cheese was a soup consistency. Fancy plates but their food is no better than... I don't know Chili's? It was also freezing inside. Not cozy. Won't be going back.
Rachel B.,"Houston, TX",1,30,6,5.0,1/22/2016,"This is my favorite restaurant, period. The food is as good as it gets! I have two favorite entrees that I am always having a hard time deciding between, the BBQ ranch chicken salad, and the Chicken Madeira. YUMMM! I always get the Chocolate Tuxedo cheese cake. It is the  . The service is always good. The wait is usually pretty long but that is to be expected given the location and quality! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
A Person With Opinions K.,"Spring, TX",0,3,,4.0,11/8/2015,"Overpriced, but small plates menu and bread are pretty solid, and of course the cheesecake is great"
Victor M.,"Spring, TX",169,8,1,5.0,11/24/2014,What can I say... Love this place. On a Saturday night wait was very minimal which was quite surprising. Ordered my usual Chicken Maderia; always taste great everytime. I applaud my server Brittany; did a great job taking care of me and my guest. Will be coming back!
Angela Walker P.,"Spring, TX",0,8,,5.0,12/24/2015,Consistently good food and service- can't go wrong here. Just be prepared to leave stuffed and with a to go box!
Emily W.,"Conroe, TX",7,8,1,2.0,9/27/2015,"Not very happy, first off the hostess was really rude,when we were finally seated our waiter came to the table,not very friendly, took our drink order came back took our appetizer order and our meal order, waited and waited for our bread which never came till we asked, as we were waiting some others hostesses came in to arrange seating for a large party,a guy and a girl, while arranging a Hispanic busgirl asked them a question to which the male responded to and she walked away the female hostess made a rude remark about the Hispanic lady and rolled her eyes, I hate people who think they are better than others this just left a bad taste in my mouth so I don't think I'll be back again,and our food came and still no appetizer we asked about it and they checked on it to which it wasn't ready by the time we got it we were already done with our main course, this is probably the 4th time we've had terrible service don't think I'm coming back for awhile, they need to rehire servers and hostesses who actually want a job and works well with the public,I've worked in the food industry before and now l still work with the public today and if any of these people worked for me they would be gone in a heartbeat!"
Melissa B.,"Spring, TX",106,96,203,4.0,7/5/2012,"Celebrated my 32nd here this evening. It did not take long to seat our party of six. Waiter was attentive and friendly. Our family received refills in a timely manner and our food was brought our promptly. They sang hb and wrote happy birthday to you in chocolate on my plate. My four year old enjoyed her Alfredo pasta and discovered she liked cheesecake. It was a good experience and I'd recommend it to others! Chicken Romano was delicious (huge portion) and my brother liked his meatloaf. The strawberry cheesecake was heavenly,"
Imagine P.,"Houston, TX",14,70,115,1.0,7/2/2014,"The CheeseCake Factory is located in a beautiful area and has a great view BUT what it comes down to is the food and honestly the food is always a C-. The only part I would return for is the actual cheese cake and i feel that's what they should serve and cut the rest out. I also ordered 2-Go orders for my job at the medical center on many occasions and every-time we get back to the office there's always something wrong with the orders and we have no time to go back and get the order corrected due to the fact we are always busy,and everything was explained in detail! As i said before the only reason I would return would be for the cheese cake."
David B.,"Spring, TX",513,320,166,3.0,3/1/2012,"The food here is consistently good. There is usually a wait to get a table though. Service here is slow at times. Prices are pretty high, but the portions are big and you usually have leftovers. I love the sweet corn tamale cakes here. Cheescake is the main reason to come here. Good every time I get it. I have had numerous varieties and they are all tasty. On the most recent trip we got the Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Very rich and decadent. You always know what to expect from this place and it is a decent place to go for a meal."
Ann G.,"Conroe, TX",0,16,,1.0,3/1/2015,"we usually go here once a month food is good and service . but last night was enough to make me never go back again. I took my son and his family there since they had never been. we waited an hour. was seated and waited 1 hour literally for our food, our drinks stayed empty cause the waitress was m.i.a., finally get our food and it was cold. !!!! just too much to explain horrible experience and just lost more customers. will never eat there again"
Alyssa B.,"ASTORIA, NY",188,245,137,1.0,11/17/2011,"I started off my meal at the bar with a watered down frozen margarita, complete with ice chunks. $10. We were seated in our booth a short time later, and our server, Tom, brought us some bread while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. 3 pats of butter and a basket of bread later, our friends arrived and Tom came back to take our order. I got the Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna. It sounded healthy. What came out was about an 8 oz ahi tuna steak encrusted in breadcrumbs on top of a bed of buttery rice and a small amount of julienned vegetables swimming in (more) butter. $22. I've heard the rumors and I've seen the ""Eat This, Not That"" articles constantly featuring Cheesecake Factory and now I understand how they manage to make everything unhealthy. BUTTER.  The service was excellent, but I would like to keep my arteries (and my wallet) in tact, so I will probably never return here if I can help it."
Kaio S.,"Spring, TX",3,44,,2.0,2/14/2014,"Went here with my family to celebrate my birthday. I think everyone did that night because the poor waiters must have sung Happy Birthday 7 times while we were there - and I kindly asked them not to sing to me because I was tired of hearing it. Staff was up beat and cheerful, and the ambiance was a 10. The food was sadly disappointing! The teriyaki chicken was bland and looked thrown together on the plate. The fish tacos had zero flavor - although the plate looked fabulous, it was a snooze fest to the taste buds. The kids had chicken tenders and fries and even those were border line inedible. And then came the cheesecake - the one saving grace of the evening. Maybe that's why they call it the Cheesecake Factory instead of the Really Good Food Factory. If I end up here again I will just skip the pleasantries and go straight to the dessert menu."
Brandy F.,"Denton, TX",0,9,,1.0,9/26/2015,"Our experience was horrible from the second we walked in. The staff was snickering about us as we walked up. The whole place as pretty empty yet they sat us at a table between the only other two groups, so NO privacy or talking due to the loudness. Our waitress bordered on rude and our food was very mediocre, at best. For the price we paid we were very disappointed in our date night! We will never return!"
Miguel G.,"Anaheim, CA",4,9,14,5.0,10/29/2014,Great service showed up did not have to wait to long to be seated.  Bread is always good and food is amazing.
Michael V.,"Federal Way, WA",42,10,1,2.0,7/25/2014,Food and service are normally great.   But make sure you check your dishes and utensils for dried stuck on food!  Yuck.  Manager just shrugged his shoulders.
Stan L.,"Lufkin, TX",3,7,1,3.0,7/17/2014,"Took the whole family out for dinner. They had a 20 minute wait and it took exactly 20 minutes to get a table...the atmosphere is noisy but we prefer that with a big family. We had 2 fried appetizers...they were good. For dinner we had Baja chicken tacos, pulled pork sandwich and mac-n-cheese, plus 2 grilled chicken breasts for the boys. It was was a little slow and the Mac-n-cheese of all things came out almost 10 minutes after everything else, which was odd.  For desert we ordered 4 cheesecakes to go. The bill with tip was $125....seemed pricey but we're on vacation so no complaints. Overall it was an enjoyable experience for all of us."
Tim S.,"Magnolia, TX",3,98,9,5.0,10/6/2013,Went here today for brunch after being treated like lepers at Hubbel and Hudson because we had a ten month old with us. The Elvis Waffle is great and the bruleed French toast that my wife had looked awesome and she said it was good. Waitress gave us excellent service. The snobs at Hubbel need a lesson or two from them.
Matt S.,"Richmond, TX",45,286,1,4.0,2/13/2012,Great cheesecake as always
Samantha F.,"Spring, TX",468,183,87,5.0,3/15/2014,The Chicken Littles & Parmesan Crusted Romano are my 2 favs! Super yummy! I also like their brown bread best! They have large portions in food & drinks. They also serve the kids bananas if you request it. It's a loud atmosphere so it's great for kids! Waits can be quite long during peak times so plan ahead.
