Renee Y.,"Spring, TX",46,106,1,5.0,9/8/2013,"The BEST Cheesecake Factory ever. Great service, food, and drinks. I love the ahi tuna dishes and the cheesecake is wonderful!"
Julie N.,"Houston, TX",0,11,7,4.0,4/4/2014,"This place gets REALLY busy around dinner time, unless you're in love with the food here it's not really worth the wait. I've usually gone during lunch and it's nowhere near as crowded during that time so the service is quick and the staff is a pleasure to talk to. They have a wide variety of dishes so it shouldn't be too hard to find something you'll like, I always get something different every timeI go. They have 'skinny' dishes and drinks which is a big bonus. This place makes the best sour apple martinis hands down!"
Danielle S.,"Spring, TX",0,27,60,5.0,8/3/2013,There's something refreshing about eating food served by people who look like they're enjoying the work they do.  Everyone working behind the bar Saturday night was in good spirits and cranking out drinks more efficiently than I've ever seen in a restaurant bar.  The service was professional and sincerely friendly.
Tiffany T.,"Spring, TX",5,3,,5.0,6/16/2014,Very good food & always nice atmosphere. This place is always packed but worth the wait. Such a huge selection of cheese cakes & food taste pretty fresh. The patio is a great place to sit on a beautiful day. Great for a date.
Lisa B.,"Kingwood, TX",2,16,1,3.0,2/20/2014,"Our family has been to Cheesecake Factory restaurants around the country. We've probably had more than a hundred meals there. The Woodlands location is my least favorite. It's unpleasantly loud and it just doesn't have the same cache as others, but I'm not sure why. We're going to visit the Westheimer location this weekend.  I'm hoping for the more typical relaxing experience Cheesecake Factory restaurants usually offer."
Holli H.,"Houston, TX",0,21,,4.0,11/15/2014,"Four stars because there is always a wait and there is always a wait on the damn bread. However! What made it worth eating in the cold outdoors and having the bread come 2 seconds before the meal...was the waiter! Tall, musical note tattoo on the right side of neck...and he could sing!! He sang to a girl that was having a birthday and he sang, ""I'll Be"", by the Goo Goo Dolls. Sure wish he had sang that to me! Talent!!"
Josh U.,"Kingwood, TX",89,18,1,4.0,2/7/2014,Great food and great service. One of my regular dinner restaurants. Amazing cheesecake!!!!
Chris B.,"Spring, TX",0,22,,5.0,5/22/2015,"We went there for my daughter's 18th birthday and was highly impressed.  The waitress understood when my daughter did not want any big deal made  for the birthday and was extremely attentive.  I ordered the Thai Lettuce wraps, my son a burger and my daughter ordered stuffed tortilla of some type.  The food was good, service good and the wait staff exceptionally attentive.  We shared a wild blueberry cheesecake and the waitress put tons of whipped cream and put a candle on top to causally celebrate so my daughter would not be embarrassed.  NICE JOB!  We will be back."
Amber S.,"Houston, TX",360,72,25,4.0,10/20/2013,"Good food, GREAT cheesecake! They have a decent wine selection to pair with the cheesecake.  I like to go with a crowd so we can all sample each other's cheesecake flavors.  I love the location, walking along the waterway, Market Street, or going to Barnes and Noble after a meal here is my favorite!"
Jane D.,"Spring, TX",2,8,,5.0,5/16/2015,"I have been here more times than I can remember and every time it has been great! Some times we have to wait, but the wait times are always reasonable. No matter how busy they are, servers are always attentive to your needs. The food arrives in very reasonable amounts of time, and if there is ever a problem, they work hard to remedy it ASAP! A manager will visit your table and personally apologize for any incorrect food. We have yet to try something on the menu we dislike, but our favorites are the miso salmon and the barbecue chicken ranch salad. For the appetizer, the fried mac and cheese is a chwat meal in itself, and the fried wontons are also very good. Drinks are great, and their iced green tea is like nowhere else, but very good! Each time we try a new cheesecake, and always make sure to go when the pumpkin and pumpkin pecan cheesecakes are available in the fall. They are AMAZING! Give them a chance and you won't be disappointed!"
Denise K.,"Tomball, TX",0,23,,1.0,5/3/2015,Lovely setting. Horrible service. Mediocre dinner. Great bread. Management doesnt care. Terribly understaffed
Sida B.,"Irvine, CA",58,129,689,3.0,9/19/2009,"I have a confession to make. Of all the chain restaurants that I frequently visit, I go to Cheesecake Factory the most. Mainly because I had a lot of good memories there, and the fact that their cheesecake (when prepared right, you'll see what I mean soon) is awesome! I also have certain favorite items on the menu, and they take reservations! So since I pretty much try to visit a CF at any city I'm in, I suggest to my best friend to go to the one near her house, located at the Woodlands Mall. I think to myself, ""what can possibly go wrong?""  Complementary BREAD and BUTTER            I LOVE PUMPERNICKEL bread. love it. I also love how they never fail to serve me as much bread as I want.  SPICY AHI TEMPURA ROLL         For the appetizer, my best friend recommends something she tried recently (after I got her hooked to CF when she went to visit me in California). We get it, and it's a bit spicy. I'm not a spicy fan, but the touch of spice in this dish really brings out the Ahi, so I enjoyed it very much. However, the sauce is too sweet and watery. I think I would've preferred a slightly thicker texture of dipping sauces, like sweet-n-sour. Also, the tempura batter wasn't too thick and didn't really match the spicy Ahi as well as it looked. Kinda bland and takes from the spicy Ahi itself.  PASTA CARBONARA            My roommate got it the last time I went to CF in Cali and lemme tell ya, this dish is unbelievably tasty. The intense amount of flavor (the ""Spaghettini with Smoked Bacon, Green Peas, and a Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce"") is so rich and savory that I almost died and went to heaven the first time I tried it. My best friend and I split this dish, and she absolutely loved it. It is a bit heavy, but this is my guilty pleasure indulgence at Cheesecake. It's not one of my ""usuals"" but I do get it when I feel the need to just get some pasta and cheese in my tummy to satisfy a craving. The bacon stands out really well, even in it's little chunks of glory. So pasta and bacon lovers...this is your Kryptonite. :) 30-YR ANNIVERSARY CHOCOLATE CAKE CHEESECAKE                 It's ""Layers of Our Original Cheesecake, Fudge Cake and Chocolate Truffle Cream."" Pretty much that sums up what the cake was, and the rich texture really brings out the different layers. If you feel that the chocolate is too much, take your fork and whisk a little whip cream to blend it out. It's delicious to the max.  Since I absolutely love this place, why not a 4-star? Service. Not only was our waiter missing half the time (I had to have a different waiter refill our glasses and check on our pasta) but our waiter served our cheesecake HALF-MELTED. You heard me. If you've ever been to a cheesecake factory, they NEVER serve their infamous cheesecakes melted! It's almost like a taboo! So sorry CF...you're incompetent waiter kills a star for you :("
Rob H.,"Austin, TX",248,317,230,4.0,1/30/2011,"What can I say... it's The Cheesecake Factory. Consistent no matter where you go. We had and have always had good service at this one. The Woodlands CCF is located conveniently across the street from the mall so it makes for a great after shopping meal spot. Just remember, CCF means there will be a wait so plan accordingly."
Wendy W.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",1,46,1,4.0,5/10/2013,"I was pleased with our food and service here for the most part. This was our first time to a Cheesecake Factory and our first place out since we moved to Texas. We were seated right away and we liked the ambiance. Our waiter was new but was nice and attentive.  The menu was gigantic! We had the crab rangoons for an app and they were just ok. I'm used the mixture inside being a little sweeter so I might not order these again. My fiancé had the pasta carbonara and I had the ahi tuna as my entree. They brought me the wrong entree and I guess it was entered incorrectly so we had to wait for mine to be made, but that was ok. It was soo delish. And of course we had to order cheesecake!! I had the white chocolate blueberry and my man had the dark chocolate raspberry. Both were great. When we received the bill the incorrect entree that was entered was also on our bill. We weren't bothered but was surprised at that moment that a manager didn't come to speak with us about the issues.  There were too many options to choose from :) so I guess we will have to go back!"
Alan W.,"Houston, TX",8,6,,4.0,5/5/2011,"We had a family birthday with 14 people. Appetizers:  salmon firecrackers (kind of greasy and fish not truly fresh) Spinach/artichoke dip was very good, though. Main:  Bang-Bang Chicken was a bit better than good. Service:  excellent, especially considering how many people Dessert:  Key Lime Cheesecake was very good."
Amy S.,"Spring, TX",0,24,,2.0,7/6/2014,"got there around 10:45 this morning.  just a handful of customers and we had to wait for a table. ?  Got seated and the waitress took our order.  we had the nachos as an appetizer.  the chips were almost burnt and the ""red sauce"" tasted like ketchup.    why? we ordered our meal and it came out about 5 minutes after the appetizer.    what we ordered was ok at best.   want overpriced almost burnt food? this is the place for ya. won't be back for a long time."
Sydney S.,"Clovis, NM",10,7,1,5.0,1/11/2014,"Great location, great food, and great service. The heaters on the outdoor patio are a great touch to keep you warm and enjoy the night."
Adam F.,"The Woodlands, TX",98,94,76,4.0,7/6/2013,Overall the food is good. Some items are a bit bland but the massive variety means there is something for everyone.
Tabitha Y.,"Spring, TX",45,14,,1.0,10/3/2012,"During our last visit, after we left, our waiter decided to add on to his tip line. Took forever to get anyone to correct the issue, even after they acknowledged the problem. Not impressed by the service or the management."
Brittany L.,"Newton, TX",36,9,,5.0,10/24/2013,Very delicious. We had the salmon salad and my husband had the Louisiana pasta the chicken was so moist and delicious. And don't forget about the Oreo cheesecake one word WOW!!!
