Albert N.,"The Woodlands, TX",218,293,118,1.0,11/17/2008,"We revisited for a child's birthday, and were met by impressively poor service.  (We'd been before, so we knew not to expect particularly good food, but the kids like the desserts, so off we went.) We parked and were seated immediately.  The friendly waiter gave us menus and took our drink orders. The waiter returned after about 10 minutes, and we ordered our salads and entrees.  Then we waited. The server came back 15 minutes or so later with one entree.  Then the salads and the other entree, all together.  So instead of a normal dining experience of salads followed by entrees, we had a table full of food. As you can imagine, this was not a good turn of events.  We wanted to tell our server, but at this point he was nowhere to be found, so we started eating and eventually snagged a manager who walked by. He seemingly couldn't be bothered by this, either.  We did mention to him that it was our child's birthday.  He said that if we ordered a dessert, they'd sing happy birthday, and put her name on the plate. I don't think I've ever found a restaurant so cheap that you have to order a child's birthday dessert before.  But now I've found one.  (And when it came out, of course her name wasn't on the plate.) Normally I'd tell a manager about this sort of mess, and see if he could make it right.  But here I couldn't locate a manager at this point, and we were more than ready to leave.  So I decided to tell Yelp instead. Folks, avoid this train wreck.  In short: It's Chili's-quality food marked up an extra 50%. Service is dreadful. Courses come out in random order. Management doesn't care. Birthday?  You're invited to buy a dessert. They're so crass and tacky that they sell advertising in their menu. Apparently the modus operandi for Cheesecake Factor is ""Anything for a buck.""  Except doing even a mediocre job. Avoid this place."
Robert B.,"Gilmer, TX",0,2,,4.0,6/8/2011,"Usually my idea of a cocktail is to add an ice cube to my whiskey but every time I visit the cheesecake factory I have the tropical martini. It looks like a girly drink, but it's great. I just have to ask the waiter to pretend like he's giving it to my wife, then I slide it over and drink it. Food is always good here. Sliders are phenomenal. Service is above average. Portion sizes are huge. The only complaint is that every now and then the food has a ""chain"" taste and feel, with little in the way of distinctive flavors. If you have more than two people the wait is sometimes  a little longer than it should be. We had 5 and noticed a lot of empty tables they could have shoved together to accommodate us, instead they seated numerous twosomes who arrived after us."
Karen P.,"Cypress, TX",41,207,7,1.0,1/8/2009,"I had heard raves about this place so I dragged my whole family there.  After close to an hour wait, we were seated, then the wait began.  My frist disappointment was there was no child's menu.  WTF?  I ended up having to order a full adult meal for my 2 kids to split.  The wait between drinks, appetizer, entrees, etc. was so long that we didn't have the time or energy to wait for ordering dessert.  We asked for the check so that we could get the heck out of this place.  This place is SO highly overrated that I really felt ripped off.  The services is inexcuseable and they act like they are doing you a favor serving you.   You won't catch me wasting my time on this place again.  It can stay in the Woodlands!"
Colie J.,"Lafayette, CO",13,208,105,5.0,2/27/2009,"It is true, no kids menu.  It is semi-overpriced as a strawberry lemonade will now cost you $4.50, but this is my favorite chain restaurant EVER.  The service and food at this one is ALWAYS good. I stop by whenever I am in Houston.  Alternatively, the one in the Galleria is good or try the Grand Lux across the street from the CF in the Galleria. Again, my favorite food is Stuffed Chicken Tortillas, but I also crave the potstickers, thai lettuce wraps, Monte Cristo at Sunday Brunch, Sante Fe salad, garlic noodles with chicken, and Grilled Corn cakes. My favortite cheesecake (Tres Leches) is no longer served, but now I eat White Chocolate Carmel Macademia."
Jared D.,"Conroe, TX",18,25,12,3.0,10/26/2013,"This place has a great upscale relaxed atmosphere. Although the menu is quite cumbersome due to its vast nature. I'm giving it 3 stars simply for the menu concentration, price to freshness of food served. It just seems to me, someone couldn't make up there mind in what they wanted and just kept adding. There food cost has to be absorbent. There is no way they serve this amount of fresh food daily. So at this point eating seafood in the middle of the week was a little suspect. Yet, I truly believe to be the great 4 & 5 rated star restaurants, you should serve any menu item any day of the week and it remains consistent, fresh and inviting. We had spinach artichoke dip, dynamite shrimp, fried calamari to start us off. All was great typical appetizer, would not say best in town, but not disappointing. Unfortunately, this day the shrimp had a slight bitter taste in my shrimp scampi/steak Diane. Also the wine sauce, tasted like yesterday's redo. The Food service was excellent, he did his job well... Just go with an open heart and an empty stomach, I bid you good eating! Oh yes let me not forget, the ""Original Cheescake"" can't miss this action - ever, I just needed a larger piece. Yes, of course I had this portion to go..."
Mike P.,"Chesterfield, NJ",11,22,5,3.0,6/19/2012,"The food was good and the atmosphere was very nice. I just was not all that impressed with the dinner menu. Despite the one thousand items on it, I just didn't find anything that great."
Chase N.,"Katy, TX",10,98,11,4.0,7/31/2011,"with an extensive menu and very large portion sizes, everyone is bound to find something to their liking.  While I've always been impressed with their food, I can't speak as highly about the service or ambiance.  Our 25 minute wait for a table took an hour, followed by a server that rarely came to our table, yet frequented other tables around us.  Dinner turned into a 3 1/2 hour experience, which I find highly unacceptable.  The lighting was so low, we had to pull out our smart phones & use the flashlight apps in order to see the menu.  That's a bit extreme, if you ask me.  Love the food, I just wish, for the prices they charge, the entire experience was as enjoyable as the food."
Andree W.,"Spring, TX",23,108,44,5.0,10/30/2010,"The only things I have ever had here was the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, the Herb Crusted Salmon and the Miso Salmon, all excellent.  Wait time to get food is longer than usual for a place so large so I wouldnt reccommend going if you are in a hurry. But large menu with something for everyone and of course the best cheesecake! I will go back!"
Brantley F.,"Spring, TX",16,23,6,1.0,5/31/2010,"Moral of the story...I'm SERIOUSLY not joking...you ask for Cody N. and enjoy a great time, or you suffer...terribly."
John S.,"Houston, TX",1,28,,2.0,2/1/2012,"Very average.  Pricey desserts, very slow service (took 20+ minutes just to get a few slices of cheesecake) and tables crammed so close together there is little or no privacy."
Shannon G.,"Spring, TX",0,99,2,2.0,6/11/2013,"Cheesecake is awesome but that's about it. Food is overpriced and substandard. Employees have an ""i dont care"" attitude. So take the cheesecake to go if you order some."
Angie K.,"Splendora, TX",10,2,17,2.0,7/22/2011,"I feel that their prices are a little steep, but their portion sizes are pretty big. Their menu is huge, so there has to be something on there for everyone. Service was a little slow tonight, but it's Friday evening so that could be why. Had the house Merlot and it was tasty.  I don't really care for the seating arrangements.  There were 2 in my party, and we were seated very close to the tables on both sides of us.  The table to the left was a group of 20 something guys who thought it was ok to drop the F-bomb every other word.   I don't know that I'll return."
Eric B.,"Spring, TX",0,31,,4.0,6/9/2013,"Cant go wrong here.  Ive had many things on the menu and never been disappointed.  Fav is prob the cuban sandwich.  Portions are large and you leave full, and prob with a to go box.  Very rarely do we actually get the cheesecake, but it is very good when we do.  Service is always top notch.  Only complaint is the wait sometimes, but that just means they are a thriving business."
Sheryl A.,"Houston, TX",6,21,2,4.0,3/15/2011,"Awesome food, awesome service, excellent ambiance. Needs a bigger ladies' room. Very cramped and awkward for such a big restaurant. :-/"
Jess G.,"Ukiah, CA",1,29,1,5.0,10/30/2012,First time at the Cheesecake Factory and it was amazing! Our waiter was really helpful and nice. Food was good and we didn't have to wait forever for it. I had the pumpkin cheesecake and it was delicious! Would definitely come back!
Christopher W.,"Lafayette, LA",2,100,,4.0,7/21/2010,"Their waiting service is very friendly, the atmosphere is one of the best and most relaxed I know of, and the food is great! Their mashes potatoes are excellent, and the chicken they put over the pasta is so good! And their cheesecake is the best in the world!"
Barry C.,"Katy, TX",29,88,3,4.0,3/17/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is a typical chain food restaurant in my eyes. However, their salads are typically fresh, nice just way over sized. The Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad is my favorite. Full of fresh vegetables and the chicken is very nice while the tostada chip stays nice and crisp even though it is covered with black beans. Truly one of my favorites and a recommendation.  This location is always nice, I prefer to set at the back against the glass, seems to be a little quieter, due to the decor these locations are always noisy with the cold floors, high ceilings and expansive open space.  For the finale of course it was cheesecake. To me the cheesecakes are those of something you find in the frozen food isle of your nearest grocery store, however, each time I try and find a new one to try. This time was the cookie dough cheesecake. It was nice and creamy with more dough than most, which is my favorite part. Be warned the crust is chocolate graham cracker or Oreo, which is unique with this type of cake. The contrasting taste makes you you stop for a moment.  Server did not provide his name, but was excellent as serving in which earns them an extra star. Almost forgot the bread to start with is delicious."
Michele B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",48,67,92,3.0,5/26/2009,"Typical of any Cheesecake factory on a Sunday afternoon. Busy with kids, families, strollers, shoppers and a few couples. The wait was moderate topping out at 20 minutes and our table of 8 was seated. The overwhelming menu (20 pages at least) had a few in our party scratching their heads with too many options but the food was satisfying, portions plenty, teas refilled in a timely manner and the Godiva cheesecake made my taste buds happy! A tad over priced for the quality but this is a safe bet as you know you'll find something for everyone with their abundant number of offerings."
Kittiya L.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,70,3,2.0,12/29/2008,"This review was based on my most recent experience at CF, when my friend and I ducked in for a quick drink on a late Sunday afternoon.   'Twas crowded, as any CF I've been to tends to be at any given hour, but we were able to find a perch for ourselves at the bar instantly.  There's not much to review: I sat in front of the two bartenders, who were courteous, friendly, and kept our water glasses full and checked in on us every so often.  I ordered their house Cabernet Sauvignon, which was fine; they gave us some complimentary warm bread (we had to wait a bit for these), which was generous; my friend ordered a tall and watery mojito which was attractive in presentation; we drank; we chatted; it was loud; TV screens flickered; then we paid and left.  I might add that I didn't eat not so much because I wasn't hungry, as because I didn't think the food particularly appetizing, nor the ingredients of admirable quality. So, though I have no specific complaints, the experience wasn't particularly pleasant (or unpleasant).  That being said, I am sure that I will patronize the establishment at some point again, but only when it's convenient.  CF has not been and probably will not be a choice destination for me."
Allison L.,"Spring, TX",0,21,,3.0,1/5/2012,"meh. I think it's overpriced for what you get. The food is good but not fantastic. The service has always been good. The menu is huge, so I think anyone could find something they like. We don't come here very often, too many other much better places to eat."
