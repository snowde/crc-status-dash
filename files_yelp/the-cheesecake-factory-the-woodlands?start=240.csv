Chantal R.,"Houston, TX",134,16,,4.0,3/26/2010,"I've been to all 3 Cheececake Factories in the Houston area and this one has to be my favorite. They have more food choices on the menu then the other do and they are much more spacious. Its always busy here no matter when you come, but I would rather wait at this location because of the wait staff service. Every time I've gone I have had good waiters and experiences. I absolutely love the strawberry lemonade and they are the only ones that have the mango lemonade. Favorite Cheescake Factory so far!"
Lexx S.,"Spring, TX",1,5,,5.0,8/18/2009,"I love this place despite all the wait during the weekends. I usually get the Shrimp Scampi everytime come here. I've been to alot of different restaurants and ordered their shrimp scampi but nothing compare to The Cheescake Factory. It may cost about $20 but its all worth it. You really get what you paid for. Anyways, the atmosphere is just like every other cheesecake factroy, very typical. However the bar here is pretty huge. Oh yeah btw, their cheesecake is the best! Tiramisu ftw!"
Jason A.,"Menlo Park, CA",4,17,,1.0,1/3/2010,"STAY AWAY! I came here with my family for lunch and everything about this place stunk. We were a party of 10, which apparently was too much for our server to handle. When we were seated, no one had bread plates, and he didn't bring any until I asked him, which was about 15 minutes later after we had eaten the 1 basket that was brought out. Crumbs were everywhere. We kept waiting for our order to be taken, and it wasn't until my aunt had spoke loud enough for him to hear, that we were all ready to order, then he came over. He didn't seem like he wanted to be there. I ordered the Kobe burger and guess what- it was very dry and crumbled apart. It was greasy on the outside like they fried it up in a skillet; I ate about half of it. Apparently the salad that my aunt had ordered was good though, it was an asian style chicken salad. None of us even wanted dessert, which I guess is what their known for, but after having their meal I wasn't going to take a chance on dessert. Overall it was bad, bad service and food. Maybe since the server knew the gratuity was included in the bill, he didn't need to worry about paying much attention to our table. As far as the cooks go- wow how hard is it to GRILL a burger? I won't be going to one of these chain resteraunts again."
