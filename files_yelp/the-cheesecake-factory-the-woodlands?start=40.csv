Jacqueline R.,"Houston, TX",0,7,3,4.0,7/1/2017,Delicious food with great service. The southwest sandwich is super spicy. The burrito is so huge you can literally share it with an extra person
Eliza L.,"Sugar Land, TX",2,71,76,4.0,6/28/2017,"Came here for dinner. I order the SkinnyLicious menu - chicken pot pie 540 calories. First time ordering this dish. This was DELICIOUS, it was alittle bit soupy. Great taste. I also order the Hazelnut cheesecake. One of my favorite cheesecake."
Ahsan R.,"Spring, TX",126,187,343,3.0,9/2/2016,I would really like to give this place more stars but the wait times and unorganized handling of masses of people was giving me anxiety and making me claustrophobic. The cheesecake we ordered was chocolate mousse which was slightly underwhelming. I had been to Cheescake factory years ago on a more memorable experience. Here's a takeaway: If its in your name then you better knock that dish out of the park. I'm sure there are better cheescake shops out there and I will start hunting them down for you guys
Allen H.,"Spring, TX",0,13,1,5.0,7/3/2017,Great food. GREAT SERVICE!!! Will be coming back soon for the next date night. Large portion sizes for the whole family and enough to take home. Keylime cheesecake was fantastic.
Carol N.,"Houston, TX",0,8,,1.0,8/1/2017,"I don't mind spending money on a good meal, I just hate wasting it and this whole experience was one not to repeat in my mind.  The food was mediocre minus at best - had the chicken and biscuits.  The chicken was pounded down to an eighth of an inch, bland, dry and tasteless.  The biscuits were dense, tasteless and cold.  The restroom was dirty, door didn't lock, the floors in this establishment were filthy, wiped the seats down just to sit in a booth, and the waitress kept disappearing for 15 minutes at a stretch.  No refills on drinks until flagged down (nicely), side orders forgotten, and having had 2 daughters that were waitresses I was being very kind.  The restaurant was busy but not during peak hours so was extremely disappointed in service."
Fabi M.,"Houston, TX",3,11,,5.0,3/27/2017,"Never disappoints!  Party of four. Great service, large portions. Our server was Alyssa. She was super friendly and uber attentive. We ordered the Hibachi Steak, Fish and Chips. Shrimp basket and the Pork Chop. All were delicious!"
Courtney May J.,"Houston, TX",118,37,30,3.0,2/23/2016,"I absolutely love the food here, the miso salmon is great! However, the food here is the highest calorie food of any restaurant! One meal can easily be 3,000 calories or more here and that's not including the free bread (which is very tasty).  It really irritates me that they don't take reservations and the wait times can be absolutely ridiculous. Some people end up waiting 2 1/2 hours for lunch! Their cheesecake is amazing I recommend the Adams yum! The covered patio is also very nice with the lights and music. The real reason for the 3 stars is their drinks. They are awful!!! They are very pretty, but you can tell they add water to them to dilute them. I had the Caribbean cooler today, which is basically a watered down strawberry Pina colada for $9. I could pay $5 for a margarita and be tipsy. I felt like I paid $9 for a watery virgin drink!"
Ashley S.,"Houston, TX",82,206,925,5.0,1/9/2016,"My bestie and I visited The Cheesecake Factory for the first time today. When we first got there she went up and got a pager. We had to wait five minutes before being seated at the booth beside the window, where you can over look the tables and chairs and the water. Our waiter, was very nice and friendly but she would disappear for five minutes between getting drinks, getting our food, ordering cheesecake and she disappeared  with my debit card for five minutes, from the computer. Finally she came back with the receipts, gave them to the wrong person and walked away. We left her a tip and left, by the time we walked to the front it was over crowded.  I had the fish and chips, my friend had a pasta plate, and I got the Adams peanut butter, chocolate cheesecake."
Taylor T.,"Spring, TX",515,162,673,3.0,9/9/2015,"This place overwhelms me. No it's not because of any bad service or bad food. It's simply because this place is filled to the brim with people... constantly. Looking for a relaxing, quite meal? Then this is not the place for you! I've only been twice, and each time I've sat in the super small tiny tables that are about 2 inches from the guests next to you. Literally so close I could probably stick my finger in their food... yes that close. I usually can't enjoy myself at this restauraunt simply because it's loud, crowded, and there is constant movement happening everywhere. Now I can't speak for this place during brunch or lunch hour, but I can definitely say this is how it is on dinners, especially weekends. Their menu is HUGE. Everyone should be able to find a meal at this place. It usually takes my husband and I 30 minutes just to read over the whole thing, and figure out what we want. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed simply by how many options there are (not that it's a bad thing.) They have some really great appetizers, pastas, and burgers. Their portions are huge! (Think Olive Garden style.) My husband and I normally share an entree and still have room to spare. Of course they have an exquisite cheesecake selection (obviously), so that's a plus! And for those of you who just want to drop in or take a cheesecake to go, they have the separate dessert counter to order them separate from food/seating. Overall I think their flavors are mediocore, it's over crowded, and noisy. But damn they have good cheesecake!"
Heather D.,"Oakland, CA",57,300,147,3.0,7/4/2016,"Great lunch option in The Woodlands.  We were seated immediately and our server was there within minutes to take our drink order.  The menu is vast, but the lunch combos of soup, sandwich and salads are very fresh and tasty and should have something for everyone.  Oh, and I hear that they may have cheesecake."
Raven T.,"Humble, TX",0,13,9,1.0,4/1/2017,I wish I could give this place no stars but I have at least do so to write the review the customer service at this place is trash they seat you at dirty tables them get upset like you are the problem you have rude waiters and waitresses with dirty shirts filled with stains I'm not going to say that all of them are bad but the 3 that I encountered were horrible and one even went so far as to Curse me out by intruding into conversation that he had nothing to do with the general manager lacks managerial skills and I'm not quite sure how she got the job she never address or fixes the problem and thinks it is ok she doesn't have any control over her staff and I find it odd that there are over 2 assistance managers in a building and they are always busy because people are constantly complaining about the service this is something that needs to really be addressed by corporate soon!
April K.,"Spring, TX",97,98,18,5.0,12/23/2016,I stopped in the bar for a quick stop during holiday shopping. I squeezed into a bar seat but was greeted right away and asked what I'd like to drink and if I would be dining tonight. I ordered a grey goose martini which was made perfectly. One of the 3 bartenders brought me bread to nibble on while I was scouring the menu. I decided on the sausage and ricotta Flatbread. It was delicious! The ricotta was warm and gooey. The sausage was seasoned with out being spicy. This was exactly what I needed to refuel and the service was friendly and quick.
Jasmine V.,"Spring, TX",86,31,97,5.0,12/31/2016,Of course I'm going to give this place a five star because of my go to when I don't know what I want to do LOL... it's a great place if you want to have good comfort food and a great dessert!
Katherine W.,"Houston, TX",70,32,2,2.0,4/23/2017,"My family and I have been going to this location since it opened years ago. The service and food have always been superb until recently. In the last year or so this place has hit a low in service and cleanliness. Morale seems super low around there. The bathroom is falling apart and even the small things are not given attention. Attention to detail is important. We went for a family lunch/dinner today and sat outside. The area was filthy all under tables. So much so that people kept going inside because of the trash and everything under tables. My dad even went to let a manager know. Not long after someone came out to sweep a few things here and there but it was still junky. Not one person followed up with us to acknowledge the error and how unacceptable the filth was. I'm sad to see this place drown in unprofessionalism and bad experiences. I decided to say something in hopes of restoration. In the meantime, my family and I have no intentions on coming back anytime soon."
Gigi T.,"Humble, TX",0,8,13,4.0,2/4/2017,"Absolutely love the food here service was great except the server had too many tables and didnt even bother to bring me out some bread, maybe next time"
Alison C.,"Spring, TX",225,186,2622,2.0,5/30/2014,"A glorified Chili's or Applebee's. Very inconsistent. Only worth a step in if you are as hopeless at making desserts as I am. They have types of cheesecake I wouldn't dare to daydream about.  MMMMmmmmm, expensive cheesecake~~"
David B.,"Spring, TX",0,6,,3.0,2/17/2017,"Bartenders are very attentive; great drinks, mostly all hand mixed. Had the Portabello Avocado zucchini appetizer -- it was very salty, virtually inedible. Nevertheless, it has a very extensive menu, something for all tastes."
Nicole K.,"Hanover, Germany",32,105,289,4.0,9/21/2015,"Cheesecakes at the Cheesecake Factory are amazing! No doubt about that. ""The other food"" is mostly average, but I have a few particular dishes which are hiding in this menu and totally deserve attention:   Appertizer: Avocado Eggplants Entrée: Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta Entrée: Pulled Pork Sandwich   The Pasta is by far one of the best pasta dishes I know. Spicy, but not too spicy, creamy, but not too creamy, great veggies added and topped with crispy noddles! Try it! You will love it.   The dark bread they always serve up front is really good, too!   Unfortunately, all of the above is already so filling (plus the portions here are HUGE), in the end there is never any space left for Cheesecake..."
Marigold P.,"Conroe, TX",9,51,611,5.0,11/14/2015,Oh i love what i have ordered today the Hibachi Steak  The server named Erik was right i will surely love it  it has a an asian taste sauce which i love it so much !! Thank i erik for ur recommendation;)) Of course my all time favorite here is their shrimp& chicken gumbo  Their receptionist is not too friendly she looks frowning anyways still we got our table & we love the food ;))
You M.,"Miami, FL",0,30,4,1.0,10/5/2016,"Disgusting! The cleanliness of this restaurant was a zero! When we were seated, the tables and chairs were both littered with crumbs. The menus were filthy!!! When we informed the staff we were told that we could move ourselves! Totally outrageous! I usually love Cheesecake Factory restaurants but this one was by far the worst ever."
