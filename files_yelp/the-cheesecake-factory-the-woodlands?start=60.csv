Luke M.,"Tomball, TX",22,5,,1.0,1/26/2017,The waiter Travis threatened to hit me with a plate after I told him what my problem was with waiting an hour for a salad. The salad never came. He put his chest against mine and almost fought me. Becareful the bald redbearded waiter. He is hostile.
Michael S.,"Sour Lake, TX",5,156,161,4.0,5/14/2016,We took our baseball team to eat late on a Saturday night. We were worried They could not accommodate our large group but were seated quickly on the patio. The food was great and so was the service.
Cherina G.,"Houston, TX",0,3,1,2.0,1/22/2017,"First of all, I DON'T like that the eating utensils are placed on the table instead of being wrapped in a napkin. That is disgusting and unsanitary. When I ordered my food(parm crusted chicken) i was disappointed with the fact that they were using FROZEN cut green beans instead of the usual french style. I know the taste of frozen vegetables and i hate it. Then, my chicken was a lot smaller than usual and it was a bit hard. The mashed potates were the only thing good. Highly disappointed.."
John S.,"Keller, TX",26,76,26,1.0,11/23/2016,"He lady at the cheesecake counter was very rude and pushy.  Because I wanted to take a second to decide on what I was getting, I was treated very rudely."
Hunter W.,"Tomball, TX",0,2,,1.0,3/20/2017,"A waitress or waiter does not just receive Zero tip they Earn Zero tip. I walk into the Cheesecake Factory looking for a nice 4 to 5 star meal and service and felt as if I were at McDonald's in the lower in of town. The waitress named ""Pamela L "" snatched the menu from my fiancé's hand as she walked away, back turnt toward my guest and I, as she continued to give her order. The attitude and the tone of her voice threw out my visit, which was very unpleasant. This place isn't even the top of the line when it come to food it just a modest way to have lunch on a nice day. I wouldn't suggest or recommend this place to anyone I care about. I'd take my company and my self else where."
Sidak S.,"Spring, TX",0,1,,1.0,9/18/2016,"After a long time, I was looking forward to come back here again with my whole family on a busy Saturday night. Initially, everything was going smooth as we got seated and our waiter came to us to ask what we wanted to drink. We decided to order their famous Chicken Samosas as appetizers. For our main course, we ordered the Spicy Cashew Chicken, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, and Spicy Chipotle Chicken. After our order was taken, things started to go downhill. We waited about 15 minutes and never received the sourdough and sweet multigrain bread that would normally come within 5 minutes of being seated. Our appetizers came and immediately after taking the first bite, we realized that the Samosas were full of salt. When we asked about the bread, we were told that they had ran out of bread and were waiting to get more. New people came and were seated next to us. They were served with bread immediately. Next, our food arrived, but the bread still didn't come. We had to request the food server (not our waiter) this time that we never received the bread and she said she would bring it. The bread ended up coming after the food had arrived. After taking a few bites of the main course, we determined that all our entrees had very high amounts of sodium and that made our experience terrible. We were not pleased with the service or the food and don't plan on coming to this location."
Terra W.,"Houston, TX",0,8,13,5.0,11/11/2016,This is my TOGO spot for the best cheesecake dessert...... I always enjoy the Factory.
Lindsay S.,"Houston, TX",128,11,4,4.0,11/22/2016,This place is great! We sat outside on the patio today and had wonderful service! I ordered the turkey and avocado sandwich. I added chipotle mayo and it was perfect! We also shared a slice of the salted caramel cheesecake and it was AMAZING!
Michelle P.,"Spring, TX",0,3,,1.0,6/17/2017,Food was awful!  Server could not help with recommendations for a similar dish that had been taken off the menu.  Ordered sauce on the side and completed meal before sauce was received. There was always an excuse! Very disappointed!
Michael R.,"Humble, TX",33,29,345,5.0,6/26/2015,"Always great service at the factory. Entrees are a little high, average $14-$16 and appetizers average $8-$11. But the portions are big, one plate will feed two people with average appetite. I have never had anything I didn't like here. Wait... I did have grilled shrimp, of all things, that were meh...  Cheers."
Dean T.,"Spring, TX",363,68,,5.0,7/25/2016,The service was very good. The food was what we expected and the cheese cake was great.  I recommend it
Hoa K.,"New Orleans, LA",252,289,1540,4.0,3/30/2014,"Love coming here!  We waited about 30 mins and was sat promptly.   It was my birthday so I ordered a strawberry Creamsicle! Loved it!   There were four of us so we ordered different things. 1. Calamari: delicious, light and goes great with garlic dip.  2. Chicken Marsala on Bow tie pasta.  Great Marsala mushroom sauce. Came with three pieces of thin sliced chicken breast.   3. Koby burger: med rare.  Juicy and fresh tasting.  Best burger according to my father in law. 4. Fish tacos: grilled on corn tortillas.  Not the best dish here.  Four tacos to a plate.  Tiny corn tacos. Fish was overcooked.  Overall not a good dish. I will be back for their other great specials"
Kelly S.,"Hockley, TX",1,22,40,1.0,5/18/2017,"We were sat right between 2 other couples which was very awkward, took forever to get our drink order in, very dark, bread was hard and cold, cheap cold, hard butter and menu was pricey. Food was ok, waiter was unfriendly and appeared irritated when my husband asked for ketchup with his fries! Not a great experience won't go back."
Danielle T.,"Montgomery, TX",0,3,,1.0,11/13/2016,Service today was not exceptional. The food was brought one plate at a time and took 20 minutes for our entire table to get our food.
Lindsey D.,"Houston, TX",187,486,615,5.0,3/12/2015,Great for coffee and cheesecake. Server was quick. Seating was fast. This was a Thursday at 9pm.
Jared F.,"Springfield, VA",0,22,13,5.0,4/12/2016,"The cheesecake factory is defiantly the place to cone with your friends.  Elaborate and fanciful the cheesecake factory feels like your dining in a palace rather than a resturaunt.  But dont worry this place wont break the bank of your average joe.  While the prices are a but in the higher end they certainly aren't exhuberant.   A massive menu greats you at the table along with a pleasant host. The food encompasses a wide range of american classics, today im eating sliders, excellent. Wash that down with an apropriate selection of beers wines and liquors to make it a meal, and dont forget the cheesecake"
Cyrena R.,"San Antonio, TX",15,29,26,5.0,3/5/2016,Plenty of choices on menu! They have a great light menu & good choices for kids. I always get an adequate amount of food for my money.
Robyn T.,"Spring, TX",0,1,,3.0,4/30/2017,Ok.....so I'd wanted cheesecake from the factory for a couple of weeks. Finally get to buy my slice today......DELICIOUS...but what happened to the size of the slice especially since the price went up a dollar?!?!?!
Dustin C.,"Humble, TX",0,6,,4.0,4/28/2016,It is pricey like all Cheesecake Factory restaurants are. This restaurant is very big but you will still have a wait on the weekends. There is no point in going there if you are not getting cheesecake but I suppose that is just my opinion. I usually get an appetizer or small meal so that I can fit that cheesecake in and the price tag is not as high.
Lina L.,"Southwest Houston, Houston, TX",0,7,3,1.0,4/27/2017,Today is my first time come to the Cheesecake Factory. However the white women is so mean about me. I am waitress too who working in the restaurant about four years. When she pass me she talk to other lady I am drink a lot water. (She just refill two time)That is made me super anger. But I still give her 20%tip. I know work in restaurant is long time job. Very important thing is if you don't like you customer. Complain them AFTER them leave. If she keep doing that way. Next time not tip at all for this white lady.
