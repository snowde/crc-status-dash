David A.,"Porter, TX",1,23,1,1.0,10/15/2016,"What a disaster! Haven't been over here in months. Looking forward to a night out with my wife. Simple order - turkey club. Had it before. Told them ""no salt on the fries"". We wait a long time - end up with a turkey burger! Sent it back. Comes back with turkey on a sub roll. Could have got that at subway. Third time - they bring me a skimpy turkey sandwich - not a club! Not that difficult! Then I tell the manager - says I don't have to pay for the sandwich! NO KIDDING! So I said, ""I don't want to pay for anything (my wife got a salad that probably costs a dollar to make). He insists I pay for it. Told him a wasn't going to. He begrudgingly agreed. This place is the money factory! Beware."
F L.,"Houston, TX",25,145,159,4.0,7/12/2016,"My husband and I came here on a whim. I had a taste for their tuxedo cheesecake specifically and a good meal. We had some errands to run, so I kinda killed two birds with one stone. Anywho, despite the amount of people in and around the area- there was no wait. So I was happy about that (I was starving). We were immediately seated in a booth, and our waiter came shortly after. I ordered their house side salad as an appetizer, and I must say their house vinaigrette is one of the BEST I've had (next to La Madeline's raspberry vinaigrette)! It was seasoned but not overwhelming. I practically scraped the plate. :D We were also served fresh warm bread to go with the salad. I love their wheat bread which reminds me of the same type of bread that Outback serves- delish! Our entrees consisted of the popular chicken Madeira and the gluten free angel hair shrimp pasta. I can see why the chicken Madeira is popular because it has a mixture of flavors. My husband really like his pasta as well. He said the shrimp had a buttery taste to them, and they were large. Honestly, there were so many things to choose from, it was hard to decide! They had meals to fit anyone's taste buds, ranging from Tex Mex, to comfort food or Italian. There were even ""light choices"" in case you wanted to indulge in the sweets (wink). Lastly, of course I had dessert, but that had to be on the go- I was stuffed. I truly couldn't even finish my meal because of such large portions. I was even able to share some with my husband. Needless to say, I would definitely return. I saw a great list of drinks I'd like to try the next time around. ;) Signing off..."
Victoria G.,"Pasadena, TX",0,11,12,5.0,3/1/2017,"Went for lunch on a Tuesday with reservations for a table of 14. They let us in a few minutes early, lead us to our table and quickly got our drinks and food order! Awesome customer service! They accidentally dropped my daughter's pizza, but came over and explained, and asked if they could bring something in the meantime... strawberries, and some other options. They quickly brought her some strawberries and had her pizza out shortly after. I can't wait to go back and get their chicken Romano again. It was fantastic! Thank you for helping us celebrate the adoption of our new family member!!!"
Matt R.,"New Orleans, LA",521,512,289,4.0,11/19/2014,"Ahh... much improved over the experience I had recently at the Memorial City location. Unlike there, this location in the Woodlands has a working air conditioner!  Anyway, my family loves Cheesecake Factory food. They have one of those menus that approaches the same page count as War & Peace and leaves you wanting 28 different items, but only able to reasonably choose a couple. For me, I always lean towards the pasta dishes and of course, load up on several of the delicious appetizers.  Get there early, because the place fills up at prime times and there can be a wait. Once seated, the service has always been good and the atmosphere pleasant.  BOTTOM LINE: Probably the best of the three Cheesecake Factories in H-town."
Ty A.,"Spring, TX",0,1,,1.0,3/19/2017,"First off I am so happy that you and your girlfriend had a good time, but I was expressing how my family and myself got treated that night. It was not a excellent visit at all. I tried my best to respect the waiter due to how I was raised, also I wanted to make sure our food got served to us without anything extra going into our food. And by the way it wasn't lunch time when we attended the resturant, it was dinner time. May God continue to Bless everyone that this may have affected."
Amy Y.,"Houston, TX",4,13,,2.0,7/20/2016,We drove almost an hour to go specifically to The Cheesecake Factory. We were told it would be a 5-10 minute wait and we watched as several groups of 4 went in before us. As we waited we heard the staff speak really inappropriate and curse loudly at each other. There were several children in front as well. We waited 20 minutes and were never seated and walked out.
Jed S.,"Houston, TX",9,18,5,3.0,9/9/2015,"I'm really torn about how to rate the Cheesecake Factory. If I could give two ratings I could, but I can't, so I have to give them 3 stars. The Cheesecake is amazing. I would give it a 5 by itself. However... the meals we ordered was not good, so I wanted to give it a 1 star. So averaging the two, I came up with a 3. We should have suspected that the meal menu wouldn't be to good, because it's huge. You know how when you go to a buffet that has too much stuff on it? Most of it isn't very good because they don't focus one kind of dish. This is true of Cheesecake Factory. They have a huge menu. I've heard the burgers are good (after we ate there), but we ordered some Italian food. It was probably the worst pasta I have ever eaten. The cheesecake for dessert made up for it, as it was delicious. Next time, we'll just go there for dessert, or maybe try a hamburger."
Randie W.,"Spring, TX",42,25,50,5.0,7/8/2016,"So the food is grand in scale and usually its good. Had the hot spinach and cheese dip. It was kinda bland. We could already tell the waiter was a character so when he asked how the dip was I said it's okay. He said I can fix that. He came back with a block of Parmesan and he was right - it was better. Crusted Parmesan Romano was good. And cheesecake was great as always. But what I really wanted to say was - if you ever want dinner and a show, ask for Jacob F. He was very entertaining and we will ask for him the next time we go back."
Rebecca C.,"Spring, TX",0,14,2,3.0,8/20/2016,"Not pleased with the quality and amount of food given the prices. Their mushroom swiss burger thing is delicious, but I don't know very many people that can mess up a burger. The salads are huge, but can tend to be under dressed. Their cheesecake slices are pricey, I know how to make my own so I'll stick to making my own entire cheesecake for the price of 1 slice there."
Lorin S.,"Conroe, TX",0,4,,1.0,1/22/2017,"Well unless I want cheesecake I won't be eating here again. I ordered the Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken & when I cut into my chicken breast it was completely raw. I was so grossed out that when they were going to cook it again, I just ordered spaghetti."
Gwyn D.,"Spring, TX",23,9,,4.0,1/22/2016,"Been here twice and have been very happy with the service and food. But my one bug-bear is their Shepherd's Pie.  It's only that is you use Ground Lamb. The hint is in the name. If you use Beef as the Cheesecake Factory do, then it's Cottage Pie. Being British like l am, then this is quite important. Please get it right - Thank You"
Jen S.,"Houston, TX",53,54,421,4.0,7/3/2015,"Pretty basic franchise food - but this location seems to get it right every time.  The sweet tamale corn cakes are a fantastic appetizer! And, bonus, they are naturally gluten free. Crisp exterior, sweet, smoothly inside with flavor that just bursts in your mouth. I've ordered it as a meal before.  The Pasta DaVinci with chicken and mushrooms is excellent and served in extremely generous portion. Actually, everything here is served in shareable portions.  And don't forget the famous cheesecake. I loved the tuxedo cheesecake - smooth, silky blend of traditional topped with chocolate mousse and Ganache, just melts in your mouth!  Not a place for dieters, but fantastic food with enough menu choices for everyone to find something they'd like."
Grace B.,"Houston, TX",5,25,36,4.0,10/28/2014,"My dad and I have never eaten at The Cheesecake Factory, but we've always heard about. So one day, during a trip to the Woodlands Mall, we went on a spontaneous food date to the Cheesecake Factory.  The wait wasn't long, and the service was pretty nice. They offered free bread as we waited for our food, and although it didn't look appetizing it was certainly delicious. I guess brown bread with oats encrusted on the top, appears to look bland but it wasn't at all.  Our waiter Jacob was pleasant, and he was easy to talk to. We were able to have funny small conversations and he was flexible and patient with us.  Onto the food, I had an herb crusted Salmon and my dad had ""The Everything Pizza"". My salmon was AWESOME! It was served on top of delicious mashed potatoes with a creamy but twisty-tangy sauce. The sauce is to die for! I don't know how to describe it, but it had an slight Â citrus lemon sour taste. I'm guessing they used Greek yogurt? I also believe they used farm raised Salmon, since the fish was a light pink instead of a rich deep pink.  The ""everything"" pizza, had a nice crust and it was also delicious. The only thing I would have preferred was the order without kalamata olives. (DISCLAIMER: the Cheesecake Factory gives you the option of having olives or not) My dad wanted olives on it, which wasn't the best idea because the olives made the pizza even more saltier than it already was. The crust was pretty amazing though, to make up for the saltiness. I wasn't as crazy about the pizza as my salmon. I can imagine the margherita pizza to be waaaaay better. I also wish we were seated some where more private. We were pretty close to another party next to us. It kind of felt like a community table. The place was kind of noisy, but we could deal with it.  I would give this place an overall score of 4.5 out of 5. Mainly because of the pizza and the privacy of the tables.  I wish we were able to try a cheesecake!!! The lunch portions were soooo big, we didn't have enough room in our tummies to stuff a cheesecake down. Maybe next time, my dad and i will just dine with a nice drink and good cheesecake."
Michael G.,"Saint Louis, MO",1,26,,2.0,10/11/2016,"So interesting experience - we love the Cheesecake Factory however this location is dirty, the pizza we ordered made a Digornio pizza from the supermarket look amazing. Â Pizza was delivered uncooked, Â had to order a different meal and it took forever to receive with the fries coming even later. Cleanliness is horrible Â - sticky handles on what was supposed to be a fresh glass of water, table was dirty, etc."
Souny H.,"Tomball, TX",200,28,21,5.0,9/23/2015,Love this place! Great service and fast also. Great food! Came during lunch and it wasn't busy. The strawberry lemonade is absolutely good! And the brown bread is life!
Taylor M.,"Buda, TX",112,112,92,3.0,7/20/2014,"It's a chain. I'll leave it at that.  I always want this place to be so much more than what it actually is. I guess the outer appearance gives it this incredible visual appeal and draws people in. Which is clearly understandable. The decor is phenomenal.  Now to the food...  We started with blueberry mojitos because... Hello, summer. We munched on the free basket of warm delicious honey oat bread. For an appetizer we ordered the avocado egg rolls. They were pretty tasty, the dipping sauce makes them awesome. It's like a honey cilantro vinegar sauce? For an entree I ordered the summer rolls because I wasn't too hungry. They were actually okay... A little skinny could've used a little more ""stuffing"" but not bad! The others ordered a Mexican salad and a steak Diane. I did not try but they both said they enjoyed their dinner as well.  Morale of the story. This place has a VERY extensive menu. Basically like reading a novel. But don't be fooled majority of it is drinks/cocktails and of course their dessert menu! We were all too full but I'd say of you're at the Cheesecake Factory then it's obligatory to get some motha fuggin cheesecake!  *free slice in your birthday* #protip"
Adri A.,"Houston, TX",2,19,6,1.0,2/29/2016,"I was so excited to eat at the cheese cake factory for the first time,but is was a huge disappointment. I tried the crab artichoke dip it was ice cold when the brought it out gross!! They supposedly fixed it but it just looked less than before with more oil just nasty. I ordered they chicken piccata something like that and the angel hair Pasta was not cooker right if had pieces that were stuck together idk what happen but i don't think I'll ever go back Idk why people enjoy eating here"
Lora S.,"Spring, TX",1,13,1,3.0,3/23/2015,"I love coming here. The food is amazing and the cheesecake is out of this world.  The only downside is the service. It's awful. I went on Friday night and waited to be seated, which is normal for a Friday night in The Woodlands, but I had to wait ten minutes before they took our drink order and another ten before we actually got our drinks. The waiter had way too many tables! We ended up waiting a good 45 minutes before the food arrived, and we had to hunt him down just to get our check! Usually when I come I expect the service to be a little slow...it always is, but this time made me unhappy."
Niesha J.,"Spring, TX",0,12,2,3.0,10/11/2015,"I was so amped about eating here after hearing about it for so long. Truth be told, its not at all what its cracked up to be. Alcoholic beverages were not good at all. Food is just OK and that depends on what you order. The cheesecake is outstanding, maybe it should just be The ""cheesecake"" factory. Don't be fooled by my pics either, it looks good but it was definitely bland. Grande burrito and Asian lettuce wraps."
Marie C.,"Houston, TX",1,36,4,2.0,4/29/2016,"I stopped going here a while back because the food got so overrated . But loved their wings and their dessert . The last time I went they took FOREVER TO SERVE US , AND THE BURGERS WE ORDER WERE DRY"
