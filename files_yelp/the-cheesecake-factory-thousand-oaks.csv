Lakshmi M.,"Phoenix, AZ",130,329,311,4.0,9/11/2017,"This is a pretty standard Cheesecake Factory with all the usual bells and whistles. I dropped in with a friend around 8:40 pm and was surprised to find that there was virtually no wait time! Yay! Ended up wanting more of a breakfast for dinner type meal and ordered the avocado toast. To be quite honest, I didn't know Cheesecake Factory even had avocado toast, but it was a pretty good avocado toast overall. A bit heavy for my liking, but tasty regardless.  Service was good and our table was well tended to."
Cassandra M.,"Newbury Park, CA",61,49,21,1.0,12/12/2017,"Worst experience we didn't even stay to eat. We went to go and eat in the mall portion of this restaurant. Walking to your table you feel like you are walking on sawdust or peanuts... only it isn't a restaurant that does that, so when you look down it is actually crumbs of food. You get the leftovers from the many costumers, before you get to the table! Yum!  The first table we were going to sit at was already set but had not been wiped down, more leftovers! Second table looked clean and the floor had very little evidence of people missing their mouths. When I opened the menu I got a prize and not one you get in a cereal box...leftover bread crumbs from the previous consumer! Well I know I wanted bread, but this was just ridiculous. Some bird would have been extremely happy with the feast that lay on the clean plate and my lap. PLEASE tell Mary Poppins to feed the birds at the park! I had lost my appetite at this time but the people I was with were hungry, so I told them I wouldn't eat. If it couldn't get any worse, I noticed my spoon. It had some sort of whipped cream or creamy sauce on the spoon. Thank goodness I saw this before inserting someone else's DNA into my mouth, did they use mouth wash today...? I hope so! Again I wish the Cheesecake Factory would give me some fresh food that ""I"" ordered! We left after the spoon, we were not going to chance eating something we didn't order (crumbs, sauce on the spoon). If you like to live on the edge and see what kind of leftovers lands on your plate before ordering... GO FOR IT!  My suggestion bring your own silverware, look up the menu on your phone, pack a mini vacuum, vitamin c tablets, and a bucket in case you some how get sick from all the extra unwanted leftovers you are about to eat. My fear is the sitting areas looked like this, can you imagine the kitchen?"
Brown Eyes B.,"Studio City, CA",1,39,,2.0,11/25/2017,Food pretty good but service is a let down every time. Management does not seem to care. They just make up excuses for the servers. Asked manager to get us a new server after complaining but she did not do so after few complaints from other tables too.  Again we complained 2nd time and said we did not feel comfortable with her serving us after complaining. Manager just told us not to worry about it.  Shows poor man agents skills. Can't expect good service if management does not care. She thought offering a free cheesecake makes up for it after a whole disaster lunch with numerous tables of complaints.  I don't care about a cheese cake you offered. I would have appreciated if she actually care about the customers. We did not feel comfortable eating the rest of our meals because we didn't want the service to do anything to our food after complaints. We paid for meals we did not feel comfortable eating thanks to management not taking appropriate action. Total let down.
Vanessa D.,"Oxnard, CA",48,13,5,5.0,1/7/2018,"Our waitress was delightful and made herself available for every request. Food was delicious, great atmosphere."
Mike T.,"Simi Valley, CA",4725,371,1020,4.0,11/17/2017,This restaurant is a great place to grub on some delicious food but the service could use some improvement. I recommend any dish they have because it is all good in my opinion. Be careful because this spot gets super busy almost every single day which is a good thing but not at the same time do to the service being not very efficient.
Annette M.,"Ventura, CA",56,74,228,4.0,6/15/2017,Have been to this Cheesecake a million times!  Each time service has been exceptional. They really go out of their way to make your dining experience all that you expect it to be. Tried something new. Grilled Fish Tacos- Delish. Sat at the bar and the bartender was attentive and professional.
Davish B.,"Ventura, CA",109,135,61,1.0,12/31/2017,Was told we'd be seated in 45 but it because 1.5 hrs. When I spoke to the manager he was extremely rude. It looks like he is about the worst manage of any Cheesecake Factory. We've been coming to several for many years. The service was a major disappointment here as well. We won't be back.
Mona L.,"Westlake Village, CA",11,151,20,4.0,12/23/2017,"I was shocked that this place wasn't rated better on Yelp. I've very rarely been disappointed. The menu selection can't be beat, the food always tastes great and quality is always decent of not great. The service varies, but is rarely terrible.. usually good or great. The wait can be a bummer, it's hard when the place is at the mall, but it's always been worth the wait. Very kid friendly- and it's always been somewhat easy to eat here when I'm on one of my new diets. Cheesecake is so tempting and delish but remember how fattening it is and try and share with the group!!"
Fiona G.,"Honolulu, HI",205,468,3433,4.0,9/9/2017,"Celebrated my mom's bday tonight. Considerable wait time but that's expected on a Friday night. Our waitress was wonderful. The food came out rather quickly considering how busy it was! Must be birth month of Virgos because there were 5 other bdays in the same room! It was quite funny! Good food, good service, and great cheesecake!!!!"
Ricardo G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",24,4,,1.0,1/2/2018,"By far worst driest,plain ribeye I have ever ever had. When you steak from Denny's taste better than theres a huge problem"
Ted B.,"Newbury Park, Newbury Park, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/10/2018,love this place come here with my wife occasionally we always get avocado eggrolls for appetizer! they're just amazing! second course is usually pasta verde or salmon dishes are pretty great too! staff is always courteous and always tries to accommodate with best seats possible!  oh yes and dont forget the cheesecakes! best in the world!
Janine F.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,26,5,2.0,12/24/2017,"Poor service for the price. This chain has managerial issues. Other locations offer the same sub-par service, so I think it's the fault of disorganized management. For example 1 waiter got 4 tables that arrived at the same time. Pretty sure we all felt ignored. It's Christmas Eve, so I was hoping to make some good memories. A busy holiday may not be perfect but we came at a slow time and service was still painfully lacking. After consistently neglectful service, I spoke with a manager and still left feeling like I wasted my money. Special occasions and this chain do not mix."
Cameron P.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",7,51,79,4.0,7/24/2017,"I've never had a bad meal here. Period. Service is terrific.  Servers are always nice, professional and knowledgeable.  This place is a finely tuned machine.  The menu is (Literally) a mile long so, your biggest problem will be deciding what to order.  On my last visit I had the salmon with asparagus and jasmine rice. Perfect. The salmon was cooked just-medium. Asparagus was perfectly al dente. My glass was never empty. The server, as busy as she was, always kept our beverages full or half full.  Not a single gripe. Ever. (Well, except for the wait. But, what does that tell ya? )"
Steve S.,"Los Angeles, CA",299,200,261,5.0,6/23/2017,"Cheesecake has always been a favorite - hands down. always reliable, never messes up your order, everyone is well trained (not that servers are dogs..but), everyone is very polite, the girls working are all very pretty - great all around restaurant/bar. I always sit at their bar, i love walking pass the mess of inexperienced gaggles of people in the front that stand around for 40 minutes for a table to open, then proceed to bitch about it... cute story idiots. My go-to is their Blackened chicken sandwich even though it is not on the menu anymore, if the right people are working you can still order it :) secret menu status. If i'm having dinner or I'm craving it, i will order the chicken and biscuits - that is literally one of my favorite dishes ever (last meal on earth type of s*#t). Every time i come to a Cheesecake Factory the customer service is great, food comes out on time and all together, you never have to be worried about looking around for service, the bar will ring up your drinks if you order them before happy hour ends (HH ends at 6PM), and everyone is always pleasant or at least faking it. Also, the outside remodeling looks amazing!!!! congrats guys!!! 2 things i absolutely HATE about this location: 1) the TV's are pathetic in the bar - what are you guys doing? they look like tube tv's that weigh 200 pounds from the 90's. 2) If you are walking near the kitchen entry to be seated in the back of the restaurant (to the left of the bar area) watch your step ... It's always slippery on the floor - you will fall."
Zoe F.,"Canoga Park, CA",525,196,66,5.0,6/22/2017,"Came in right before happy hour ended last night. Was able to find a seat at the bar immediately and was greeted just as fast. The bartender, very nice, was able to get food and drinks working for us right before it ended.  He was super nice and totally understood our hurry. We got our drinks promptly, followed by food. Which looked and smelled delicious. My friend had started to eat some and seemed to really be enjoying it. Before I could dive in we have to go unexpectedly. The bartender immediately closed us out and our food was being packaged as soon as we had asked. Everyone was really on top of it!  I love cheesecake. I always come here and try to sit in the bar. I unfortunately have never been able to sit down and enjoy their happy hour fully. I will definitely be back to experience it!"
Joe C.,"Tampa, FL",4,42,47,5.0,9/29/2017,"I like the style and selection of Cheesecake Factory.  It's always busy but always delicious and worth the wait.  My favorite meal here is the turkey club sandwich along with a delicious slice of cheesecake for dessert.  The location was clean and staff were friendly, it's part of a really nice mall and was a really enjoyable experience."
Samantha S.,"Minneapolis, MN",201,206,383,4.0,10/15/2016,"This was my second time at this particular location of The Cheesecake Factory. I split the pizza with my mother and it very good (a little more grease than I would have preferred). My sister had the ""Soup of the Day"" which was Baked Potato and ate it to the last drop, so take that as you will. For dessert, my mother stuck with the classic cheesecake, while I enjoyed the Godiva chocolate cheesecake and my sister had the s'mores cheesecake. If I had to rank them, I would put s'mores at the top, then Godiva and classic last. We arrived on a Saturday, just after 5:00pm and it took about 25 minutes to be seated. As we were waiting, the line became very long, so I would advise calling ahead to get the wait time.  The staff was very friendly and one of the waiters gave a very thorough description of the chocolate-flavored cheesecakes to help me decide!"
Richard H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",5,16,,1.0,12/6/2017,"I knew eventually happen, the cheesecake factory has finally slept dramatically into mediocrity, or just plain poorly prepared, tasteless food. It is been quite sometime since we've visited this restaurant. We were hoping that the food quality, service was up to their standard as in the past. We were unfortunately mistaken. It is always disappointing when the restaurant Makes the conscious decision to reduce food quality in order to improve profits. Never again, I will not be burned twice. The comment by guest services is a typical, comment from a company that no longer cares about the quality of their product."
Samantha W.,"Camarillo, CA",87,13,2,5.0,10/21/2017,I can't begin to explain how much I love the cheesecake factory from the food to the service.  A++
Alyssa K.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",186,3,1,2.0,8/29/2017,"The atmosphere and staff are nice, the cheesecake is great. Well deserved name of the restaurant. That being said, I wouldn't order a meal at the Cheesecake Factory again. We split the Shrimp Scampi, and it was fried with the breading falling off. Furthermore, the pasta was dry (the sauce was pooled on the bottom of the platter), and the flavors lacked any of the imagination the presentation attempted to convey. In the realm of $20 Shrimp Scampi, I'd much rather drive out of my way to receive more than six pieces of shrimp for our $20. I'm sorry to harp so much, but a $20 dish should be worth the added expense, not a charge for the elaborate overhead.  From now on, we will only purchase the delicious cheesecake."
Pinn S.,"Santa Barbara, CA",62,39,74,5.0,4/30/2017,Just perfect! Our server for our Saturday lunch was Shane. There were 8 of us adults and 1 children and 1 baby and everyone was full and happy :)
Jimmy D.,"Riverside, CA",223,85,109,3.0,5/17/2017,"My recommendations:  Fried mac n cheese Louisiana chicken pasta (my favorite)  Shrimp scampi Jampalaya Original Cheesecake  But you cant go wrong with the pastas here, but if you take leftovers and microwave it, a lot of oil comes out. I still eat it but just letting y'all know."
Sande M.,"Newbury Park, CA",36,76,,2.0,12/28/2017,Absolutely disappointed. Cobb salad came with no salad dressing. The beet & goat cheese salad for almost $7.00 - 2 pieces of goat cheese almost no salad. Didn't even fill up a quarter of the container! And; I'm getting very offended at sales receipts that suggest I tip up to 22%. For a take-out order that most can't get right?? Seriously. Actually; this order for the price and quantity of food now; i.e. two small bread loafs for 3 people. really deserves less. Guess that's why their still open. Seeing a lot of the same comments apparently on this location. They should probably stick to cheesecake and not food.
Lisa D.,"Oak Park, CA",0,36,,5.0,8/28/2017,"This is a great place for wonderful food, delicious cocktails and a friendly environment. Today I met my best friend here for lunch, as we've done several times. We had THE BEST SERVERS!!! Rachel was training Cheyenne. Rachel has served us before and these ladies were constant professionals! They were polite and prompt with everything we asked for. They were funny and sweet. As we all know, restaurants are not scarce in Thousand Oaks but GREAT customer service is, come here and experience the BEST of both worlds. The food is flavorful, the drinks are tasty, and you can't beat the service! And do NOT skip the cheesecake! Never! Thanks CF for always being on point!"
Michael B.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,18,20,5.0,6/25/2017,"I eat at the cheesecake factory a few times a year. Their serving sizes are very generous so I always share with my wife. Our favorite menu items are the following: Jambalaya Pasta $19 Avocado Egg Rolls $12 Combination Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon $22.50 Dulce de leche caramel Cheese Cake I feel that for the price, the quantity, quality and service are very good. They have the best cheesecake around (though that is a bit pricey). I'm always happy to eat at the Cheesecake Factory."
Suzanne S.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,16,,1.0,11/7/2017,I went with my daughter today!! Again what a disappointment !! It took 20 minutes to bring water bread and an 1orange juice. 25 minutes for a high chair. 30 minutes to get our food with a burnt side of salmon for my grand daughter. It was not busy at 11:30 am. Another unpleasant experience.
Albert G.,"Camarillo, CA",3,2,2,1.0,11/10/2017,"I told the waiter it was my wife's birthday and asked him to get the staff together to sing happy birthday.  He agreed, then didn't do it! Will never go here again."
Leah A.,"Jacksonville, FL",951,1062,9238,4.0,2/5/2017,"This chain was a favorite when I worked at The Oaks. The service was efficient and friendly. I was in the habit of ordering lunch from here 3-5 times a week. Whether it was sitting down to eat, making a to-go order or just indulging in a slice of their cheesecake (I've had them all!), I really love this location.  They are located at the front of the mall so parking and accessibility to the restaurant are pretty easy. The service is consistently good here and the menu is big enough not to get bored. Try their Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad, Cobb Salad & their Chopped Salad. The Cheesecake Factory offers plenty of affordable lunch specials and two of my favorite Factory apps that never disappoint: The Thai Lettuce Wraps & The Avocado Eggrolls"
Elisa H.,"Westlake Village, CA",77,547,1456,4.0,8/9/2016,"Great family style restaurant with indoor dining, which tends to be a tad loud, patio dining which tends to be quieter and dining within the mall at tables adjacent to the restaurant, which we choose....air conditioned and just right. Extensive menu choices, decent kid menu with fair pricing.   Took our 8 year old granddaughter to dinner...and what did she choose for an appetizer? Fried calamari, and she loved it! Lightly breaded and salted, can't even imagine the calories, it was indeed tasty . I chose Evelyn's pasta, rigatoni pasta tossed with broccoli, sun dried tomatoes, eggplant, mushrooms, pine nuts and I can't remember what else. Portion size was large, so have lunch for tomorrow.  Our granddaughter chose two beef sliders with fruit.  She ate every bite! Couldn't resist getting her a child's hot fudge sundae, two scoops of ice cream, hot fudge and whipped cream.   Service was excellent, my compliments to Maria C for outstanding, attentive service."
Amy M.,"Agoura Hills, CA",56,18,,2.0,10/24/2017,We got carry out and all our food was soggy! We ordered a kids quesadilla and they gave us the appetizer quesadilla which had spicy peppers inside -- for our 2 year old! The only thing they got right was the yummy cheesecake... FAIL!
Charles G.,"Simi Valley, CA",226,79,11,4.0,8/16/2017,Had dinner here last night and the food was great. I was very happy with our server Leo who clearly enjoys what he does. He was very attentive to us and made sure we had a pleasant experience. Thank you Leo!
Angela M.,"Agoura Hills, CA",53,125,50,3.0,3/1/2017,"Just a heads up! If you are a fan of the chocolate cakes, they have changed in size. Remember it came in a large square container? Well now they are placing it in a cheesecake container. The slice of cake is much smaller. And unfortunately it looses its shape in that container."
Erin W.,"Studio City, CA",737,205,815,5.0,12/20/2016,Cheesecake Factory is always a hot for me! Great service and delicious food. I always try to leave room for dessert haha This location is great! Love their lunch options and eating at the patio. Dog friendly too. They bring out water for my fur baby all the time and it's so cute. Aww. Then after we walk around the mall. :)  *Try their vegan salad and avocado toast next time!
Anasia P.,"Woodland Hills, CA",119,11,4,4.0,6/6/2017,"One of my favorite places to have brunch! I normally don't drink by myself but having Victor as my waiter , I will always be okay with sitting alone. His attentiveness is priceless and boy was he fine. The drinks he creates for you are one of a kind. I wish everyone could have a Victor at there location because he was the bomb!"
Ray G.,"Simi Valley, CA",4262,265,4580,5.0,11/12/2016,Great Food! Great Service!  Very busy on a Friday afternoon. That's a great sign but the wait was expected to be around 35min. Not bad but as hungry as I was ... I asked if which area I could go to to avoid the line. The gal said the chairs by the bar and the 3 high tables next to it were my best bet. She was right. I waited a few min and a high table opened up. Sat down in less than 5 min!! Love it!! My fav Appetizer choices : fried calamari or avocado egg rolls My absolute fav dishes:  Cajun Jambalaya & Spicy Cashew Chicken  (I'm salivating as I write these choices!!) And my fav cheesecake is the Lemon Raspberry  WOW!!
Harris E.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",23,59,1,1.0,6/7/2017,"WOW!!!!! This was the worst birthday celebration attempt at a restaurant EVER!!!!!!!!!  My wife and I have been frequenting this location for over a decade now and she loves cheesecake factory - or I should say - ""loved"" until last night. My wife and our party had the worst birthday celebration experience! It is especially unfortunate that it was at our local location that we have been coming to for years!! We had a party of 7 and the night started off ok with pleasant introductory service, however that's where it all ended and went downhill from here;  A couple of entrees were incorrectly served, my order was sent to a different table and therefore I had to wait an additional 20 minutes while everyone else finished their food. I didn't blame the waitress as she was apologetic and did offer a comped appetizer. And after all that  long wait -  the shrimp bistro entrée was bitter and spoiled. I had about 3 spoonful's and just gave up! The waitress noticed and asked if I wanted something else but I was tired and didn't want to complain and wait again after a long day! The waitress finally came back and I had to ask for the dessert menu, but the straw that broke the camels back was when I explicitly told the server that it was my wife's birthday 3 different times during the night!!!!! After the painfully slow and unpleasant service; the waitress brought our desserts- quickly placing them on the table and then disappeared - bringing no clean plates or utensils. I had to flag down a different waiter for the clean plates after my party was waiting for over 10 minutes as the lit birthday candle was melting! Horrible!!! To make it worse - we were waiting for the customary birthday recognition from the staff, but no one showed! I expressed my dissatisfaction with the waitress and she just replied: its late at night and we are just all over the place, showing no concern or apology especially after I was significantly patient and courteous with her.  But that's not where it ends! I finally asked for the manager to rectify this horrendous experience for my wife and her party of guests.  Cameron  P. - was the most rudest, condescending and unapologetic manager I have ever met, especially being in the hospitality industry!  I explained to him of our issue! I had to express 3 times that we had a birthday celebration in our party and we were completely mistreated and dissatisfied with our reception for this supposed memorable experience. He showed no sympathy or apology stating that he was not aware  and simply stated that he will comp one desert. WOW!!! Really?!? I didn't even bring up my spoiled dish until now and he stated that ""if you ate it, then I have to charge you!""   WOWWWWWW!!!!!!!! I seriously asked if this is how he is going to end the experience ? His response: "" if you didn't like the service, you don't have to leave a tip!"" LMFAO!!!!!!!! REALLY!!!!!???????   Obviously he was severely uncompassionate about the principals of celebrations and memories!!!! But being the manager, if your employee dropped the ball - you are expected to pick it back up and maintain the brand! But guess what? It still didn't end there! To add insult to injury - a table in front of us had a birthday recognition from all the staff! I told the manager - but no sympathy, no apology! Just arrogant demeanor!  Thanks Management! You just made the franchise lose guests that have been coming to this local location for over a decade! You personally didn't ruin the night - but as a senior manager, you were responsible for the brand representation and rectification of the horrendous experience and unfortunate memory with our guests! We will never return!"
Lynn G.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,13,,1.0,10/17/2017,"I have been coming to different Cheesecake Factory restaurants for almost 20 years,  my first one was in Newport Beach and when I moved to Indianapolis 18 years ago, I was so excited they had one there! Idk what's going on but there prices have gone up and the quality of food, my god has gone so down, it makes me so sad because this was my place, birthdays any celebration, just was in the ThousandOaks one, giving it another try! Nope , never going again, it's like going to Marie Calenders :( Here I go  again lol. It was my dads birthday today, and this was his choice. I said Dad , it's not the same! So we went, after the meal , all  8 of us who have been coming to Cheesecake Factory for 25 years said never again! We are all very sad."
Don A.,"Oxnard, CA",0,29,25,5.0,6/18/2017,"Had the chicken Parmesan sandwich which was great as usual, very filling, enough for two meals, baked macNcheese with bacon was very good! Andrew the server was best server that I've had in a while, very knowledgeable friendly and filled water glasses several time even though this place is busy, which is a very important trait in a server. Highly recommend this place and as well him as server."
Randall D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,4.0,10/13/2017,We love the food BUT your beer selection sucks!  Please fix it.  Even your wait staff thinks it's horrible. And $5 for a bottle of beer. NO!
Lene N.,"East Bay, CA",1433,849,4285,4.0,2/24/2016,"I may be a little bias when it comes to Cheesecake Factory because it was one of my first ""real jobs"" out of high school, grand opening the location in Pleasanton, CA- and at the time I thought Cheesecake Factory was the best thing ever created aside from sliced bread. Although CCF is a corporate chain and every store goes through the same extensive training on the food and how to provide exceptional customer service, not every location has the same customer service,  and the only thing that is constant is the food.  The CCF in The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks is truly hit or miss when it comes to the customer service. One day we can get someone that actually practices the training they were taught and one day we can get someone that probably shouldn't be working in the restaurant industry. Either way, this is the closest CCF to our home, so that is why continue to come here. I really enjoy this location because who doesn't enjoy a good meal including dessert after a great day of shopping? I enjoy sitting outside on their outdoor dinning area, indulging in a great piece of cheesecake. Sometimes sitting on one of the tables inside overlooking the mall entrance is fun, so you can people watch.  Almost always this place will have a minimum wait time of at least 30 minutes so be prepared.  My favorite all time dish has been the Chicken Piccata with a side of angel hair pasta. I've never been a fan of capers until this dish. Capers are like an olive and are sprinkled throughout this pasta dish. The chicken is slightly seared and perfectly seasoned. The pasta is al dente all the time. I love this dish!  For my cheesecake, the three that I love is the White Chocolate Truffle Raspberry, Tiramisu and the other is Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake. All are absolutely delish!   Cheesecake Factory makes a great date night spot without breaking the bank. Also the location is great with different seating options: indoor, outdoor or indoor along the mall. I would recommend CCF to everyone... The cheesecakes are amazing!"
