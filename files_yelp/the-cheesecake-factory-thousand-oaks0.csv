Tony N.,"ENCINO, CA",1,43,,1.0,9/7/2016,"I am a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory.  I've always been very happy with the food and the service.  But the service during yesterday's visit (9-6-16) was terrible.  I was visiting friends in the area & this was my first visit to this particular location.  I ordered the large Santa Fe salad, as I usually do.  I was mistakenly served the small lunch size & it had no chicken, and no dressing.  Well, OK....no big deal, I told our waiter & he brought another Santa Fe salad.  This one was the right size, but I was surprised to find that it had exactly ONE small piece of chicken in it.  I again notified our waiter & politely showed him that one piece of chicken & also showed him by digging around the salad that it was the only piece of chicken present.  He actually said, ""Hmmm...I saw the chef cutting up a lot of chicken,"" implying that he didn't believe me.  I said, ""Just bring some chicken, please.""  My friends commented on how rude the waiter was & also expressed disgust that a waiter would treat a customer that way. I hope this is an isolated incident & not an indication of the type of people The Cheesecake Factory is presently hiring."
Anna L.,"Calabasas, CA",589,126,184,5.0,3/14/2016,"I truly love the Cheesecake Factory, it's a nice place to eat, meet, and hang out. This location is my favorite due to The Oaks Mall. The wait can be a bit long at times, but it's to be expected considering the area. Fun place for the kids, the staff is friendly and attentive."
Isabel D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,11,,5.0,8/17/2016,Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant. Love this place. Our server Luca was very polite and accomadating. We were on the patio with only 2 other patrons so he came out only when necessary which was fine bc we had what we needed mostly.  We will most definitely be back and hope he is our waiter again bc he was good and friendly. We appreciate the service. Ahi Tuna salad was great as always. The stuffed mushroom appetizer we would skip but everything else was so tasty.
Sam D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,83,13,3.0,1/21/2016,"I like Cheesecake factory but this location is so understaffed and under-managed that most experiences are somewhat subpar to other locations. I hate utensils placed on semi-wiped semi-dirty tables, I hate slow service. I hate being ignored by wait staff. I hate empties not taken away promptly.  The food was OK though the kitchen ignored my special instruction. This place needs more and better staffing."
Robert B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,152,77,5.0,5/10/2015,"We had great service from Cody, even on a crazy Mothers Day, where they were packed. We never felt rushed, and Cody made my mom feel great.  The food is always solid, and everyone in our party can always find something they like. I particularly like the brunch items, especially the Baja Chicken Hash w/Eggs and the Chicken Chorizo and Avocado Omelet."
Golzar S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/21/2016,"Came in today for lunch with a friend. We're regulars here but today, our server Rachel was the sweetest. She was so attentive and gave off the best energy. The mushroom soup was amazing as well. We loved her"
S P.,"Oxnard, CA",0,70,10,1.0,4/27/2016,"Wife wanted to go have dinner. I didn't want to go to the Cheesecake Factory. The food is like Denny's but twice as expensive. It's not about the money, I rather donate the money than eat there. But rather than argue the family went. Famous Meatloaf plate? It was horrible. No flavor, thank God they put Gravy on it. But the gravy tasted days old. My daughter tried the ratatouille, I was shocked! Lots of geese at the bottom. It totally grossed me out.  Asked for lemons with my Ice Tea didn't get till half way through eating. The server was very nice and polite! Only one good thing at this place, the Cheese cake, Nothing else!!!! Save your money donate to charity instead!!!!"
Youri Y.,"Oxnard, CA",734,529,863,4.0,8/15/2012,"First, my family planned to go to Ktown for KBBQ but it was derailed because of a rig accident on the 101. We were still stuck in HORRIBLE traffic in West Hills and decided to turn back in our 2.5 hour journey that lead us to the Cheesecake Factory in Thousand Oaks. I honestly haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory since high school before a Cirque du Soleil show but after reading a bunch of Yahoo! articles of ""EAT THIS NOT THAT"", I remember seeing the Cheesecake Factory as the ""NOT THAT."" Luckily, they offer a ""SkinnyLicious"" menu and I opted for White Chicken Chili. It was pretty good and the portions were plentiful. Also, the bread rolls they offer before we received our entrees were soft and fluffy!  One of the pros why I enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory was how late they opened till on Saturday night: 12am midnight :) I 'll be back for more and maybe try a skinny cheesecake if they offer it lol"
Mandrew Q.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,35,,2.0,4/4/2015,"I want to preface this by saying that I've worked at Cheesecake Factory before, so I am well aware of their standards and what a server should be doing. First, the server.  Her name was Jessica and she greeted us with a half hearted attempt at a fake smile.  I can tell she was forcing it and either she was having a bad night, didn't want our company, or something. We ordered drinks.  She gave me an attitude (verbally groaning ""ugh"") when i politely called her back to order appetizers.   It was dead and far from busy, yet it took her 8-10 minutes to bring back our bar drinks (after I had to remind her that we ordered them to which she replied, ""oh yeah"").  She asked my friend if he wanted another drink, but not me, although my glass was less than 1/4 full.  As i've said before, I used to work for this company and they trained us about this.   The food was okay, but the tex mex rolls were crispy and not as soft as I was used to them being when I worked there which was what I was expecting.  The Louisiana chicken pasta also didn't have that same hint of spice as to what I was used to.   Overall, just another experience with a seemingly entitled, absent-minded, non-serving......""server"".  I really wouldn't have cared about the food not being what I expected if the experience was better. The short female host in the front  with glasses (how convenient that I forgot her name) was much more polite and chit chatted with us with genuine smiles and all.  Her attitude was customer service.  Jessica's was not."
Jasmine C.,"Portland, OR",0,12,2,5.0,7/7/2016,"Tonight was the absolute best experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. I actually kinda hate these places. Every time I go to one no matter where the location (usually in the greater Los Angeles area) the aspiring actress of a waiter/waitress I have sucks, the food sucks, and pretty much everything else besides the damn cheesecake sucks. Tonight our server, Joel, was absolutely amazing. He was that cool server with an awesome personality who does everything perfectly and comes around just enough times. This is also the first time our food was actually bomb and not drowning in oil. I had the herb encrusted salmon with mashed potatoes and spinach. The salmon was cooked perfectly, I didn't even ask for lemon. My best friend had the Chicken Bellagio which was pretty awesome too. Overall, it was a great experience. I'll be calling in the morning to praise Joel because he was just the best."
Linda F.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,13,4,5.0,7/6/2016,"I always expect the food to be really good at The Cheesecake Factory, and it always is, but what is even more terrific is the great service I always get here.  The servers are the best!!  They certainly do great training here because all the servers  are super friendly, so kudos to this location especially for a job well done!!"
Karina S.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",30,2,,1.0,9/19/2016,"Hi I was there Friday night with a group of friends and let me just say the service was horrible. Drinks took over 30 minutes to arrive. Appetizers came before the drinks. Just to say this our night ended with a roach crawling all over the place and once we let the manager know all she said was ""It's just a baby roach""  stepped on it and pushed it aside like it was normal thing at the restaurant. Will never go again!!! Zero stars for this place but must select at least one."
Ingrid P.,"Moorpark, CA",8,9,1,5.0,7/27/2016,"We had birthday dinner here for my Husband the food was amazing! The ""adult"" drinks were great I personally recommend the Georgia Peach. The size of our party was 11 and included small children. Our server was so good to us, very patient, courteous, very professional, these guys work hard and they are human therefore error will occur which in our case the way the mistake was handled by the manager who personally came to our table was very much appreciated. This manager cares about his restaurant, his employees, and his customers. Thank you guys for making our experience so great!"
misbah s.,"Chicago, IL",61,183,78,4.0,5/19/2015,"Of course if you move out of Chicago and plop yourself in Conejo Valley, where else can you find a Cheesecake right down the road from you! So anytime, I mean anytime, I'm in the mood for a classic cheesecake with strawberries then I stop in. I don't make it frequently however, a girl has to watch her figure. Ordered the margherita pizza as well, yummmm."
john a.,"Oxnard, CA",2,36,17,2.0,3/6/2016,"For a birthday dinner last night, the little girl decided she wanted the Cheesecake Factory rather than her usual Wood Ranch so off we go to TO. It's the typical wait at this location, 30-45 mins on a Saturday afternoon, so we got our pager & waited. We get seated & our takes our drink as well as our food order since we looked at the menu as we waited.   The bread & drinks took a lot longer than usual to arrive, about 10 minutes, usually we receive both in about 3-5 mins even on their busiest day. We get our food, miso salmon, grilled pork chop, & I got the bang bang chicken/shrimp. At first everything looked good I start eating & it's delicious. But as I start to poke around, I noticed that I got the chicken but no shrimp to be seen. I call the waiter over to let him know of the issue, he apologize, but didn't offer to have the dish sent back to be remade. I continue to eat my dish as I hate cold food then 10-13 minutes later, he comes back w/ a little bowl of the tiniest shrimp you'll ever see & I was about half way done w/ my cold food as I had to wait for the shrimp. The shrimp was not the shrimp that comes w/ the dish, it was just sauteed in oil & seasoning, not the normal Thai sauce. To add to insult, the shrimp was completely overcooked & still had shells I had to spit out.   At this point I was extremely disappointed, as everyone's dish came out perfectly & here I was looking like an idiot waiting for the worlds tiniest shrimps. Although the server was apologetic, in no way did he correct the issue the right way. I was expecting the entree to be discounted or at the least a free dessert, but no, he just rushed the check to us & shoved us on our way as if nothing happened. On top of the check taking again an unusually long time, I had 2 gift cards I wanted to use & even then he screwed that up by charging the card w/ the most credit first so I'm still stuck w/ 2 cards instead of 1. If I wanted to, I could make all the dishes that were served to us today, but we go out for the dining experience. The food & the waiter are part of that experience, & today, both of those failed.   We will most likely come back as this is the closest CF in 50 miles, but I just won't order ""complicated"" dishes in the future as today tainted my experience for that."
Linda V.,"Sylmar, CA",19,15,,2.0,3/15/2015,"I'm writing this review because I was very shocked when I had lunch with my friend 3 Sundays ago.  I hadn't seen her in many years and we were catching up.  After our lunch, if the waitress came by once, she came by 4x to see ""if we were ok.""  Then, she removed some plates and then the bus boy removed plates.  They should have just said, "" get out, your time is up.""    We felt we had to go, so we left. Not what I would have expected and I should have called the manager.  So I put it up on yelp instead..."
Carla C.,"Sylmar, CA",44,3,44,4.0,5/30/2015,I want to start of by saying the service was almost perfect. We could of ordered an extra drink but our waiter didn't come around close to the end of our dinner. I had the Jamaican pepper shrimp and it was delicious. The shrimp was nice and tender but the sauce is what gives it its final touch!! This dish comes with black beans and white rice. There was a portion of the food overly cooked but wasn't that big of a deal. The restaurant is nice and clean and located in the perfect spot.
Frankie M.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",0,155,,4.0,5/20/2016,Great restaurant and atmosphere! Food was just as advertised with large portions and fair pricing. Got the chicken maidera. Came on a Friday night and wait and service took way too long. Parking is also horrible.
Tumeric T.,"Moorpark, CA",0,16,2,5.0,11/23/2016,"Cheesecake Factory gets five stars because it is professional and reliable.  The staff are skilled and professional, and the menu is broad but and consistently well-prepared.  I am most impressed with the Cheesecake Factory because it continues to innovate in a conservative way; my family has been visiting for decades, and they keep the beloved classics on the menu but also respond to the times and improve any weaknesses.  Hard to go wrong if you decide on dinner here--quality value and service for the price range.  As an aside, the headquarters for Cheesecake, which has locations throughout the world, is right around the corner in the Agoura Hills-Calabasas area."
Bahar S.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",36,94,61,4.0,4/13/2016,"This is the best Cheesecake Factory around! They have really great service, nice ambiance, and of course a delicious variety of food.  This location is way better than the woodland hills one.  It's my husband's favorite restaurant and he has tried a large selection of their entrees and loved all of it.  I always stick to the skinnylicious menu and it never disappoints.  Our favorite cheesecakes are Adams peanut butter and s'mores."
