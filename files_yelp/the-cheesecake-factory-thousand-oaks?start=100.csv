Carlos P.,"Newbury Park, Newbury Park, CA",1,5,,5.0,9/28/2017,"I ordered a Santa Fe chicken salad and must admit it was phenomenal and definitely worth every dime and dollar. I highly recommend this place to everyone whether your by yourself or with the family. I am telling you, you will never be disappointed trust me."
Natasha H.,"Ventura, CA",130,36,20,3.0,4/4/2017,"Our first time here at Cheese cake factory here in Thousand Oaks ... It was over all ok .. Are server needed to pay more attendant to detail.. For example; lemon in our waters, extra marinara sauce and serving our party food all at once.. We came to all eat together not to watch some of us eat.. I have heard nothing but amazing thing about this place but I was not impressed. Our server was Daisy .."
M. C.,"CA, CA",0,3,6,4.0,6/14/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is always great and the menu is almost overwhelming, but there are definitely a few favorite items that can't go wrong.  Single best thing on the menu is Avocado Egg Rolls, in my opinion.   This place is almost always busy with really long waits, though, especially on weekends.    The wait staff are generally fine, but have had orders messed up on more than one occasion.  They are always good about getting things fixed, though.   The cheesecake is, of course, fantastic.  It will end up being a pricey meal, though, after drinks, appetizer, main course and dessert with the cheesecake (probably the way they want it)."
Mr. D.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,27,3,5.0,1/20/2017,"They have a, please know that they have a bacon bacon bacon cheese burger here and it is orgasmic.  If you open the tender buns, there is bacon, and if you lift up the bacon you will see that, yes, there is indeed some bacon up under that bacon right there. Great joint. 5 star eating establishment."
Richard A.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,11,52,5.0,9/29/2016,"The filet mignon, cheesecake and service were amazing but the Buffalo blaster wasn't as good as it sounded. Either way 5 stars for the service and foods that I did like. I am definitely going again."
Jeanene I.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,82,22,3.0,3/26/2017,"OMG. They told me 25 minutes for my curbside order. I get here in exactly 25 minutes and expected that I would have to wait...but not another 20 minutes - 10 for my order and then 10 to get my card back. Seriously, WTF is up with the service at this place? Food was good - I always order the Chicken Costoletta and it never disappoints. The cheesecake is underwhelming though."
Rachel W.,"Ventura, CA",669,482,1475,4.0,11/3/2015,"I'm always coming up with Brilliant ideas, yet sometimes my execution of said brilliance can hit a snag when you have a bad habit of procrastination. All I can say is Thank you Cheesecake Factory bakery for coming through at the last minute. The restaurant was hopping as always, but the clerk up front was very helpful and filled my order for a 6 inch plain cheese cake which feeds about 4-6 peoples and rings up at $17.95.   Not to worry if you are concerned they are going to pull the display cheesecake out and sell it to you, they have them stocked in the back. The cheesecake was so creamy and everyone enjoyed a small piece, truly the amount is perfect for an after meal treat."
Ruby D.,"Los Angeles, CA",105,22,111,3.0,4/4/2017,My salad was A ok but my husband's steak was loaded with sodium!
Javier J.,"Santa Barbara, CA",622,448,499,4.0,11/1/2014,"The first time I went to a Cheesecake Factory I must have been around 16 and ran into Miley Cyrus..Hannah Montana Miley Cyrus. For a few years after I made this my bread and butter. This was the spot to take a girl on a date in my teens, then something happened, I don't know what..and I stopped coming here all together. Well I made my comeback and it was just as good as I remember it! When I got there I requested side by side seating regardless of the wait. It didn't take longer than 10 minutes before I got the confirmation text (no more vibrating pagers).  Eh the hostesses weren't too friendly but they didn't come off as rude either, just indifferent. Smile a little more!    After being seated ""Matthew B."" introduced himself as our waiter. He was friendly enough and never left us waiting long for anything we asked for! Food: BREAD: They bring you a basket with sourdough and whole grain bread (at least that's what I think it is) it's the dark one in the picture. Honestly if you're into the whole sourdough thing cool but my my my how I love the whole grain one. It's got a taste of it's own that it leaves you wanting more and more and more and more.4.5/5 CAESAR SALAD: The caesar salad was good enough for a side salad. The size of it was the smallest one yet 2 people are easily able to eat from it. A lot of cheese which is good because it helped it stay balanced with the dressing. Lettuce quality was fresh for the most part. 3.5/5 AMERICANA BURGER W/BACON: Ordered it medium and it was cooked to perfection! I really enjoyed my burger. The ""secret sauce"" added a good flavor to it..I added some bbq sauce to it too which went well with the whole bacon aspect of it. 4/5 FRIES: These fries were good. Nothing worth hyping up but a tad bit better than the fries that accompany a burger at any other chain restaurant. Their ranch is good so if that's you're dipping sauce you should be left satisfied with them. 3.5/5 CHICKEN PICCATA: The chicken was meh. A bit dry and needed to be more lemony. But the pasta was great! It was cooked well and the sauce and herbs came together nicely to give a satisfying taste. 3.5/5 Drinks: STRAWBERRY LEMONADE: It's the must thing to order if you don't plan on having alcohol in your system. It's a good strawberry lemonade. The sugar around the cup is always a good touch..if you are really trustworthy of the dishwashers of course! 4.5/5 Alcoholic Drinks: Don't judge me on the selections, I can drink ""manly"" drinks too..I promise. GEORGIA PEACH: This is one of the best frozen drinks that I have tasted in my life. It was really really really really good! Matthew recommended it and it didn't disappoint. The raspberry swirl gave it that edge that put it above average. Must order!! 5/5 MAI TAI: Ehh too sweet. That's all there is to say. Avoid it. 1/5 Dessert: CHEESECAKE WITH GLAZED STRAWBERRIES: It was good. The cheesecake wasn't extremely rich but it didn't taste like your average vons cheesecake either. There are sooooooooooo many options to choose from so I shouldn't have gone too conventional here but I did. Either way it was a solid dessert. 3.5/5 I like this place. It was 74$ for everything mentioned above. Which is more than fair considering their portions are big! I saw a lot bad reviews for their customer service which wasn't bad to me. You just have to be more wordy I suppose. They get busy so just let them know what you expect from the beginning and there shouldn't be a problem with your experience there. I'd say their service was okay overall though..definitely something to improve upon. I RECOMMEND picking booth seating regardless of the wait..it's just more intimate and it lets you feel like you're in your own private area.  Go to the Cheesecake Factory at least once if you never have. Their menu is full of options. I'm glad I came back. It was kind of like when you see that ex after a few years and you realize how hot she is and hit yourself on the head for letting her go. I'll definitely try to integrate The Cheesecake Factory more into my restaurant rotation. Even more so now because I'm sure Miley Cyrus is past Cheesecake Factory's..which is good..means better odds that licking that sugar off the strawberry lemonade cup is less dangerous!"
Elsa H.,"Oxnard, CA",93,20,2,5.0,5/3/2017,This is one of mine and my boyfriend's favorite restaurants to go to. We live 30 minutes from thousand oaks but we're always willing to make the trip for their hospitality and great food! Their fried mac n cheese is a must have. The amount that you pay for the quality and quantity of food is totally worth it.
Tracie L.,"Oxnard, CA",0,18,2,5.0,3/22/2017,Who doesn't love Cheesecake Factory. There is something for everyone. I started coming here many many years ago. I started off ordering the Meatloaf and ordered that for a few years then I began ordering the Baja Chicken Tacos and ordered them every single time for the next few years. I then decided to move on to the Crispy Chicken Costaletta (OMG...Amazing) ordered that for like the next year or so and now I am absolutely hooked on the Miso Salmon. Unfortunately I never really get around to dessert because the portions are so big but I do have to say the red velvet cheesecake is awesome.
Joey T.,"Simi Valley, CA",217,455,77,3.0,11/29/2015,"Every time someone wants to go to the Cheesecake Factory I just kinda moan and roll my eyes.  Sure it is a reliable source of slightly better than average restaurant food (I like to think of it as classy Chillys) but I just feel like it's a boring safe choice and people are not being adventurous enough.  My latest cheesecake factory trip was more of the same. A silly long wait, food that feels over priced, me eating all the bread I can to try and compensate for the price, and then me regretting getting the cheesecake as I waddle back to the car.  I really just come for the cheesecake."
Cassie C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",102,104,58,5.0,7/29/2016,"How can you not like The Cheesecake Factory? Huge menu for whatever you may be craving, and great desserts. Most menu items are a huge serving size so you'll have enough for two meals. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is one of my favorite menu items. This place gets pretty busy on a weekend especially at prime time, so expect to wait. At least you can walk around the mall and get a text to your phone when your table is ready. Bar seating is first come first served so feel free to stalk people out as soon as they leave their table in that area if you're lucky enough!"
Snow S.,"Newbury Park, Newbury Park, CA",21,27,1,5.0,4/24/2017,"We had a late lunch there on Sunday their menu is huge with a tremendous number of options. I had the chicken tostada salad which in the dinner size is enough for two people it was huge and delicious. It was also nice to go someplace where they would refill your Diet Coke without you having to ask for it all the time,  anybody walking by would say hey can I feel that for you that was really great."
Dana O.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",58,2,,4.0,4/21/2017,Food is always great here. Whole family always finds something to eat here. The only reason I gave 4 not 5 stars is the wait. Other than that it is great. Pretty scary now that they have the calories printed on the menu. I have to order of the Skinnylicous menu lol. The shrimp tacos are great on this menu!!!
Jillian V.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,14,4,4.0,3/29/2017,"It's a good place to eat, it's always been my kids favorite place to go. But today, I used their app (cake pay) and the order taker wasn't paying attention to my order. Then when I picked up my food, the lady who assisted us, seems like she wasn't informed that a kids meal comes with a drink. I ordered 2 kids meal along with another entree, she said take out DONT come with drinks. But I said it's on my receipt do you wanna see? She insisted it doesn't come with it. Fine, I said so no drinks but is my cheesecake in the bag too? I said I claimed a reward for using cake pay and she seems like lost it's on my receipt. She said it doesn't come with it until another guy helped her. Omg..."
Andy R.,"Nipomo, CA",22,271,26,4.0,11/18/2015,"My wife and I had lunch after shopping. We ordered crab bites and the Asian chicken salad. While we loved the six crab bites the chicken salad was a disappointment.  The chicken was tasteless and fairly dry, akin to yesterday's chicken. The salad was also lacking in dressing.  We told the waitress to let the kitchen staff know the chicken was below par.  After refusing a redo (due to time constraints) we requested the bill.  Our server said the restaurant ""comped"" the salad as it was not to acceptable standard.  Very professionally done. Kudos.  The Cheesecake Factory turned a FAIL into a SUCCESS."
Katie M.,"Camarillo, CA",1,44,41,2.0,8/20/2017,I understand Sunday is busy - we patiently waiting 40-45 min after church- seated and waited again for a long time for service - ordered simple lunches soup/ salads/ sandwiches. Waited. 3x we were offered the wrong meals from the wrong table. Finally received our meals - Wrong items on all plates. Eventually received our food. Soup taste canned. Meals blah. Unless your going for Cheesecake to go  I would avoid this restaurant- not worth the hype!
Erin R.,"Camarillo, CA",0,13,1,1.0,12/29/2016,"The food was burnt, the fries were cold and the salad didn't have dressing.  This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to.  After my third complaint to the assistant manager, she said, ""The best we can do is comp your iced tea"".   Oh boy! Free iced tea!!! Meanwhile I'm forking out $15 for a burnt sandwich I'm not going to eat. Well guess what T.O. Cheesecake Factory? The best I can do is dine at Lazy Dog instead."
Ma R.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",10,55,5,1.0,1/2/2017,Never Again Coming Here!. Simply HORRIBLE!! We ordered a few dishes and my son's dish was completely drenched in oil. Servers Lack on being able to multitask and serve multiple tables. Not only did we have to wait 45 minutes to get seated but the service was completely unacceptable and horrible. My son couldn't eat because the server never came to check up on us just see how our food was.. not once did they refill our drinks. Definitely not coming back. very dissatisfied.
