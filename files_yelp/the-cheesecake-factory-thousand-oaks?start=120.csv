Frank H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",15,3,,1.0,9/3/2017,"Ordered 1 simple meal and 2 Skinny appetizers and 4 cheesecakes for Curb pickup. Was told order would be ready in 20 minutes. Waited 20 minutes before starting the 10 minute drive. Called while at the curb. Told that bags were ready and would send them out. Waited another 20 minutes and asked if the order was ever going to be delivered to curbside. Told ""Let me check on that."" After 5+ minutes of listening to restaurant noise hung up and called again. Then told that the order was ready but since they were busy it would be a few minutes. After another 5+ minutes I called and stated that in 2 minutes I would drive off. Within the 2 minutes the order was delivered. Young lady delivering the bags noticed that one of the ordered cheesecakes was incorrect and she took it back inside to exchange along with credit card. In about 5 more minutes she delivers the correct cheesecake and credit card bill. First time in years in the tip area I wrote ""EXTREMELY SLOW SERVICE"". When I got home, my niece checked the 4 cheesecakes. Only the cheesecake that was exchanged was correct. Niece took the incorrect cheesecakes back to the restaurant and spoke to the female manager. When my niece returned home with the correct cheesecakes she had NO KIND words about the manager. No apologies for the screw-ups.  I don't patronize restaurants often and will not patronize this restaurant again."
Melissa H.,"Simi Valley, CA",3,18,,2.0,8/13/2017,"Everyone knows and loves Cheesecake's food and oversized portions. Had to write this about some of the worst service I have ever had. Ordered chicken pasta for pick-up to drop off for someone working at the mall. Chicken pasta- ready for pick up in about 20 minutes. Great! Wrong. 30 minutes later they give me tacos. What? So I explain I ordered the pasta. The guy at the pick up window literally said to me, nope you ordered the tacos. Actually, no I ordered pasta. No apology no nothing-just ""so do you want them?""  In a snotty tone with rolled eyes. I'm not kidding. It gets even better. I had promised to bring cheesecake home so I went back and ordered 2 pieces to go. Well, when eating it, it was still frozen! So, for $40 I got frozen cheesecake and three tacos I didn't even order. I could have overlooked it if there would have been any level of customer service. So-hate to say it-love the factory but this location seriously lacks customer service. Seriously disappointed."
Nat L.,"Malibu, CA",7,29,48,1.0,1/28/2017,Horrible among other cheesecake franchises I've been. Dishes always greasy. Seats nasty not clean. Food is cold. And I even got sick from their wine had to go to emergency room after all. This place is runned poorly by whoever is in charge of this place. Feels like in one of the poorest countries dirty and greasy. Very sad.
Alissa R.,"Ventura, CA",579,157,291,4.0,7/22/2015,"My sister and I ordered 6 appetizers to split. Calamari, stuffed mushrooms, avocado egg rolls, mushroom-avocado-zucchini fries, crispy shrimp, and another one I can't remember. It was a TON of food. We were surprised by how large the appetizer portions are. Stuffed mushrooms were good. Calamari was great. Skip crispy shrimp.  Service was great!!"
Dolly T.,"Westlake Village, CA",6,35,,5.0,8/13/2016,"We had an awesome experience last night!  Our waiter Joel K. was so patient (and busy).  We had a wonderful time, got their at 5:30 on a Friday night, just before the mad rush, and had no problems being seated!  But look out, when we left... We could barely make our way out!  It's worth waiting for, if you l like consistency and ""awesome"" cheesecake!  Oh, and the Happy Hour is pretty kewl too!  Cheers!   ;-) Thanks for making our experience an awesome one Joel K!  :-) Best,  Dolly"
Gala A.,"Westlake Village, CA",145,516,225,3.0,12/2/2015,"My mom and I came here forever ago!  I remember we wanted to eat a fun meal so we decided to eat here.  They have an ""inside"" patio since you're still in the mall but outside of the restaurant. I remember wait staff being not very attentive. Be warned, if you're going to eat at the Cheesecake Factory, it is going to be an experience rather than a meal.  I consumed so many calories ... from fried mac and cheese balls, flatbread, and even a salad... The cheesecake from the cheesecake factory is always tasty and caloric.  It's a real treat, especially my favorite: the oreo cheesecake."
Leanne R.,"Camarillo, CA",45,45,6,5.0,7/24/2016,"This is our usual go tinplate for appetizers and dessert.  It was total chaos (as expected at 530pm on a Saturday). We waited 40 minutes for our table, which we asked for inside.  After we were called up, we had to wait another 10 minutes as they only had a table in the mall lobby.  We accepted a table in the bar (not as bad as we expected- we don't drink and don't usually are to be around sloppy bar patrons).  Ryan was our server, he was attentive and our food was brought out hot and look freshly prepared.  We love the avocado egg rolls!  Since we were short on time due to the table mix up, we couldn't order dessert as we had a movie to catch at 745pm We are always amazing at how efficiently this restaurant works with so many tables and guests that they can accommodate."
La L.,"Oxnard, CA",178,17,15,5.0,1/15/2017,I come here from time to time and must say they have the best customer service ever... every time I come they always greet me with smiles and of course I come here for the desserts yummmy!!!!
Tony C.,"Oxnard, CA",563,23,3,1.0,11/20/2016,"Way to Kill my Vibe...With my group I tried to order a Cocktail, Mule to be exact. So she carded me, no problem I'm 37 and have my ID, no big deal. Then a few minutes later the Manager came and asked for my ID again and Took my ID? Wth, then I guess after investigation the girl returned with my ID ten minutes later. I just canceled my drink, the vibe was way killed. I felt awkward in my group like I was doing something wrong?!! Wack"
JenFred G.,"Saint Vith, Belgium",2,12,20,4.0,8/17/2016,"As usual, good food and good service! The mall can be a little loud sometimes so sitting on the patio is a nice alternative. There was no wait for outside seating which was surprising since this restaurant seems to have a wait no matter the time of day or location. I have yet to order an entree I didn't like or a cheesecake that didn't impress me. I love the 30th anniversary!!  Still remains one of my favorite chain restaurants."
Sarah G.,"Bakersfield, CA",80,20,33,1.0,12/30/2016,"We do not have a Cheesecake Factory in Bakersfield and many people I know tell me I have to go there, so while in Ventura my Husband and I went for lunch.... big mistake.  After a 25 min wait to be seated we ordered the pizza and salad.  My husband ordered the everything pizza and I ordered the Margarhet pizza.  My pizza tasted horrible like boxed Chef Boy R D pizza.   I would have rather have had a Digiorno pizza at home than to have spent money on this meal.  My husband didn't like his either he said it was somewhat better than mine but he couldn't eat it either.  We left very disappointed in our meals! The waitress was very busy  there wasn't much communication there."
Inez A.,"Oxnard, CA",56,4,2,3.0,7/30/2017,"Food and service was good. The floors were super slippery, I almost slipped and fell  a few times before I made it to my table. Some of the staff laughed which I'm sure it was funny... but come on, can you please clean the floors properly with some clean water before someone gets hurt."
Private I.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,,5.0,7/18/2016,"Alright I just got in from dinner (7-18) we sat on the patio and I have to share the wonderful experience I had. I gotta preface this by saying I've worked as a server at Cheesecake Factory AND Rock Sugar. So I get it, I get it all. It's been years since I've worked for this company, and the food is still the best.  Everyone was great but there were a few things that really stood out and are worth mentioning. First was our busboy. I think he had blue eyes and a lite beard- he was gorgeous. He worked hard the entire night, lighting different heaters (which most people don't recognize is a pain) but his movement was just very graceful. He should be working at Mastro's. He even offered to box up my food for me, which I thought was a nice touch and a surprise. Never in my 4 years of working for that company did a busboy offer to box up food for one of my tables.  I mean, he really should be serving. Come to think of it, watching him, he probably was a server but just working a bus-boy shift for the night. I wish I would have found out his name, but if a manager is reading this, you'll know who I'm talking about. Also, I noticed another server from inside the restaurant came out to help with the heaters and I thought that was a surprise. If i recall the restaurant isn't a pooled house, so that was nice that he took time away from his work to help out.  If I wasn't out to dinner with my parents- I would have definitely got the name for my busboy crush."
Great Pizza Places P.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",16,82,460,3.0,6/5/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory seems to always be packed.  It is located at the Oaks Mall near the entrance by Stacked.  Call in ahead to get your name added to the wait list.  Friendly young staff, decent food, and nice decor.  The drinks are usually good, though a little overpriced."
Cynthia L.,"Los Angeles, CA",504,61,70,4.0,6/10/2016,Went to the one by the Westlake mall and cinema cuz it's open very late; till Midnight yaaaaay! Good chicken pasta dish lots of garlic very yummy :-)
Phillpe K.,"Oak Park, CA",7,69,71,5.0,8/29/2015,This established eatery in the Mall is about as good as it can get. Staff...... Great Food..... Reliable and good Breakfast... Great Large menu and a nice place to wait to be seated. You can't go wrong here. Brenna is great as a hostess.
Leslie D.,"Oxnard, CA",2,62,2,1.0,5/31/2017,"On April 29, 2017, we had a family birthday dinner at the Cheesecake Factory in Thousand Oaks.  I called ahead to see if I could make a reservation for 8 people.  I was told that I couldn't.  I asked about ordering a whole cake to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  They described the sizes and varieties that are available as a whole cake.  I was told to tell our waiter when we arrive that we want a whole cake.  When I arrived about 40 minutes early, I spoke to one of the managers in the bakery.  He told me that they need a 3-4 hour window to prep the cake.  When I asked what that means, he said that the cakes are frozen and would have to defrost.  We were at the Cheesecake Factory because my daughter wanted cheesecake for her birthday.  When it was time to serve the cake, they served us frozen strawberry cheesecake.  I complained again to a manager who tried to pacify us by taking an appetizer off our bill.  How about taking the cake off the bill?  Since it was still frozen, most of us took it home to eat.  I don't expect to go out of my way to eat there again."
J K.,"Goleta, CA",1,14,10,2.0,11/26/2016,Went there for lunch on a Saturday.  We waited about 30 minutes to be seated.  The service from the restaurant was much better then my previous visit.  Everyone seems friendly and fast. Our waiter Ryan was great and attentive!  Food was good as well.  We were so full so we decided to order cheesecakes to go on our way out.  The service from the bakery counter was poor and slow.  The lady and another guy just ignored us and took their sweet time to chat and sign in/out the cashier.  I would give four stars for the restaurant but I took two stars off due to the service I received from the bakery counter.
Dominick T.,"Kirkland, WA",7,18,24,4.0,7/4/2015,"It was busy, but we were able to get a table for 7 in less than 5 minutes. The cheesecake is always good and they have an amazing variety, hence the name Cheesecake Factory. They have every kind of dish you could want so it makes for a great place for whatever you are craving. The waiters and service was a little slow and didn't come at the right times, but the food is pretty good."
Noam A.,"Rockville, MD",68,13,5,5.0,1/7/2017,"I was there yesterday, the service was amazing. I got big meal and delicious desert. There is a nice vibe. I really recommend to go there"
