Mabelle R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",65,3,1,1.0,7/30/2016,"This is the worst cheesecake I've ever been to. I've been to a lot of other ones and loved them but the service at this one was horrible. We were told we'd be waiting one hour so we waited. After one hour we were told we'd be seated in a few minutes but ended up waiting for another 40 minutes only to be disappointed. We were told that the table we were supposed to sit at was ready but we waited to be seated for another 20 minutes so we ended up leaving. When we told the staff they didn't even bother to apologize or justify anything.  Very rude, unprofessional staff, horrible service."
Vatche K.,"Los Angeles, CA",142,64,116,4.0,2/24/2016,"Growing up I have always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I have been to many cheesecake factories before and I am a fan of how big their menu is. It's almost endless! And I'm not just talking about their cheesecake menu. This cheesecake is conveniently located right at a corner of the Thousand Oaks mall. You can shop while you are waiting for a text for your table to be ready so I think that is pretty cool. The service at the place is very good and I really need to mention a waiter here that is probably one of the best waiters for Cheesecake Factory in general. His name is Joel and this guys knows the menu inside and out. My friend and I always ask for him to help us because not only he is so attentive he makes us laugh every time because he describes their specials and food and desserts in ways that he is on some food network showing off his masterpiece. He has been working their so long he said he not only has tried everything, but he literally knows every single ingredient in every item they have there. Ask for Joel"
Dave S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,180,36,3.0,8/3/2015,"If good sex could be a taste...a slice of their raspberry white truffle cheesecake would be it.  I was offered a job at the Woodland Hills CF in the late 80's during college. It was a go to place. The one in Thousand Oaks always seems crowded and still provides the massive menu options. There are so many available entree's you end up making a Sophie's Choice between 3-4 tempting plates before settling into your selections. There is always a nagging feeling that you may be missing out on something else you skipped over. I have always been partial to their Jambalaya. Always satisfying. There is always a wait, and even though this restaurant theme is a little dated, it's always a good meal."
Gregg A.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",29,14,1,2.0,9/7/2016,"Both the wife and I went for dinner, plenty of food to say the least . I had the turkey club with sweet potatoes fries. I was half way done with the sandwich before the fries came out. The waiter substituted regular fries in its place. Nice jester but still got charged for the upgrade to sweet potatoes fries. My wife got the half sandwich with soup and salad. She was not able to finish the soup which wasn't touched and wanted to take it home. We were told there was no container to take the soup home in and as a result went home without it. There was no compensation offered and we left. I have been here many times over the years And have watched the service become very poor. The waiter should have realized how dissatisfied we were."
Sam C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",225,7,,5.0,6/8/2016,"I ordered from Cheesecake Factory through 'Door Dash' and one of the items I ordered seemed to be tampered with  I called Cheesecake to ask if I could order the item again and come pick it up but the manager didn't have me pay  That was very much appreciated!  They clearly caiter to customer satisfaction, and they succeed! Thank you CF!"
Charles C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,4.0,1/14/2017,The food is outstanding although lately the dinner portions are not as large as they were in the past so if going to lunch I would not order a diner portion at this specific Cheesecake if your very hungry. The bread is great and some of the waiters/waitress are Great some clearly  do not want to be there!!! Usually there are a couple of waitresses that are rude but are good servers but the last person had it right on the service is Very spotty. You would think with Corporate out here and so close that they would get some nicer servers to at least make me pretend I am important. The lines can be very long to wait. The deserts are excellent. Very fair prices. The managers are excellent so don't be afraid to speak up and they will take care of you!
Chris K.,"Newbury Park, CA",1,13,1,2.0,9/27/2016,"The chef working today must be trying to quit or something because it's obvious they don't give a **** Let's see...burned crab cakes half the size of what they used to be without any chunks of crab like it used to have. The fried crab bites appetizer I had from Cheesecake Factory by my girlfriend down in Artesia the other day seriously had larger chucks of crab in it than these. Those were good, yet the actual crab cakes here were pretty tasteless and overcooked. The other dishes our party had included avocado toast. I guess that's still technically correct since they burned the ends off of it similar to the crab cakes. I'm told it was really good last time we were here, but even the toppings are different too. Last time it had watercress and this time it had arugula which was a big disappointment for the person who loved it last time. The Butter Roasted Carrots and Pecans were actually just steamed carrots without pecans. I guess they fixed it when asked at least though the carrots  were obviously still not roasted. The Shepherds pie was good, but smaller than before as well. I'm not too picky about food and I really hate complaining about it or trying to send anything back in a restaurant, but honestly I am probably going to go home and make some Costco crabcakes for myself right after this. All in all we were all inclined to believe the issue lies with the particular chef tonight since the food was good in the past so  we might be back to give it another shot, but damn it was abysmal this time. If you can provide me with the schedule of the chef that thought this food was OK, I would be happy to stop by again on a night they are not there."
David A.,"Calabasas, CA",55,32,13,1.0,6/3/2017,If you want to order take out go to any other restaurant. I called in my order only to be told that they no longer have the Chinese Chicken Salad on the menu. I ask this person how is that possible since it is the number one item they sell and he says he does not see it. I ask him to ask a manager but he just puts me on hold and gives me the same incompetent answer. I now have to go into the restaurant to place my order and waste another 30 minutes of my day. When I get to the take out counter the first or second salad on the menu is the Chinese Salad. I tell the manager on duty what happened and she did nothing. They have no clue how to take care of their loyal customers and figure that they are already busy enough so why should we care if someone is not treated the correct way. It cost too much to go out to dinner and there are too many other restaurants that get it. Go anywhere else.
Michael B.,"Los Angeles, CA",95,26,9,2.0,9/24/2016,This used to be the place to go unfortunately that's no longer the case the portions and quality of food gone down and there have been a few occasions where he we have come home and felt sick if not actually gotten sick in particular my son Cheesecake Factory used to be a regular fare it no longer will be we will be avoiding in fact maybe it's still the place to get a good piece of cheesecake but I don't even believe that's the case anymore sad to see this iconic restaurant has gone downhill
Wendy T.,"San Fernando, CA",115,22,14,1.0,9/10/2016,So I order chicken and biscuits. Everyone got their orders. I waited an extra 20 min till my food came. They only brought me chicken. They forgot half of my meal and made me wait another  20 min
Anna W.,"Oxnard, CA",1370,37,48,4.0,1/28/2016,"The name says it ALL. If you're a fan of Cheesecake(who isn't?). Then I would definitely recommend this place. They've got the hugest variety of Cheesecakes. And there menu for food is not too shabby either. Along with a full bar,and cozy indoor and out door seating you can't go wrong."
Garrett S.,"Moorpark, CA",0,4,,4.0,1/3/2017,Great food. Great service. Ate WAY TOO much butter and bread. Don't make the same mistake that I did.
Hope M.,"Camarillo, CA",9,23,6,2.0,8/19/2016,So you guys want me to pay for food that is already discounted? No thanks.. And it only took you guys almost 2 months to respond... I stand by my previous review
Yaisha L.,"Camarillo, CA",8,2,,4.0,7/4/2016,Sunday July 3rd. My self and seven of my friends went to Cheese cake factory to celebrate my birthday. and our server was Kristen who was the best ever. Our service was great we all ordered something different and all out food came at the same time which made our lunch very special to say the least. And by the way we all requests separate checks which was not and problem for her. She could not have been more gracious and accommodating. We never had to ask for service. She was always   There. And by the way we really enjoyed all of her kindness. And her Pleasent smile.
Jeff B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,11,,2.0,6/30/2017,"Reviewing the 'shrimp scampi' only.  Certainly non-traditional.  The shrimp, while of good size, were BREADED, and thus disappointing.  The tomato, basil & roasted garlic sauce was nice but again non-traditional.  Nicely presented, but when expectations are not met, you'll always come in second best."
Erin K.,"Ojai, CA",320,1396,10421,3.0,6/13/2014,"I wanted to give this 4 stars, but I just couldn't.  Came here today because the place across the way was too crowded and Cheesecake said they could seat us ""immediately.""  Immediately ended up being about a five minute wait, waiting on the server to seat other guests in line ahead of us (I guess it meant a table was immediately available, whether or not they could get us into it that fast).  Anyway, our server was fantastic.  Josette was friendly, with an upbeat attitude.  She made sure our drinks were full and brought us table bread quickly and a refill when we were out.  The table bread was heavenly and I probably could have just eaten that all day.  The rest of my food...  The corn tamalle cakes were great, just as ordered.  The fried mac n cheese balls were a total waste though - like most places, they fell short by overcooking the pasta.  It was barely a different texture than the hot cheese. Gross.  Also these mac n cheese balls were WAY too much cheese.  Taking one in half you could barely pick out the pasta visually.  It just looked like all melted cheese.  Fried coating was tasty though.  I ate 90% of one and got a to-go box for the other three.  :( Chocolate Mouse Cheesecake was good.  Rich flavor, but not too sweet.  the best part was the dark chocolate shavings on top.  When I finally got to those, they really made the flavor pop. They should have included more of those and maybe the whipped cream only on the side (on top it totally overpowered the chocolate shavings). Overal okay experience but the mac n cheese balls really turned me off and made me not want to ever have them again.  The rest of the food was good, but for the price, I am not sure how often I will come here.  Great service though!! Josette gets five stars from me!"
Amber H.,"Goleta, CA",57,20,25,5.0,4/26/2016,This place is soo good the alvacodo eggrolls were amazing and the carbonara was the best I've ever had my fiance and I loved this place.
Erika B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",146,36,15,2.0,8/1/2016,"The food was great this last time, but I can't say the same about the service provided by Danielle N. To start off, the patio was completely open because it was early on a Monday evening. However, the host tried to seat us right in between tables that were so close to other guests we might as well have been eating together. My friend requested politely to move just a table over to give us and the tables besides us a little more privacy since it was very slow and quiet. We got major attitude right away. Being in our early 20's, Danielle N immediately judged us rather than treating us kindly and providing decent service. She did nothing special to make us feel welcome or enjoy our dinner, not even a smile. Being a waitress myself, I know what good service is. This was piss poor. My friend asked that her salad that came with the entree to be boxed up to go when we ordered, but Danielle clearly didn't listen because she had the entire order boxed so my friend had to ask for a plate. Danielle didn't even recognize her mistake or apologize for it as she watched my friend move her entree from a box to a dine in plate... She also was extremely unprofessional and laughed when refilling our water glasses because of something a coworker had said. Have some class and compose yourself before walking over to a table. I've never left such a poor tip in my life, but I've also never had service like that. This review is to let Danielle N know I wasn't just a cheap college kid, I was a pissed off guest who should've been treated better."
B P.,"Columbia Falls, MT",0,1,,3.0,6/18/2017,Been going here almost weekly since they opened. Food and service have always been very good but the last three times I've been there the service has not been good. 30-45 minute wait after we ordered our food.  They expanded the seating. Maybe the kitchen can't keep up?  If it continues the way it is I won't be going as often
Keith P.,"Fillmore, CA",45,270,221,5.0,12/31/2015,"It is really hard for me to give a chain restaurant 5 stars but I couldn't find anything to complain about and the food was amazing.  Most chain restaurants have a generic taste because they deal with bulk items or things that have been flash frozen but not here. My waitress was super attentive and kept my son's drink glass full despite his endless thirst (6 refills).  I never had to ask for anything and the food came out lightning fast and delicious.   My favorite dishes are the Jamaican black pepper shrimp and the Jambalaya,   As for the cheesecakes, I am still undecided because I am working my way through the long list.  So far they have all been amazing."
