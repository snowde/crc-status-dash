Kylee V.,"Stockton, CA",0,7,1,5.0,6/12/2016,"A freaking mazing. Thank you Ashely and Kylie for being fantastic servers. We had a great experience from the door to being seated, even when we were leaving. Our drinks were always full (a common problem in service now a days) and we were checked on at all the right times. Upon leaving we even decided to purchase a 6 inch cheesecake to go! Thank you to the entire staff of this location for helping us end our vacation perfectly."
A. L.,"Camarillo, CA",0,10,3,4.0,5/2/2017,"Love the food here and always great service! It's always a treat. But last night we came and I have the cake pay app so I looked at it and it said I had a reward for free cheesecake, awesome right? Wrong! They try to make the CakePay app so complicating to use and probably just so they don't have to offer the rewards! My boyfriend and I went with his brother and his wife and the servers and manager made a big deal about splitting the bill using the app. Seemed like they just didn't want us to use the reward for the free cheesecake. Why promote the app if you're not going to want to use it because it is ""too difficult.""  The manager was not being helpful at all and the server just seemed like she didn't want to bother with the app. If I didn't make it a point for her to use it she would of shrugged it off and not cared for me to even try to use it! Tip: Lose the app or learn how to use it!!"
Jules B.,"Los Angeles, CA",371,178,536,3.0,2/17/2015,"At the mall, Cheesecake Factory is a good choice (if one is shopping and ya don't want fast food)...  Went here on Valentines Day with my family and this place was incredibly busy! I give it 3 stars for: 1) Bringing decent food to the mall 2) Our server, Dylan, he did the best he could on a busy day (okay, and he's hot)  3) Free bread ..it's rare to get free anything now a days...  4) OMG, the cheesecake! I got the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake... YUMMAY!"
Jeff K.,"NEWBURY PARK, CA",0,8,,2.0,11/12/2016,"Good food, of course, but the wait is ridiculous. I'm also convinced they mess with you if you come in with kids. (Less profit) I called from the parking lot and was told there was a 20 minute wait. 30 seconds later I walk in and the smug little punk at the counter tells me it's now a 40 minute wait. Then, get this, the very next group behind me he tells them ""20 minute wait"".  Not going back- ever. Life is too short."
D G.,"Camarillo, CA",0,3,,4.0,6/5/2017,Ordered cheesecake to go and it was delicious! Very fast curbside delivery. Will definitely come back!
Jara Neriza M.,"Ventura, CA",137,194,357,1.0,2/21/2016,Unbelievably slow service even though I just wanted to buy a whole cheesecake to go. Blah.
Jerry S.,"Simi Valley, CA",92,67,74,5.0,3/18/2016,"We came on a Friday Night! We ordered the Santa Fe Salad. The first time around the dressing was lacking the Cilantro dressing. We told our server who later brought the manager John D! John, was simply amazing. He took care of us and brought us a brand new salad. The second salad was simply Perfect! The Manager John D turned our meal from OK to Great! Thanks John! We'll be back very soon!"
Jae E.,"Ventura, CA",0,4,12,3.0,5/30/2016,I was there last night with my daughter for her 25th birthday dinner. We had one of the sweetest servers and she was very polite.  My daughter had a few cocktails and we had appetizers. The food was also very good.  Towards the end of our meal another patron came in and sat behind us. I could tell that she was making our server a bit nervous and the staff was on edge. The patron kept asking my server for small tedious items to satisfy her every whim while running her excessively.  Next thing you know the manager walks towards our table and ask me if we have a question.  I ask him for two togo boxes for our appetizers but we would like to see the menu for cheesecake. He asked me if I'd like to take that to go.  I told him no.  I would like to complete our dinner there and how it was my daughters birthday. He made us feel rushed!  Shame on him.  It was my daughters birthday!!
Kathryn P.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,3,2,1.0,5/1/2017,"Literally the worst take out crew ever. They can never get my order right. If I want to order take out, I HAVE to come in so I can check my order because I know something will be wrong and it will take them ten times as long to run back and forth from the curb side pick up. Not only do they get things wrong, but one time I had to wait 10 minutes just for them to slide my card when I was using curb side pick up. Why don't they just ask for my card on the phone? It's very disappointing because I love the salads for lunch when they are correct. Please get a new take out staff. I've held my breath for too long. I just called to order lunch and was on hold for the bakery for 8 minutes without anyone even answering and saying please hold. Serious incompetence"
Yonnie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",95,1972,1916,3.0,1/4/2014,"This review is only for cheesecakes sold at the cheesecake counter right in front of the restaurant. We've been here twice, and both times were for the cheesecakes! We've ordered the following flavors: (1) Tiramisu cheesecake - I used to get this cheesecake often when I was young and when I ordered it again last year, it was just OK. Flavors were decent, but the cheesecake wasn't as moist as I remembered it.  (2) Banana cream pie cheesecake - my husband's family enjoyed this cake (can't comment much about it because I didn't try it!) (3) Vanilla bean cheesecake - tastes just like vanilla bean ice cream (but it's not frozen cold).  Servers at the cash register are friendly and nice in helping you prepare the cakes to-go!"
Kelly F.,"Camarillo, CA",284,235,762,4.0,12/11/2015,"Although the wait on a Friday night can be anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour, once you are seated you forget all about it. The bread arrives warm at your table and enough to satisfy your hunger pains from the wait. The menu has so much variety and everything I've ever had tasted great. They serve butter with the bread, but try asking for a side if the garlic aioli it's so incredible.  I usually fill up on bread and drinks so  I go to my favorites like the deliciousness of dynamite shrimp or stuffed mushrooms.  My friends ordered the macaroni and cheese balls which were also fabulous. I get that we all have our own opinions, but since this is all about my opinion I'm going to say that I just love the food here. I've also had the cheesecake  (plain, red velvet, peanut butter, etc) and each one was also fabulous. If you do not like to wait then get out of line and go somewhere else because I'm just dying for my buzzer to go off so I can cancel my diet and dive in."
Kevin K.,"Santa Clarita, CA",21,9,13,5.0,3/27/2016,"Wow great service.. We were seated immediately upon arrival with no reservations and the waiter (Joel) was very knowledgeable and helpful.  This is how dining should be...great food, great company and fantastic drinks. Kudos"
Katrina P.,"Ventura County, CA",174,92,172,4.0,6/29/2016,Big restaurant located Inside the mall. Very large selection of items on the menu for you to choose from. I normally just come for the cheesecakes. Their food portions are huge!! But I think the butter and garlic pasta with shrimp was pretty good here so I ate as much as I could and took the rest home. The downsides are long waits for a table and finding a waiter  to check up on you.
Patrick N.,"Philadelphia, PA",155,433,533,4.0,12/28/2014,"You can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory no matter what time of day you go. I can confidently say this since my most recent visit was for Sunday brunch and was very satisfying.  I got the bruleed french toast, which was a definite winner. The only downside was the classic Cheesecake Factory portion size. These two huge slices of french bread were good, but with my lack of self-control, I finished the entire thing. The exterior was perfectly crunchy and the inside had a heavenly custardy interior.  My brother got breakfast potatoes on the side of his eggs and bacon and I'll have to agree with his assessment that they looked and tasted like they came straight out of a freezer bag and into the deep fryer. Make of that what you will, but I've had much better breakfast potatoes elsewhere.  I was impressed with the price, you could easily spend just as much at Eggs n Things 10 minutes away as you could here."
Cindi P.,"Chatsworth, CA",10,57,12,5.0,9/15/2016,"Had a great dinner with our friends.  The waiter was very helpful and funny! I had the Steak Diane.  It was super! I got the mashed potatoes that came with it, my friend substituted the Mushroom Soup.  The soup was fantastic.  I would go back just for that! Potatoes were good, but I'm not a potato fan. My husband and hers had a shrimp and pasta dish.  Both were good.  Had a great Mojito on Happy Hour $5.95. A long time since I've been here.  I'll be back soon.  Lots of good things on the menu"
Bees W.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,9,1,5.0,4/26/2017,Went for lunch today at an off time around 2:00. The server was very accommodating to the kids and the staff was a well oiled machine. HUGE compliments to the busser he was on top of it. My glass was never empty and he paid special attention to my son. Keep him around he's a huge attribute to your team.
Eu Gene G.,"Camarillo, CA",9,6,2,5.0,9/18/2016,Great food and great service. Even the cheeseburger can already make your day. My wife and I keep coming back to this restaurant. Keep it up!!!
Dee V.,"Ventura, CA",0,21,3,3.0,4/16/2017,"So i went in today to buy some cheesecakes, and we were looking for the ones we wanted , I was ready to order there was 3-4 workers at the register they were just talking to each other not one looked up at me or said will be with u in just a minute so RUDE bad customer service , so I said can I order or are u guys busy then they finally said something to me this place is good but the service was horrible today !"
Melissa B.,"Fountain Valley, CA",197,253,92,5.0,2/14/2016,"My friend and I came last night and had a great experience. The wait was a bit longer than they had originally told me, but it's okay.  Our server recommended the Georgia Peach drink and it was amazing! I loved my salad and she loved her chicken and pasta. We ordered the salted caramel cheesecake to share, which was also recommended by our server. I can't remember his name, maybe Michael or Matthew but he was so great! Really attentive and on top of things!"
Jon F.,"Simi Valley, CA",113,73,,5.0,12/4/2015,"I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but this one is BY FAR my favorite location.  Our server Cody was OUTSTANDING.  He accommodated our diva orders and was very on the spot with drink refills, dressings, and other special requests throughout the meal.  The Regional Manager John was even there tonight and took the time to say hello to us and make sure we were enjoying our meal.  This location gives a very personal feel that you wouldn't regularly expect from a very ""Corporate"" restaurant.   In short...  I'm a fan!!  :-)"
