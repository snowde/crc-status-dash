Serenity A.,"Bakersfield, CA",5,96,147,2.0,8/7/2016,Great location adjacent to mall. Fried mac n cheese was delicious. Salad yummy. Steak tacos were lacking meat n dry. Service was good but we ordered a cheesecake to go for the road and come to find out there was NO UTENSILS. UGH. NOT COOL
Jennifer Z.,"Oxnard, CA",93,10,12,5.0,4/2/2016,"Best place ever! Although it's always busy,  the staff is very attentive and the food is delicious! If you're really not up for the wait nor the loudness, ""to-go"" is the best option."
Jill D.,"Newbury Park, Newbury Park, CA",0,5,,5.0,4/23/2017,"Love this place!  We eat here so much that most of the servers know us!   Most of them are top notch.  There is so much variety and the food is great.  The bread is delicious and the cheesecakes are sooo yummy.  Sadly, they have removed a few of my favorite dishes from the menu over the years.  Please bring back the Thai chicken pasta!  But they are always adding new dishes as well.   Their Chinese chicken salad is my favorite lunch item.  And the Chicken Madeira is amazing!   My whole family looks forward to having the peppermint bark cheesecake in December!  We can't wait til the new patio opens!"
Cher E.,"Agoura Hills, CA",20,8,3,3.0,3/30/2016,"Been coming to this place for years and always enjoyed the service and food. Waiting for table can be long sometimes from 30 min to one hour. Ordered my favorite usual lettuce wrap with chicken satay etc. As I was about to eat second lettuce, noted that all lettuce had dirt and we're not thoroughly washed. Notified waiter who immediately took food back.  I did not escalate to manager (not my style to make a scene when it comes to MY food being prepared by someone else, and trust me when I say I speak up under other circumstances). I was pleasantly surprised that manager, Johnny, apologized and even  comped my food which of course is greatly appreciated. Thanks again Johnny! We remain loyal customers to cheesecake factory. Note the rating is 3 stars because of dirty lettuce but 5 stars for service and how manager addressed the issue is warranted."
Baleria M.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,18,6,5.0,9/6/2016,"There was so many options i did not know what to choose so our waiter Luis gave me a recommendation to get the crispy chicken costoletta  . It was soo delicious, it comes with mashed potatoes but i got it with angel hair instead. It definitely did not disappoint and it was a large portion."
Jason V.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,11,,5.0,11/23/2016,"I have never had a bad experience at this place!! Last time my server was Bryan, he was very enthusiastic and you can tell he was excited to be there"
Sherri P.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",61,47,165,4.0,7/31/2016,"Food and service was good. Little loud, but inviting and comfortable environment. There is always a line to get in though. Plan on waiting at least 30 minutes for your table."
Leah O.,"Simi Valley, CA",71,171,72,3.0,10/30/2015,"My last 2 experiences here have been subpar.  The quality of food and the service at this location are sliding. the newest salted caramel cheesecake was underwhelming and the ch ages made to the fish tacos is terrible. Braised red cabbage does not belong on fish tacos. While I know I will be back, I feel that this location needs to reevaluate their food prep and service skills."
Alissa F.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,12,11,5.0,2/27/2016,"Always long waits for table,  but well worth it. Day day was amazing dinner was grate ! Everything was delicious. Can't go wrong with cheese cake factory."
David S.,"Oxnard, CA",1,24,22,2.0,6/21/2016,I ordered the hot wings appetizer as my meal and it tasted old and over salty. Food was not very good.
Jacy V.,"Atascadero, CA",44,29,26,4.0,9/1/2015,"As far as chain restaurants go, this one is my favorite! I was a little turned off by their 27 page menu, but got over it pretty quickly. They obviously have a lot to choose from, so everybody at your table will be able to find something they like. They have everything from hamburgers, to spring rolls, to enchiladas, and so on.  I went with the stuffed chicken tortillas (that's fancy talk for enchiladas). The portion was huge, I ate about 1/3 of my meal and took the rest home for midnight snack. It came with corn cakes which I always love, this is probably why I even chose this dish in the first place. It also came with black beans, that were alright, I mean they were just black beans.  After lunch my husband and I split an Oreo cheese cake. Ooo baby that was good! It was also huge, but don't fret...we managed to finish it all.  Service was fast and friendly, we got in right before the lunch hour rush.  I don't normally go to chains because the food to me isn't always fantastic. But Cheesecake Factory is definitely an exception!"
Robyn C.,"Simi Valley, CA",202,233,421,4.0,7/30/2014,"This is one of the nicer restaurants at The Oaks Mall. Yes, it is a chain restaurant but the food is good. The menu is quite extensive and there are plenty of items to choose from, including a separate ""Skinnylicious"" menu with some lower calorie/lower fat items. I have tried several items on the menu and I have been pleased with all of them. The cheesecake is delicious and there are several different varieties to choose from. I usually order anything with chocolate. The service here is great. The waitstaff is attentive and makes sure that you are taken care of.  The one place that needs a little help is the front check-in. This area tends to get crowded and they call you for a table but will make you wait another 5 minutes or so to get seated. It causes a bit of a back up in the front area. Parking at the mall can be hit or miss. It depends on the day. This restaurant does get crowded but the wait isn't usually that long as there is also outdoor seating and a small mall patio area."
Jessica H.,"Moorpark, CA",5,47,48,4.0,7/27/2016,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here a few nights ago. I should say that I have worked in the restaurant industry for many years and a lot of that has been in fine dining restaurants.  Of course, Cheesecake Factory is not ""fine dining,"" it's a great restaurant.  We lucked out and didn't have to wait for a table. We were seated right away. That almost never happens.  My boyfriend ordered some kind of steak RARE and it was definitely MEDIUM. I ordered a passion fruit mojito and I'm almost positive that they forgot the alcohol! It was good but I paid for vodka! However, my garlic noodles with shrimp was really good. Our server was nice. Not too attentive because I didn't get a chance to ask about my drink or my boyfriend's over cooked  (for his liking) steak.  Like I said, I've been a server for years, so on one hand, I hate to send anything back but on the other, I deal with it when I'm serving.  Overall, not a big deal. We still had a fun night out and we will be back. Maybe next time I'll sit at the bar and watch the bartender make my drink!"
Ashley P.,"Valencia, CA",0,38,10,5.0,7/25/2016,"We had Andrew D as a server and he was awesome.  Very personable and genuinely friendly, felt like we were talking with a friend.  The food per usual was great and the host was funny telling us jokes as we waited for our table to be cleaned.   Great job cheesecake of TO!"
Stephanie G.,"Carson, CA",0,7,,5.0,2/21/2017,Definitely always a good time when I come here no matter what the occasion is they always treat us so good and the food is always delicious. my favorite is the warm bread with butter ! This place is a most def must.
Jo M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,177,,5.0,12/4/2015,"Good food and fast service. Cheesecakes are delicious--try the banana cream. Best of banana cream pie and cheesecake and perfectly sweet. No artificial banana flavor. For food, I love the white chicken chili and the shepherds pie and other home style favorites."
Kellee M.,"Torrance, CA",0,34,4,5.0,8/1/2016,"My boyfriend and I eat here at least once a month, the service is never bad,the wait times aren't ever very long for a table for 2 . My boyfriend is gluten intolerant so for us to find great gluten free buns,pasta and the Godiva flour less cheesecake in one place is like hitting the jackpot! They even have a gluten free options for the sweet corn cakes which is amazing!"
Steve T.,"Camarillo, CA",60,8,,1.0,6/10/2015,"Had an experience at the cheese cake factory in the Oaks Mall that I have never experienced at any other Cheese Cake Factory.....EVER!   While waiting to be seated, I was waiting for approx. 5 Mins while a staff of 4 including a manager took a dinner reservation.  Once completed, I was stepping towards the counter when another customer stepped in front of me and informed the staff she had a party of six.  As the staff quickly gathered menus to sit this party.  I informed everyone that my party was there first....and was told they did not see me.  I am 6'4 260 lbs and was wearing a bight yellow shirt....Hard to miss, I guess. As the staff was giving appoligies to the other party, I asked, ""Why would you appolige to that party and not me for being overlooked?""  Never was one given.     Once seated I waived the manager down and informed not only was I ignored but I was not acknowledged.  When the manager then informed me that hostess was not a hostess...she was a server,  Its not her fault.  She further stated, ""any you called her a name.""   NOT TRUE....and if you are going to back your employee and discount your customers because of their skin tone ....soon you'll have nothing but employee's and no customers. Think twice before eating at this establishment...but if you do go I hope you have the same server I had.....great table service and the cheese cake was great....too bad the public skills of the manager don't match!"
Elite M.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",0,254,,3.0,9/3/2016,lots of noise.. slow service but waiter smiled... pasta too salty didn't ask if you want refill of bread..must I ask? miso salmon was excellent would I go back yes but very PRICEY
Stan C.,"Henderson, NV",135,379,201,5.0,6/21/2015,"I have eaten at many Cheesecake Factory outlets. But this is the first time I have come to the Thousand Oaks Cheesecake Factory for a Father's Day brunch. We got here at 11:30 AM. To my great surprise, no problem getting a table. We chose to eat outside and got the table under lovely tree. Because it was Father's Day, I decided to go to heck with myself and ignore calories and potential health consequences of the meal. My wife and I decided to share the Bruleed French Toast and the Chorizo Avo Omelet. The French toast consisted of two large pieces of bread that were each about an inch thick. It came with syrup to put on it, but the syrup really wasn't needed. Even without the syrup, it was rich and sweet and incredibly delicious. By far the best French toast I've ever had. I came into the restaurant really hungry, and by the time I finished my half of the French toast, I could've quit eating for the rest of the day, it was that filling. The omelette was also really very tasty. However I was so stuffed from the French toast, I was barely able to eat half of my half of the omelette before I had to stop. I brought it home and will have it for breakfast tomorrow. Sitting on the outdoor patio when the weather is this perfect is an ideal way to have a brunch. And the service at cheesecake, as usual, was excellent. This certainly was a 5 star brunch experience."
