Dev L.,"Ventura, CA",517,56,17,3.0,7/24/2015,"I love cheesecake and I love artichoke. When they are out of what you want, it's definitely a mood killer....  And I understand how busy it gets, so the wait is fine, but maybe when it's like that and things are running out, compensate somehow! It's good customer service! But, no worries, I hope next time they have it! Be back soon! :)"
Sydney S.,"Santa Rosa Valley, CA",151,12,5,5.0,5/21/2016,"I am unable to come here often, living on a college student's budget and all, but I believe the prices here are backed up by the amount, quality and taste of the food, especially the desserts! My boyfriend and I came here for dessert and the Oreo Cheesecake is absolutely amazing. The service was a bit slow, and it may have bothered hungrier customers, but we were only there for dessert and it was a very busy time, so we didn't mind and gave them the benefit of the doubt. I'm mainly writing this review because our waiter, Patrick M, was absolutely amazing. He is hands-down the best waiter I've ever had serve me at any restaurant. He was very friendly and would check up on us several times (we were taking forever to decide on a dessert, so many great ones to choose from!), and when I saw another server walk by with a delicious looking cake, I asked Patrick to scope out which one it was, and he happily went to the other side of he restaurant to do so for me, and it ended up being that beautiful Oreo Cheesecake I enjoyed so much. Thank you, Patrick M!"
Alexandra M.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,27,,4.0,12/27/2016,"Love the Cheesecake Factory! I love how extensive  the menu is, and despite how busy they are, I always have a reasonable wait time.  However, the online menu really needs to be updated. The version I kept finding has things that do not exist anymore which makes it hard to do an over the phone order pick up in store.  I had to make the guy wait a couple minutes on the phone while I scrambled to find another choice.  PLEASE funnel it to the top to update the online menu! For a chain this big, there should be a quick response time to update the main menu that pops up when you google. Thanks!"
Celeste A.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",20,79,21,5.0,7/27/2014,"The food is amazing i normally get overwhelmed with such a long menu at restaurants but truth is everything i have ever had at The Cheesecake Factory has been amazing. I have never had a bad experience. My favorite dish would have to be the Louisiana pasta. It's spicy and amazing. Also, make sure that you give the Buffalo poppers a try. Amazing shredded chicken buffalo crispy, crunchy goodness.  The piña coladas are also a good pick. Always hits the spot."
Skylar C.,"Hurricane, UT",0,2,,1.0,6/11/2016,We got  mac and cheese balls and they were extremely burnt and my entree Louisiana chicken had very burnt and crispy chicken. Not satisfied with this Cheesecake Factory. I have tried them in many locations but this is by far the worst.
Carl P.,"Oak Park, CA",0,17,1,1.0,5/1/2016,"It is not easy to screw up pasta, but they did. I ordered simple Pennie pasta, with basil, tomatoes and garlic. I got a plate of hard noodles that tasted rubbery, canned tomatoes on top, a basil leaf stirred  in and two pieces of boiled chicken strips. Oh, I forgot to mention zero garlic. Ordered St Francis Cab, got house red (waitress said was exclusively made for them by Berringer). Next time I visit I will order what they do best - pies. Hard to believe the corporate headquarters is right down the street."
Joan J.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,3,2,4.0,5/18/2016,"Hi there, so this is my first comment here in yelp . I ate at the cheescack factory and it was a lovely experience. The food is always good and i really like to eat there. The only thing that bothers me is the fact its really dark inside. Besides that it was very nice."
Randy B.,"Westlake Village, CA",4983,2338,4473,4.0,12/1/2014,"Expectations always met: great drinks and great big portions.  You can't beat it.  You know what you're going to get.  (PS.  As Yelp'ers, we like a little mystery and tend to go to boutique places) * Bread & Butter: It's free!  Amazing and usually warm, a dark bread (like squaw) and a baguette.  More please!?! * Large menu / large food: Pages and pages of selections, and always leftovers.  Each plate is 2-3 portions.  My favs: Chinese Chicken Salad, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Famous Factory Meatloaf, Chicken and Biscuits, Orange Chicken, Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms, and Chicken .  Ultimate favorite?  Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. * Great appetizers: Try the Parmesan-Garlic Cheese Bread, Avocado Eggrolls, Tex Mex Eggrolls, Ahi Carpaccio, and the Fried Calamari.  I nearly like the apps more than the food. * Cheesecake: galore!  My favs are: Carrot Cake Cheesecake, White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake, Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake , Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake, Snickers Bar Chunks and Cheesecake, but my absolute fav, Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel Cheesecake.  (note: I repeated the word ""Cheesecake"", because I can't get enough of it.  Cheesecake!) =========================== What makes this location unique? =========================== * Service: always nice, always well-trained.  Management is excellent if you ever have a problem or issue (or several!). * Wonderful patio: not great.  Sits on the parking lot. * Valet parking: not available. * The wait: Always, and expect at least 45 mins. It's worth it."
Marc R.,"San Diego, CA",0,33,,2.0,11/5/2016,"This place was a disappointment. To be fair, I'm not a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory but their food is usually decent. On this night we had a bad experience. Despite having a good size group, it took about 45 minutes for the food to come out. Once it came out, one of our group had a. As Chicken Piccata that was missing nearly all of the flavor. When we informed the server she didn't apologize but merely grabbed the plate and walked away. When a new plate came out it was better but still missing flavor and missing the capers. It was a real shame. The server became defensive as if it was our fault. I only give this a second star because the manager came out and apologized, twice, was sincere by taking the meal off the bill."
Karen H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,23,1,5.0,3/29/2015,"Great service, did not have to wait for service at all. The food was amazing and came very fast with a smile"
Holly R.,"Coeur d'Alene, ID",46,115,129,5.0,12/18/2015,DELICIOUS! Always love cheese cake factory and this is just another location. Never been disappointed and the waitresses are always super helpful and suggestive which we love.
Yvonne B.,"Newbury Park, CA",2,14,2,4.0,4/14/2016,"The food was exquisite as always. The host's were very polite, though i wasn't to pleased with my server. He was not very attentive to my table. But overall two thumbs up to the delicious food."
Lior M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",76,9,2,4.0,6/8/2016,"I love the food and the service so much, and it's also not so expensive you people can definitely come with all your family,my recommendation for good meal it's the salamon fish..enjoy"
Starr M.,"Camarillo, CA",93,38,35,5.0,5/4/2015,"We ordered appetizers instead of entrees because they're just so damn good. This is the Firecracker Salmon, it's spicy salmon rolled in wonton paper and fried on the outside with a sweet sauce on the side. This picture serves no justice. Also got the crab bites! Super good!!!"
Kimberlee M.,"Moorpark, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/14/2016,"We  went out for lunch, and it was packed of course...so then we sat out side,so we had to move inside because there was a foul smell by the drain..We had to wait again to be seated inside..That was so darn wrong..So, then we finally got seated and we ordered 2 Chinese chicken salads and 1 bowl of Chili.. Well, the food came and my sister's salad was made wrong and the chili was ice cold needless to say it took 45 minutes...Ok, and the service was really poor, had to ask the waitress 3 times for extra dressing for the salads and 3 times for the sour crème for the chili....This is the location in Thousand Oaks, CA  ;-(((((((((((("
Claudia B.,"Simi Valley, CA",1069,1230,6273,5.0,8/9/2011,"Going on a weeknight sure beats out going here on a weekend.  No waiting.... at least at THIS location.  The only reason I'm updating is because I see that I forgot to list one of my favorite dishes (in my initial review), and I just had it again last night......it's the pan-seared salmon.  It has great flavor with the capers, a light lemon-butter-wine sauce with mushrooms, and it's served with fresh spinach and angel hair pasta.  I just love it, and it's one of the lower-caloried items on their menu.  I didn't say LOW.........I said lowER..   We also tried some lentil soup, which I had never had there in all the years I've been going there.  Like most everything else about this place, it was very tasty.  I love lentil soup. My husband and I were going to share an order of their strawberry shortcake until I read their calorie/fat content, and it upset me so much.......that I went home and had sugar free ice cream instead.  I know, so not an equal trade-off, but I felt so much better.... as in GUILT FREE... as opposed to how I would have felt if I had eaten that strawberry shortcake.  I foolishly thought that because it was a bunch of fresh strawberries with ""some"" shortcake and ""some"" ice cream, oh, and ""some"" whipped cream, it was going to be one of the lowest calorie items.  WRONG WRONG WRONG.  It was just shy of 2,000..........I mean REEEEEALLLLLLY?  Over 1/2 of the cheesecakes WERE LESS THAN THAT.  Perhaps my mind has slipped into a bit of denial if I thought that THOSE ingredients weren't going to be that bad.  This is just so depressing."
Megan E.,"Agoura Hills, CA",93,94,173,4.0,12/9/2013,"Cheesecake factory will forever be my favorite dinner place. The bread they serve in the beginning is so yummy-sometimes I find my self craving the bread only! Service always differs, one day ill get a very happy & attentive server and another I'll get one that visits my table maybe once or twice (after the initial order placement). If you are a pasta lover you have to try the Farfalle pasta. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G ! Wasn't really a fan of their ceasar salad, it doesn't have the classic caesar taste (maybe it's the dressing) Overall, Cheesecake factory is amazing! - and their manager Massimo is exceptional as well! They are open till 11 PM as well. Best cheesecake: white chocolate truffle raspberry"
Robert S.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,10,,4.0,7/5/2015,"Lots of good things about this CF, cleanliness is NOT one of them.  We always forget until we sit down in the last customers mess and try to find silverware and napkins without chunks.  Doesn't make sense..."
Dora B.,"Simi Valley, CA",430,261,736,4.0,10/2/2014,"I love this Cheesecake Factory location because after a day of shopping, you can go grab some lunch/dinner here.  I would say most people come to Cheesecake for their cheesecakes, but I actually come here for their Kobe burger.  I was on the hunt for the best burger and I would say this is definitely in my top 3.  The burger is really flavorful and the patty is juicy.  Try it and you can thank me later for it."
Erika B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",6,12,2,5.0,1/11/2016,"What can I say? Well I have been coming to this place for almost fifteen years. It's my goto place when it comes to dinner. The atmosphere is always light and enjoyable. One down side is the parking being that it's at the mall, so at times it can be a pain to find parking. (But that's not a deal breaker) The customer service is out of this world. They always cater to my needs. My bf thinks I am a pain in the ass when it comes to ordering but they never seem to mind. They always cut my chicken littles in half and make them well done just like my request. That's my favorite meal there. I have eaten just about everything on the menu but yes the chicken littles are my goto. Some might say I am a creature of habit. The waiters/waitress are very knowledgeable about the wine they have as well and great at recommended which wine would go with the meal of your choosing. I will continue to come here because well let me be honest it's my favorite place to eat in Thousand Oaks.  Lastly try the egg roll appetizer it's so so so good."
