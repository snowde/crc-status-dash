Julie D.,"Oxnard, CA",145,318,1209,5.0,10/11/2013,"I've been here numerous time over the years. Every visit has been pretty good. Tonight's was exceptional so I felt compelled to praise the staff. From the moment we were greeted to when we were seated then assisted, every person we encountered was just so kind and accomodating. Special shoutout to our server Chanel K. We actually just came in for dessert, but she was so convincing that we ended up ordering entreés after she recommended chicken madera and bang bang chicken. The garlic sriracha was so good. Thank you again for the excellent service."
Makenna C.,"Camarillo, CA",287,71,42,3.0,9/17/2015,"We have been here many times and the service is usually great and food is ALWAYS delicious, but last night it took someone about 15 minutes to get our drinks. We both got water and 1 glass of wine. Our server brought the waters and said he'll be right back with the wine. Well about 10-15 minutes later our food was out and no wine. So we asked the lady who brought our food if she could check on it and it seemed to be a VERY hard task for her, she sighed and had a very obvious eye roll. I get it, people get busy. But it was about 5:30 when we sat down and from the looks of the place it wasn't that busy. Disappointed in the service."
Evelyn G.,"Ventura, CA",26,5,,1.0,11/15/2015,Got the shrimp angel hair pasta. Disappointed paid $20 for just pasta and only 4 shrimp. Never going to eat here again.
Chantel B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,25,2,1.0,4/19/2017,"We eat at this particular Cheesecake Factory 2-3 times a month for dinner and lunch 3-4 times a month. Tonight, our order took FOREVER to come to us, even our server James offered us a cup of soup because it was taking so long. (We declined the soup). When our dinners finally (FINALLY!) arrived, my husbands sauce on his Meso salmon was cold, like directly out of the refrigerator, it had hard chunks  of solid butter in it!  When our waiter finally came back, my husband asked for them to warm the sauce.  James took the plate away .... 10 minutes later he returned with the same cold plate with the same cold sauce and now cold salmon and cold rice.  My husband asked him to just take it away and would eat at home.  The manager walked over and inquired, not really caring a bit.  Mr NO Personality.  They sent us home with desserts as an ""I'm sorry""??  Funny guys there at Cheesecake Factory .... packaged the desserts (banana cheesecake had a hair in it!) with both desserts packed upside down in the bag.  We just tossed them away at home and my husband had a frozen TV dinner.  Not the best dining experience tonight.  Will we return? ..... dunno"
Ariyana R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,41,,1.0,9/25/2016,UGH. I am cursed to have to eat at this location! Unfortunately for me this location is convenient for pick up and often times I am forced to pick up food from there simply due to the fact that there are no other options. That being said- this location is horrible. Every time I do pick up something is MAJORLY wrong with it. This is the second time in a week that they COMPLETELY messed up my order. Even worse the managers do NOTHING ever to fix it. AVOID.
Simon H.,"Castaic, CA",0,63,8,4.0,3/7/2016,I have never had a bad meal here although it gets crowded fast! i first went to the original location next to the former galleria (former mall in the valley). This place serves huge portions so if you want cheesecake you might want to share haha!
Monique F.,"Simi Valley, CA",24,30,8,4.0,1/29/2016,"The boy and I have been on a Philly Cheesesteak kick lately and the one here is SO yummy! Of course it doesn't compare to the actual ones in Philly (which we love) but this ""California Cheesesteak"" is pretty darn good! Try adding avocado to it! :)"
Lake F.,"San Diego, CA",0,42,1,5.0,4/11/2016,"Always busy. It is a popular place to eat on weekend. It is situated inside Oaks Mall, a beautiful setting.  Delicious food with a large portion. Will come back."
Vivian C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",356,29,329,5.0,10/19/2014,"This restaurant opens until midnight and famous for their cheese cake.         A thoughtful, warm, informative service is on top of priority for us to choice a restaurant after a long hours working day especially on weekends. Luka Mentzer was a fantastic server, knowledgeable, very patient and help me to decide what should I order.  It's very hard to choice from an extensive menu if you don't come here often.  Compliment to the bartender tonight. Strawberry Martini is terrific and ultimate Margarita was really loose me up and I ordered a small plate: fried crab-cake bite, appetizer: Warm Crab and artichokes dip taste creamy which is too rich to late night. Dally soup: Also creamy potatoes soup and Garlic Shrimp with Angel-hair. All seems American comfort food plus Italian pasta. We ate too much wheat table bread, very delicious. Last drink Passionfruit Martini was a perfect ending. With tip the bill sum it up $100. Not a bad idea..."
B. Z.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,17,,3.0,10/2/2016,"I know there are a lot of Cheesecake Factory fans, but I find the food mostly mediocre... I eat here frequently for business and there are a lot of choices, but it's such a large chain the food ends up being adequate but not great (at least for me).  Very crowded, usually, and decent service."
Jeannie A.,"Ventura, CA",28,73,18,5.0,2/20/2016,"We were in for today for early dinner. Our servers name was Louis. He was the best server we've had in a long time. He was very personable and knowledgeable.  He had the answer to every question we had and always had a smile on his face. He was more than happy to give recommendations as well. Besides the food being awesome, the service is what will keep people coming back!"
Ryan K.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,20,,1.0,9/8/2016,"I don't get the appeal of this place. Somehow it is still always crowded, probably because of the sparse amount of restaurants in the area. The menu is massive and you can tell by the bland taste that the kitchen must be overwhelmed by the amount of different items it has to make. After reading their novel of a menu that ranges from Chinese food to Italian food, I have trouble remembering what genre of food they are supposed to be. I have tried so many dishes and have yet to find one that is decent. After emptying your wallet at the end and returning home, you are reminded in the bathroom of the terrible restaurant choice you made. At least their free bread is good."
Jennifer B.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",0,8,,1.0,3/31/2017,"My favorite restaurant has disappointed us one too many times. The past four times we have visited, something has gone wrong. Twice we were quoted an hour wait, only to end up waiting closer to 2 hours to be seated. We decided to give it one last try tonight and I was so excited when the buzzer rang on time- only to find out they had put in for 2 instead of 4 people and our wait continued. We were sent raw salmon on one trip, then totally overlooked ahi the next. When we requested the ahi be cooked properly, they said they ran out of ahi and couldn't accommodate us. On another trip we ordered a shrimp and chicken dish, with not a single piece of shrimp on the plate. We have been to other locations multiple times and the food, service and ambience has been consistently flawless. The Thousand Oaks location needs to really step up their standards. There are clearly significant management issues here. We won't be giving them a 5th chance!"
Victoria R.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,9,,3.0,9/25/2016,The food was just ok. My meal was luke warm. Service was good. I will say my husband and I were seated in the room inside by patio and I saw a medium size roach run across the floor under the table. It kinda grossed me out. I think this place should call a pest company asap!!!
A C.,"Camarillo, CA",0,31,2,2.0,2/7/2016,"We r lovers of Cheesecake Fact...but last night (sat) was awful. Our female server was rude. Ordered a Moscow mule & it was served in a glass; not a copper mug. I was surprised as that is what it's supposed to be served in...when I commented to the server she seemed irritated! I explained it didn't taste right & would like another drink. No apology, nothing! An attitude actually. She grabbed my drink & walked away. Wow! This is the service we get...my food was subpar. Chicken was cold. Why send it back & have another snide interaction w/the server. I will say she was attentive...but could have been nicer, friendly..."
Carlos G.,"Camarillo, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/27/2014,"Horrible experience!  Tried to check in to be seated hostess were rude! Stood in front of the hostess stand for about 15 seconds before I was being acknowledged. We asked to seat in the patio because we have a 4 year old and a 10 year old, I didn't want my kids to bother any other customers. The hostess sat us in the patio, it was crowded. My wife's chair was pushed against a tree and my chair was next to another customer. I asked the hostess to help move the heavy table so my wife and I could sit down, but she didn't say a word and walked away. My wife decided we should leave she was very upset! We are a Hispanic couple and I don't known if that has anything to do with the way we were treated. We are never going back there again. Carlos"
Anonymous C.,"Long Beach, CA",4,25,,5.0,5/21/2016,Its been a long time since Ive eaten here.  When I would I would sit at the bar and Anthony was my server and bartender he is the best bartender ever!!!  He handles everything with grace and efficiency what more can I say.  He makes the best drinks too.  If hes still there please give him a raise if possible.  If I were a restaurant owner I would hire him full time with benefits and meals!!  Food quality is good too.
Jenny M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",14,6,,1.0,7/31/2016,"If I could rate my experience on Friday lower I would! I was having lunch with my sister and a friend. I ordered the luau salad, it comes with 2 large wonton crisps on it. As I took a bite I thought I got a big piece of the crisp and started to chew,it felt odd so I took it out of my mouth only to discover it was a large chunk of GLASS!! Our waitress came over immediately and apologized and told us there was nothing she could say to excuse the glass and she took it away. The manager then came over and got all of my info and said someone would be calling me. They offered me a different meal and I said no I was to scared as I just poked my lower jaw with a piece of glass. My meal was taken off the bill, the other two girls had leftovers and didn't want to bring them home and risk getting glass in their food. I've been come to this restaurant a handful of times and it's been ok. But having glass in my food is inexcusable."
James N.,"Tavernier, FL",75,29,13,3.0,7/8/2015,"The wait is never too bad, the food is never too bad, and the service is never too bad. My only gripe is the poor menu. It has advertisements taking up entire pages, rather than photos to highlight their food. I find myself meandering through the menu, imagining what the dishes could look like. Which is fine if you only offer 12 dishes, but with their wide selection, you are better off hanging the menu on the wall and throwing a dart to make your choice. And maybe the lighting at night, could definitely use a few more lumens in there!"
Megan M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",5,45,14,5.0,6/16/2015,"This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory location. I always receive excellent customer service, even when the restaurant is extremely crowded. My favorite items on the menu are the Macaroni and Cheese Burger and Red Velvet Cheesecake. I come here with my boyfriend for virtually every special occasion and couldn't be happier."
