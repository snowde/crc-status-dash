Walt S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,59,,3.0,2/8/2016,"Service here can be absolutely terrible or quite good.  It is a crap shoot.  Today, it was the latter.  My girlfriend wanted to have the Bang Bang Chicken that many are raving about.  It was not on the menu.  You have to ask for it.  I tried some of her dish and both of us wondered what was the big deal.  It wasn't that great.  The sauce was a peanut/curry(?)  blend and was way too sweet. I had the Baja Chicken Hash.  Outside of the fact that the eggs were raw and runny (egg white was not cooked), it was pretty good.  I think the eggs were supposed to be poached, but was not. I am not sure exactly why we continue to go there, as we did not even have a slice of cheesecake.  Oh yeah, the not so good coffee was $3.00.   I think I will try to find another Sunday brunch establishment."
Lisa S.,"Camarillo, CA",1,37,7,1.0,7/5/2015,"Ordered catering for an office lunch last week. Specifically asked the manager what the dimensions of the catering pans were and how many pans per entree, etc. I told him we were feeding 25 ppl and he assured me that the order we placed would feed up to 32 ppl. I then gave him the credit card information to run the order. When the order was being picked up the person helping us said he never ran the credit card. It's a corporate card so we had left it at the office. Had to call the office and give the card number again. Now we're running late for the lunch and by the time we got back and set everything up it was 15 minutes past the scheduled lunch time. We also realized then that in spite of the reassurances about the amount of food, we weren't going to have enough!! One of the entrees we ordered was fettuccine alfredo with chicken. It came in 2 small pans that were only filled an inch high even though the pans were over 3 inches high. There were maybe 10 pieces of chicken in each pan. The fettuccine dish alone cost $80!!!  I even called the manager back and told her we weren't going to have enough food and that the pans weren't even full and she just said we can order, pay for and then pick up more food. Um, no thank you, never again.  Way over priced for what you actually get!!!!"
Steve C.,"Westlake Village, CA",15,29,40,4.0,8/26/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a fun place to eat at.  They have lots of variety and I've been pleased with the quality of the service and food.  I DID enjoy the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad most recently but used to use the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp as my go to menu item.  It can get quite busy, but they manage to staff themselves appropriately so that the wait that you experience as a seated customer is not offensive.  I appreciate that."
Cindi R.,"Newbury Park, CA",178,349,64,4.0,12/28/2012,"*** This review is for my experience ordering cakes only -  not for the restaurant *** After a couple years of ordering birthday cakes almost exclusively from Nothing Bundt Cakes, I decided to mix it up a little.  My older son asked for a cheesecake for his birthday, so I came here.  The cake was delicious,and the service was great.  So when my younger son asked for a red velvet cheesecake for his birthday a couple months later, I came back here.  The difference this time, is it was 5 days before Christmas . . . at The Oaks Mall.  After circling the parking lot for about 10 minutes, I finally found a space and entered the extremely busy restaurant.  Again, great customer service.  I ordered and paid for my cake but I couldn't wait for them to write on it, so when I returned 20 minutes later, I parked in the pick-up lane and was in and out of there in about a minute - at Christmastime - at The Oaks Mall!  The cake was delicious, and I am very happy with my experiences here."
Laura C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",33,19,1,5.0,9/9/2016,It's take a long time for the food to arrive although the food is very tasty. Recommend you to try the salmon miso. Is it delicious.
DanMark D.,"Ventura, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/4/2015,all i can say is that service is so bad.. we were here yesterday and we just walked out. They sat us down in a table gave my daughter a piece of bread and slice banana and never came back. i called of the server he said he will call our waiter and no one came. so we just decided to leave. What's the point of making fight or agrument. SO DISAPPOINTED. I DONT EVER WANT TO COME BACK AND I WILL NEVER SUGGEST THEM TO ANYONE I KNOW.
Mike G.,"Camarillo, CA",47,33,6,1.0,5/9/2015,So happy I get to pay $17 for 2 slices of cheese cake Togo and it takes 15minutes. Best part is you get all the attitude from everyone who works here. Last.time.ever.
Melissa G.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",50,24,10,3.0,8/6/2015,"Went for dinner with my family. The food was amazing. I had the Diane steak so did my husband just done perfectly. Our daughter got the pesto pasta and added some shrimp as well and really enjoyed it. The reason for the three stars is the service. Waiting to be seated to a long time and for no apparent reason. The food took a while to come as will, other than that I would say over all a great evening"
Linda K.,"Simi Valley, CA",20,39,,5.0,3/6/2015,"Love, love this place.  The food is always perfection, the atmosphere is inviting and romantic.  The salmon is the best I have ever had and there chocolate cake is amazing.   Sometimes you have a long wait, but it usually goes pretty fast.  They will give you a pager, so you can shop around.  Not a huge fan of malls, but better than being bored. The hostess who sat us was really sweet (Chrissy?) and our waiter Joel  was incredible.  He took the time to talk to us and help us order for our children.  He was super fast and very efficient!   We love this place and eat there several times a year. Go!!!!"
Mr. B.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,11,1,3.0,11/25/2014,There was a time they cared. Waited a half hour for a to go order that when I was told would take 15 minutes. Got a half assed apology. Now I'm not surprised by the poor rating. The hostess was nice and I realize it's not her fault. Plus I saw a couple cheesecakes kept on top of the counter unrefrigerated during the time I waited.
Fiveslurp S.,"Winnetka, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/17/2016,"Let me share my upsetting experience. The receptionist told me it would be 45 minutes. Well, we waited an hour. Then I came up to the receptionist again and told her I waited longer than what she told me and that my daughter is now crying and hungry. Then they took us in. Let's talk about the service -very bad. We got cold bread. They usually serve white and brown rolls. This time they only served us the white bread slices. Although I see the servers delivering white and brown bread slices to other tables. We barely saw our server. Over all, it was a shitty experience. Oh yeah, did I mention we came here after my daughter's recital? Her happiness and proud moment concluded with a very upsetting dinner."
Jason L.,,374,445,1235,4.0,9/29/2012,"As usual, it was PACKED.  Had a 40 minute wait (Friday night, so understandable.) Right at 40 minutes we were seated.  Had a great waiter named Kyle who was polite, efficient and responsive. Food was fantastic.  (I had the spicy chicken.. very good.)  Huge portions; expect a to-go box. Overall a great experience!"
Dave S.,"Oak Park, CA",203,48,27,4.0,9/28/2015,"Always a great choice, but so darn busy that it is hard to get a table after work.  Not a bad thing since no one wants to eat in an empty restaurant."
Vanessa O.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",207,143,303,5.0,8/4/2014,"Love love love this place '! This is my go too for any occasion, whether a birthday, graduation, or just a family dinner. The service we receive is always splendid. The people here are so friendly and do anything in thier power to give great customer service. I went last night for my moms birthday and it was a great dinner. I got the tomatoe basil pasta which was delicious. And the warm bread is just spectacular ! For desert I got a Godiva chocolate cheesecake and it was perfection in every single bite. To top off our night three employees including our awesome server came along with a little dessert to song happy birthday to my mom. What a wonderful dinner and a wonderful experience. That's why I always come back! Good job guys !(:"
Wanda O.,"Lompoc, CA",55,107,513,4.0,8/19/2014,"This is a chain but I always have great food here.  Our waitress was very nice, she gave good suggestions and our drinks were never empty.  This isn't the biggest Cheesecake Factory I have been to but it is nice.  They have an ""outdoor"" sitting area, which is really inside but it's nice.  Our food came fast and warm.  I really liked the Sunday brunch."
Mike C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",11,198,9,4.0,6/19/2014,We have been to several cheesecake factories. This one is run pretty well.  The Good: service is good. Dinner portions are huge so good for sharing. I order off the skinnylicious to save the calories.  The Bad: there is limited parking here at the mall Tip: we like bringing the banana cream pie cheesecake and freezing it. It taste amazing once frozen
Jaine B.,"WINNETKA, CA",169,14,4,5.0,6/12/2016,"I love cheesecake. Love this location because it's at the TO mall which is becoming my favorite since moving from the valley to Simi. My boyfriend and I noticed that all the same employees have been there forever so that means the management much be good and that they are good workers as well. I have to say Domingo is my favorite waiter though, such a nice guy! Can't go wrong with Cheesecake."
M M.,"Oxnard, CA",326,23,4,3.0,3/13/2015,"I'm never disappointed with the food served here! The dishes always taste amazing and of course the desserts are to die for. However, tonight's trip  was a little irritating! We arrived around 7 pm( Friday) night and were told it would be a 50minute wait- we didn't get seated until 8:15! Our server was extremely short with us and only checked on us 2x. I understand that Friday nights are busy- but I still expect to be treated with excellent service despite the business. If you wanna make those tips- ya better work your tables!!!! Hopefully next time our server will go above and beyond!"
Jack P.,"San Ramon, CA",21,318,314,4.0,8/3/2014,"Well these guys just rock with the generous portions crowd and they do a great job.  I actually used to eat in the real Cheese Cake factory decades ago in their mostly employee restaurant in Calabasas, CA on the 2nd floor of the factory when I could eat cheese cake - now older than dirt and need to watch the rich stuff.  My favorite is eating at the bar and having the Meat Loaf with double spinach, hold the potatoes. Location is in the mall where we do other shopping, so its real handy."
Jason M.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,9,,1.0,6/28/2016,Went here with my wife.  I got one of their burgers.  When I got it the meat was ground way too small.  It just fell apart and was gritty tasting.  Also super greasy.  I asked and was told this is how all their burgers are ground.  Never going back.  Wife didnt like her meal either.  Just overpriced bad food IMO.
