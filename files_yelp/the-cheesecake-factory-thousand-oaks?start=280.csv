Leslie H.,"Westlake Village, CA",8,30,1,4.0,9/21/2015,Love the cheesecake and most of the dishes I've had have been pretty good. But the wait to get a table and how crowed it is puts me off going there most of the time.
Melinda B.,"Hawthorne, CA",28,23,5,4.0,6/21/2015,"Always know that I will be satisfied when I go to The Cheesecake Factory. This location had no wait time which is a shocker, because we all know that you normally have to wait at least 20 min to be seated. Staff was friendly and food came out fast, can't really ask for more."
L B.,"Simi Valley, CA",189,6,11,5.0,5/12/2016,"Tonight I placed a take out order from the Thousand Oaks Cheesecake Factory for my boyfriend and I. The gentleman taking the order let me know that one of the 2 salads (Cobb salad and BBQ ranch salad) I ordered normally comes with corn but they were out of corn. I said that was fine and Continued with my order. Get home and there's actually corn on his salad (which is good but puzzling after the phone warning I received) but there's barely anything on my Cobb. Chicken, a small amount of bacon, a crumble or 2 of blue cheese, and 0 egg! It was an extremely sad looking salad for $15. I fought with myself as to whether or not I was going to call and bring the issue to the staff's attention because it's not really my style but ultimately decided to because it's not right to pay $15 for a salad I was adding home ingredients to just to salvage it. I called and politely asked for the manager. Angela picked up the phone and what a breath of fresh air! I told her what happened with the salads and that I was disappointed with the meal I received. She offered to comp my whole meal! I told her that wasn't necessary as one of the salads was being enjoyed but she insisted. She even asked me to ask for her the next time I visit so she could introduce herself and apologize again. Seriously, most of the times that I've had an issue at this location it's either attitude or no ownership of the problem. But Angela took ownership right away and treated me like a valued customer. To make sure she receives my gratitude I will also be calling corporate to let them know they have a huge asset to them on their team. Thank you Angela for being so polite and kind. Every manager should take note from you!!"
Arlyn A.,"Santa Barbara, CA",30,80,460,5.0,7/30/2014,It never gets old best food great all American food big portions I never not like a dish from this place
Hannah W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",46,96,86,3.0,2/5/2014,"My girlfriend and I came here last night for a girls night and it was absolutely astonishing how horrible the customer service was.  We were sitting at our table for LITERALLY 20 minutes before we had to personally ask someone to take our drink orders. And it was pretty funny to us to watch not one, not two, but THREE servers in one section not realize for 20 minutes that we were just sitting there waiting to be served. - I don't care if that wasn't someone's section, you hop on helping a table no matter what, its MONEY.  After requesting our drink orders from a server I believe was named Jessica (who was very sweet and apologetic for noticing we were just sitting there not served. And this was after we asked for a manager), she was very attentive even though we weren't her assigned table. My friend and I wished we were her table because she was a lot nicer than the snob of a server we were dealt with.  The manager was great too, he made sure to get us our appetizer immediately and free of charge. I think my only main complaint besides waiting for 20 minutes before being noticed, was our server. It's funny because she was never once sympathetic that SHE was actually supposed to be our server and never noticed but she had the worst attitude of all time. She acted like it was a pitty to serve us and she really didn't want to. She was never once attentive to us, we had bus boys and other servers and the manager serving us and refilling our drinks before she could even think to get to doing that. Then after we ordered our cheesecake it took her ANOTHER 20 minutes flat to get us our check. Even after saying the cheesecake was all we wanted left, no coffee, no more drinks. A great server would have given us our check after that...but nope!  And it wasn't until she gave us our check that she finally said ""And I'm sorry for the mishap in the beginning"" in hopes that she would get a tip. HAHA!!!! I'm sorry, but I am a customer who highly praises exceptional customer service and I will definitely reward you for that. But she definitely didn't earn a cent extra of my money. So you can bet that I let her know that Servers Earn Tips. Maybe you should be more attentive to your customers instead of wasting my time and giving us attitude."
Chris S.,"Chatsworth, CA",255,1601,6242,4.0,7/4/2014,"If you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them on. This TO location rivals its peers by offering solid service, an inviting atmosphere and quality food across the board. And, it's open late, which other than the Lazy Dog can be tough to find in this area. I haven't had anything on the menu that wasn't good, but have been gravitating to the Jamaican Jerk Shrimp lately. The sauce is wonderful and with black beans and brown rice, you can't go wrong."
Katie D.,"Palmdale, CA",7,23,1,3.0,2/8/2015,"The food was really good, but the method they use to seat you needs to change! We were told a 30 minute wait at 2pm on a Saturday, and that was fine. We sat outside in the mall and they texted my phone. THEN when we showed up at the counter (myself, my hubby and my 83 year old mom) they told us, oh yeah, ok, stand over there, against a WALL in a narrow passageway by a bunch of strollers, with wait staff trying to squeeze by with plates of food. Which would have been ok, but then we Waited and Waited, and another family got beeped, and they told THEM to wait against the same wall, and then another family 5 minutes later, and here we all were squished against the wall.   I watched a waitress count out menus and thought here we go, but then she put them back and walked aimlessly in another direction.  My mom was having a hard time standing there so long, we would have been better off waiting where we were on the benches.  Finally I went up to the front desk and said our number was called and we were told to wait over here in the hallway, and my mom is having a hard time standing over here so long! So they said oh sure we will seat you right now.  Jeez, you would think when they call and say your table is ready that your table would really be ready, not that you would be shuffled off to another waiting area.  Horrible.  But waiter very nice (he had a 5 year pin) and food good.  They really need to change their seating procedure!!"
Anthony B.,"Riverside, CA",513,690,483,3.0,10/22/2012,"Fancy. What caught my eye is they have seating actually inside the mall itself too, which left me feeling a little weird. Only thing separating you from tables inside is a window. Feels like strangers sitting and eating at the table with you."
Gilbert M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",46,31,68,5.0,7/14/2014,"This was the first time I visited the cheesecake factory. As usual lunchtime hour it's full of people, we didn't wait long to get a table. The waiter was very friendly and honest. We ordered for appetizers the stuffed mushrooms and avocado rolls. I will admit they both are delicious. For the main course I had a chili Relleno burger. Truly one of the best burgers I've had in my life. Great flavor and feels you right up. I will definitely come back to this place."
Sharon G.,"Oxnard, CA",50,14,11,5.0,3/16/2014,"I've been here a couple of times before, but now they offer ""skinny"" items, great for those who don't want to eat a lot, but still leave feeling satiated (like me). Ted and I came in on a Sunday with a 3PM reservation. I ordered a skinny turkey burger with a strawberry margarita. Very delicious meal! Turkey was cooked well and the salad had the perfect amount of dressing. For dessert, Ted and I shared a slice of original cheesecake for FREE (from our gift card). Customer service was great; we had a pleasant waitress named Jesi. Will definitely come back in the future."
Jenny A.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,28,1,5.0,8/13/2015,Throughly enjoyed the dinning experience provided by Shane.  His attention to detail and flexibility to our tight dinning schedule made it a great dinning experience.  The banana cream pie is a  must have and just as Shane stated it is definitely a slice of heaven.
Gaye F.,"Portland, OR",6,45,39,5.0,3/8/2014,When you want comfort food come here and have their meatloaf....it is so good.... Mashed potatoes onions a side and it is just delicious. The unfortunate part is that's the portions are so big there is never any room for cheesecake at the end so maybe the thing to do is to start with dessert and then have dinner afterwards. I used to get the Keylime cheesecake with the Carmel sauce for the apple cheesecake and what a combination that is....tart with sweet on top of it..... The only complaint is be prepared for a lot of noise but the food well makes up for it.
Jeff K.,"Newbury Park, CA",8,161,,4.0,3/6/2014,"I have no complaints about the food here, but its the cheesecakes that keep me coming back.  The menu here is HUGE, so its great for when you are with a bunch of people that are all in the mood for something different.  Not only that, but they have lots of small plates and appetizers, so its great for going out for drinks with a group of friends. When its time for dessert though, nothing beats their cheesecakes.  I tend to stick to the classics, but I'm every kind they make is somebody's favorite."
Stan W.,"Simi Valley, CA",319,522,154,4.0,11/15/2011,"My experience at this Cheesecake Factory location is either a 3 or 4 star experience. Here are some disclaimers: *Yes, the wait is usually insanely long. *Yes, the seats and tables are a bit cramped. *Yes, the dining area inside the mall portion of the restaurant is a bit weird. *Now apply those constants into an expected dining experience at this location and review accordingly. Service can sometimes drag but I think it is because of how busy and congested the restaurant is. My experiences there have been consistently solid. Food is hot and delivered on time and there is some time to actually experience and taste an appetizer before you are bombarded with your main course. The portions are good here too. It never seems to fail that we have a to-go box to take with us at the end of our meals (whether we remember to grab out leftovers when we leave is another story). The menu is insanely huge. Almost too big. I've tried a number of items and I think my favorite is the crusted chicken romano (the chicken is so thin and crispy and really goes well with the light tomato sauce). Obviously this place has dessert. I must say the lack of pies is a bit unfortunate (wink, wink) but the selection of cheesecake is mind-bottling. Yes mind-bottling.  ""You know, when things get so crazy it gets yours thoughts all trapped like in a bottle"" - Blades of Glory I digress. I go for the carrot cheesecake while the wife goes for the Godiva cheesecake. Greatest idea I think Cheesecake Factory has done is have a separate menu for the calorie content of it's dishes. I hate knowing how bad the food is for me when I'm ordering ;)"
Patty D.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,77,16,4.0,6/12/2014,"Overall a very good Cheesecake Factory.  Of all the Cheesecake Factories I've dinned at, this one has the best customer service.  I've never gotten a mediocre waiter or service staff.  I've had several of them go above and beyond several times, especially when I worked at the Apple store in the mall.  On several occasions, staff members gave me extra bread with my orders and asked me which bread I preferred and if I wanted anything else extra at no charge.  It became a common thing for Apple staff members to order lunches together from here because of the good service.  We all knew it cost more and we had several options in the mall. I recently came here with my boyfriend on a Tuesday night, and they continue to have that amazing customer service.  One of my favorite things about this particular location is the option to sit on the inside patio, outside patio, bar and regular dining.  It's no wonder this place is packed from open to close on the weekends and most weeknights. There was about 20 people waiting outside, but we only had to wait 15 minutes, and I was able to do a bit of window shopping before I got a text that my table was ready. Kudos to the management and service staff."
Karyn G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,7,,5.0,7/25/2015,"Love this place!! Always have always will!! Every special Occasion is spent at Cheesecake Factory or we get Take out from them!! Best choices of food items, Chicken Piccata and their mash potatoes the best in California in my opinion! Sunday brunch is incredible!! Wish they served their lemon ricotta pancakes during the week!!!!! Can't say enough about their food and their service!! A++ That's why there is always a wait to eat there!! :)"
Adilene A.,"Ventura, CA",5,11,58,4.0,6/13/2015,I love this place they have a great selection of food and desserts. The wait tends to be very long.
Greg T.,"Calabasas, CA",1,74,22,3.0,3/28/2015,Wonderful food and one of our favorites! Just be sure that when you have a problem you solve it then and there as the store told us we would have a credit for a cheesecake waiting for us but when we arrived the manager refused. Cindy said we were supposed to get a gift card not a replacement!
Ren S.,"Moorpark, CA",3,11,22,5.0,3/16/2015,Good Stuff.  Sharing a dish with my daughter and still have leftovers to take home.  Huge!
Rob B.,"Newbury Park, CA",1,7,,5.0,10/27/2013,"This is the second time that I have contacted in regards to your restaurant's. I want to commend you again for your excellent service and food.  My wife and I decided to try your Sunday Brunch and found it excellent, I had the Monte Cristo Omelet, it was different but very tasty.  To start with, your hostess seated us promply, then the waitress extremely attentive.  Her name was Kristen S. and she is probably one of the finest and most efficient, waitresses I have ever seen, and with a personality plus, plus, attitude.  She is a seven star waitress.  Keep up the good food and the hiring and training and your restaurant will never have an equal. PS Thanks again for having Kristen"
