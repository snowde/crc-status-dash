Amanda C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",18,22,,4.0,1/8/2014,Yes this place is pretty pricey now however the portions of food are HUGE. I can usually get 2 meals out of it sometimes 3 depending on how hungry I am. The Pasta Da Vinci is still one of my favorite pasta dishes. It is so yummy and full of flavor. The special edition oreo dream extreme is absolutely incredible!! I have to say cheesecake factory has gotten REALLY REALLY cheap on the cheesecake and you can see that it is half cheesecake and half whipped cream however oreo dream extreme is not like this. I guess they only do that on some of them. Really too bad. The bread and butter that come with your dinner is always a hit and very very good!
Frank G.,"Camarillo, CA",0,1,1,1.0,9/23/2015,This place is so discasten me  & my wife order chicken tacos the rice was cold very disappointed
Todd G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,15,,1.0,3/12/2015,"BEWARE of takeout service!  I do a lot business lunches and I dread coming here!  I've literally been here over 10 times and it NEVER fails that I have to wait forever and the order is always botched!  I've even went as far as to speak with the GM on one occasion after a complete fiasco with another previous order.  I get lunches everyday from all over and I very rarely run into these types of issues.  For a large, successful corporation already aware of these issues, it's really inexcusable to have such chronic and pervasive service issues.  To the GM, you really need to take drastic measures and get someone who can manage your takeout more effectively and efficiently."
Leeana B.,"Oxnard, CA",19,16,17,5.0,10/29/2013,"Amazing service, everyone was very welcoming & took care of all out needs. We had the factory nachos as an appetizer & it came on a huge plate.. Very very delicious. Everything we ordered was yummy.. & they all sang to me for my birthday! Great place to eat"
Nancy L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",74,10,,4.0,6/26/2015,"My favorite little trick here is to mix the ranch with bbq sauce and dip the bread in it. I love the bread, too bad I just started a no carbs diet. Oh I'm really going to miss the bread. The menu has everything here. Really its like a book. Oh and the Caesar dressing is so good. Sometimes I bring it home and surprise my husband with it, but I tell him I made the dressing myself."
Lauren K.,"Oak Park, CA",0,13,3,1.0,10/21/2016,food is great but the service was horrific. we sat for 20 min before we even got anyone to notice us! very disappointed TRUCKS
Sydney G.,"Simi Valley, CA",19,68,7,5.0,11/17/2013,"Never had a bad meal here! Always throughout the years has this place been the go-to dinner restaurant for friends and family. Their prices reflect their high quality ingredients and friendly staff and excellent service.  Highly recommend ANY of their salads, and their burgers are juicy and flavorful. Honestly be prepared to take a while to look at the menu if you are undecided on a meal, they have so much good stuff."
Hector S.,"Oxnard, CA",2,3,2,1.0,5/20/2015,"Just left after waiting over 15min for a server to talk to us. The elderly heavy set gentleman working outside passed by us several times, even glancing at us as he passed by, but continued to serve the neighboring tables. A larger party was sat next to us after we were sitting, and they were greeted and served drinks well before he decided to come over to our table. Worst service I've gotten. Ever."
Alyssa A.,"El Sobrante, CA",1,21,3,2.0,4/12/2015,Our waiter was super nice and the food came out quickly but they literally sat all the minorities in a corner on the side of the mall which was located inside the mall with all the passerbys gawking at your food. After an hour long wait. With 2 little ones under the age of 5. I'm definitely not one to pull the race card because it's not as common in the valley but jeez! It was no coincidence that the 3 parties they sat around us were the only other black families other than my own. Extremely disheartening. We're not coming back here.
Ben L.,"Glendora, CA",0,10,6,4.0,7/14/2015,My favorite here is chicken bellagio and bistro shrimp.  This branch has better taste than any other cheese cake factory...the pasta has right amount of sauce and the chicken is not to dry.  The service is ok but not the best.
Jasmine D.,"Camarillo, CA",173,33,8,4.0,7/8/2015,"Every time I order food here I am left wanting something more.  I've been invited here for birthday parties and other celebrations for as long as I can remember and I just don't understand why this place is so popular. First off the advertisement on the menus is off putting. The sauces lack flavor (I've never had a more watery and garlicy ranch dressing). I've ordered the grilled salmon twice and it has had this odd bitter flavor each time. Lastly, the customer service below par, you constantly feel rushed and a nuisance when asking for any extra condiments or drink refills. The desserts are delicious. I think the customer service could definitely be improved!"
abby b.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,52,,2.0,3/22/2016,"I have always loved the food at the Cheesecake Factory, but the service was so slow at our dinner tonight that we really couldn't enjoy the food.  It took at least 10 minutes to get our drinks (iced tea and water!) and at least 30 minutes for our entrees (pizza, salad and pasta - nothing fancy).  Each ""course"", we had to ask, ""Where is our food?  Where are our drinks? etc.  The server just kept telling us ""Happy hour is really busy.""  The final straw was when we heard him offer a free slice of cheesecake to the table next to us because of the long wait, but nothing was offered to us. Not that we needed the free cheesecake, but it would have been nice if some sort of apology was made for the slow service."
Lesley S.,"Ventura, CA",0,6,2,5.0,7/6/2014,The manager here is what really makes this place all the more perfect for me. He always remembers me and is so kind and seems very genuine to not only his customers but his employees too. Not only do we come from Ventura to go here on special occasions but every time I'm in town we try to come by. I love this place and they hire great people. The manager deserves a raise! Can't say enough good things about him.
Daryl C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",2152,637,434,2.0,6/25/2013,"Bored. Why is there always a line for this place?  Other than the cheesecake, all the menu items are easily put together and not worth the price we pay.  Service is just ok.  Lemonade is $4.50.  The lemons must be shipped from Italy to explain that cost.  The Jambalaya is 1/2 cup chicken & 1/2 cup shrimp, some bell peppers, tomatoes and spice sitting on a bed of noodles.  Personally, I think Zatarain's boxed Jambalaya is better and for the same cost, I can feed 4 or 5."
Darren P.,"Newbury Park, CA",35,21,3,3.0,12/24/2013,"Came here Christmas Eve for lunch and had the Santa Fe Chicken Salad.  I was ok, I felt better quality greens should be used.  Welted lettuce is not to appetizing.  The service was good,  food came out quickly."
International C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,2,,4.0,8/10/2015,The people were excellent and the food was amazing as well. I will be coming back here very soon
Maria H.,"Ventura, CA",2,24,7,5.0,4/18/2015,We went to the Cheesecake Factory a couple weeks ago and the service was fantastic. We had someone named Andrew (sorry if that's wrong). He was awesome. It was my boyfriends first time at a Cheesecake Factory and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Got us our drinks quickly. We were outside and the sun moved so it was in our eyes. He noticed and let us move over to the next table where were covered and comfortable. I asked for a lot of ranch and I got the perfect amount of it. Tipped him 50%. Would totally recommend this place.
Jacob M.,"Camarillo, CA",2,30,,3.0,5/9/2015,The food is pretty decent but we ordered appetizers and they came right before the main entrée. The wait for the appetizers was a bit long but the food was great.
Arianne S.,"Camarillo, CA",28,116,51,2.0,2/16/2015,"I've been to plenty of other Cheesecake Factory locations but this one by far was one I'll pass up. The waitress we had was pretty rude and I'm not usually one to complain but she just seemed like she hated working there and didn't want to give us the time of day. Other than that, I had ordered a side caesar salad and when I went to go take a bite, my mouth was burning. Burning from an overpowered spice which I'm sure was garlic. I informed my waitress which and I told her what I thought and she replied ""um I don't think there's any garlic in this, but okay"" really? That's like a main ingredient in cases at salad. Our burgers were okay, lacked a touch of flavor but you know for what we pay it should be amazing without a doubt."
Curt E.,"Grover Beach, CA",1,63,71,4.0,4/6/2014,Great meal with good service... We were there for Sunday Brunch (made difficult by the fact that we were a party of 12). The food was delicious. The French Toast I ordered was perfectly cooked and the all the other food was great as well.   I love the variety of the menu and was happy with the overall quality. Ended brunch with a slice of white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake... Yummy!!! We will stop there if we end up in Thousand Oaks again.
