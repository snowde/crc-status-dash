Richard R.,"Oxnard, CA",102,196,62,5.0,2/23/2015,"Had family in town and we all had different tastes for dinner.  Thankfully the menu at cheesecake factory is quite abundant and has yet to fail me in any way.  Food is always on point from all of my experiences at several locations.  Service was really good as well,  so no complaints from me.   Good job."
Lynn U.,"Pismo Beach, CA",58,111,688,5.0,6/6/2013,I can't speak for all locations but this one takes the cheeseCake! Not overhyped! I've been to this location 4 times and ordered a different meal everything with my friends and family that did the same and I got to sample some of theirs I love everything! They have a huge menu which I have to say is the only down fall for the time it takes to read it all. The waitstaff super awesome team work! Always a pleasure to visit!!!
Joni S.,"Temecula, CA",174,380,861,3.0,1/22/2012,"Pros: Can grab a drink at the bar while waiting to sit. Consistently mediocre food. Cons: Salads are probably your only Paleo dish. Like all other Cheesecake Factory Restaurants, nothing special. Overall: If you like cheesecakes, then make sure to order a cheesecake to make the experience worthwhile."
Adam J.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",4,22,1,4.0,5/28/2014,"A Good restaurant well located in the T.O. mall. Venue- great location inside the Thousand Oaks Mall. Always clean and respectable, and well kept facilities. Neat little ""outside"" area both in the mall and actually outside.  Food- Great choices, we are a fan of the Hibachi steak. My friend described it as ""a party in her mouth and everyone is invited"" and that ""the delicate aroma of the steak, intermingled with the asparagus was comparable to a state of heaven for her tastebuds"". In summary, some good food choices. I tend to get the Pasta Da Vinci, which is always a good choice. Unfortunately a lot of the menu is fairly generic which is the main put off.  Staff and Service- Fast and polite, around Christmas they have a great deal- If you buy a giftcard you also get a ""Slice of heaven"" giftcard which allows you to choose a free piece of cheesecake.  Value- a little on the pricey side, but still good.  A good restaurant in the mall, although the menu tends to stray from exotic, and harbors to more generic, typical foods, with a few gems intermingled within. Definitely worth going to next time you're at the Mall."
Jason G.,"Ventura, CA",125,10,1,5.0,2/14/2016,Amazing dinner tonight even though it was packed as hell ! I couldn't be happier with my meal . Ps Zach the waiter was on point with all of his favorite meals ...
Kendall C.,"Las Vegas, NV",102,174,369,2.0,1/9/2014,"This place is like any other big chain, garbage food ! I had there Thai Lettuce wraps, disgusting.  Any place that has menus  the size of a novel, run. It's quantity not quality."
David G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",123,52,18,5.0,2/4/2015,Top to bottom the most consistent and variety filled menu. So many things are good. My favs are bang bang chicken and shrimp and the Louisiana chicken pasta (extra sauce). Jenny the hostess was very nice and accommodating to the kids.
Marbella P.,"Port Hueneme, CA",19,5,,5.0,12/16/2014,"Delicious food, excellent customer service I like this location better than woodland hills even tho their both located in a mall Thousand Oaks has better customer service"
Danmo H.,"Montclair, CA",231,590,1953,4.0,4/5/2013,"We had an Easter/Birthday Celebration here last weekend on Easter Sunday,and much to our surprise, we did not have to wait for a table.  For me, the food was just average (I had a shrimp and BLT sandwich with a side salad).  However, what impressed me the most was the attentive service from our server.  Drinks never went empty, table got bussed in between the courses, and she never rushed us even though we all arrived at different times and needed to contemplate the menu offerings---so those really make up the three stars, and the fourth is for the cheesecake.  Dark chocolate raspberry is my poison."
Colton A.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,2,,3.0,6/7/2015,"Dining in provides excellent service. However, every time I've done curbside, whether it's a meal or simply a single slice of cheesecake, I end up waiting 15-20 minutes over their ""expected wait time"" they provide; in front of the restaurant, in the curbside section. Unfortunately, this happened again tonight, I waited over 15 minutes in front for one, single slice of cheesecake. I bring it home, my wife starts eating it, and it's still partially frozen. More disappointed than mad."
Sara K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,43,1,3.0,3/2/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! I just wish that the lines/wait at this particular location were shorter. It can be 45-1 hour and I'm usually famished by then. We will end up going somewhere else or just being cranky here. Otherwise, haven't had a bad experience with the food, pretty standard. The waiters/waitresses have been super nice though!"
Amber L.,"Simi Valley, CA",224,5,,5.0,4/21/2015,"Went here for dinner with my friends and everything about the service was perfect my two waiters Zach and Kris were on top of things and helped us every way possible, definitely the best service I've ever had!"
Sherri M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,12,,5.0,3/3/2013,"My husband decided to pick up Cheesecake factory for dinner last night and bring it home for the family... I called in the order and it was very easy and fast. The person I spoke to was very friendly and low and behold... unlike most restaurants that are as busy as The Cheesecake Factory is on a Saturday night, everything was correct, done when they said it would be and tasted great by the time he got home with it. We had Chicken tenders and fries, Chicken Marsala and an Old Fashioned Burger and fries. The food was still nice and warm when he arrived home. This morning my husband discovered that his wallet was missing... After retracing his steps, he realized that he had probably left it at The Cheesecake Factory counter when he picked up the food last night.  Normally, my husband and I do not carry a lot of cash - but he happened to have several hundred dollars and all of his credit cards in the wallet because he had just returned from traveling. Although it was 8:30am and I didn't think anyone would answer the call so early on a Sunday morning, it was answered by a manager named Jennifer who was VERY helpful. She said that they DID have the wallet and that he could come and pick it up right away although the restaurant wasn't open yet. He said she was helpful and friendly throughout the exchange and that he feels like going there more often just because of the service and attitudes of all of the employees that he came into contact with both last night (Nicole when he picked up the food) and today (Jennifer). Obviously the staff at The Cheesecake factory aren't only friendly and professional - they have a great deal of integrity!"
Tiffany E.,"Atascadero, CA",0,4,,4.0,4/18/2015,"Amazing haven't had one bad item! Amazing service dont like how the dish came out send it back and get a new dish, but hardly ever send anything back. Desserts are to wonderful!!!!!"
Monty C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,7,2,5.0,11/27/2014,"My wife and I went here on Thursday evening.We were seated in less than 5 minutes.I had the spaghetti & meatballs,it tasted better than Buca di Peppo's.My wife has the Mediterranean flatbread sandwich,it was also very good.We took home a pecan pumpkin pie slice.Our server Michael C was awesome.He is a delightful,humorous and hard worker.I highly recommend this Cheesecake location!!"
La-La O.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,115,6,4.0,5/30/2015,Always a great experience at Cheesecake Factory! Always a safe choice with an encyclopedia of options!
Jay F.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,78,79,5.0,2/2/2015,Want something great? It's not on the menu. Long ago cheesecake had s dish called Sheila's Blacken Chicken pasta. Then they killed it. If you're like me... I missed it. A old chef tipped me off. Order Louisiana chicken pasta. Get chicken blacken instead of fried. Replace bow tie pasta with linguine. Done. Try it. Amazing.
sarah s.,"Westlake Village, CA",55,24,4,2.0,3/5/2015,I had dinner at the Cheesecake Factory this evening and have to say I was completely underwhelmed. They sat us in the outside area within the mall toward the end of the dining area. Both staff and other patrons continuously walked between my seat and the space in the plants shaking my seat throughout my meal. My drink was never refilled nor was it offered until we were given our check. I ordered the veggie burger. It was mushy and fell apart. Yuck. The server took a long time to arrive with our drinks and even longer to take our order. She was not very friendly. Needless to say we will not be back.
Joy V.,"Camarillo, CA",57,140,102,3.0,11/14/2013,"There's so many menu items that it's difficult to choose what to eat. I always have anxiety when a group of friends decide to go eat here because I'll stare at the menu for a good 10+ minutes and nothing at all seems interesting to eat. This last visit we ordered spinach & cheese dip, crispy crab wontons, & orange chicken. The dip was very bland and the tortilla chips were way too salty. The wontons were good, but the wrapper was really greasy. Orange chicken was on point though. Very delicious!  Honestly, I'd only come here for the bread they serve when you first sit down and the cheesecake if I could. You can have too many appetizer/main course items on the menu, but you can't have too many cheesecake options. My favorite by far is the red velvet cheesecake. If you haven't had it, your life is incomplete."
Vivian G.,"Westlake Village, CA",7,31,28,2.0,1/7/2015,"Christmas Eve not so sweet. I'd preordered a cake for our holiday dessert. I'd confirmed when ordering that it included strawberries and whipped cream, being sure I'd not neglect anything. Day of pick up, also being Christmas Eve I called ahead to confirm the strawberries and whipped cream would be ready as well with the cake, I was assured it all would be.. Satisfied I'd have a beautiful dessert for my family I sent my son to pick up the order. First off they were very rude to him, about the order, then charged him additional for a few strawberries and refused to give him whipped cream. By the time he returned Christmas dinner was already being served and my beautifully planned dessert didn't work out so well.  I called the restaurant asked if they could deliver spoke to a manager who said no, but he (Johnny) took my information including name and address and promised to send me a gift card refund. Which I never received.  Terrible customer service on a special occasion. :(  Im disappointed after careful planning and communication on my behalf there was no accountability from this establishment during this experience."
