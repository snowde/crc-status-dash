Mike L.,"Ventura, CA",688,48,11,5.0,1/25/2015,"I was at The Cheesecake Factory in Thousand Oaks last night and it was busier than I had ever seen it.  Seemed as if everyone and their folks were there, as I was. I didn't think there was anyway we would get a seat but we actually got seated fairly quickly considering how busy it was. Our waitress was fantastic and quick which was important since we were going to see a movie after dinner. All considering I was impressed enough to ask for the manager. His name was Massimo and was a complete gentleman.  I told him all Cheesecake Factory locations need to have managers as efficient as he is. I've been to a lot of Cheesecake Factories and I'd definitely recommend this one."
Niccole S.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,5,,3.0,3/14/2016,"If it wasn't for the manager Jonny, I would have given this place the lowest review. I recently became a Vegan and finding places that I can eat is a challenge. I wasn't sure if this Cheese Cake Factory location could help me. I asked a waiter if they could modify the classic Chinese Chicken Salad for me and he directed me to someone at bakery.     I asked the guy behind the desk named Kevin to help me with the modification of this salad and also to see if the price would change. Since the chicken would be the most expensive part of this dish. He said they could remove the chicken but not change the price. I arrived in the evening and this salad is $17.00 .  A little too expensive for some lettuce and dressing. His attitude was lousy and he had a ""don't care"" response. I decided to leave the restaurant.      As I was walking away very dis-satisfied with the service and the price, I decided to return to see if the manager could help me. I returned to Kevin and asked him if I could speak to the manager. He came out and I asked him the same question regarding the chicken and lower price. He said Yes they could change the price and he went to the back to speak to the kitchen manager for price difference.    I ended up getting the salad for much cheaper and same size as the dinner plate. If I would have left with the response from Kevin, I would not have gotten a better service and what I actually wanted.  This attentive and compassionate manager understood how hard it is to eat out being a Vegan and gave me exceptional service.    I left very happy but remembered I did not get the receipt from the cashier Lauren and she was just like Kevin, had a very poor customer service attitude. Why work directly with customers when you do not have good people skills. This place could be losing business to employees like this. Thank you for managers who care about customer service like Jonny to save the evening."
Ali S.,"SAN PEDRO, CA",0,9,,2.0,5/15/2014,"I went there late about 9 pm last friday night. it was very crowded, but they quickly found a table for us. the service vas ok but the food wasn't good.  we ordered soup  and three different kind stakes, our stakes was rushed to cooke, and they were burned.  even the price of the food, wasn't too cheep, we didn't finish our food and we left the restaurant."
Bryce W.,"Simi Valley, CA",80,220,2,4.0,1/29/2013,"Let's do the compliment sandwich. The good: Cheesecake factory is nice because the food is always decent to good.  The bad: Unfortunately, there are a few downsides to this one. The wait on a Friday night is 40ish minutes. That's a long time if you're already hungry. Addtionally, you have to wait with people from Thousand Oaks. If you're not from Thousand Oaks, you understand what I mean. If you are, well... you're very nice, I'm sure, but your outfit is bad no matter how ""trendy"" it is.  The also good: The service at this particular Cheesecake Factory is fantastic. Our waiter was absolutely great. He seemed genuinely pleased to serve us. He was chatty, but not too much. He was attentive without being pushy/desperate. His service would be in the 90th percentile of what I've experienced in my life. We were very pleased. To recap: Good food. Annoying people you have to wait too long with. Great service. What this all means: I'll wait the extra 20 minutes to not leave really pissed off because I didn't have water for the last 30 minutes of my meal."
Meli. O.,"Oxnard, CA",4,47,18,3.0,2/22/2015,Always a pleasure but since we went on a Saturday afternoon the server was a bit overwhelmed with the volume of tables he had. We were sitted quickly on the patio and 2 of the 4 napkins had spots on them. The table and menu had grease  and the silverware was full of spots as if they were bunched together in a dishwasher. The drinks were holding us down until our fried cheese and warm bread came out. The entree I ordered was a cuban sandwich and me being from the Caribbean this was no where near Cuban. It didn't even come on cuban bread but some hard bread. It had melted cheese but was not placed on an iron press to toast the bread and flatten it down. The highlight of course was the red velvet cheesecake. God forbid if they got this wrong. For the price we pay for a dinner for a party of 3 with drinks it's becoming a bit overrated.
Pete C.,"Temecula, CA",2,9,,5.0,5/13/2015,Had to do a dinner stop since traffic was horrendous on the 101 Freeway.  Cheesecake Factory Restaurant to the rescue.  Everybody in party loved their dinner and service was faster then expected.  Never disappointed!  New Lemon Meringue Cheesecake is awesome!
Avril N.,"Chatsworth, CA",51,239,65,5.0,7/30/2013,"Cheesecake Factory now has my vote for best happy hour. It was actually  first for all of us. We were at group of 5 that night. Bar area would only be able to fit 1 big group or 2-3 groups of six max. I think the servers must have thought we were amateurs because we ended up with a happy hour feast. What we thought were going to be small plates ended up being 2 or 3x bigger. We ended up taking home several bags of take-out boxes home. Avocado rolls were good but very filling. I liked the spinach dip but the chips that came with it was really thick...not a fan. I didn't take any of my husband's sliders. They looked more like normal-sized burgers than sliders to me. For desert I had the tiramisu cheesecake which I thought was ok. My husband got the s'mores cheesecake which I took bites of, of course. It was delicious. Service was quite good at this location. Servers were often around. They didn't mind too much about us taking over the next table even though the 5th person in our party took a lil while to get there."
Karen W.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,11,1,5.0,3/7/2016,"Garlic Parmesan cheese appetizer was awesome.  Great service, salads were so tasty."
Leal B.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,7,,5.0,3/4/2016,"Always a great choice. The huge menu is always changing so it never gets old. One could dine there practically everyday and never order the same thing. Still, I think my favorite dish has to be the grilled salmon followed by a slice of key lime pie."
Steph H.,"Long Beach, CA",248,1692,1985,3.0,12/19/2012,"A pretty typical CF, nothing more, nothing less. Was visiting a friend in the area and she suggested it for lunch, which was fine--I usually have a fine experience when I visit a CF. This particular location was slammed with all the holiday shoppers so the service was kind of harried and spotty but at least they were friendly. We both ended up ordering the same thing: Grilled chicken club with avocado. These sandwiches were HUGE and got a bit soggy at the bottom but were delicious. I got a slice of plain cheesecake to go and it was very nice of them to hold our leftovers while we went shopping (although we had to wait forEVER to claim our bag from the busy cheesecake-to-go counter when we returned). Overall, not bad."
Michelle R.,"Oxnard, CA",326,123,151,5.0,8/28/2014,"I don't think I could type anything bad about this place. It's a chain. But it's a chain that serves delicious food. Macaroni cheese balls are to die for and so are the avocado egg rolls. The menu is so big, I have no complaints about what to order. The shrimp BLT is amazing, Cuban amazing, orange chicken was okay. Pastas are good! Desserts always good. I love to eat here occasionally, it's not exactly calorie friendly but it's good!"
Todd N.,"Los Angeles, CA",460,583,496,3.0,7/24/2011,"Cheesecake Factory, the name itself instantly creates a realm full of high end ambiance paired with good food.   I'm not a BIG fan of this chain restaurant, but I'm definitely a fan.  If I ever have a casual lunch, dinner, or special occasion this place seems to work. Although I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and try something a little bit more interesting, the Cajun Jambalaya pasta was practically screaming at me, and I decided to get it. There goes trying something new. The pasta was nothing less than I expected; however, this dish seemed a lot less spicier than usual.  Every time I order this dish, I remember it being a lot spicier to the point where my eyes would water.  However, it was a good experience. I'm reviewing this place solely in terms of customer service and location really and that's why it gets 3 stars.  Because it's located in the mall, the restaurant is SMALL, and I mean really really SMALL!  My friend and I had to sit out in the atrium because the place was packed."
Xochitl S.,"Studio City, CA",119,215,72,4.0,12/13/2012,"Had a really good first experience here! My friends and I planned a Secret Santa dinner, and we had a big party of 9. From reading many of the reviews, and lack there for reservations, I thought it  was going to be a while.  Our hostess sat us immediately, though the place looked packed. Our waiter Joel, was pretty awesome. He was so kind, took our orders & checked in on us frequently, Their portions were also pretty big so I was happy, that I got what I paid for! Back to our waiter, I know most servers would be pissed off and annoyed with separate checks, but we did not even have to ask him for them. He brought them to us promptly (we would have been fine paying off the full regular bill). That was so surprising to all of us! I will definitely return. & their cheescakes & desserts are a must have! Totally worth it!"
Cory N.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,5,,2.0,2/22/2016,"I come here about 3 times or so a month, and EVERY single time, the dishes and silver ware on the table are very very dirty! It's like they don't put effort into cleaning the things that people eat with! Pretty disgusting actually. I have even had food particles floating in the water that was brought to me at times. The food is good, but the cleanliness needs a LOT of work."
Istara Z.,"Woodland Hills, CA",351,124,234,5.0,7/21/2013,"Always satisfied with the customer service, well prepared food, and well lit atmosphere. This place is quality at its finest. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone celebrating a special event e.g. birthdays, anniversaries, or just want some quality food and a good time out."
Tim D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",13,114,3,5.0,11/14/2012,"After reading reviews here on Yelp and elsewhere, my girlfriend and I came here to try the portobella mushroom burger.  Unfortunately they removed it from the menu (maybe location-specific?), but we had a waiter, Ryan, who highly recommended the portobella burger and said he'd check with the chef to see if someone could still make it.  He returned and said all was good, and we were able to order the portobella mushroom burger - happiness!  Highly recommended vegetarian option (choose no cheese and no aoli for a vegan option) piled high with veggies and an awesome slab of grilled onion.  Excellent. We also ordered the grilled pear and blue cheese flatbread, which was excellent and highly recommend if you're more into vegetarian options. We started with the sweet cornbread patties (3 per appetizer) and they basically filled us up.  If you like sweet cornbread (with corn kernels), this is a great option. For a side we ordered the beet salad, which surprisingly came with arugula as well.  I love beets and this was a perfect combination. We ordered way, way, way to much food.  Came home with about half of everything left, but were very happy.  Thanks again to Ryan our waiter who managed to have something made that wasn't offered on the menu! Cheers."
Dan L.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",81,59,32,5.0,11/10/2014,Cheesecake factory this place is great. No need to say anymore.
Imani A.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,26,10,5.0,4/1/2013,"I love this place!! The waiters and waitresses never blink an eye if u order too much or too little. They're attentive and friendly and quick.  The atmosphere is UH-freaking-mazing. It looks all fancy but really it's such a casual and relaxing vibe. The food- super delicious. Watch out ppl- those of u who watch ur waistlines and count ur calories (like me lol) this place can be a hazard. A thousand plus calories for each plate. Dive 4 the skinny menu!! Though I admit, more often than not I don't.  The cheesecakes are heavenly. I've only ever tried like 3 or 4 different types on different occasions (I know, I should expand more) but the ones I've had are soo good. I really end up feeling super full after coming here even if I left half my plate and took it to go. o_O; But still, amazing place!"
Gerard C.,"Santa Ynez, CA",0,5,,5.0,12/23/2015,"food was good. best part was the server JOEL K , amazing service ! you can tell he had the passion and loved his job"
Jason B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,185,7,2.0,12/11/2012,Very disappointed  The server messed up my order and brought something else. I ended up sending it back but it took another 20 minute for my food to come out. By that time all the people in my group were done eating and I had to ask the guy to box the food. So I pretty much didn't eat there. They didn't even offer to take off the bill or give me 50% off. I will not go back to this place.  They don't understand what good customer service means.
