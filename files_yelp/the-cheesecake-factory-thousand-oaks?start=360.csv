Leslie V.,"Oxnard, CA",221,143,599,4.0,5/20/2011,Cheesecake factory is a good dine in place. Food is good. The only thing I don't get is why are restaurants so freakin dim! But still manageable.  Their prices are a little pricey but the portions are good. I usually can't manage to finish my whole plate. Their chicken carbonara late is delicious.  And their cheesecake. Omg! All good! Definitely one of the best cheesecake ever! I recommend coming here if your a fan of cheesecake.
Sami E.,"Los Angeles, CA",170,58,10,5.0,10/14/2014,The Cheesecake Factory is always an amazing place to eat. It can get a little pricey but there food is so worth it. I've tried so many different things on the menu and its all delicious. Their ranch dressing is my favorite. I always enjoy my visits to cheesecake. They are always so clean and have amazing customer service. Defiantly a good date night spot.
Tanya B.,"Simi Valley, CA",217,85,29,4.0,9/26/2014,"I love their lunch specials, the Skinnylicious menu. Smaller bites and low calorie drinks is NEVER a bad thing. I wish I could finish the regular sized meals but too many leftovers . Hope to be back next time I visit The Oaks mall."
Michele B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",41,16,4,4.0,8/19/2014,The food is always so good and plentiful. The chicken artichoke soup is to die for....I'm always too full for dessert. The specials have a great variety such as the Spicy chicken chipotle pasta...it's my favorite pasta...
Katelyn D.,"Oak Park, CA",0,10,,5.0,3/2/2015,The miso salmon is off the chain and they are very friendly especially in regards to giving kids meals to people over the age of 10. Their portions are really big so I suggest sharing a few different things with the whole table
Steve R.,"Westlake Village, CA",23,399,217,3.0,4/19/2013,"Pretty good fast food, sit down, waiter service restaurant in TO Oaks Mall.  Most people know about Cheesecake Factory's menu, so I'll just say the food quality and service at this location is very good."
Bryan L.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,50,5,4.0,2/23/2015,"If you feel like you want to literally EAT A BABY and not care what everyone thinks about you, come to Cheesecake Factory! The food is always pretty good but I think its a little over priced (but you do get A LOT of food).  I hate how they have advertisements in the menu, how tacky! Oh, and dont forget to get a piece of cheesecake to eat or take home.  Best part about this place obviously."
Andrew B.,"Orange, CA",397,479,59,4.0,7/28/2014,Pretty standard as far as Cheesecake Factories go. I just wanted to write a positive review because the service was pretty good. We had a rehearsal party eating as a group and had mass cheesecakes ordered. They sliced the slices into two pieces to make it easier to share for the group. I thought that was pretty awesome.
Jess D.,"Camarillo, CA",0,49,5,3.0,11/22/2014,"I have to say Ive heard alot of hype about them but I wasn't too impressed with the food. the multi grain bread at the beginning was pretty good, but I didn't care for my chicken Alfredo. I thought the cheese cake would at least be good we ordered the turtle it was okay but very salty, so that was disappointing. On a lighter note our waitress was very nice and everyone was very attentive to our needs. I think overall the cheesecake factory felt over rated."
Robert B.,"Ayer, MA",0,11,,3.0,11/22/2014,I will not waste too much time on my review....because it seems the general populous seemed to enjoy it. I thought the food and poor service could be summed up in one word: MEDIOCRE The only thing I will be coming back for is the cheesecake...which is the only reason I even considered a 3 star rating.
Mrs. M.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,24,6,4.0,6/16/2012,"Stay for the food, don't eat the cake. Excellent Service.  Well run restaurant.  The Food: I know the cheesecake should be wonderful (considering the name) but it's not.  It is too sweet and has that defrosted from frozen quality to it.  The salads, steak, and fish entrees, however, are excellent. Also of note, I have been to the Cheesecake Factory in Corte Madera (terrible) and this one is so much better."
Heather W.,"Simi Valley, CA",67,57,2,4.0,11/9/2014,Love this place.  The staff is very friendly and professional and come on it's the Cheesecake Factory whats not to love.  The food is excellent.
Sunny D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,6,,2.0,11/5/2014,Terrible to go service.  1 person handling all dessert orders and all to go orders.  Been in line for 15 minutes.  Hostess told me that only bakery can help/handle to go orders.  No one else.  Only 1 person in bakery despite having so many to go orders.
Amy S.,"Moorpark, CA",20,83,4,2.0,10/2/2012,"If you are looking for a sit down meal after 8 :30 pm in the area, then you have The Cheesecake Factory as an option.  If not, go somewhere else is my recommendation.  For the cost and calories, it only works for me when it is my only option: til 11 on M-TH and Midnight Fri-Sat It is nice to have a later night option in Thousand Oaks."
Duane P.,"Redondo Beach, CA",16,107,37,3.0,1/21/2013,"I've been to this CF several times and overall it's been a pretty good experience.  If you've been to one CF you've been to them all in many ways, but the service at this one gets high marks considering how busy they get on the weekends.  The one issue I have with this location is the seating they added outside the restaurant in the mall.  It doesn't make you feel like you're dining in a decent restaurant at all.  It feels like you're sitting in the ""Cafe Square"" fast food section of a mall but paying restaurant prices.  So if you go be sure to specify you don't want to sit in the indoor section outside the restaurant (make sense?) as I will be sure to do from now on."
Gustavus B.,"Camarillo, CA",28,58,77,3.0,8/2/2014,"Although only had a salad and soup, the Menu continues to be impressive.  This place although not what you would call fine dining, provides volumes of good quality food.  The service is always up to par and provides a smile with your meal.  Even with the salad and soup it was still difficult to stand up from the table as the belly became an actual anchor.."
Manuel M.,"Oxnard, CA",6,21,50,3.0,10/20/2014,Normally a hit with everyone but tonight we were not impressed. The mushroom burger was fucking pink inside! Blood was oozing out. I didn't ask for a special request so it was sent out this way. They quickly replaced it when I notified the waiter and the wait want so long.
Sunil R.,"San Francisco, CA",708,2322,12,3.0,6/11/2010,Why are the portions so gigantic here? I got the lunch portion of a salad and it looked like Mt Fuji... HUGE!!!! I think majority of the folks either end up getting a doggy bag or wasting their food. That is the only nit that I have with CF which I have always liked. I take that back. The other nit is that they are alway crowded at all their locations. They have a huge variety of options which is good.  Our waitress was a sweetheart. She was sweet enough to laugh at my unfunny jokes. Had to have dessert against my better judgement after a huge salad. The chocolate rasberry truffle was rich and good. Overall CF is a better option than most other chains.
Anna Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",680,113,53,4.0,4/4/2012,"Okay I've been here before- yes it gets busy, BUT we came here on a Tuesday night at around 9PM and we got seated immediately. After 3 hours of intense shoe shopping, we were starving and this place hit the spot! I ordered: CHICKEN BELLAGIO 14.50 Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Sala What?!!! This sounds like such a strange combination of flavors but this was absolutely an amazing dish. I love all of these ingredients separately and together-they just worked. I'm still excited to eat my left overs for lunch, so I get 2 meals out of one. Bomb. Also, our waitress- blonde haired girl- was a doll !!!! She was so wonderful. She was attentive and I appreciated her upbeat/kind attitude even though it was near the end of her busy shift and she must have been exhausted. Totally impressed Cheesecake. Rock on."
Ashley B.,"Santa Barbara, CA",61,108,142,5.0,7/26/2012,"-Hate the wait -SERVERS ARE PERSONABLE AND VERY ATTENTIVE =]  -Love the bread (You get filled up on that ALONE)  -The avocado egg rolls are simply to die for, I like the buffalo blasts too  -Ranch and blue cheese is homemade and A MUST for dipping -The California Cheese Steak is my first Love -The Kobe Burger is my second -Strawberry Shortcake is HUGE and must be shared with at least two other people -Love the banana cheesecake as well and I hate cheesecake!  -You walk in ten pounds thinner and walk out feeling like you gained the freshman 15 in the course of an hour. It's awesome."
