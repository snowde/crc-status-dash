K S.,"Calabasas, CA",0,23,1,4.0,3/19/2014,"Love the Skinny Small Bites - good selection, good prices, all delicious! I'll split 3 little plates with a girlfriend, and we'll be full. Always nice wait staff. Big place, lots of different options for seating: at the bar, bar tables, booths, indoor, outdoor, in-mall ""patio."" Love the squaw bread. Complaint: It's way too crammed at the hostess booth - they need to make the glass cases smaller and move the hostess area out from around the corner."
John L.,"Valencia, CA",83,37,,5.0,7/24/2012,"Came here for my mom's birthday.  We had a pretty decent sized party (6 Adults, 2 Toddlers and 2 Kids).  I was expecting the normal service when you have a big party, server ignoring you because their tip is already set.  But I was pleased to find out that the service was very very good. Out waitress Jennifer did a great job at making sure we were doing good and was on top of getting re-fills and condiments we were asking for.  Food was good as usual but the service is top notch."
Asefeh N.,"Woodland Hills, CA",45,2,,5.0,9/21/2014,Great service!  Amazing ppl and great location.  There food is amazing and consistent never a disappointment.  Love the Chipotle chicken pasta and hibachi steak yum !
Val S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/23/2016,"This happened last Friday June 17th and I am still so mad about it!!!!! We got there at 4pm for happy hour and were promptly seated. We ordered cocktails and our server was quite pleasant and helpful. However after we ordered dinner and more cocktails our server left for the evening and we were introduced to our new server Savannah. From the get go she was unpleasant and made us feel unwelcomed! What a sad difference from our previous server. We tried to make small talk and engage her but she was rude. I made a comment about my drink "" evaporating"" and that I would like to order another. She right away gave me a dirty look and so I told her who our DD was and that I was not driving. I again explained that we were going to a movie and I was not driving. She said nothing and walked away. Next thing I know she has the manager walk over my cocktail to see if I was ok. The manager was very professional and explained that this was my 4th cocktail in 2 hours and they would be liable if I fell or something. We chatted for a bit and he was satisfied that I was not drunk and gave me my cocktail. He also offered to extend the happy hour price for me. Savannah came back and was completely rude, dismissive and has no business working the bar area if she is going to pass judgement on people! If she had taken the time to chat and ask questions she would have been satisfied that we were not out of control. The icing on the cake is when we had a gentleman join us and all of a sudden she had a personality and actually chatted with him. I come here with my coworkers for happy hour to celebrate birthdays, work anniversaries, engagements etc.. THIS WILL NOT BE HAPPENING ANYMORE! We will all take our business to  Farfalla Trattoria in Westlake. The menu is better and their servers are all very pleasant! The sad fact is we are all in the customer service industry and we have already shared this terrible experience with many people."
Kevin R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,3,,2.0,11/30/2015,I went to the Cheesecake Factory in Thousand Oaks CA hearing good things about it I was pleased and not. The wait was long and then we got sat down and took a while to get the food. The food was very great my thanks to the chefs. But then I had a little issue and I asked to see manager and they sent me the floor manager. Mr John winter. He was no help at all. I can tell by the look on the mans face he is not responsible enough to carry the restaurant. Didn't seem professional. Man needs more training. But my compliments to the chefs in the back
Jason P.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/12/2014,Food was pretty good.  But absolutely horrible services. From the host to the general manager. Food took so long and one person in our party didn't get food until 15 minutes after the rest of us did.
Kate C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",45,26,9,4.0,6/25/2012,"Yeah, it's a chain, but don't say that like it's a bad thing... This Cheesecake factory always delivers. I love the atrium seating! The lemoncello torte is a personal favorite!"
Maricela R.,"Oxnard, CA",194,257,754,3.0,9/19/2012,The boyfriend took me there on a date and it wasn't great it was just ok. The place was so full we had to wait a while before we got to sit down. The food was pricey and even though it was good it was not delicious. The service was not great but I could understand why because they are so busy and have so many customers to take care of. I love their cheesecakes but if you're trying to watch your calories stay away from them. I would go back but only for a special occasion.
Alice A.,"Granada Hills, CA",539,143,31,4.0,12/21/2011,I like this CF because the times I have been here it's not crazy packed.. Perhaps because its during the weekday! We get seated right away and the atmosphere feels good! We always get very friendly waiters who know what's up!  My favorite dish would be the chicken & biscuit! I love love love that dish even more when I am craving comfort food! The servings are massive and I always end up taking more than half home.. It is apart of the mall so parking will never be an issue.. big plus! will for sure keep coming to this location
Daniel M.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,104,23,5.0,6/9/2015,"I came here for dinner with two of my friends and we had Domingo as the server.  First off,  the Cheesecake Factory always has amazing quality food and great service and our server Domingo did not disappoint.  He was really nice and super helpful.  Second, the food came hot and amazing as promised and very delicious.  I love this place and love the food even more.  I will be coming back as I have been for many years to this location and would recommend it to all my friends and family."
Carrie D.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,7,,2.0,4/8/2015,I should have known better to come to this place.   Salad had no dressing and there was no toilet paper in the ladies room.   Waste of $60. Mall rats everywhere.  People's kids running a muck.
J.Steve I.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,12,,1.0,1/24/2015,"Once again another terrible experience at the Thousand Oaks CheeseCake Factory. I swore tha last time I was mistreated there that I would never go back, but unfortunately my daughter and her fiancé had a gift card they wanted to take advantage of, and we were celebrating a belated birthday for my daughter.  The following was a comedy of errors and screw-ups that made for an extremely frustrating experience. To keep tis short and succinct I will simply list them. 1) specified to the hostess we wished to eat inside. (as it was blowing 20 knots outside) 2) when we finally were notified we had a table the first hostess could not find our res.  3) after the first hostess abandoned us, the second tried to lead us to a table outside! when we told her we had asked for a table inside, she told us it would be another 20 minute wait!  4) 40 minutes later, we are led to a bar booth barely big enough for 4. they stick a chair on the end of the table, in the middle of the aisle directly adjacent to the entrance to the bar area. (I might as well have been seated in the middle of the freeway. 5) wait forever to get 2 beers, while sitting 10 feet from the bar 6) when we finally get our drinks the waiter forgets straws, we ask for straws and then don't see him for another 15 minutes. Finally ask a passing waiter for some straws, he walks 10 feet away and gets the straws. 7) the table is cluttered with 5 services and I try to flag a waiter to clear some of the extraneous junk, and even after yelling at a passing waiter finally have to remove the stuff myself and dump it at a wait station. 8) our first order of starters arrive and because of the lack of space I have to get up and stand back so the waiter can serve.  9) I have never had this next one happen before.... A waiter comes to our table and asks us if they can bring our entrees to the table because they are up in the ""window"" (even though the starters have only been on the table a few minutes.) We figure we can stand that and agree. A moment later the entrees arrive and it becomes glaringly clear that there is not enough room at the table for all the plates. I am forced to stand up and step back again while the servers figure out the mess on our table. I want to point out that I have not ordered an entree. I remark to the waiter that if I had, where would I have put my plates? And further point out that 5 people should never be seated at a 4 place table! He mutters something about ""we do it all the time"" I am now furious. 10) some guy who does not identify himself, comes over and asks, "" Is there something I can help you with?"" I am so angry I can barely speak! Fortunately my future son-in-law calmly explains to him how poorly we have been treated. The ""manager?"" apologizes about 50 times but offers nothing more than to seat us somewhere else in the middle of our dinner!!!!!  This same guy trips over the back of my chair later and makes no remark...... I have lived in this valley for over 50 years. I used to play on the property that this restaurant occupies. When the mall was constructed and The Cheesecake Factory opened we thought we had hit the big time. Sadly, in my experience, it is run like a cafeteria, the only thing they care about is stuffing you in the joint and then making sure you get out as fast as you can. I do not recommend this place to anyone."
Donna C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,15,4,3.0,9/9/2015,The Cheesecake Factory  seems to be always too crowded and not enough staff. we had a party of 6 it took over 45 minutes to seat us and it took over 45 minutes to get our food out. needless to say I probably won't be coming back
Greg W.,"Agoura Hills, CA",103,661,80,4.0,5/20/2014,I like this location and think its a win overall.  The menu is very broad and I have never had a bad meal here in years. They will do what they must to take care of any problem.  The sizes are good so you will leave full no matter what you get.  Pricing is about average for a nicer restaurant.
Kurt S.,"Newbury Park, CA",7,20,,5.0,6/20/2015,"I've eaten here numerous times over the last 20 years. During our most recent visit to the thousand oaks location, shortly after being seated, we were approached by the manager and asked if we would move tables to make room for a large party.  This was a simple request which we were happy to oblige, but he went out of his way to compensate us for this gesture.   The level of customer service exceeded my expectations."
Naomi H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",179,122,194,4.0,7/31/2012,"I come here maybe once a month as it's a nice spot to grab lunch or dinner with my friends or family. Since I find the portions at Cheesecake a little much, I tend to lean more on the small plates and snacks menu. I usually go for my Ahi Tartar that comes neatly stacked on cut up avocado with soy ginger sauce with sesame seeds sprinkled all over. It's a great item to have on it's own and if I'm hungry I order 2 items from the small plates menu, usually the shrimp summer rolls (both on the Skinnylicious menu!) or a flat bread pizza. You really can't go wrong with the small plates and snacks menu. You might as well mix it up since it has a bunch of great options, instead of paying $15 to $20 bucks for a ridiculously big meal that you end of taking home and just maybe throwing it out.  I believe the pricing at the Thousand Oaks location for the items mentioned above run  about $6 and there are many other yummy options to choose from: Stuffed Mushrooms, Beets with Goat Cheese Salad, Freshly baked flat bread pizzas (a total steal, its actually pretty big for an individual pizza!) So next time you Cheesecake it, load up on the inexpensive small plates and snacks menu (the SkinnyLicious menu is fantastic too!) and do it Tapas style!  Next time I stop by I'll check out their Happy Hour!"
Addie H.,"Newbury Park, CA",13,17,7,3.0,6/14/2014,"This is the place you want to go to if you want many options to choose from. That being said there are too many choices, the menu is like reading a short book. It is pricy but understandable foe their large portions. It is great food but if they scaled back with the endless list of food items and focus on the food being the best then it should get five stars."
Peggy B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,,5.0,7/12/2014,"My husband & I went here for our 44th Wedding Anniversary lunch.  Elizabeth, our waitress, did the most incredible thing for us.  I reminded her that she was my waitress that the last time I was there. I was glad that she was my waitress this time. I casually mentioned that it was our 44th anniversary. She said: Oh!  You know I forgotten your name, my name is Elizabeth.  So we reintroduced ourselves.  (That was her very clever way of getting our names.) At the end of the meal, she brought each of us a dinner plate with our name and Happy 44th Anniversary written out in chocolate with a little sunday in the middle with a candle! You just don't get any kinder than that!!! She made a memory for us that will never forget.   THANK YOU,  ELIZABETH!!!!!  (And Cheesecake Factory for hiring great people like this.)"
MM K.,"Torrance, CA",0,5,,2.0,3/22/2015,"My husbands meal had a 2"" piece of cardboard in it.. Do they unwrap food from a package and warm it up? If so part of it ended up in his food. Our server alerted the manager who seemed annoyed at having to address an issue rather than walk around. We really didn't want to have any reason to complain since the other patrons on either side of us seemed to have several complaints.. We kept our order simple but this was unavoidable."
Jason D.,"San Francisco, CA",150,164,4849,5.0,7/8/2012,Excellent service and good food! I recommend the Chicken Bellagio. But their cheesecakes are too sweets!
