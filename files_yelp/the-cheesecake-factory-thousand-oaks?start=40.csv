D B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,34,15,2.0,12/31/2017,"I am just putting up a review of the last two visits we have taken to this location December 18th and 30th, 2017. We waited over an hour for a table both times which was fine. They provide pagers and they extend into the mall.  You don't have to sit and wait in front of the restaurant.  It's the same as any Cheesecake Factory anywhere. The food choices, the ambiance, and service were all great. I don't know what happened at this location but the taste of the food these last two visits, one being just last night, were awful.  December 18th, 2017: My husband and I ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad and I like the Skinny Factory Salad. Neither salad was that usual Cheesecake Factory plump hearty salad. It seemed like portions were less.  They were both lame and just didn't taste as fresh as they should have.  Last night December 30th, 2017: The food was really bad. My husband order the Jambalaya Pasta and I ate Chicken Madeira.  These two dishes were terrible. The jambalaya veggies and shrimp were overcooked and burnt.  The top of the dish was all black. There was very little pasta in the bottom of the dish.  It was dry tasting. My husband was hungry so he just ate it. Not good at all.  My chicken was burnt as well. I was eating charred chicken.  The mashed potatoes were not smashed enough.  Maybe these experiences are temporary and this location and can get it back eventually.  It was very busy both times but it's no excuse to serve food like this and for the price it shouldn't be substandard. I'm hoping a manager takes note of this review and can make improvements to the kitchen."
Marina H.,"Camarillo, CA",1,50,23,2.0,3/10/2017,"Been a while since we've eaten at this particular location. Service was excellent, food was pretty awful. Avocado egg rolls.... always a hit with us, this time they were just ok. I had the chopped salad - it was just awful. Way too much dressing so all was wilted. The place was so packed & we were so hungry i ate 1/2 of it & left.  I'd normally complain but had a busy week & just wanted to get home. Going to be a while before we head back in."
Feras B.,"Tarzana, Los Angeles, CA",153,3,1,2.0,10/15/2017,We came in for lunch time and ordered 3 Peach Bellinis with our food which took some time to get. The first two my friend and I didn't taste any champagne at all it just tasted like a smoothie. Even wondered why I got I.D.ed for this. Then when the 3rd one came it finally tasted like how it should. I explained to one of the waitresses and she said she'd tell our server but no one came to address the problem and we ended up just leaving after paying the bill. Other than that the food was good but I just wish I got what I paid for..
Jason D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,1,4.0,7/15/2017,"I like the location in the mall, very nice set up, I prefer the patio The food quality and the service are what you expect from a well know place, the strawberry cheesecake is our favorite with veggie sandwich for my son and steak combo for me Every time we go there I find something new I like, never disappointed!"
Marin C.,"Traverse City, MI",71,1159,175,5.0,2/12/2017,"Delicious!  Sheila salad for me- lunch sized, cashews, avo, chicken, honey peanut dressing. My mom had the falafel salad, she approved. She had their tropical tea. We split a piece of mango key lime cheesecake. Mango mousse, key lime + cream cheese, with a coconut macaroon crust. So decadent, tasty though."
J.R W.,"Port Hueneme, CA",0,56,19,3.0,6/13/2017,"We dropped in here for lunch, June 6. 2017. Our last experience here was forgettable. We entered the Restaurant to an empty hostess station, and mostly empty restaurant. After waiting for a while, I inquired from a food preparer if we seat ourselves, he said someone would be right with us. As I am just about to abandon my quest for lunch the hostess comes strolling up the isle with a handful of menus. She's in no rush, stopped by the menu table deposited the menus, and made sure they were all square and straight. She did a very good job, clearly this is where her talent lies. And, to no surprise she grabbed the same menus for us, she spent so much time straightening. Eventually, we were seated. Now things picked up dramatically from here. Andie B, is a poster child of how wait service should be. A five star rating for Andie. She knew the menu, helped with drink selection, made recommendations, and was very attentive without over doing it. Great job Andie! If some of Andie could be rubbed off on the dozy hostess I would give an extra star in my rating. Because of Andie, we will be back."
Carol N.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,46,3,1.0,8/3/2016,"We get takeout from this location about every week because it's open late.  The service is sometimes great and sometimes bad. The food is usually fine, sometimes really good, but more often than not, it's just fine.  Today the service was ok but the food was TERRIBLE. Literally EVERY SINGLE shrimp in my $18.95 (plus tax and tip) was BURNED and rubbery.  The spicy chicken sandwich was bland because there was barely any sauce on it.  The food is expensive so I expect a LITTLE bit of care and some pride in the food they serve but our meal today was sloppy, substandard and a total waste of our money. We'll be making plans to avoid having this as our only dining option going forward."
Mariah M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",173,139,147,2.0,3/31/2017,"Cheesecake factor food and desserts are always spot on, but service here is not the best. I ordered curbside take out twice and been let down. I ordered just fettuccine alfredo. I called to tell them I was there and no one came out for about 20 minutes. Last time I ordered the BBQ burger and they forgot 2 ingredients, the side of fries were also cold by the time I got home (10 min drive). I'm only here because I have a gift card honestly."
Carley H.,"Simi Valley, CA",49,10,,1.0,4/29/2017,"Well... the waitress and the food were fine, but the manager tonight was just not a suitable fit for the service industry.  Upon arrival, she snapped at my brother who had called the night before to tell the restaurant we would be coming with a large party for my niece's birthday, and to ask what the protocol was since they don't take reservations. My brother did exactly what the restaurant told him to do. He arrived early, at the time they asked, but upon arrival the manager snapped at my brother and argued and told him that she was going to make him wait 2 hours. Completely unprofessional. She must have realized she was out of line because she did apologize for her behavior.  However, when we left, my niece accidentally left one of her cards with a gift card at the table. We had been standing outside for now longer than 10 minutes before we realized. I went back in to ask about it and she went to the back and came out to say, ""No sorry. I have an honest staff, so it's probably in the trash."" Ummm, okay so go check. That's your job. If it's in the trash it will still be on top!  As a manager in a Cheesecake Factory, one of your biggest responsibilities is CUSTOMER SERVICE! The manager tonight needs some serious training in how not to be a jerk.  I understand it was my 11 year old niece that mistakenly left the card, but the excuse should not be, ""we're honest here and it's probably in the trash."" No bueno Cheesecake Factory, Thousand Oaks!"
Isaac K.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",52,29,,4.0,2/26/2017,"Came in with my sister. The food was good and the server Nancy was attractive. Would return for the server, possibly for the food depending on how hungry I am."
Elaina P.,"Oxnard, CA",111,30,66,3.0,5/24/2017,"For whatever reason Cheesecake Factory is always busy. Their food is not great, just good. Seems to be a standard choice for families and groups.  Their menu is PACKED. It has SO MANY options (American... Asian, Mexican, Italian... I suppose that the American way is to have it all) You think every item can't possibly be good. I suppose you'd have to try everything to know. Service is hit and miss. Really just depends when you go.  There is always a wait in the evenings to be seated. Usually quite a bit of a wait. Though they did just finish their outdoor patio area which adds a decedent amount of seating.  I will note the Lemon Garlic Shrimp with angel hair pasta is very tasty. Looks simple but the flavor is great and the shrimp are a good size (A bit pricey in my opinion for 5 shrimp, a few asparagus pieces and some angel hair pasta with sauce - I ordered it as take out for lunch and it was $19.25) Cheesecake options are endless... for sure my Achilles heel."
W Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,166,5,3.0,1/22/2017,"The food is decent and the staff is professional, friendly, quick and efficient.  My complaint is about the patio. We sat out there for dinner, only to smell sewer the entire time we ate. I know cheesecake factory can't control it, but for future guests, be aware. They do however have nice heating lamps to keep people warm if dining out at night in the cold. We chose the patio so we didn't have to wait 45 minutes to be seated in doors."
Tracey C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",33,28,1,5.0,9/4/2017,My kids love this place;make sure you have a reservation.  I tend to avoid the mall but this place is worth the trip; big portions; save room for the cheesecake
Lyn M.,"Glendale, CA",0,9,4,4.0,9/12/2017,"We had dinner the other night celebrated the birthday of my daughter, great food and friendly staff.. cheesecake factory is the best cheesecake ever..i will definitely recommend this!"
Kacey B.,"Simi Valley, CA",19,1,,1.0,8/26/2017,"Takeout SUCKS! I couldn't even get a takeout person to answer my call. First I waited on hold for 10 minutes and when they did answer, they hung up on me. When I called back, the person who answered was rude and I had to wait another 10 minutes to place my order. They need to work on their bakery service."
Brittney P.,"Simi Valley, CA",94,34,17,5.0,2/14/2017,Great Cheesecake Factory.....one of our favorites! Great management and staff and the food is always perfect!
Rachelle B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,15,,1.0,11/23/2017,"Bought a cheesecake for Thanksgiving from here. Asked when we picked it up yesterday when to thaw it. He told us 4-6 hours in a fridge. So this morning I take the cheesecake out of the freezer and put it in the fridge to thaw. 7 hours later I pull it out and it's still partially frozen and the strawberries on top are mostly frozen. It's frustrating to pay so much money for cheesecake and have an employee give you the wrong information so you end up not having dessert to serve after Thanksgiving dinner. I guess I should have researched the info instead of asking the employe, I just assumed he would know. I looked up the info after I realized my cheesecake wasn't fully thawed and according to the website it says to allow  8-12 hours."
Anna A.,"Oxnard, CA",911,252,1008,5.0,12/1/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is my favorite chain restaurant next to Buca di Beppo. Everything here is very good, and they have happy hour at the bar. Their avocado rolls are the best! And I love the baked potato soup. The cocktails are great and they can make most of them in the skinny version. I love the bread that they give out, though it's a dangerous slope with the bread. Funny thing is, I've never even had cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory."
Ken F.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1274,755,8717,4.0,6/2/2016,Not much to say. It is the Cheesecake Factory. Very corporate. But they do a good job for what they do. They have a few excellent dishes and good sandwiches.
