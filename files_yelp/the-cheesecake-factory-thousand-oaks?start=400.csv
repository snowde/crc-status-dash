Jonattan R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",45,23,,5.0,2/18/2012,"Much smaller than many other Cheesecake Factories so the wait can get out of control sometimes especially on the weekends but they are pretty good about giving you an accurate quote time. The food like all Cheesecake Factories is superb! The fresh grade ""A"" ingredients they use make a great meal. Food is always hot and fresh and huge portions; definitely you get your money's worth. Out of all American chain restaurants The Cheesecake Factory is the best. The staff here is friendly clean and full of cool interesting people to spark up a conversation with. It is a little loud inside though so I would recommend sitting in the patio or the atrium. Recommended dishes and appetizers: Chicken Marcel Blanc Four Cheese Pasta Anything on the Sunday Brunch Menu (Sundays 10am-2pm) Avocado Egg rolls Sweetcorn Tamale Cakes Recommended desserts: Dulce de Leche Cheesecake Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake Adams Peanut Butter Cheesecake"
Keith M.,"Camarillo, CA",0,3,,2.0,8/10/2013,"Food is excellent here! I'm just not sure why the service isn't better :( I am a manager of a local restaurant myself so when I go out to eat I pray for a great server so I can leave them a nice 30% tip because I know how the industry is. Unfortunately our server was terrible. Not sure what her name was, tall girl, black hair who could care less about her job. Didn't introduce herself, didn't ask how we were doing, did not ask us if we had any questions about the menu and only checked on us once. I still gave her a 20% tip because that's just how I am. It's a shame because I love the Cheesecake Factory, but next time I go out to eat I will still to Wood Ranch or Lure Fish House because they clearly pride themselves on superior service, as do I."
Sarah B.,"Newbury Park, CA",47,10,,5.0,7/19/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory! So many different food options that would satisfy anyone's palate. Great service as well, but usually packed with people. Lastly the food portions are generally large so bring your appetite."
Chris S.,"Simi Valley, CA",16,28,22,4.0,10/5/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is a usual haunt for me because of its consistency of good dishes. This location has mediocre service. Most of the waiters and waitresses always seem to be flustered or in a bad mood here. Although, if your able to pick a waiter, pick a man the name of Joel, he's one of the best waiters I've had at any place. I don't do anything on the menu except for the pastas and appetizers. Their pastas are some of the best around as well as the appetizers. Dish Recommendation: Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic (probably the best dish on the 50 page menu)"
Victoria M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",932,468,310,3.0,11/15/2011,"There was a 40-minute wait for ""first available"" on a Friday night, so we walked around the mall for a while until our buzzer went off.  We were guided (by a new host who smelled like he had just smoked a pack of cigarettes outside before his shift) to our seat, which was right by the patio door.  The table for 2 was really only big enough for 1 and as people went in and out to the patio, I froze the entire time while eating my dinner.  I ordered the meatloaf, which was good; had a sweet taste, maybe the carrots??  It was good, but not MY meatloaf!  Hubbie got the shepherd's pie which was astounding!  Yummm...   Oversized portions led us to take home an entire meal for the next day."
E J.,"Simi Valley, CA",659,92,12,3.0,10/26/2013,"Cheesecake Factory never fails went there today for my birthday!!! The service was excellent but tonight the food was not as grand ;""( ... Even so I will not give up on CcF..of course the desert is always pleasing"
C T.,"San Buenaventura (Ventura), CA",8,19,22,4.0,7/31/2013,Good variety on menu.  Food is dependable at any of their restaurant.
Neil E.,"Monterey, CA",1,25,56,4.0,8/11/2012,Good family restaurant. Food is good and service is attentive. I always opt for the 'lite' menu. We eat here about once a month. Always a line. Definitely a step above Olive Garden ...
Jennifer G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,21,,5.0,8/16/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory has been great every time we go. We average a 15 minute wait Thursday/Friday evenings. Love the Factory Nachos or Fried Zucchini. I recommend the Chicken Katsu, Americana Burger, and any  Cheesecake! I recommend not sitting in the atrium as it can be a little noisy. Very romantic inside and great service always."
Steve P.,"Newbury Park, CA",2,5,,1.0,1/2/2015,I decided to do curbside pick up this evening for dinner. The wait was over 45 minutes and my food was cold really? Come on Cheesecake Factory get it together I don't care if you're busy inside if you tell me to pick up my food in 45 minutes and I'm there to pick it up don't make me wait another 45 minutes geez!!!
Patti S.,"Port Hueneme, CA",32,11,,2.0,8/13/2015,"Restaurants with large menus are not my thing..I'm a ""mom and pop""/""hole in the wall""/or better yet...""boutique"" type restaurant kinda girl. But, this fit the bill as I was meeting a friend who would be in the area. We arrived at opening and ordered off the Lunch Specials Menu. I ordered the Chicken Salad Sandwich which came with a side salad. The Chicken Salad Sandwich just tasted ""off""...the chicken tasted like fish....but, I could a few more bits until I just could not stand it. Ugh. I should have told our waitstaff but I kept thinking it was me...and, honestly, it could have been. Finally, I did ask the waitstaff if I could have a sample thinking I may find that what I had been given was that a piece of fish was given instead of chicken...but, she said that all the chicken salad was already portioned out. She did offer to give me something else but I declined...had lost my appetite at that point. I honestly don't know if it was me or not...but, my stomach did feel queasy the rest of the day as well. Anyway, its a beautiful restaurant and my friend was happy with her meal. I have not had a lot of luck here in CA with Chicken Salad anyway...its best in Texas and in the South in general."
Kim L.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,12,4,2.0,8/4/2013,"The food is always consistently good.  But service... well, I was there with my family and was definitely not impressed by the service at this location.  We were there about a little before 9 on a weekend and it felt like the staff cared more about cleaning up to go home than making sure we had bread or drinks even though they don't close until 11 or 12 on the weekends.  We spent over $200 there before tip and deserved better service than what we got."
Michael A.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,15,,4.0,3/2/2013,"The obvious:  best cheesecake selection in the world.  My wife likes the red velvet. Great appetizers: avocado eggrolls, corn cakes and lettuce wraps.  Great salads, sandwiches and selection of beers on tap.  Best dish according to my wife is spicy cashew chicken and she orders it with a side of thin pasta instead of white rice. I know the wait is long but get there early.  The service has usually been very good.  Just a good chain restaurant.  We usually go once a month because they have a good selection of food at a reasonable price."
Michael B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",195,45,3,5.0,5/18/2014,"The quality of Food usually outpaces the customer service. It's not an indication of bad service but great food over pretty good service. I've never had an experience that I walked away from CKF saying, ""this food was all right or the service ruined my delicious food."" The menu can satisfy anyone with any taste given how cumbersome the food selection is. Just went on friday and noticed some bad reviews of people needlessly complaining on yelp."
Dwp R.,"Simi Valley, CA",6,11,2,5.0,6/22/2014,Great service. Food looks amazing and taste amazing. Ask to sit in Joels station. He knows his menu and will take very good care of you. Very seldom these days do people take pride in their jobs. Hats off to you Joel! Tip well deserved.
Jewel L.,"Los Angeles, CA",90,448,8,4.0,11/21/2013,"Huge menu, now with a skinny menu, and gluten free menu...great options!"
Justin M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",192,20,3,5.0,11/30/2013,My girl friend and I came and the food was amazing I loved it we were so stuffed. We got the four cheese pasta and it was amazing the sauce was really creamy. But then are server was really good his name was Shane. And he was really busy but he was able to cater to our every need!!! And was very personable. As lame as it might sound it made our time even better!!
Amanda M.,"Camarillo, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/18/2013,We were with a large party and had to wait over 3 hours to get a table. The staff was not accommodating and kept messing up and seating other large groups before us. I love this restaurant but I was very unhappy with this specific location.
Anthony N.,"Los Angeles, CA",831,593,2353,5.0,5/9/2011,"Hoity Toity foodies step off, I don't care for your attitude or your holy than thou prescribed bias on food and chain restaurants.  I care about how the food tastes, I could care less if it came out of a shack cooked by a homeless person on Santa Monica Blvd. GLAM BURGER? REALLY CHEESECAKE? REALLY? If I didn't like this place I'd have some snide comment. Has anyone tried their Farmhouse Burger?  It is effing awesome!  Medium Rare Kobe with smoked and grilled pork belly with a sunny side egg and I asked for a Garlic Aoili on it with spinach and pepper Jack...Sounds Good huh?  It was awesome!  I get the sweet potato fries with the chipotle dipping sauce because I can.  BOMB. Dot. COm! The chicken Madeira is a favorite of mine.  As well as the ""Philly"" cheesesteak, its not authenitc but its pretty delish.  I also like that they have Heifenweizen on tap!   The last time I went the chubby waitress was kinda bitchy to my friend.  I didn't really appreciate it, but the food was still good and since I was a bit drunk I didn't really care.  But other than that instance, I've gotten pretty good service here."
Barry K.,"Agoura Hills, CA",28,206,3,5.0,3/8/2014,Food was good and the service was excellent. I like that they are attentive. I never had to ask for a refill of our drinks.
