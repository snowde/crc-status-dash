K. B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",82,9,,2.0,7/31/2015,"Very irritated. I called to place an order for two cheesecakes and they put me on hold for twenty minutes! I don't know why I waited that long I guess they were waiting for me to hang up. they finally answered 5 minutes before they closed and sounded very irritated by repeatedly saying ""you can place your order only if you come before 11"" How am I supposed to get there in 5 minutes? I understand coming in 5 minutes to get an order can be annoying but I called in 20 minutes before and i'm pretty certain they made me wait that long so I could give up and hang up."
Mac N.,"Oxnard, CA",4,117,26,2.0,10/10/2013,"Okay..I've eaten at several of these chains and am only speaking about this specific Cheesecake Factory.  Previous to my most recent visit, I have dined at this specific restaurant four or five times without any issues. My cousin and I met up for a dinner during the week. Since it wasn't a weekend, the wait was less than five minutes (yay!).  We were seated in the area near the kitchen which are ""booths"" only one person wide.   While waiting for our meal to come out, I thought I saw something crawling on the side of the wall.  It was hard to tell since the lighting is dim and the walls are dark, so we both disregarded it and continued to talk.  When our meals came out we had no complaints.  I had a chicken dish (I can't remember what).  Halfway through our meal we BOTH saw something crawling on the wall, but we were unable to kill it.  A few minutes later, a bug (which looked like a baby roach!) crawled across her bread plate!  She killed it with her napkin and we promptly called the manager.  He comped our meals and asked us if we wanted dessert (really?)! We were only halfway through eating...we tipped and left sans dessert because of how disgusted we were. I liked dining here previous to this experience.  The bug probably came from the dark paneled walls...but just seeing it crawl across a plate is a strong enough memory to keep me away from here for good."
Honest R.,"Orcutt, CA",0,15,5,5.0,8/26/2014,"The customer service is always fantastic and the food is great! I've gone here twice, each time with a different waiter and they never seem to disappoint! Definitely the best service I've ever received at a restaurant. I recommend trying to strawberry shortcake, it's delicious. Definitely coming back."
John A.,"Newbury Park, CA",24,43,2,1.0,6/26/2011,I will start this off my saying that I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. On average the establishment is clean and and the food is satisfying.  The Cheesecake Factory is Thousand Oaks is BELOW normal Cheesecake Factory standards and below most roach coach standards. On a recent visit I observed a bus boy wipe a nearby table off and then proceeded to wipe the booth off as well. Then the bus boy took the same rag and re-wiped the top of the table off with it! Very disappointing. Throughout the meal the bus boys walked by with their rags with stunk with the smell of cleaner and bleach. I thought it was just myself who noticed this but it soon became a table topic as everyone was able to smell the odors. If you want the Cheesecake Factory its worth the extra drive to find another location.
Mr. G.,"Oxnard, CA",5,26,2,5.0,4/3/2014,"I been here only two times, but I gots to say the food was amazing. Its a pricey but its worth it. First vist I got the chicken madeira, and 2nd vist was the spicy chipotle pasta. The bomb!!!"
Fidan B.,"Simi Valley, CA",75,63,112,4.0,10/23/2014,the place is awesome! they just get too busy and you get  lost in the craziness. but they have an awesome variety and the food is always going to be delicious. they have the most amazing kobe beef burger. ever. ever ever.
Anna K.,"Los Angeles, CA",358,201,243,3.0,9/18/2011,"Came here for my dad's birthday lunch on a Sunday. It was very crowded and the line for seating was extremely long (on a Sunday afternoon? Very interesting). I was put down on the waitlist for 5 people, and the girl told me it would be around a 20-25 minute wait. It actually was more like a 2 minute wait, which was awesome for us!  We were seated promptly and given our bread and drinks very quickly. The sourdough bread at Cheesecake is always blah (especially compared to the sourdough I am used to eating at Boudin), but I always love me some good squaw bread. Yumm. Our server was insanely nice and friendly. He made us all feel really welcome and happy.  The reason I am giving this place a 3-star review is the food -- although (as always) large in size, colorful, and beautiful, it simply is not that exciting and delicious to a foodie that's used to scrumptious mom-and-pop restaurant food. We got buffalo wings with blue cheese dressing, 2 different salads, and 2 pasta dishes. They were all ok, but for what we got, definitely not worth the $90 price tag!!  We had a nice time at Cheesecake for a birthday lunch, but I need to remind my sister to stop suggesting Cheesecake Factory for family get-togethers if we want tastebud-tingling food on special occasions."
Sandy P.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",40,43,,4.0,8/23/2015,I like this place especially the cakes:) the service I find is good I enjoyed it def will b e nback
Troy W.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,24,,5.0,4/28/2014,"I am writing this review for one reason...   the macaroni and cheese hamburger!!  The genius who came up with this simple, unique creation should be given the culinary equivalent of a Nobel Peace Prize!   To say blending mac n cheese with a hamburger is akin to the first time chocolate and peanut butter were put together is not any sort of crazy exaggeration. BRAVO Cheesecake Factory!!!"
Amber D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",13,27,5,4.0,3/27/2014,I ordered to go and it was ready very fast! Very nice feeling . Live the location. The food is just great!
Amanda Y.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",5,4,,4.0,5/30/2014,I love this place. The staff is always friendly and whenever I come on my lunch break the service is always fast and efficient. The only thing that keeps me from putting five stars is that they wouldn't let me make a reservation for my birthday.
Sheila H.,"Newbury Park, CA",85,59,23,5.0,9/7/2013,Hands down the best Happy Hour for your money!  Delicious $5 appetizers (that look more like a meal) and $5 cocktails.  Can't beat it!
Jang P.,"Westlake Village, CA",160,25,1,5.0,5/24/2015,"My girlfriend and I come to cheesecake factory quite often. Id say once a week because we love the food and the service. I have to say the past couple times we have been lucky enough to be served by Luca (I believe that is the correct spelling of his name). Luca is a great server. Everything is on point even the simple things like water refills being done, being courteous and just being a really good guy. Hope he is at cheesecake for a while because he is great. Thanks Luca!"
Matt K.,"Belmont, CA",5,57,9,5.0,9/30/2013,"Love the cheese cakes and love this Cheesecake Factory. Visiting So. Cal with mom last week, stop by The Oaks for shop and lunch. Service was professional great compared to bay area Cheesecake F. I means all about server, he knows what customer favorite. Most server don't know what I'm thinking but he does!!! Chicken dishes were absolute delicious, initially not willing to choose because I'm not chicken person. Must go!"
Elizabeth D.,"Santa Paula, CA",0,4,3,3.0,6/30/2014,Usually I love this place but the last time my husband and i were here my salmon was under cooked :(
Leticia M.,"San Fernando, CA",0,6,,4.0,6/29/2015,I love this restaurant the food is great and the price is just right.  The employees are great and offer one of the best customer services around.  The employees really go out of their way to make sure that your needs are met.  I have never had a bad experience ever.
Tim A.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",601,89,66,5.0,2/13/2014,"Love this place! My wife I have eaten here several times and the service is top notch!  The food is always fresh and taste fantastic! Today we had lunch here and Elizabeth was the best service we have ever had at any restaurant!  We felt like we here in a 10 star place. Elizabeth is the best server we have ever had. This is a true testimony to her and, the manager makes this place click like clock work. The vibe is fantastic! If you go ask for Elizabeth. I promise you will not be disappointed."
Tammy Q.,"Fullerton, CA",98,179,58,3.0,12/23/2011,"It's The Cheesecake Factory, not many choices outside of the food court when you're at the The Oaks mall so this is where people end up and it is normally always busy on the weekends. Service honestly is a hit or miss, everything from excellent to so terrible I want to report the person to corporate headquarters. Don't order anything weird, stick to the basics. Their menu is so big that they can't possible make everything perfect. Pasta, pizza, burgers and sandwiches are good choices. When I'm here with my friends we LOVE their tuxedo cheesecake, definitely a favorite.  I'm happy that there are more alternatives to sit down places at the mall now, Red Robin and Lazy Dog Cafe."
Chino x.,"Simi Valley, CA",52,6,1,1.0,11/13/2013,"I'll never return to this place ever again. On top of an hour wait, the waitresses couldn't do simple math to figure out the tip. After 20 mins going back and forth their solution was to add more on the bill. When we brought it to their attention, their answer was that their system couldn't be changed. No refunds, no apology. Food is great, can't say the same about their service."
Tim S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,4.0,4/30/2014,"I don't think you can go wrong with your selection of food, everything is good and huge portions. Only downside is the wait"
