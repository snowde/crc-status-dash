Godfrey S.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",16,342,,2.0,11/8/2012,"What an idiot place. It's always full, but you can't make reservations. You can only make them at 11am, 3pm and 5 pm. I called at 3.15pm - no deal. The food is OK to average, but the place is very noisy and full.  I was amazed at how costly this place is: $110 for 3 small martinis (very little vodka), one medium sized filet (very average), a small salad, and two small pieces of cheesecake. Ingredients for these are about $12. I must say that the servers were absolutely delightful, and efficient. Go elsewhere, or cook at home."
Karma L.,"Oxnard, CA",5,30,20,4.0,5/9/2011,"Ate here with my family (of 6) late afternoon early Saturday evening (4:50 pm) and the wait time was an average of 35-45min.  By 5:30 it was an hour!  We waited about 35 min. We sat in a booth and didn't have very much elbow room, so 2 stars there but for a very busy evening we didn't complain. 5 stars for our server Edward (also the bus boy) who was professional, upbeat & never let us see him sweat even though it was outrageously busy/slammed.  The staff seemed to help each other out which was wonderful to see. Drinks & bread served in 5 min. Appetizer: Hot Spinach & Cheese Dip 2 1/2 stars, we've had better...  It was a little bland & I wasn't crazy about the tortilla chips but my dad liked it. I had some type of Salmon dish in what tasted like a lemon-butter white wine sauce with capers & spinach plus angel hair pasta.  It was not on there usual menu.  I picked it at the very last minute & was not disappointed...absolutely delicious! 5 stars Mother-in-law had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta; Chicken Breast Lightly Breaded and Sautéed to a Crisp Golden Brown. Served with Lemon Sauce, Mashed Potatoes and it usually comes with asparagus however she subbed for green beans .  She says she really enjoyed the dish & the lemon sauce was very tasty. 5 stars   Parents had the Salisbury Chopped Steak 3 3/4 stars...my mother mentioned the steak was a bit on the fatty side which she didn't care for but they both said it still had a good taste.   Father-in-law had the Jamaican Pepper Shrimp 3 stars (wasn't spicy enough for him) but enjoyed it over-all. Husband had the pepperoni pizza...ummm yeah (I won't nag about his choice =0P), he said it was ok & really liked my salmon.  2 1/2 stars  Dessert: Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake...looks rich but isn't!  Yum!  Decided to try this since a girlfriend of mine kept raving about it.  I really liked it (& I'm not huge on desserts) however every now & again I'll have a sweet tooth for a little something. 4 stars Cruising the mall is a great way to walk off all that food (LoL)!"
Bianca L.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,12,7,4.0,4/23/2014,"The food is good and they have good deals on happy hour. The drinks are great. The cheesecake is bomb. The service is alright for the most part. The employees are very enthusiast and helpful. It's just the usual, nothing special."
Roderick S.,"Milpitas, CA",23,69,12,5.0,5/30/2013,"I still remember the first time I stepped foot into The Cheesecake Factory. It was magical and still to this day the magic remains. I've tried almost everything on their expansive menu and have never been disappointed. This time our small group ordered the Deep Fried Macaroni and Cheese as an appetizer and I cannot begin to tell you how sinfully delicious these are. Super creamy. Extremely Macaron-ey. And the sauce they come with is an excellent complement to this already fantastic starter. If I could have just eaten a few orders of these as my entree I would have, but then I would probably be 400 pounds in no time lol. As my main course I ordered the burrito which is always prepared with the freshest ingredients and comes out piping hot. Love it. No dessert this time around even though our waiter was extremely convincing. Can't wait to try the one up here in San Jose next."
Jenny G.,"La Salle, MI",72,34,66,1.0,2/8/2013,"*****THE FOLLOWING REVIEW IS FOR THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION ONLY!!!!!!*****    A NOTE TO THE MANAGER IF YOU EVER READ THIS: TRY WATCHING HOW YOUR STAFF TREATS YOUR CUSTOMERS!!!! BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU MAY LOOSE A LOT OF BUSINESS!!!!        I have been to many different locations to eat at cheese cake factory, but I would have to say this one was THE WORST!!        Its inside the thousand oaks mall, and we were sat on the patio which is part of the mall, when asked to sit inside and we told them we didn't mind waiting they said no. Our waiter was VERY arrogant, and acted as if we shouldn't have had the right to eat there (I'm assuming because we didn't know we were going to be judged on appearance, we were dressed too casually for this servers taste) so he ignored us most of the time, didn't offer us more water when our glasses were empty or more  bread when the basket was empty. Probably because he was too busy waiting on the two women DIRECTLY NEXT TO US because they were dressed up, had a lot of shopping bags from the higher classed stores (not to be named) and so I guess he figured they deserved his 100% undivided attention. We were treated like dirt our whole visit, like we were trash off of the street.       When we COULD ACTUALLY get his attention, he was very snobbish with us, and RUDE BEYOND BELIEF!!!!          Not to mention, the food was not as high quality as I am used to having when visiting a Cheese Cake Factory restaurant. He didn't even offer us any desert, we had to ask for the desert menu AFTER he decided it was time to shoo us off my giving us the bill!!!!  The cheesecake that I ordered tasted as if it was DAYS OLD!! and I got sick that night. our bill came out to over 90$, and my husband being as generous and sweet as he is, still left a good tip. (bless his heart)      We WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS LOCATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I ADVISE YOU TO TURN AND RUN FROM THIS LOCATION UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE JUDGED BY YOUR APPEARANCE, AND WANT SHITTY SERVICE.!! *** I would recommend the location in TOPANGA or the location in SHERMAN OAKS. At least there, you get great service along with great quality food. and your NOT TREATED LIKE TRASH. *********"
Ali P.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,7,,5.0,5/11/2014,Cheese cake factory is one of my favorite places to eat! They have great food and also very good cheese cakes u should definitely try it!!!
Candice C.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,193,29,3.0,10/17/2013,"Stopped in here to avoid traffic on a trip to the Central Coast. The place gets packed around 6, luckily we were seated right before the swarm of people. Service was slow, our waitress seemed like she was very tired. Food is good, I definitely recommend the skinny menu as the portions are good size and the flavor is good. Aside from our sleepy waitress, the only thing I didn't enjoy was the fact that they charge $20 for the steak diane which ended up being a plate of oversauced steak tips."
Curtis M.,"Stuart, FL",0,7,,5.0,6/30/2013,"Great!  My wife and I go at least once a week, and we love it!  There is great selection and we are always pleased.  I like the large portions.  They waiters are very professional, and we have gotten to know many of them.  Even the bus boys gladly help you.  The food arrives quickly and prepared just the way you asked--my wife often asks for substitutes for (or omissions) of  items, which they gladly do. We go to Cheesecake Factories all over the US.  We have always been pleased.  When working a long day or getting in from a late flight, they are great for late night dinners."
Allan D.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,79,5,4.0,10/17/2013,I really like this location because its abundance of seating.  Cheesecake factory is pretty consistent with service and menu so special consideration should be given to this location for its seating.
Leon V.,"Moorpark, CA",0,1,,4.0,4/24/2015,"I've always been a fan of the restaurant ever since I took my first girlfriend there for a nice romantic dinner. The skinnylicious enchiladas were amazing as always, and the waiters were sure to be there if we needed anything! The heavens must have created the oreo dream extreme chess cake, and brought it to the restaurant, beacuse I could not get enough of that Delicacy. Would definitely recommend for a nice and delicious dinner."
Lee Y.,"Camarillo, CA",62,13,,3.0,10/1/2012,"After hours of shopping, I usually end up at this place as it is so convenient. It's alright, but I wouldn't go out of my way just to eat here.  + The portions are so large that I can split them into 3 (and just eat that the whole day!) In the middle of the mall, perfect meeting place very roomy with abundant place chatty ambiance and nice view outside - Takes forever to get a seat Then takes forever to get the food Servers are a hit or miss  Food is overly caloric"
RJ W.,"Camarillo, CA",0,56,,3.0,5/9/2013,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory last night to celebrate my daughter's 12th birthday. It was her choice and she wanted to sit in the ""mall area"". You can either sit in the restaurant, the outdoor patio or the seats that are in the mall. We mentioned the birthday to the hostess and she made sure that she got the details. Our server came over and immediately wished the kid a happy birthday. It was nice. Our drink order was immediately taken and the waitress handled it quickly. She also came back to take our dinner order but we were not quite ready. It seemed to take her a while to come back but they were busy. It was not absurdly long so I was OK with it. Once the orders went in, the food came out promptly. All three kids had different pasta dishes (two ordered off adult menu). My son's fettuccine Alfredo was SWIMMING in butter. I am sure it tasted OK, but I was not excited about his losing a year or two on the back end of his life. I had a burger. It was slightly cold. I was not in the mood to send anything back, so I ate it. Found out later the birthday girl's was cold also. The fries were lukewarm also. I am guessing the waitress would have taken care of it, but I did not say a word. It was my kids birthday, we were having fun and my beer was ice cold so I was willing to overlook. Because we were celebrating a birthday we got a complimentary sundae which was REALLY small. Don't count on that to share. We also ordered cheesecake (when in Rome, right?). My wife got original, son got Oreo Dream  something or other, and birthday girl got vanilla bean. Gave the sundae to the youngest. Cheesecake was amazing. The Oreo one was so rich my ten year old took home half. So 5 people (one off kid menu), one beer involved and 3 cheesecakes was 119 with tip. I didn't check but I suspect the cheesecake was a tad pricey, but it was my kids birthday. The family had fun, waitress was nice (don't know her name but I know she has a sister named Lauren who also works there). If burger and fries and pasta were warm it may have gotten a much higher grade.."
Kimbra P.,"Newbury Park, CA",37,76,13,4.0,3/16/2013,"Ordered to go,did curbside pick up. I love not having to go into the crowded mall, worth the $2 tip to sit in my car & text. Food came out within 2 minutes of me calling to say I was there..check your order , they forgot the bread. Luv the squaw bread...pretty expensive, $16.95 for Pasta Jambalaya or Thai Chicken Pasta.  Really liked Thai Chicken Pasta , should be on the regular menu,  not the secret menu. Oreo Extreme Cheesecake was yummers but geez $7.95 for one slice that we split between 2 adults and 1 kid. Good thing I had a gift card for the whole meal. Wish I could afford to order Cheesecake Factory to go more often."
The C.,"Agoura Hills, CA",122,91,20,4.0,8/13/2013,Did a great job accommodating a large party and the food was quality.
Sunny R.,"Simi Valley, CA",2331,459,373,5.0,12/24/2008,"I've never had a bad experience here!  The service is awesome.  The food is outstanding.  And they have this alcoholic pink lemonade that I have become addicted to.   I don't even like cheesecake and I like their cheesecake.  The white chocolate caramel one we had was amazing.  The avocado egg roll appetizers were too yummy.  I had the garlic pasta without the chicken and the flavor was perfect - spicy, creamy, rich. I haven't tried eating outside on their patio yet but will do so once the weather warms up again.  Cheesecake Factory is a pleaser!"
Theodore S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",41,255,88,4.0,1/24/2013,This is a standard Cheescake factory. They have a small bar and great food. The Cheesecake is obviously the best in town and as it should be considering their name. This place gets real busy for dinner and the service does not slack off. They are prompt with your order and keep the place tidy.
Leeann L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1,27,8,4.0,8/16/2013,Busy during lunch.  I really enjoy the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta.
Brad F.,"Simi Valley, CA",28,105,21,5.0,7/11/2013,One of my favorite places for sure!!! Staff is always awesome. Recommendations suited for you if needed (big menu). The cheesecake..... As it should be.... Is to die for. HUGE list and all of it (that I have tried) is amazing!!! Save room for sure!
Adam E.,"Oak Park, CA",536,179,7,3.0,9/3/2011,"It's Cheesecake factory. For the love of God people don't order something thats out of the normal. Soups, salads, sandwiches. Eat because you don't want to eat at the food court or you feel like sitting on the patio and have a over priced overrated glass of white wine. We know what we are getting when we come here."
