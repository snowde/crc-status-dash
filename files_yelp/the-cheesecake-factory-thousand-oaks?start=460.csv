Howard E.,"Calabasas, CA",161,64,15,5.0,1/14/2013,We had an issue but the manager Jennifer came thru...Great Customer Service. Thank you
Brandy Lee T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,1.0,9/5/2014,"What happened?!!!! I have such fond memories of the food here but my latest experience has left me absolutely no desire to return ever...or at least not to this location. We ordered the chicken and biscuits which was advertised as sautéed chicken breasts with pan jus...what came out were 4 paper thin 2 inch x 2 inch slivers of dried out crispy (as in overcooked, not fried) pieces of chicken in a weird lemony flavored gravy. It was gross and so was the biscuit, which was also dry but strangely sweet. The entire dish had a really weird after taste and was sent back. Next up was a side of mac and cheese...usually pretty hard to mess up, unless you severely undercook the pasta and the sauce breaks...fail #2! This one sat uneaten at the edge of the table, seemingly unnoticed by the staff who never inquired as to why it was just sitting there across from us, uneaten. The third attempt was the chicken fettuccini with sundried tomatoes...this is probably thee most disgusting thing I've ever tasted...it had a really odd earthy sort of fishy flavor and despite only taking one tiny bite, I can't get that awful taste out of my mouth! After an hour and a half of sitting there waiting for something palatable to come out of the kitchen, only to be more and more disappointed each time, we finally asked for the check. Another 15 minutes went by while our server searched for the manager. The manager came over to offer us something else, just as the lights were being turned off around us. Unless he was offering a pillow and a blanket, I'm not sure what he was going to bring us..."
Mark W.,"Prescott, AZ",1,101,12,2.0,9/9/2013,"So, not great. My wife had the Steak Diane, it was ordered med rare, came to the table VERY rare! It was seared more than cooked. My Pasta dish was the Chipoltle Chicken Pasta, should have been called the bland Chipoltle Pasta with a HINT of chicken. It had 4 small bites of chicken. The manager came over after we sent the Steak dish back and offered my wife another glass of wine, it was nice but for $70 total bill, we will not go back. Service OK, food and content, not so good!"
Carmie L.,"Ventura, CA",20,2,,4.0,1/14/2014,I LOVE the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake!!! This satisfies my chocolate craving every time
Cheryl D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",24,90,,3.0,5/3/2013,Waitress - if you don't want to work - STAY HOME! Worst waitress with bad attitude I've ever experienced. You almost wanted to apologize for being her customer. Geez. Food was ok.
Erica G.,"Simi Valley, CA",72,133,55,4.0,9/3/2010,"Not sure why our server was crying, but apparently she was having a rough night. We got taken care of though - another server took our table.  I got the ""Chris' cake"" and it was cold, dry, chewy and a little old tasting. I did, however, take a bite of our friend's Reeses Peanut Butter cheesecake cakey thing and THAT was incredible."
Danielle E.,"Anaheim, CA",417,131,126,4.0,10/10/2010,"How I love the cheesecake factory!  Ive never got a bad thing here.. I love the BBQ chicken pizza, Thai lettuce wraps, roadside sliders, Thai Chicken pasta, and the nachos. Honestly, every dish here has been good.. Cheesecake: I love the 30th anniversary cheesecake.Its beyond delicious.  Favorite: Factory Mud Pie... Big slice of chocolate cake with scoops of ice cream and whip cream. Enough for 4! I get it every time I go! :)"
Tammy M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,12,,5.0,11/24/2013,"After eating at Cheesecake factory numerous times I felt it was time to write a review.  I can honestly say there has never been a time that I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory where I haven't had a great meal.  I've tried so many different dishes and now have my favorites but all the dishes I've tried have been fresh and flavorful. The fish and chicken entrees are my personal favorites... currently the cashew chicken :)  The only problem with Cheesecake Factory, which for them has to be a great problem, at prime lunch and dinner time there is always a wait. Oh and the desserts are absolutely amazing!  I'm a whipped cream fan... they have THE BEST!!!!  Makes anything under the whipped cream that much better."
J. S.,"NEWBURY PARK, CA",0,16,3,5.0,1/3/2013,"We come to this restaurant almost every Friday night.  I have never been to a restaurant that is more consistently good--both in food and service.  The staff always seems really, really happy.  Either they are tremendous fakers or Cheesecake has created a great work environment.  The service is almost better than the food just because the servers make the experience so enjoyable.   But let's be clear that the food is always great.  All of the servers are awesome and put their own twist on their service, but the 3 that we have enjoyed the most are Joel, Zack, and a nice looking tan complexion gentleman with a great deep voice.  Joel knows that menu as if he cooked it himself and is so helpful with his suggestions.   Thank you for always ending our weeks with a smile! ~Juliana and Jamey"
Lacey S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",30,13,,4.0,7/10/2013,"I went to dinner here with my boyfriend tonight and overall we enjoyed our experience here. I always love their bread, especially the rye/oat bread with butter! The waiter was really nice & helpful, although he didn't really check up us after the entrees arrived, he didn't need to because the food was delish! We tried the tortilla soup special for the appetizer, which was very tasty... and I loved that it was garnished with rice and fresh cilantro! For the entrees I enjoyed a good chicken salad sandwich, the only disappointment i had was that the menu did not say celery was in it, when there was a lot of it! I don't mind celery, but I don't prefer it. My boyfriend David had the cajun chicken pasta, he liked it, and so did I! Unfortunately we were too full for a slice of cheesecake! Well be back soon!"
Teresa M.,"Northridge, CA",0,10,,3.0,1/28/2014,I Love to eat here but almost every time I go there they are out my favorite plate. There excuse is that I come late at night and they always run out of it.
Donna W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,164,121,2.0,3/26/2011,"This location NEVER measures up to the Woodland Hills Cheesecake Factory.  I think because of being in the mall the Thousand Oaks Cheesecake Factory does not feel like they have to try too hard. They have a captive audience.  Though with more dining choices opening up at this mall they really need to get with it. It is like a good imitation of Cheesecake Factory, it just does not measure up.  I ate there yesterday.-Four Cheese Ziti Al Forno- The Pasta was so undercooked it almost cruched.  Honestly I can eat raw pasta straight from the box and get 16 ounces for .99 when its on sale. The sauce was extremely acidic leaving me with an upset stomcah the rest of the evening and into the night. I never think of going to this location for any special occassion, yet the Woodland Hills facility is my first choice. This has been the case for the Thousand Oaks Cheesecake Factory for all the years it has been opened. I give the Woodland Hlls location Five Stars, Thousand Oaks is only 2 stars.    Well worth the drive to head into the valley if you want a real Cheesecake Factory Experience."
Michael S.,"Westlake Village, CA",22,49,6,2.0,6/16/2010,"Ok...I admit it.  My wife and I are kind of clean freaks when it comes to restaurants.  And this place just isn't. On Monday my wife and I had a rare opportunity to get lunch together mid-week.  She suggested Cheesecake Factory...not my favorite anyway, but, ok.  (I think mostly she likes the place cuz she can always convince me ""since we're here"" why don't we do a little shopping at the mall). Cutesy, bubbly hostess takes us to a booth in the bar.  Wife sits down, notices food still on the bench.  I look at my side and grease was dripped on my bench.  I took their white cloth napkin and wiped my bench.  Napkin came up filthy like hadn't been actually washed in years. Hostess asks is everything ok?  Wife says, no, there's food all over the booth.  Response, ""Oh, there must have been a baby sitting there right before you.""  No, I'm sorry.  No, let me get that cleaned up for you.  No, let me get you a new table.  No, nothin' We decide to leave.  Manager tries to stop us and offers another location, but the damage had been done.  We clean-freaks imagine the kitchen being as dirty as the tables once we've had a bad experience.   Sorry CF.  It will be a long time before we go back. (We ended up at Cafe Provencal in Westlake.  Great lunch with the ""older crowd."")"
Seena A.,"Los Angeles, CA",292,178,44,2.0,10/11/2010,"Definitely had the worst service I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. Waited way too long to be greeted by the waitress, and with a restaurant so empty, there wasn't really an excuse for me. I used to be a server... so I know... Continued the evening with subpar service, the food being ok. Not the best I've had at a Cheesecake Factory, either. When the waitress finally realized she better work for her tip, she tried to be extra nice but it was a bit too little, too late. Sorry, lady. Can't force enough sweetness in the 5 minutes remaining before I sign the bill to change my opinion of the meal."
Tammy C.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,17,,5.0,10/28/2014,"This place never disappoints. Me and my husband love the Cheese Cake Factory!!! We have never had a bad meal and the service is always very good. Their mojitos are the best!!!! I'm not normally a mojito person, but I love their's."
Paul J.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,48,23,2.0,3/20/2013,"Why do I this to myself? A long flight from the Midwest and a starving body...is why. I succomed to my hunger pains and ordered a farmhouse burger. It looked delicious a perfect medium rare, lettuce, tomato, pork belly, topped with a fried egg. It was ""fantabulously"" FLA-VOR-LESS. I give up and don't want to continue. The fries were great. Going to stop by the bar and order a double shot of Goose."
GabeandKitty R.,"Ventura, CA",0,7,1,5.0,1/2/2014,This place never disappoints. 5 star from appetizer to dessert. Can not say the same about the one in Marina Del Rey!
Jackie R.,"Spokane Valley, WA",882,683,70,2.0,6/29/2010,"My trainer says CKF is evil. That said I used to live down the street, so I've eaten here a dozen times. I'll write on my most recent experience. The food is good for a chain, massive menu and more types of cheesecake than you have ever seen. The service is friendly as well. We came in for dessert this time and ordered a piece of cheesecake, an order of strawberries, a baileys on the rocks and an iced mocha with a shot of baileys. The bill totaled over $40. I frequent nice restaurants and order pricey drinks at swanky bars (Cheesecake Factory not falling into either of those categories). I also know when I'm being ripped off. I knew the desserts aren't cheap (they aren't small either) and I can understand berries aren't cheap and baileys on the rocks is straight licquer. What I cannot reason is $13 for a shot of espresso, milk, chocolate and one shot of licquer at a chain restaurant. For shame taking advantage in a recession Cheesecake Factory!"
Ryan K.,"San Buenaventura (Ventura), CA",0,6,,4.0,8/16/2013,"Went here on a Friday night with a party of 10. We ordered appetizers and I would highly suggest the macaroni cheese bites. The service was ok, we had to ask for drink refills. We then ordered cheesecake which was awesome. Couldn't go 5 stars due to service but food was great."
Angelia W.,"Reseda, CA",6,8,1,5.0,8/21/2014,I think we all know that the food at The Cheesecake Factory is awesome but I don't get out to Thousand Oaks very often.  Why...because I don't drive!  I am one of those select few people who have epilepsy and navigate through Los Angeles without a car and the support of friends.  This was a special occasion because my friend and I were out there to see another friend in a local play.  We had amazing food and service from the Cheesecake Factory...they got us out in time to get to the play in time and we can tell... all the staff handled the busy restaurant with great skill. Well wouldn't you know it I left my credit card at the restaurant!  Stupid me.  I called into the restaurant and they were really awesome.  I never told them that I couldn't get there because of my condition just that I couldn't get back there and was pretty far away.  They offered to mail me my card.  They were totally sweet.  If you are in the area...go!  They will take great care of you!
