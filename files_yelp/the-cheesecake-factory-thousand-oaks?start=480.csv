Erik A.,"Somis, CA",433,119,286,1.0,4/7/2010,This place can't even make a salad.
Marlo R.,"Ventura, CA",10,83,153,3.0,11/5/2010,"The only other Cheesecake Factory I've been too prior to this visit is in S.F. @ Union Sq. I had a decent experience, so when I saw there was one in Thousand Oaks I thought well okay then.  The menu is very extensive!! Especially if unsure of what you're in the mood for. Seems like they offer something for every taste, which is good. I couldn't make my mind up between a Caesar salad, pizza, burger, or sandwich. After some deep deliberation I opted for the Turkey Club. I've had better, but it wasn't bad. Fries came in a cute bucket. Lol!  Hubby ordered the Blackened Chicken sandwich. That too was just okay ( had a bite to check it out ). Again I've had better at other restaurants, but it was okay.  Our server was super friendly, came to see if we were okay frequently. Food came out to us hot and fast. Iced tea glasses were filled often, and it was all done with a smile.  I will probably come back to the Factory again...I would like to try the Chicken Caesar salad. For me, the frequency of my visits teeter on the deliciousness of their Ceasar salads...so we'll see.  Keeping you posted Yelpers. :-)."
Tina T.,"San Diego, CA",123,351,51,4.0,4/30/2012,"Why do I adore Cheesecake Factory so? I think its this, I know I'm going to like whatever I order and I will consistently be pleased when I eat here. I like the iced tea, the bread, the cocktails, the salads, and the entrees. However, appetizers are my favorite food, and CF has a larger, more adventurous selection of apps than anybody else. On this particular visit I enjoyed a small salad, chicken samosas, and shrimp and grits, all on the ""small bites"" menu, all delicious. No room for dessert this visit."
Osly P.,"Simi Valley, CA",52,10,4,1.0,5/14/2013,I took my mother for Mother's Day here we had the worst type of service. We asked to have a piña colada remade since it tasted more like a vanilla shake we were asked to pay more for a defective drink and the waiter simply dumped food on the table and ignored us. Willfully ignored us. Never coming back. The restaurant right across them has superior service.
Rachel F.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,175,4,2.0,4/22/2012,"Good food but bad service. We went here for a work bday celebration and made a reservation at 1130.  2 1/2 hours later we were out. It wasn't a large group so we were surprised it took so long, especially because we beat the lunch rush when we put our order in. Wouldn't suggest coming here with a big group unless you have time to wait."
Mr C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",83,200,96,5.0,5/1/2012,Consistently on top of their game. Always great food with service to match!
Mimi D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",422,496,222,5.0,4/29/2012,"Things to try:  Miso Salmon, Crusted Chicken Romano, Pecan Crusted Catfish and the red velvet cheesecake!  I want all of these things every day"
Wes S.,"Ventura, CA",1351,866,624,4.0,2/5/2008,"The empire of cheesecakes. Well, you know what, I can't really hate on you. Why? You have fairly decent food at reasonable prices. Plus, you're open late.  It's always fun to eat at this Cheesecake Factory as you see all the inspiring ""Real Wives Of O.C."" here. I'm actually quite shocked that show wasn't made out here considering a lot of the people in this county really think they're special because they have money.  Anyways, always decent food, service is always good. If you haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in your life, you must live under a rock."
Fred B.,"Glendale, CA",507,122,,4.0,9/22/2011,This Cheesecake is actually at the Thousand Oaks Mall!!  Took me a good while to figure that out - I kept yelling at my Navi as to why it kept leading me to the mall. Sat outside on the patio with a few friends and just hung out and talked for the longest time.  The server was very nice and never gave us the feeling that we needed to leave.  We had a slow lunch and took our time. Great attitude by everyone there!
Hudson B.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,6,,3.0,10/8/2014,"Came into dine here this past weekend, and just had an okay experience. Waitress was slow food was alright nothing special. The atmosphere was very loud. The best part of the meal was their delicious classic cheesecake to finish it off."
Amy C.,"Norwalk, CA",3,6,1,2.0,6/16/2014,Bad front seating customer service! we came in and stood there for a couple minutes...there was about 4 employees standing around..and someone that might of been the manager ..and we were not greeted or asked anything at all..out of all those people no one said anything to us..some random lady came and Sat us ..they were too concerned to get there stuff done and it was only 40 min. Till closing time..they need to work on there front seating customer service..this kinda stuff makes u just wanna walk back out and just go somewhere else.
Kathy R.,"Palm Desert, CA",264,203,42,3.0,8/5/2010,My food and service was so good last week at the Cheesecake Factory in Sherman Oaks and I had a specialty dish that was worth having again so we popped in to the Thousand Oaks Cheesecake for a redux. The portion was smaller next to the Sherman Oaks Cheesecake and there service was all backwards. We waited 20 minutes before they even asked if we wanted bread and water. When the Enchiladas came there was a tablespoon of Cilantro Rice on the plate. They made it up by bringing a side dish but it was not as good as the week before.  We will have to try Woodland Hills before they change the specialty menu again!
Kayla S.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,36,5,2.0,7/12/2014,Make sure to check the Hawaiian pizza for tooth pick pieces! My sisters mouth almost got cut up! But thankfully the manager took off our bill and the company apologized with a gift card. The waitress wasn't the friendliest but we still love the cheesecake! Waitress attitude and the toothpicks in the pizza is the reason I lowered my star ranking
Ric P.,"Oak Park, CA",95,268,116,3.0,2/8/2010,"Cum-on, who doesn't luv the Cheesecake Factory.  I mean they are good, but not great. You can always get a great fill on what ever dish you order.  We always eat up at the bar (also quicker service / less of a wait) and socialize with the Bartenders.  Recommend just getting an appetizer & entree to share between two. I love desserts, but most of the time we take a pass.  Super casual & laid back place."
Clara C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",44,180,167,4.0,5/6/2008,"I used to LOVE the Cheesecake Factory (for a chain, it's good, what can I say?) but I guess as with most things, you get bored after awhile.   Yeah, their food is decent and they have HUGE portions but really?  Does America NEED to eat a plate of food large enough to feed 3-4 people?   That being said, I love the Baja Chicken Tacos, the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes, the Santa Fe Salad, the Chicken & Biscuits, the Steak Diane and the Morning Quesadilla."
Renae B.,"Los Angeles, CA",262,9,8,4.0,1/4/2013,This cheesecake factory is nothing like the one in Albuquerque New Mexico !!!  Love love love it ! Upside down pineapple cheesecake is simply divine ;)
Ryan R.,"Newbury Park, CA",173,406,106,3.0,1/19/2010,"This is a family favorite and you really can't go wrong. Aside from the obvious cheesecake menu (which is extensive), the menu is several pages and chock full of good stuff. For myself, I am a fan of the Sheppards Pie and the blackened chicken pasta. The pot stickers are always good. The only bad thing about this location is the wait. You can bet on 30 minutes to an hour wait."
Elli H.,"Agoura Hills, CA",7,5,1,2.0,6/24/2013,"This place is a nightmare ! Besides the fact that they make you wait at least 1 hour even on week days , the floors are so slippery I almost fell down 2 times. The food is good of course like at every other Cheesecake Factory but this location is terrible . The services is always rude and can't wait to get you out of there fast enough... If you can choose between going to this branch or the one in canoga , then definitely the one on Canoga would be my choice!"
Leon N.,"Simi Valley, CA",29,148,2,4.0,12/23/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is the only restaurant I can think of that can have a menu 20  pages long, have any type of food (Italian, steak, seafood, Chinese, etc) and actually do it relatively well.  I have always been surprised how well they can do so many things.  Food is excellent, service great. They rapidly bring over a kids plate to entertain the kids (bread, banana) which is simple yet very helpful with kids."
Chris A.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",21,27,17,1.0,7/6/2011,"I used to love this place! Unfortunately the last several times I'v been there have been way below par! The last time I went there was the last straw! I wont be going back there again. I do plan on going to other Cheesecake Factories though. When we were seated the table was filthy, the seats where dirty and greasy, when I opened my silverware there was brown stuff all over it, a glass was dirty and my mom couldn't eat her salad because there was a bug in it, and her pizza was sooo greasy it was falling apart because it became so soggy. I was really upset because  it was so post to be a celebration lunch and it ruined my day. It makes me sad because I used to love it there and now I have to drive far away to go to another."
