Bryan P.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",10,34,3,5.0,11/21/2012,Great dining place and my favorite part of all? CHEESE CAKE!!!
Mike S.,"Oak Park, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/22/2015,"Our large(9) group met at the Cheesecake Factory last week for dinner.  The restaurant was busy as usual.  After a short wait the hostess sat us inside near the bar.  Our waitress was pleasant and efficient and took our orders in a timely manner.  However, when the meals were delivered one person did not get served.  We were told that this dish would be coming out of the kitchen shortly.  That was fine with our group until about 10 minutes passed at which time we asked the waitress about the missing order.  She was polite and said that she would check in the kitchen.  The next time that she passed by our table(another 10 minutes), we asked to talk to the manager.  The manager never came to our table.  The missing meal arrived as the rest of us were finishing our plates.  When the bill arrived, we asked again to talk to the manager.  No such luck.  Finally, upon leaving the restaurant, the manager(Kelly) tried to offer a limp apology saying several others had complained and she was very busy with them.  Needless to say, this was insufficient.  Our plan is to help her out and make her and the restaurant less busy in the future."
A T.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,13,,1.0,7/11/2014,"Dined there last Wednesday and I though for a moment we were at a fancier McDonald's. The service was really slow (saw a person from an adjacent table order all of their table's drinks from the bar) and once our food arrived, we were relentlessly pressured to leave. Love the CF menu, but will think twice about visiting this one anytime soon."
Andrew M.,"San Diego, CA",1683,346,600,4.0,10/23/2011,"I remember going to Cheesecake Factory when I was young and we stopped going for quite a few years, as I remember the food quality dropped off, but this last time I went about a week ago, they had revamped the menu and really stepped it up. Presentation wise the food was done well, plus the proportions were not over the top (a quality I recall from this company). The option of a ""light menu"" is excellent, especially if they want to keep a good, steady clientele here in California, being the health conscience types that we are. All in all an excellent experience,  and I've gone back a few times after that. Oh ya and if your feeling really gluttonous and wanna go all out, get a slice of the red velvet cheesecake, its like heaven in cake form!"
Larry G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,2,,4.0,10/30/2013,"I love the food at cheesecake so far I have not been let down by there amazing food all around a great company, the only thing I would change is there all white uniforms not a big fan of them"
Terry I.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,20,,5.0,6/25/2014,I was very pleased last night from the amazing service from the Cheesecake Factory in Thousand Oaks Mall. We had a large birthday party (eleven people) and they did everything in their power to make our dinner very special. I went in early to warn them of a large party arriving and the hostess could not have been more helpful. She had the table ready to go when my guests arrived. The waiter (Zachary) was fantastic. Perfect service from him and his helpers. The food we ordered was wonderful and everyone enjoyed their plates. We ordered: Seared Tuna Tataki Salad; Miso Salmon; Crispy Crab Bites; Tomato Basil Pasta; Crusted Chicke Romano; Four Cheese Pasta; Skinny Shrimp Tacos; Mushroom Burger and other dishes. For desert we had: Italian Tiramisu cheesecake which was so yummy. I have always loved their food. I was so happy with how they treated us!  Good job to the Manager of the Cheesecake Factory who knows what she/he is doing.
Christina M.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,128,15,3.0,12/27/2009,"Balls of macaroni and cheese, rolled in panko bread crumbs and fried to sweet perfection. Thai chicken lettuce wraps with three types of dip.  Salmon rice paper egg rolls. The Cheescake Factory has a large menu but does it surprisingly well for a chain. I suggest sticking to the appetizers; they're tastier and the better value versus the main entrees.   Share a slice of cheesecake - the rich, creamy slabs are big enough for two or three people. They have seasonal cakes - such as the pumpkin pecan cheesecake, but we didn't sample. We've had white chocolate macadamia nut, red velvet, and Adam's peanut butter and fudge ripple. Our office would occasionally order the gargantuan chocolate and carrot cakes. All stellar, tooth-achingly sweet and what you'd come to expect from a cheesecake factory."
John J.,"Camarillo, CA",0,15,,5.0,9/16/2013,"Kind of a long wait to be seated, I would say about 50 mins but the food was really good, and the cheese cakes pieces are amazing. Also huge slices I had to get a box to take half the slice home because it was to big to finish."
Adam S.,"Washington, DC",0,12,,4.0,8/27/2013,"Not the best food, but many options from Italian to Mexican food. You probably will have to bring some food home and please don't skip their dessert. They got one of the best cheesecakes in the country!"
Ken R.,"Ventura, CA",45,365,591,3.0,1/8/2012,"Disappointed with my lunch, not totally disappointed but I did except my flavor.  Anyway, next time I'll stick to their cheesecakes they are the best!"
Kristina H.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,31,26,4.0,1/6/2012,Good food. Pumpkin cheese cake is one of the best. I really enjoy the steak and salmon combo
Emily W.,"Ventura, CA",5,33,54,3.0,4/1/2012,5pm reservations and it's 510 pm and still haven't been sat! :( I do have to say they did move quicker once I spoke to the manager and let her know we had a movie to catch by 6:50 that evening. We made our reservations for 5:00 pm to ensure we would have enough time to be sat and then get to our movie on time. Our server was great and once we told him we had a movie to catch he was on the fast track to get our orders in a get us on our way. I do have to say when I went to the bathroom it was very dirty and under stocked. Which sometimes is a red flag! I feel like all parts of the restaurant should be kept cleaned. Will most likely come again cause I love the cheesecake. :) by the time we got sat it was 5:30 :( 30 mins after our 5:00 pm reservation.
Joe M.,"Goleta, CA",6,23,1,3.0,5/14/2011,"Went here for lunch the other day. I was looking forward to it, unfortunately it did not meet my expectations.  Pasta was oily and the cheesecake tasted old.  The one bright spot in the meal was the Peach Bellini I had which was a slushy glass of blended goodness :) Ill be back but certainly wont seek this place out as a goto spot."
Karen F.,"Burbank, CA",28,194,4,4.0,10/24/2011,"You can never have a bad meal at the Cheesecake Factory, everything they make is wonderful. I had the Jumbalia (over pasta); it's one of my favorite dishes. I was a little disappointed in the cheesecake. I remember it being much better. We ordered three pieces for the table. The lemon raspberry tasted like it was made with lemon flavoring rather then fresh lemon. The raspberry sauce was authentic, raspberry reduction and delicious. The red velvet was just OK, the cake and cheesecake portion was very good, however, the frosting was not the best I've ever had. The pumpkin pecan was delicious and even came on a traditional pie crust with pecan pie on top. Loved it! Of course I'll go back for the food rather then desserts. Their menu is extensive and over the years, I have never had a bad dish. Service was exceptional!"
Rod W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,16,,5.0,3/18/2014,"Love the skinny menu!  The chopped salad, shrimp pasta and tomato Basil Flat bread are delicious!  Taste like you are indulging but the fat and calories are low.  The skinnylicious burgers are equally as good.  The curb-side pick up is great for take out dinner.  So glad Cheesecake Factory has a low-cal yummy menu and would love to see new items on the low-cal menu!  Does NOT taste low-cal, full of flavor and good!"
Jeff S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",7,1,,5.0,3/12/2013,Had a blast. Server was awesome - thanks Jennifer! Food was so yummy.
Jane B.,"Newbury Park, CA",2,62,4,3.0,8/25/2011,"If you want to be able to enjoy the food at this restaurant just make sure you don't look at the nutrition menu that they are required to provide if you ask for it.  All the dishes on the menu are obscenely caloric.  I don't just mean a little bit of an indulgence on some of the items.  I mean a full days worth of calories in almost every dish.  I'm not a big calorie counter, it's just hard to ignore.  Other than that, on the plus side the menu is varied and the portions are large (obviously) and the service is adequate.  Their salads are surprisingly good but I found the rest of the food to be mostly mediocre.  If I'm going to indulge, I want my food to be spectacular!"
J S.,"Simi Valley, CA",10,53,32,4.0,8/24/2009,"I love this Cheesecake Factory. The food here is always good, the service is great, and the portions give you enough for a next-day meal. They are a well-oiled machine. All chains should look to them as a guide because they have it down. Unfortunately, they are always packed and because of that, you need to nearly shout at the other members of your party to be heard. Wait times to be seated make it almost not worth going. Almost... So, if you plan on eating here, come an hour in advance and bring your piggy bank because they love to raise their prices on a whim. BUT you will eat well and the service will never let you down."
marilyn h.,"Denver, CO",22,98,5,4.0,3/20/2009,"It used to be great, 5 stars great, but I think the mall renovation messed up their flow a bit.  The ""free"" bread always makes me happy, and I always order the bang bang chicken, it's about 14.95? it's an american twist on curry. The flaked coconut adds subtle texture to the whole dish, the rice has always been neither over nor undercooked, the chicken is always moist, the shrimp tends to slightly, just slightly over cooked. It is a great dish and super fun to say! The factory burrito, is also a good choice. It is a monstrous burrito (probably about a foot long). I think you could substitute it, but they serve it with black beans, with tasty ""cilantro rice"" and have everything else to the side. I have yet to try the avocado eggrolls which I have heard so many good comments about it, but once I do, better believe I'll yelp it!"
Scott M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",48,125,1,1.0,2/3/2013,"It's rare for me to give less than 4 or 5 stars but tonight is one. Party of 4 that went from ok to bad in under 90 minutes. Arrived at 5:45 no waiting due to the game. Yea team! Ordered beverages for 2 until the other couple arrived.  Then waited 20 minutes before our server appeared again, no apology, just as if everything was normal. We had to ask another server just to get water. Food arrived - except 3 out of 4 meals were wrong. Back they go. Still no sign of our server. In the interim I get a beverage refill offer from another server. Beverage comes back wrong. No server to be seen so I eventually (10 minutes and at this point I was timing everything) went to the bar to get it corrected. Food arrives but out of the 3 remaining meals only 2 were correct. Guess who got shorted. At this point I ask for the manager expecting the situation to be resolved.  I can understand an off night but it never got better. I ended up not eating and asked for my meal to go (I didn't check to see if it was as ordered, I may never check). Still no server so I ask for manager Angela to reappear. It took a bit longer this time to get an appearance. I got a soft sorry not a confident sorry or a we'll make it right sorry. Meals were free but the damage was done.  Finally our server appears and asks if we would like dessert. Wow, Really? I left a penny as a tip. I'm very forgiving and if our server had, as many in the past have done and probably will in the future, just said I'm sorry and then stepped up to the job at hand I would have been fine. Not sure if I can go back it was that bad but I probably will because it's the Cheesecake Factory. Maybe next year for Superbowl Sunday."
