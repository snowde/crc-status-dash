Scott H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",76,100,1,4.0,7/7/2011,"I try to avoid chains as much as possible, but this is the exception.  Amazing menu.  Do not understand how they have such a variety and everything seems to be good.  Portions are huge, we almost always order less meals than we have people because there is plenty to share.  And, of course, the actual cheesecake is worth a trip all on it's own."
Kristopher V.,"Venice, CA",128,349,149,3.0,3/26/2011,I remember how big of a deal it was when this place first came to town. The portion sizes were out of control and the menu was the size of a novela. As my palet has become more refined over the years I have become less and less enamored with the food. Still if you go I recommend the popcorn shrimp and the green iced tea.
Stacey P.,"Ventura, CA",17,157,65,4.0,4/6/2011,A friend and I got hungry after shopping at the mall and decided to come here for dinner one evening. It was the middle of the week but every time I've ever passed by this place it's been super crowded.  We waited about 15 minutes for a table when we were buzzed in. When we got to the front entrance we were told our table wasn't ready. We stood around for not a lot of time before we were finally seated.  I was already expecting it to be super loud since there were a lot of people so that I can't really blame the place for.  The menu has a huge variety of everything you can think of.  I finally decided on seafood- the crabcake sandwich with fries and it was very delicious and flavorful. My friend also really enjoyed her meal. We didn't see a lot of our waitresses but they were very friendly. At the end of our meal we both ordered slices of the Reeses Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake to go. Absolute heaven! The slices are huge so I shared with my husband. I'll have to come back to try Red Velvet Cheesecake next time. Yum!
Paul C.,"Oxnard, CA",35,40,4,5.0,9/29/2011,Love this place. If you wand something a lil healthy the salads here are the best but if you want a lil something sweet you have to try the Cheesecakes
Martha F.,"Camarillo, CA",36,29,,3.0,9/15/2011,"Cheesecake factory is good. Service is hit and miss. Chicken Salad Sandwich, orange chicken, white choc raspberry truffle cheesecake is my fav."
Lilani E.,"Seattle, WA",754,657,78,1.0,2/7/2008,"As I type this review, getting chills and short of breath from eating bad sushi (see below), I remember I forgot to mention Cheesecake Factory and how I've been ill the last two times I've eaten there. This past time I decided to give Cheesecake a second chance after they had food poisoned me with are mushroom pasta of some sort many years back.  We stopped by here after my excursion at Bare Escentuals in the TO Mall.  I ordered the Seafood Jambalaya.  The shrimp must not have been handled well because that night, I was ill, waking up throughout and not getting good sleep at all.  The next day after it was all ""out of my system"" I felt better than ever and that is always my tell-tale sign that whatever it was, even if it was a mild case, it was food poisoning. Sorry Cheesecake, you have been blacklisted by my stomach."
Rebecca H.,"West Los Angeles, CA",143,69,,2.0,2/6/2008,"Boo on you, Cheesecake Factory.  Your staff needs to do a better job cleaning your booths.  I had just dropped a chunk of change on a damn-fine pair of jeans and decided I was hungry and needed a glass of wine. (Hey, trying on jeans can be tough.) I went to my booth, put my bags down, and promptly stuck my hand in a pile of goo on the edge of  my seat. I could take some guesses as to what the pile o' goo was...chocolate cake, I hope? But it felt -and looked - nasty.  That kind of ruined the rest of my lunch.  My BBQ chicken ranch salad tasted kind of watery. The wine was ok, but I've had better Pinot Grigios I could have spent that $23 (including tip) a little more wisely."
John D.,"Westlake Village, CA",2,43,5,4.0,3/27/2011,The food is Great but the service is so so.  The wait time has gotten a lot better.  The original cheesecake with the strawberries is the best!!!
Brian S.,"Camarillo, CA",168,234,74,4.0,5/19/2008,"Cheesecake Factory has never let me down. Whether it's a business lunch or a family dinner, there is always something for everyone. Of course the servings are ginormous and it's a chain, but I'm not complaining. Armed with a gift card, we recently visited our closest Cheesecake for lunch. To my surprise, they had a Monte Cristo sandwich on the Sunday brunch menu. Since this is now the object of my own personal gluttonous quest, I ordered the breakfast version which is made with bacon and scrambled eggs. It was awesome! I then suffered a massive heart attack and died...Not really, but if I did, I would have died happy. If you have kids, there are no kids menus, but they do have kid friendly options. Just ask your server about them.  As usual it was packed with pretentious people. The mall is currently in a transition stage with lots of construction, but they are still serving cheesecake."
Missy C.,"Portland, OR",0,30,3,3.0,1/20/2011,"The good is amazing I love it especially the bistro shrimp pasta! However, the service isn't so great especially on weekends which really sucks!"
Mary A.,"Agoura, CA",8,36,,5.0,7/11/2011,"Thank you thank you thank you to the folks at Cheesecake Factory Thousand Oaks for salvaging my niece's birthday celebration.  We had been to another restaurant and had a MISERABLE experience . . . I was so disappointed, and then my husband said, ""Hey, let's stop in at the Cheesecake Factory for dessert and a drink.""  We had a such a great end to an otherwise miserable and expensive evening that I almost forgot to write the rotten review of the other restaurant!  Almost . . . :-) Thank you CCF for a great save!"
Laura M.,"Oxnard, CA",95,118,155,5.0,11/15/2010,No complaints here. I love everything on the menu with the exception of the items on the calorie friendly menu...lol
Kara M.,"San Diego, CA",6,43,,5.0,9/3/2006,"This restaurant has many different types of food that can satisfy any craving. There is everything from American food, Thai food, Chinese, Mexican, and Italian. The service is always really friendly and very organized. The only thing I would recommend is getting there very early (5 o'clock) on weekends because it will have at least an hour wait.   I strongly recommend the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. It is great if you like curry and coconut. It's not too spicy, but just spicy enough.  If you're looking for a lighter meal, the salads are excellent and the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps are really good. The Thai Chicken Pasta is also really good; it has a delicious peanut sauce on it.  Their Tropical Smoothie is really good too.  If you like cheesecake, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. They are constantly coming up with new flavors and have a list of about 20 different kinds. If you want to be traditional, go with the Strawberry cheesecake. If you're feeling a little daring, try the Banana Cream cheesecake. You won't regret it."
Richard K.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/10/2014,"I've been a Cheesecake Factory customer since it's beginnings in Beverly Hills... Back in the days of the big beefy ribs, salad bar and yes, even back then, lines out the door.    About 25 years ago, I settled on the Factory Burger as my ""go to"" meal and that was pretty much the only thing I ordered.  Last night, after being away for about a year, I returned to what I thought would be another satisfying meal... even if I had to wait 30-40 minutes.  Well, I was incredibly disappointed.  We had a party of 4, and although we were seated reasonably quick and the appetizer came out without incident, the main course (two burgers, a salad and an order of sliders took almost 40 minutes and came out at two separate times....and it wasn't even that busy.  To top it off, the meal itself was disappointing.  The burgers were blah, the chinese chicken salad was missing the dressing and was not at all what it used to be, the sliders lacked interest, and one waitress (not our main server) asked if one of our party wanted more coffee when it was clear there was a pot of water on the table and a tea bag in the cup.  Yes, the Manager came over to apologize when the Server discovered and reported to him that our food was extra slow in coming and only half had actually made it to the table... and he did ultimately make an accommodation for the poor service, but even so, after so many years doing the same thing over and over, this restaurant should have been running like a well oiled machine... and that includes the B team.  The only thing I can think of to create such a miserable meal is that the kitchen must have had the losers from Hell's Kitchen running the show because something was definitely wrong back there.  I never thought I'd be writing a negative review for TCF, but this was by far the worst experience I've had in over 25 years as a customer and has probably been the experience to put the nail in the coffin for future meals here.  There are just too many other choices in the area now to go back for another miserable experience."
Bill H.,"Palm Springs, CA",0,62,,2.0,11/7/2014,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory for years, and now I remember why: heavy, salty, sugary, fattening food.  I probably should have ordered from the new lite menu, but opted for the original (huge) menu because that is what I remembered from dining here years ago.  I think my palate has changed, because most of the dishes seem like what you'd order when on a teenage date.  Friends suggested coming here because it's a good meet-in-the-middle spot, so we agreed.  We were seated promptly and our server was great; a slice of plain cheesecake for dessert was delicious.  The bang-bang chicken/shrimp was way too sweet and had too much coconut on it (think coconut cake!) The menu description said something like ""Thai inspired"" but believe me there was nothing Thai about it. The fish and chips were very greasy.  Our friends said their pasta and burger were good.  I think we will come back again, but only for the cheesecake."
Jennifer C.,"Moorpark, CA",62,36,5,4.0,4/3/2010,"There was no wait, even though it was packed. When does that ever happen? Weird! Food was served quickly and server was on top of it! Holy Cow, did the CF finally figure things out?  I usually hate going here, but this was my first time I had a completely pleasant experiance.That being said, the food was still average. C'mon how good can a place be when there are corn dogs AND Thai food?  Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms was decent. LOTS of food! Enough for lunch tomorrow. Sangria was too sweet and served over ice, weird?  Tex Mex Egg rolls were tasty! Hubby had Fish and Chips. He said it was yummy and the slaw was decent.  Why go there when I knew I wasn't a huge fan....CHEESECAKE....Hello!!!! Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake!!! Whoever thought of this is AMAZING and needs to win some sort of award. Holy Hell this thing was amazing!!!!! I left out a star because of the presence of corndogs on their menu....and no not on the kids part of the menu...."
Marc G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,9,,5.0,8/28/2013,"I have to say I been coming here almost every Sunday now for a couple of years after church. I know when I go to the Cheesecake Factory, I will get great service and great food. My son and I always end up in Noa's section, she is a great server, very friendly and she knows what I like before I sit down. I enjoy coming here for brunch, you get lots of food your your buck! Oh the new Smore's cheesecake is to die for!"
Brandon S.,"Olympia, WA",243,479,258,4.0,12/27/2007,"I wanted to dislike The Cheesecake Factory something fierce.  Somehow I've avoided it for years and during that time I built up almost an animosity toward it.  It's the ultimate in overblown, overstuffed American chain restaurants and in my indie mind, it's evil.  But hey, a $50 gift card is a $50 gift card.  If it's free, who cares about evil.   But seriously, the food was delicious, I was pleasantly surprised starting with one of the greatest appetizers of all time - fried mac & cheese!  I've seen commercials for this dish at various other places and it excited me to no end.  Finally, I got to try it  and it was even better than I expected.  Best. Appetizer. Ever.  More bars need to serve fried mac & cheese.  It would be the best drunk food.  My entree was the Hibachi Steak - slices of steak with mushrooms, onions and a teriyaki sauce served with tempura aspargus and wasabi mashed potatoes.  Very tasty and cooked perfectly.  My only complaint was the mashed potatoes barely had any wasabi flavoring.   The wife had the Ranch House Burger - a burger topped with chunks of steak, bacon, mushrooms and cheese.  Mmm....Meaty!  It too was really good and cooked perfectly medium rare. There wasn't a chance in hell that we were going to be able to eat any more food, so we got a slice of Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake to go.  I love that they have a to go dish that keeps the whip cream and the cheesecake separate.  Do they have a separate Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake To Go Box Factory somewhere?  Service was good, seats were comfortable, cute kid in the window played peek-a-boo with me.  Overall, it was a solid meal and it only cost me a few bucks thanks to the wonder of the gift card.  Someday I'll actually have to come back and pay for my meal and see if I like it as much as when it's free. But advertisements in the menu do leave me with a cold, evil feeling in the end."
David P.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",18,10,,5.0,8/16/2011,"The Farmhouse burger rocks! I have had this burger twice since it appeared on the menu and it's one of the best burgers I've ever had. Everything at this restaraunt is great. They have something for everybody there, I highly recommend it. The only drawback to the place is the noise level. If you don't mind the noise it's very nice."
Michelle O.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",248,787,345,5.0,9/4/2006,"I love this place! o so good! The inside and outside is both nicely decorated. Their food portions are very big and you are def. getting your money's worth. I've never been dissappointed about my food choices, they are all good. I recommend the salads, but they are really big, the chicken marsala (yum!) and of course all the cheescakes are great. The dulce de leche cheesecake is the most sugar teeth decaying cheesecake, i swear it's tastes like pure sugar, doesn't even taste like cheesecake. The ones that are good is white chocolate raspberry truffle (OMG YUM!), snickers bar. Though I think the slices have got smaller over the years, they are still good. What might be better priced if you want a whole cheesecake is go to costco and they have the cheesecake factory sampler w/ 4, I think different kinds in each package (3 of each kind) and they are all really good. Back to the cheesecake factory: They have good service, good food portions, but...it gets soooo busy there, mostly on the weekends but even on the week nights can get pretty bad. If you can make reservations I suggest that. The shortest amount of time that I had to wait was about 30 mins. But if your lucky they have tables for you to wait at. Other than that you won't regret your decision of eating here. O and depending on what you get like pasta for example, you can split between 2 people."
