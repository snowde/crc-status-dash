Lauren W.,"Simi Valley, CA",5,23,3,2.0,12/24/2012,"The silverware and glassware were very dirty. I asked for replacements and we got silverware that still had specks of food on them and the glass had a lipstick mark on it. I finally asked for plastic silverware and glasses. If the silverware and glassware is that dirty, what does the kitchen look like? Food was fine but experience ruined for a family lunch"
Gus G.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,16,25,2.0,5/24/2012,"The food at the Cheesecake factory for the most part is always plentiful and good.  However we go there, as most do, for the cheesecake.  This is the second time in 3 months we went to the same Cheescake Factory location to celebrate one of my childs birthday.  And for the second time in a row, they blew it.  Upon checking in, I told the hostess that we were celebrating a birthday and she said she would tell the waiter.  Surprise for the second time in a row, the hostess forgot.  I can care less about a free dessert, but most kids like to feel special on the birthday, so a candle and some recognition is always nice.  The fact that it has happened twice in a row with two seperate hostess', means that this is a management issue.  While I brought it to the managers attention, and she agreed and apologized, the incident left a bad taste in my mouth.  For me good service always trumps all.  Very dissapointing."
Josh M.,"Malibu, CA",0,22,,4.0,7/31/2013,Few of us decided to dine on Tuesday because of their mushroom soup is only served on Tuesday (dumb idea) and 1/2 off cheesecake once a year on Tuesday. Our order took over 30 mins to get (waiter put our order in late) and the food was sent back because it was overcooked (just had bread that night) and the service was poor. Oh by the way now the mushroom soup is only served on Wednesdays. Not that we will return.
Sarah G.,"Simi Valley, CA",177,15,13,4.0,2/21/2011,"I work in this mall and its easy to get very sick of the food choices we have... it can also get pricey!  I love when my 'lunchtime' at work falls between 4 and 7 pm so that I can enjoy Cheesecake's happy hour!  Honestly, if you can find something on the happy hour menu then Cheesecake Factory is the cheapest meal in the mall!!  Otherwise the menu is HUGE so if cash is not your concern then Cheesecake Factory is also a place that you can enjoy regularly without getting sick of it, so many choices!!!  The 'to go' gals are always sweet and at least remember my face whenever I come.  Recently this location redecorated their little patio area (well, they have an outdoor patio but then they have this little atrium like area that is actually inside the mall but not in the restaurant main) So technically they redecorated the atrium area and it looks so much nicer!  I'd still prefer to sit in the restaurant main or out on the actual patio (on a nice day) but if it's busy and I get placed out there now I'd feel comfortable. The last time I went for dinner (outside of a work break) was for my 2 year anniversary with my boyfriend and the waitress was so sweet and even had our dessert made special for us!  Yeah, I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory, but particularly this location!"
Nerry L.,"North Las Vegas, NV",116,52,5,4.0,12/12/2010,"Omg I love Cheesecake factory, the price is decent and the food is great.  I always get the Cajun chicken little's or the Thai lettuce wraps it's soooo good. They have a lot of choices of foods & drinks. The only thing i dislike about cheesecake factory is that is so dark, they really need to turn up the lights lol. Other than that it's a really great place to eat or go on a date. Oh I almost forgot, they have the best free bread ever."
Danny N.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,5.0,7/10/2013,"had dinner with a couple of friends the other night and was very pleased with the dining experience.  The food was good for a chain restaurant and loved all the options.  we started with the avocado egg rolls which were awesome, and for an entree i went with the miso salmon which i would definitely recommend.  Last but not least you cant go to The Cheesecake Factory without indulging with a little dessert...we went with the dutch apple cheesecake and it was frieken delicious!  I've eaten at cheesecake many times before and like I said the food is really good for being a chain restaurant, but what I would come back for without a doubt was the amazing service!!  Our server was Megan G and even though the restaurant seemed to be busy at the time she was extremely attentive.  She seemed to be very knowledgeable and did everything in a timely manor (the food did take a while, but that's expected in a busy restaurant).  In addition a manager had stopped by to check up on us and made sure we were enjoying our meal.  A glass was never left empty and the food came out hot (except the cheesecake of course).   Being a server myself I know it is not easy to keep up with the guests needs when the restaurant is busy, great job to Megan and the entire wait staff at Cheesecake.  I will be back and look forward to another great dining experience."
Elvira G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",15,238,8,4.0,3/31/2012,"Everyone knows Cheesecake.  It's predictable, reasonable, and filling.  It's the place to go when you don't want to take chances and you like the buzz of people enjoying the food. Hubby and I enjoy splitting a salad and getting the tuna sushi appetizer.  I like Cheescake and you probably do too."
Patricia L.,"San Buenaventura (Ventura), CA",46,57,13,3.0,8/8/2010,"The Godiva chocolate cheese cake is awesome! Service is always good. I am not a big fan of chain restaurants but I admit the food is good and big enough to share. We had lunch and shared the Barbecue Chicken Ranch Salad, it was a great choice for lunch.  I had a Stella on tap at $6.00 a glass 16 oz that seems a little pricey. It's good but yes it is a chain restaurant."
Negar M.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,17,,4.0,6/20/2013,You can never go wrong with this place. Anything on the menu is delicious and tasty. I tried the steak Dian for the first time and highly recommend it!
Adriana V.,"Oxnard, CA",3,6,,5.0,3/21/2011,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for the cheesecake. I did eat a main entree, some pasta thing w/ chicken and shrimp. Very good by the way, but the Banana Cream Cheesecake was the best combination of cheesecake, whipped cream, and fresh banana's I've ever tasted. My hubby said the whipped cream was like eating a fluffy cloud.  Don't know when he tasted a cloud, must of been before we started dating.   We did not have to wait to be seated which was a relief. We had to walk this long courtyard in pouring rain to find the place. The server was very handsome and we got our food quick.   We had leftovers from our main entrees but we devoured that cheesecake slice even licked the plate clean. Hee hee those snobby people a table away probably assumed we were Oxnardians.   Anyhoo, we will defenitley be repeat customers, but only on special occasions because I believe their prices are up there."
Christian P.,"Los Angeles, CA",186,387,9,5.0,11/21/2007,Ate here on numerous occasions during my employment in Boring Oaks.. I mean Thousand Oaks. I always had excellent service and very friendly staff despite it being empty or filled at 100% capacity.  These guys never missed a beat.  Food portions were massive and always took food home. Each time the food was delicious and excellent. I LOVED the pulled pork sandwich despite the food coma after ahha..  Bar service is excellent even during 5pm happy hour.
eS P.,"Ventura, CA",58,48,24,3.0,8/25/2007,"As Cheesecake Factory chain goes, this one is OK. It has a variety of menu options and is a general good choice if you're feeling fo-adventurous. I am a fan of the eggplant burger, the yummiest veggie burger in town.  If you are on a wheel chair though, I recommend eating off peak hours because the tables are too close for easy navigation during rush hours."
Alex S.,"Oxnard, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/12/2014,"My last visit to Cheesecake Factory in Thousand Oaks was the worst dining and service experience I have ever had. I mention Thousand Oaks because I frequent the Sherman Oaks location and have always had a good experience. I am a pretty understanding person and being that I work in the service industry, can relate;however, the only explanation I have is that I was discriminated against. This experience has forever changed my perception of the company and I will never return but I believe it's my duty to share it with you. After arriving and being informed of a ""15"" min wait time, I was seated after 1hr15min, only because I surfaced my concern as I witnessed 4-5 groups of all sizes that arrived after me get seated first. I even stood by the greeter after she told me I was next. After another 2 groups were seated I looked at the greeter and she said it was okay and assured me my table was being prepared. Another 2 groups were seated and the greeter tells me my she is sorry but my table was given away. I hope you can understand my frustration and dismay. I am a  male Hispanic with 2 female Hispanics, celebrating a birthday after work. We are well dressed and I can't find another reason or explanation. I don't think competence could have taken it this far.  Finally we were seated at a what seemed to be a remote location within the Resturant that was almost empty(4-5 empty tables). The server wasn't much better than the greeter( drinks were never refilled). Anyways, this experience has taken enough of my time but I truly hope others don't have to share this same experience, drive to Sherman Oaks. It's only 35-40 min away(without traffic) but if you are Hispanic, you might be saving time."
Rob G.,"Port Hueneme, CA",42,156,2,2.0,5/22/2008,"I won't reiterate the menu here, it's Cheesecake Factory. Food is average,  service is absolutely horrible. Staffed primarily by snotty teens from the area, unless you meet their visual standards then prepare to wait and be treated poorly. Since I'm a little on the bigger side, I think you can tell where this is going. The couple of times I've been to this location the food has been OK but it takes so long to get out to you, you start to wonder if it's even worth it (even on several slow weekdays my wife and I have been subject to excessively long waits), in addition we've had trouble with our servers being given too large an area to service and having to wait for far too long for drink/bread refills. Even the CHEESECAKE here isn't that great. Heresy, you might say, but I've had better, and more often.  My suggestion: try Sisley across the way, they (used to?) have a wicked italian saugage with fettucine, the staff is much friendlier and the wait far shorter."
Jennifer H.,"San Francisco, CA",296,525,4,4.0,6/26/2007,"So many, many lunches with mom and my little brother have been spent here.  Right after sweet talking her into buying me a pair of shoes or something because this location is located in the Thousand Oaks mall.  The waits are never terrible, and the service is always great! P.S.  Why are the floors at EVERY C.F. so gosh darn slippery!  Why?"
ed l.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",6,64,3,3.0,2/4/2007,"Even though it's a chain, cheesecake factory is pretty good.  Consistent from location to location.  For steak lovers, the cajun ribeye is really good - far better than steakhouses like outback. The low-carb cheesecake is fantastic."
Rod C.,"Camarillo, CA",172,231,25,5.0,12/30/2008,"I've been impressed with all the dishes here.  We enjoyed the arugula pear endive salad, chinese chicken salad, grilled eggplant sandwich, herb crusted salmon filet, cajun jambalaya pasta, crispy spicy beef, meatloaf, shrimp scampi with steak diane, filet mignon, kobe burger, chicken madeira, all the apps are great!  Good beverage selection, good well drinks, good martinis, everything here is good! The point, all portions are good enough for two people, so try splitting an entree.  Otherwise this always an excellent choice for lunch or dinner."
J L.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,27,,5.0,2/19/2010,"Always good food and great service.  I honestly have been here more times than I can count and have never had even mediocre service.  It is always great or excellent.  They have it together.  And try their mai tais!  They are crazy strong and good.  As for complaining about a long wait, booo hoo, get there early or come late.  There is a reason they are popular, and like all popular restaurants you WILL have to wait."
Nat H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,8,7,4.0,5/4/2010,"Santa Fe Salad, what a meal, I enjoyed eating at the cheesecake factory and I certainly enjoyed the strawberry cheesecake. A great place for a lunch date with friends."
Jamal H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,10,,5.0,4/16/2012,Great service! Great food! Great atmosphere! Great CHEESECAKE! and Great management! Kudos!
