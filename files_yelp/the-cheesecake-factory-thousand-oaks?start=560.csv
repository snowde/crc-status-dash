H Y.,"Berkeley, CA",122,343,,2.0,5/16/2008,"Dude its the Cheesecake factory!  Its the same everywhere you go.  Um except this was the location where some employees were stealing credit card information.  It was all over the news.  Anyway to the food.  They have lots of variety but the food is usually mediocore to good.  Never poor, never great.  I did try something new this time around.  Miso glazed salmon.  Not bad at all.  Glad I did not pick up the tab with my credit card though."
Z Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,575,67,2.0,7/15/2007,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove several times and the food was always consistently good.  Not great by any means but OK.  I went to this location last night and was pretty disappointed.  I ordered a small endive and pecan salad and a grilled cheese.  When the salad arrived, I noticed something strange in it and it was a big hunk of chicken.  Now being a vegetarian for 17 years, I wasn't actually sure what it was but Paul tasted it and confirmed that it was indeed chicken....bummer. So, I sent it back right away and didn't ask for a replacement.  Paul had ordered the garlic noodles without cheese and had to send his back because it came with the cheese.  He also mentioned that he didn't like how it tasted so he ordered the Kobe burger as a replacement.  My grilled cheese was actually burnt and gross.  The cheddar cheese was actually brown and did not taste like any type of cheddar I have ever had before.  Sigh....I only ate about four bites.   The manager came over and apologized profusely for the problems with our food which was nice.  I was too embarrassed to send the grilled cheese back too, I am not used to sending food back.  Everyone else liked their food so, maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.  (Although I have ordered this same thing at the Grove location before and it was good enough!). The desserts at the Cheesecake factory are awesome though.  I tried a few bites out of Paul's Godiva brownie ice cream sunday and out of my brother in law's peanut butter cookie dough  cheese cake and wow....they were both fantastic.  They also brought us a mini ice cream Sunday for a birthday celebration and that was good also.   Although my food stunk and Paul had to send his back the first time I had a nice time.  The outside patio area is decorated nicely and the waitstaff are quite friendly.  Everyone else that were with loved their food and the desserts are amazing.  Normally I would have given the Grove location a three star rating but for this location I am actually giving it a 1.5-2 star rating.  Hey, but the leftover pizza that I ate as soon as I got home from Buono was AWESOME!"
Meredith I.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,8,,5.0,2/13/2011,"I love the cheesecake factory. Consistent, well trained staff and huge portions. Not to mention other variety of food choices. It is a little overwhelming bout since i'm a picky eater it's not that bad.  Favorites: fried Mac and cheese balls for appetizers, ALL the pastas. Wow i could go on forever. If you have the opportunity request Dan as your server.  Excellent every time. But don't go on a Friday night cuz you will wait forever!! Stick with lunch or weekdays."
Tricia M.,"Pacoima, CA",27,161,,4.0,12/27/2007,"if there could be one word to describe the cheesecake factory...it would probably be ""massive quantity""...wait, i said one, right? after spending what little funds i had in my checking account in order to put glee on the faces of each of my nieces & nephews for the xmas holiday...my shopping posse decided to round up and eat at this establishment. after drinks were served all 'round (i had a mint iced tea...i was feeling kinda sissy-ish)...our dishes were served not too long after. the quesadilla i ordered was filling as always...the pico de gallo and guacamole is always good to smother over my quesadilla.  a few other plates that floated around the table were pork chops, some steak dishes, and my sis's favourite, the pizza lunch order.  it came w/ a caesar's salad.  my sis had a ""collection plate"" in front of her order....which meant that she wanted everyone to place a taste of their order in there so she could try it...she's a funny girl. so this place, like many other restaurant chains, has it's charms...the outdoor heated seating (cuz it's been a bit chilly lately), the waiters asking if you want freshly ground peppery, or freshly shaved parmesan cheese...it's all good, and so were our meals. a solid four stars cheesecake!  and again, that mint tea is ace!"
Jennifer D.,"Oak Park, CA",6,337,,3.0,5/1/2008,"The Cheesecake Factory serves a large variety of consistently good food.  It's a great place to eat after shopping at the mall. It's also a good place to take a group as someone usually finds something they like.  I like their salmon salad. Don't hate me, but I think their cheesecake (though large in variety) is just OK."
James P.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",275,492,222,3.0,11/29/2008,"Why the hell would you spend 50 to 75 for a meal for two at the Cheesecake Factory when you could actually find a good local restaurant on Yelp that has much better food.  Some previous reviews have said that there is something for everyone, but that is part of the problem with the place.  I am sorry but I do not need to have a large variety of mediocre food.  If I want thai food or Italian food, I will go to a restaurant that actually specializes and does it well, instead of getting the Bang Bang Bangkok Brothel dish or whatever the hell it is called.  My final beef is with the menus.  I do not want to see a Lexus ad next to my food selections.  I really wonder about a chain that feels the need to squeeze out as much profit as possible by selling the real estate of their menus.  But maybe that is how they support the cost of their massive portions?  If your friends drag you here, then do not fret too much, but otherwise be a true Yelper and choose restaurants that do one cuisine well."
avon a.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,31,1,5.0,2/16/2009,"hands down my favorite go to restaurant. when we can't decided where to grab a bite or wake up starving sunday morning and don't want to drive too far this is where we end up. the service is always great. they now offer kids menus which we don't order from anyways though. and they have a great green iced tea. i get mine sweetened and it is heaven, it has a minty taste which i love. i always love what i order, like the miso salmon, garlic noodles with shrimp, tuna tar tar, farfalle, pizzas. i love it all."
Jackie P.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",96,84,25,4.0,8/17/2009,"OMG, let me just tell you that this place is soooo good and I am know the biggest fan of Cheesecake factory.  Unfortunately, the resturant is unable to reach five star quality due to the fact that it takes two hours to get a table and the table that we received was smooshed into a corner on the patio.  Did I mention that we were a party of 10???!!!???  Oh yea, lets not forget that our party was making the table of two next to us upset cause we were bumping into them for the mere fact that we were trying to get to our seats....**end rant** Now to the food, I had the best appetizer and side salad, and let me tell you that i was just the right size for me as the meal portions here are huge and I really did not want a huge heavy meal, I really wanted cheesecake and I did not want to feel guilty for eating.  I ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna with a simple salad with Honey Mustard.  I would recommend this dish combo to any who does not want a really heavy meal like lets say like my fiance who ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken, now that is heavy stuff.  After dinner we ordered a the mudslide Oreo cheesecake.  It was way yummy!!!! not rich even though my fiance thought it was, I did not!!!!  This is my new favorite spot it is so my favorite spot that Mark and I are going to do our date night at the brea location.  Oh how I can't wait, my mouth is watering just thinking about it!!!! Yummy!!!"
Dylan C.,"Ventura, CA",0,65,,4.0,10/30/2010,"ok so this is like the home depot of restaurants, that being said i have almost never had the cheesecke here, i am always too full for dessert, when you go please get the miso salmon its my favorite but i suggest substituting the rice for mashed  potatoes, its a zillion times better, the food is good but i gotta give them 4 stars becuase after having been here alot more times than i care to admit the service has always exceeded my expectations. i have been to these establishments in many cities and while the t.o. location is my favorite, the service at every stop has been really great"
jen b.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",7,20,,2.0,2/9/2008,What's the point in buzzing you to let you know your table is ready if you are buzzed with 3 other parties at the same time and then ushered to the side to wait an additional 5 minutes?  Why can't you just buzz me after you seat the people in front of me and are ready to seat me?   Why do you stack all the dirty plates right in front of me before taking them away?  Why do you drop off my food and then I never hear back from you?  Why do you put so many rice noodles on your Chinese Chicken Salad?  Why do you charge a fortune for food that is so-so?  Why did you change your Baja Soft Tacos so they don't have grilled onions on them?  And why would you not tell people that it has been changed when they order it and it has the old description on the menu?  Why do you have to make cheesecakes with everything you can imagine?  Why do I keep going back?  Because the Thai Chicken Pasta is the only yummy thing I like there except when you put the carrots in it.  Why do you need carrots?
shopaholic P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,36,,5.0,7/9/2008,"Their cheesecake is soooooooo......yummy!  Garlic noodle is my favorite!  Expect a little wait time on the weekends, but since it's located inside The Oaks mall, it's nice to look around while you wait to be seated.  I'll bet The Oaks Mall will be super nice when the renovation is done (Fall 2008)."
d a.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,132,,5.0,8/25/2008,"awesome food, servers.  can get noisy in main dining but side room and also outside dining available."
