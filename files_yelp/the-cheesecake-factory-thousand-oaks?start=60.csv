Brenda L.,"Camarillo, CA",0,48,34,3.0,8/21/2017,This review on on a take out. My mom and I ordered 2 slices of carrot cake and one strawberry cheesecake. The taste is great; but overpriced. It's $8.50 for one slice. It was almost $30 transaction. I understand that this is a more expensive restaurant; but I believe that the slices are too small for the price.
Rebecca R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",31,186,83,3.0,7/8/2017,Long wait times abound here and service is hit or miss. I have had some great experiences here and others have required improvement both in terms of service and attention to detail (for example I have had ingredients show up in my food that weren't on the menu and which I don't like or can't eat).
Alan Z.,"West Hills, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/2/2017,"Waited an hour to be seated........then waited close to an hour to get our food once we placed our order.....my chinese chicken salad had no chicken in the meal, so I complained and when the manager returned, the salad had been sitting so long, the lettuce was so soggy it was disgusting....the manager never came back to make sure the order was OK.  She acted as if she really didn't care.  The waiter was a complete waste of time as well !! Needless to say, it was a terrible experience, which was odd as we have been there many times before and always received good service and great food !!"
Gavin S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,16,3,2.0,1/1/2017,"My compliant isn't with the food, Cheesecake Factory is solid, I've eaten in a bunch of them all over.  My complaint is with the dogs that are allowed in the restaurant.  According to the staff the policy changes from manager to manager.  Seems odd from a restaurant that has such control over the wife variety of food in different locations.  And before you blast me, neither dog inside the restaurant were  service animals.  Not even the fake ones you see all over the place nowadays. I think City of Thousands Oaks health inspector should look into ""dogs in the restaurant"" here."
Jovian C.,"Berkeley, CA",449,66,103,4.0,7/23/2016,"I've been to this location many times, and it's one of my favorites compared to others in the Valley.  Their menu is very comprehensive, although my new favorite recently has been the steak tacos! It comes with 4 tacos topped with onion, tomato, avocado, cilantro, and some kind of chipotle sauce that is amazing. Rice & beans on the side.  The brown bread is surprisingly out of this world and I have returned on occasion just to buy a roll of the bread. It's so worth it!! :)"
Melissa W.,"Anaheim Resort, Anaheim, CA",293,60,10,5.0,4/13/2017,"How can you go wrong at a Cheesecake Factory...you can't! There are so many tasty options. My favorite item that I usually get 9/10 times is the Factory Burrito. It is great to share, which I do. If you want a hearty dish, get that. The cheesecake can't be beat! The peanut butter one and the nutella one are my favorites. During the holidays, it is a must in my family to buy like 3 gift cards to get the cheesecake coupon. If you are looking for something to eat, go here. There is something for everyone!"
S R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,32,30,5.0,7/29/2017,"I went here for a birthday. The free birthday Sundae was really small, but you of course can get cheesecake! The food was delicious! We got the chicken piccata and herb crusted salmon. Both were so delicious! They bring out fresh (endless) bread. Service was a little slower, but they were extremely busy so it was understandable. Honestly have been craving the chicken piccata everyday since we ate there. We also got the avocado egg rolls, which were a must get!! It was nice to walk around the mall after the meal. T.O. Mall is extremely clean and has a lot of nice stores.  Everyone in the party enjoyed their plates! Would highly recommend going!"
Eileen M.,"Sea View Estates, Oxnard, CA",93,6,,1.0,11/4/2017,"Very disappointed tonight I know that they were crowded and I take that under consideration but my meal was horrible, and our Waiter lacked  in the service department. Had to send my mail back twice still came back cold and tasteless. Used to get this dish all the time always had a good experience at the cheesecake factory and not sure I will be coming ever back again."
Darren P.,"Newbury Park, Newbury Park, CA",0,3,,5.0,8/15/2017,"I was currently in the Cheesecake Factory a couple of days ago. They were very busy as always. I was able to get seated in about 25 minutes. This was my first time actually sitting down and eating dinner there. My waiter was Shane. I made Shane  aware that I was Hypoglycemic. My sugar levels where dropping, he dropped what he's doing, went out of his way and got me a tea with sugar.  He is very professional, and he carried a  positive attitude the whole time I was there. He wasn't just nice to your face he's an all around great waiter.        I do plan on visiting The Cheesecake Factory again as much as I can. The food is great, the desserts are awesome. Thanks again Shane!!"
Rob L.,"Simi Valley, CA",54,11,,2.0,10/24/2016,Went for dinner.  Big mistake.  I gave them a 2 because the cheesecake is always great.  Will never go back to eat there ever again.  Fried fish tacos over cooked.  Burger was tasteless.  Steak was burned on out side.  The mashed potatoes were cold and stuck together that I could pick up and hang off fork upside down.  Kids mac n cheese was tasteless.  My pasta had only a small amount of sauce and the pasta felt old and hard.   I can't believe I didn't send everything back. Stupid me.  They full of people that I guess accept crappy food. I will never get anything but cheesecake and that won't be often.
Michael E.,"Oxnard, CA",246,183,164,4.0,4/2/2016,You can't go wrong with this spot- I wouldn't expect to be blown away by the food but you won't be disappointed either.  The menu selection is very diverse and you can also have select items gluten free - great option for those that need it.  Full bar and beers on tap- and of course you can't forget to try a slice of cheesecake... Hey now.
Dillon B.,"Ventura, CA",61,10,1,4.0,8/5/2017,"Just had dinner here and it was great! We got a table out side it was so nice. The 25 wait wasn't to bad especially at 6pm on a Friday night! Food was good, drinks good, service was good! We come down here once and awhile and it's worth the drive down!"
Shirley H.,"Moorpark, CA",95,584,600,3.0,9/6/2015,"I came here with my hubs recently for a pre-birthday lunch and left somewhat satisfied. It was crazy busy on a Sunday afternoon of course, but I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly we were able to get a table. I also love the restaurants new way of getting a hold of you. The hosts used to give you pager type thing, where you weren't able to go within a certain amount of feet, or else it wouldn't work. But now, they ask for your cell number so they can text you when your table is ready.  Once we were seated, we had plenty of time to look at our menu and pick out the dishes we wanted. I knew my hubs would want the buffalo blasters for an appetizer and cheesecake for dessert, so I chose to get a side tossed salad. I used to LOVE their salad but was disappointed with the croutons. They used to season it which gave the salad the right amount of freshness and flavor without the salad dressing, but this time, my salad only came with a sliver of a crouton. When I asked for more, the waitress brought out a nice small dish full, but when I tasted it, I felt like I was biting into straight up oil! It actually ruined the salad. But the buffalo blast was greasy and delicious and so was the cheesecake my hubs ordered-apple crumb.  My hubs ordered the lunch portion of shepherds pie, which tasted bland to me, but my hubs seemed to like it. The portion it self was pretty big, which was nice for what you pay.  Overall, it was an okay meal and our server did a great job, even though she was slammed with other patrons."
Megan Q.,"Monterey, CA",20,32,12,1.0,5/14/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, and brought my mom here for Mother's Day. We were told the wait was gonna be 30 minutes but ended up waiting over an hour. Our food and service were okay, I've experienced better at this location but since eating here today I've now had some of the worst food poisoning to the point I can't get off the bathroom floor."
Shawn R.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,14,,1.0,5/2/2017,"Got food poisoning from here and had to be hospitalized. Had the smokehouse bbq burger and fried mac and cheese. Tasted good but i felt nasty after. I asked for medium well on the burger but it did have some bright pink spots so i'm guessing whatever poisoned me came from the meat. Couldn't sleep the night of due to nausea. and the next morning; vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain. Didn't feel better until i got to the ER and got some morphine and anti nausea meds pumped into me.  *update- called and spoke with the manager John who was very apologetic and seemed concerned. stated he would investigate the matter. and would be sending a gift card. good customer service."
Daniel B.,"Camarillo, CA",252,2,1,5.0,7/31/2017,I've been to many cheesecake factories and this was by far the best experience I've had. Our waitress Brittney was able to answer all of our question professionally and put a smile on our face every time we talked. It seemed to be a busy evening but we never once felt like she had forgotten about us. We will definitely be returning to dine with you guys again!
Irene B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,9,,1.0,5/1/2017,"I have given this place two chances, and I am done.  No other cheesecake factory gives me this problem but Thousand Oaks. First time, they swiped my credit card TWICE and charged me double. I did not find out until my card statements came out and I did not even get an apology from the manager. Second time coming here, I called and ordered for curbside. (I have my receipt for proof and details) I wanted to treat my mom to her favorite food, so I ordered nachos with NO jalapeños and waited 45 MINS for simple nachos (it wasn't even busy) and then called again. (I was told it would only be 15 mins)  I was put on a five minute hold and then they told me my food was ready all along, and they will bring it out right away. (50 min wait now) I was already tight on time, hence me calling ahead and ordering.  Apparently ""right away"" means five+ more minutes. So I gave up and just went inside and got the food myself, without receiving any apologies. As if that wasn't enough, my nachos were cold and soggy and they put jalapeños in them, which my mom bit into and did not have water in the car.  It was late and we lived out of town so we skipped dinner that night.  For a pricey and formal looking place, your employees sure need more experience. And by the way, I work for Door Dash and often deliver from here. Your employees often forget to even put down the order, constantly mess up the order, and I end up having to wait even longer and deal with angry customers who think it is my fault."
Kelly B.,"Ventura, CA",12,15,6,5.0,6/2/2017,"I feel like everyone can find something that they like here.  The menu is obviously huge, the variety of the menu is pretty good too.  My favorites are the enchilada type chicken stuffed tortillas.  The fact that my kid can order the kid's salmon (her favorite) is a huge plus!"
Don R.,"Bellevue, WA",201,18,1,4.0,4/30/2017,"Reviews The Cheescake factory Don't expect to be seated inside at a both anytime soon. Quoted 50 mins but was only 35  instantly greeted by our server (did not introduce himself) and took our drink order. Promptly returned and I wasn't ready (I know it's the CF but I'm eating differently these days) but circled back moments after I put the menu down  he did not try to upsell us on an app. Waiter was extremely attentive and communicative. Food came in a reasonable amount of time considering the amount of seats they turn. Food was good as always with a large chain that has an established successful uniformity. We had tickets to a show and due to the wait we had to box n go FAST. Our waiter was very helpful with that process as well. He was a waiter that took interest, continued to stay engaged and even tried to be humorous. He could definitely benefit from my extensive training and experience.  #frontofthehouse #waitstaff #waitertrainer #waitstaffmentor"
River B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",133,18,8,1.0,7/15/2017,"Ok. Let me start with, I'm a server I understand kitchens and how restaurants work, I understand being understaffed and extremely busy, I sympathize with restaurant staff more then the average customer, but today... I came in and ordered a small Caesar(no chicken) and three mason jars of Caesar dressing, I asked how long would that be, because I was in a hurry, she said 5 minutes, great! No problem, after 15 minutes I asked her(Julie E) she said were putting dressing together it will be out soon, ok another 5-7 minutes I asked again, I get no apology just a annoyed look and a ""were getting it together now"" at this point I saw a manager, I tell him what's been going on, while I'm speaking miss Julie interrupts me and says ""we had to make more dressing from scratch that's why it's taking to long"" to which I reply ""I really would have appreciated being told that 15 minutes ago"" the manager apologized and I got my order within 5 minutes of talking to the manager. I was not offered maybe a free slice of cheesecake, a coupon for next time, absolutely no compensation for horrible service. I would also like to add that I saw two men standing around like deers in the headlights not helping, no smiles, not helping anyone. I hate leaving bad reviews but I was offended, also when I got home the croutons were so stale and my lettuce was wilted after waiting for 25 minutes. That manager should be EMBARRASSED, and that women Julie E should have to go through training again at the very least, teach her some manners. I won't be going to to this location anymore."
