The T.,"Newbury Park, CA",1,39,,5.0,6/27/2017,I don't think they make anything bad here. I've tried many different things on the menu and everything they serve is great. A little pricey but at least your promised a great meal.
Delaney K.,"Simi Valley, CA",38,20,13,5.0,12/23/2016,"Love this location! You can't go wrong at the CCF the food is always perfect and the servers here are Really good, especially Joel who has been there forever. The chicken Marsala  is amazing and the avocado egg rolls are a must.  My daughter loves the miso salmon and the artichoke chicken soup is fabulous but rich. Good place for celebrating special occasions or just a good night out for a great dinner."
Handsel H.,"Ventura, CA",0,4,1,5.0,8/1/2017,"Been to Cheesecake Factory many many times. I've had good and bad experiences but to day I went in with my mom and my chicken sandwich was fried to a crisp, totally inedible and dead. Informed the server and she was great took the plate away offered another fresh sandwich. I was in a lil rush so I declined. The manager John was great, said he was sorry again offered a replacement. I was hungry so I figured a salad would be quick. I was very happy with the service I received from my server and management. I understand not every meal will be 100% perfect but when there is a problem I'm always leaving happy when I feel like my problem was handled by concerned managers and servers like this."
Julie R.,"Newbury Park, CA",1,91,3,1.0,10/11/2017,"When someone is shouting, screaming and snorting across the bar, perhaps it is time to cut them off. Don't wait for when they begin to confront fellow patrons before you suggest that it might be a good idea to call a cab. Food was under the heat lamp for way too long and was dried out and crunchy. Shrimp dish that boasted ""extra large"" shrimp came with five small shrimp tinier that what you would find in a shrimp cocktail. Not worth the trashy environment or the fast food level meal. Cross it off the list."
Ilyssia Z.,"Oxnard, CA",46,111,120,4.0,9/23/2016,"Wow, I'm suprised I haven't made a review til now since I've been here a few times. I come for dinner and it usually has at least a 20 minute wait but it's worth it! Eating inside it nice, but you can't miss out on having dinner outside under the stars, feeling the cool breeze while also feeling the warmth of the outside heaters, candle lit table and sipping on a great tasting mojito! The chicken marsala & mushrooms is a great dish as well as the pasta w/shrimp & sausage if your looking for pasta. Don't forget to end your dining with a slice of their excellent cheesecake!!!"
R. J.,"Camarillo, CA",0,76,2,2.0,9/12/2017,"What in the world is happening to the cheesecakes? The past few visits we have ordered multiple cheesecakes.. and although they appear delicious, they just arent! Why? We have noticed changes in many of the flavors but tonight like last week, we just chose to throw out all three of the flavors we purchased. One bite & clearly, things are not what they used to be & that includes the pumpkin cheesecake... so sad. Id rather pay more for dessert, than have lesser quality ingredients or cheaper labor to make them. Also, been getting sick after eating chicken in your store far too many times this Summer. Lets keep things chilled. Thanks."
Giselle E.,"Agoura Hills, CA",298,158,423,4.0,4/30/2015,"Never seems to let us down. Only down-side is they don't take reservations after 5pm so there is always such a long wait. They have tons of seating- outside, atrium and indoor. Just busy!  I love their vegetable chopped salad and Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp (huge portion - def can be shared). They offer a toddler plate for my daughter every time we go- includes bread slices and banana.  Nice and efficient staff."
Katie S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/5/2017,"Terrible service. My husband ordered take-out and was left waiting curbside for an hour when it was suppose to only take 20 minutes. There were multiple mistakes in our order and when my husband asked to speak with a manager, had to wait another 15 minutes. This is our last time we'll be going to this location. The last few times we have ordered pick-up it's been a nightmare."
Jacky C.,"Simi Valley, CA",256,22,12,4.0,1/8/2017,One of my favorite places to get dessert. Service is always spotty. my friend and I usually seem to get the waiter with a large party and don't receive adequate service.  This is a large chain where everything tastes pretty good. One of my favorites for an appetizer is the avocado eggrolls. The sweet green sauce they give you on the side is not enough! Always really good! Make sure to get the pumpkin pecan dessert when it's in season!
MZ M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,26,,5.0,5/30/2017,"Treated myself & my 2 kids to Cheesecake Factory tonight because My hubby has been out of town for a couple weeks and I hadn't take the kids to a nice meal at all, and I called ahead and there was no wait!  Now I have been here many times before and am always happy as the food is good quality for the price; and even though I always order either the miso salmon, jambalaya pasta, or strangely yummy meatloaf we enjoy the many choices.  Tonight though I strayed from my normal order and had the Shrimp Scampi & Herb Salmon Combo. I was hugely disappointed! the 3 Shrimp were ok and a nice size, but the salmon was tiny and totally overcooked (being a combo I expected smaller portions, but the salmon was so small and I think because of the size they seriously overcooked it) My kids enjoyed their food, but I was so disappointed that the salmon was not worth eating. I debate saying anything to the waitress, but did. Our waitress Savhanna was right away apologetic and offered to have another plate made, but I declined.  We ordered 2 desserts to go and while waiting someone I assume was a Manager came over to check on us about my food and said he would take care of it. I really appreciate that they tried to make every thing right for us, and even though I blame myself for straying from what I know I like. The Cheesecake Factory does what it should to take care of its customers. We will definitely be back! Maybe for lunch tomorrow and Miso Salmon!"
Kelly R.,"Newbury Park, CA",156,9,,3.0,7/8/2017,Bread was not fresh until we asked for replacement. Waitress couldnt've been any slower whenever we asked for something. Food is always good though and love the ambiance
Mike H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,25,,5.0,12/12/2016,"Good on you Cheese Cake Mangement! We had brunch yesterday at your Oaks mall store.  Our server Shane was really amazing.  He recommended the ricotta lemon zest pancakes and they were the best ever... Shane was a very gracious waiter, very polite and best of all he recommended those yummy pancakes.  Thank you, Mike"
Madison O.,"Camarillo, CA",2,52,5,3.0,5/7/2017,"Called at 9pm last night to order 5 single pieces of cheesecake. I tried paying over the phone with my credit card but the employee  wouldn't take it, totally understandable. However, when I arrived after the estimated time they told me they would be ready they still weren't ready. I waited and waited and waited and the cheesecakes still weren't ready. Not sure when I had called way in advance? Anyway, I brought the cheesecake home to my family and I was so upset to see the sizes and quality of the cheesecake. Cheesecake Factory is known for the large sizes of cheesecake , however these were below average. On top of that, for all of the flavored of cheesecake we bought, the taste was mediocre.  Definitely not worth the $50"
Chaunda B.,"Camarillo, CA",18,29,18,1.0,3/19/2017,"Super disappointed, we have been coming here for three years ordering the same thing. I order my normal lettuce tacos told the waiter no onions. It forever to get the food in the first place, not sure why they weren't that busy at at. I told the waiter that it had onions, he took it back. He brought out the new one which really was not a new cause it still had onions on it. Told the waiter again but this time I told him I did not want it or anything else since my husband was already done eating. The manager came over offer a piece of cheesecake which I said no because by this time we had been there for an hour waiting on food. The manager said that the onions are in the mix which is complete BS. I get the lettuce tacos every time I go there. I asked for our check, this took another 15 mins to get. Not going back there for a really long time. Left and still hungry"
Natalie V.,"Oxnard, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/2/2017,This place is one of my favorites to go. The food is delicious and so are the cocktails. Everyone is always super nice and friendly. The best part of it all is the location you can have great food and can shop while your in the area.
Gaurav D.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,35,,5.0,6/29/2017,"This restaurant is good. Try their, thai glazed salmon as well if haven't already it is awesome. They offer a variety, of different types of foods as well I think anyone would enjoy eating at this restaurant. Recently found out they have discontinued the thai glazed salmon."
Joe S.,"Oak Park, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/4/2017,"This is the first negative review I've ever left anywhere. Went there for lunch today. The server neglected us. When she finally came over she asked ""have you decided?"" Before our food came out, another party who came in after us, had their lunch and left. Our iced teas were refilled three times. Meals came out separately, five minutes apart. I had the chicken mango avocado salad. Not good. My wife had the Cobb. There were two lettuce cores in it. She said it wasn't good. I asked for the manager and politely told her of our experience. She looked past me as if she was thinking ""are you done yet?""  Got an insincere apology and a piece of cheesecake to take home."
Ana R.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,15,,5.0,6/6/2017,"I love this place, great food, and of course great cheesecake. I always go here, because their food is amazing. Staff are very friendly and food gets prepared very soon."
Rubi G.,"Camarillo, CA",48,3,,1.0,9/23/2017,"My first time there, I am not one to complain but the waiter was not very nice. I asked for the chipotle pasta and the taste was very good but the pasta was too hard, not cooked right. I asked the waiter to please bring me another plate because the pasta was hard and not cooked right and he got upset, brought another plate, pasta was the same. After several times of him going back and forth I finally gave up and just ate it, pasta was not cooked again and the waiter told me to ASK FOR MY PASTA WELL DONE NEXT TIME!"
Vicky E.,"Oxnard, CA",21,7,,4.0,2/12/2017,"I stopped by The Cheesecake Factory with the whole family for my husband's birthday. The entire dinner was a surprise, and I told the waitress that beforehand and she helped me hide everything till the right moment. She was really friendly, and the food came quickly, so the service was an A+ for me. I ordered a burger and my husband ordered the California Guacamole Salad - we both loved the food. I enjoyed my burger till the last bite, I just wish it would have had a bit more sauce. My husband thought the salad was delicious too, and since he was the birthday boy, I was happy that he was pleased with the food and with the wait staff who got together before we left to sing helps us sing her the birthday song. We will definitely be returning!"
