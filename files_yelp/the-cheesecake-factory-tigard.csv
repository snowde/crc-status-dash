Swepna M.,"Portland, OR",50,59,111,4.0,1/6/2018,"We stopped by on the way back from woodburn outlet mall. Cheesecake factory is one of our all time hangout places. Great ambience and serving. As usual, was served with warm fresh breads and butter. We love their complementary brown breads over white ones.  Ordered couple of dishes: Spicy crispy chicken sandwich - good, came with potato fries. Really liked their crispy chicken breast, yum yum.  Requested for mayo on the side as well.  Spicy chicken chipotle pasta - good, very delicious. Love it. Out favorite pasta here. Other than that, minor, We had to add pepper n salt.  Finally we ended with 30th anniversary cheese cake, as always simply mouth watering, cant stop eating it.  Overall, another enjoyable experience."
Pepper E.,"San Clemente, CA",0,19,1,5.0,1/5/2018,"Ordered (to go) a variety of meals for the family for a special night of celebration. Salmon, pasta, burger, steak, salad and 3 slices of cheesecake.  For such a big order, everything was ready, hot and correct when we picked up. The gentleman taking to go orders at the bakery was efficient and knowledgeable. He manage to send my order in to have it out for a later 6 pm pickup - called at 5 pm.  He even asked if we wanted bread/butter - Yes please!  Not only was this order ready, it was by far superior to another Cheesecake Factory location that we have stopped going to. I ordered carne asada medallions and they were cooked a perfect medium  and so tender! I usually never order steak because it's risky in the quality.  The cheesecake - what can I say more - yummy! Tuxedo, peanut butter ripple and salted caramel.  Job well done from start (phone call) to finish (leftovers!) Such a nice change to get quality and portions that we expect from Cheesecake Factory."
Andrea C.,"Portland, OR",185,156,1211,4.0,12/20/2017,"I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory a handful of times back home in Hawaii. My parents were in town visiting & we were at Washington Square doing some Christmas shopping. When we entered the parking lot of the mall, she saw Cheesecake Factory & said, ""Let's eat there, I got a $200 gift card!"" Of course we aren't going pass up on free lunch, so yes let's do it. The wait was about 15 minutes, not too bad at all considering at home it's about 30 minute - 45 minute way (sometimes an hour) but they did open a second location in Kapolei. Anyways, getting off topic... Our server was little all over the place & actually his behind bumped into my mom's shoulder a couple of times while he was talking to the table next to us (& he didn't apologize about it either). He would walk past our table, then it would kind of click in him that he forgot what we asked for.  Their fresh bread is super good, which my stomach definitely appreciated. Food: I've been dying to try their Thai Lettuce Wraps, Create Your Own Thai Lettuce Rolls! Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew. It was soooooo good. I definitely would get that again! My fiancé ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair, Large Shrimp Sautéed with Tomatoes, Lemon, Garlic, Herbs and Fresh Basil on Top of Angel Hair Pasta with a Touch of Marinara Sauce. I ordered The Club, Freshly Roasted Turkey Breast, Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato and Mayonnaise on White Toast. Served with French Fries or Green Salad. My mom ordered Grilled Chicken & Avocado Club, Grilled Chicken Breast with Avocado, Bacon, Tomato, Melted Swiss and Herb Mayonnaise. Served with French Fries or Green Salad. And my dad go the California Cheesesteak, Thinly Sliced Grilled Steak Covered with Sautéed Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers and Cheese on Our Toasted Sourdough Loaf. Served with French Fries or Green Salad. Everything was really good. That was the best club sandwich I've had in a long time & It's such an easy dish too. Their French fries were really good as well.  My mom & I did order cheesecakes to-go. I mean you can't go to Cheesecake Factory & not get a cheesecake!  Happy Eating!"
Mark A.,"Beaverton, OR",53,96,86,4.0,10/29/2017,"3.5 stars. Not great, not bad, nice interior, friendly staff, huge menu.  Came here to just grab a few beers and ended up getting some food towards the end. All-in-all, our waitress was really nice and responsive, checked-up on us the right amount and was prompt with getting us service. The place is nice on the inside and has a bit of an oceanic feel to it with the decor and lights.  I got a chipotle chicken sandwich, which was HUGE. It was only $13, but I swear it was an entire chicken breast, so I'm glad I got the salad on the side. The sandwich (it had a burger bun) was actually really good; the chicken was super juicy and the chipotle sauce gave some nice kick with the breading, and the vegetables (tomato, lettuce) were fresh. Other than the sheer size of it (which can be good or bad depending on how hungry you are), which made it a bit hard to eat, it was enjoyable.  The salad was a bit disappointing. I ordered blue cheese and when it arrived it looked soggy like it had dressing on it, but there was practically nothing on it. Seemed like they put a drop of salad dressing on it then mixed it up. Odd. I asked for some more and they gave me extra dressing so it wasn't a big deal but it was a bit confusing if they actually thought it had dressing on it.  The menu can be a bit daunting to parse through (Ramsey wouldn't approve); maybe they can consider breaking it up or using different menus for time of day."
Alekkz H.,"Seattle, WA",504,559,1042,4.0,7/20/2017,"Every time I come to the Cheesecake Factory, I am rarely disappointed as I always enjoy each experience! However today was kind of a disappointment.. I usually order a range of dishes depending on my mood. Today I ordered the Chicken Bellagio and I think last time I had it was back in L.A. so it's been a good 5 years. It was saucy, chicken was nice and crispy, and the pasta was delicious. With that nostalgia and craving pasta, I decided to order it once more! However, the pasta was too dry this time, chicken was kind of on the softer side (not crispy) and I probably should have had it taken back and ordered something else but I was so starving I just dived in and by then, it was too late to return it. On the bright side, some dishes I highly recommend are: fried calamari, firecracker salmon, pasta da vinci, bistro shrimp pasta, crispy chicken costoletta (one of my favs), hibachi steak, and ribeye steak.  Of course their list of cheesecakes is a whole different story! I will just say, hands down, I love their tiramisu cheesecake. Yum."
Tammy Y.,"Seattle, WA",206,1042,1428,4.0,8/30/2017,"Great service in the bar area! My friend and I came here with her mom after shopping at Washington Square on her mom's birthday. We had already had a bite to eat earlier, but the shopping really takes it out of you! That being said, we each ordered an appetizer to share and enjoyed the sunset through the windows. The bartenders that tended to us were both sweet and we didn't feel rushed at all. Sometimes when I eat at the bar I feel like the staff is trying to get as many people in and out of there as possible, forgetting that we are humans and not robots.  At this location we were treated with the utmost respect and relaxed until we were ready to head home. This is definitely the best food option at Washington Square - with over 10 pages in menu items, I mean really, how can one go wrong? My summertime favorite is the skinnylicious artichoke (halved, and served with aioli). This was not the first and surely won't be the last time we eat at this CF location."
Mabelle T.,"London, United Kingdom",0,79,77,5.0,11/15/2017,"Can never go wrong with a classic visit to the Cheesecake Factory! I ended up ordering a: A  1. Veggie Burger: made with Brown Rice, Farro, Mushrooms, Black Beans and Onion. Served on a Toasted Wheat Brioche Bun with Melted Fontina Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Pickles and Mayo This was one of the most aesthetic burgers that I could of eating, but due to the fact that I was so tired after running the Portland Marathon, for the first time I was just too tired to eat. I ended up just taking my photo and passing out in the booth haha"
Kevin N.,"Tualatin, OR",1,10,1,4.0,1/3/2018,"We come here regularly and it's always good. It's usually busy with no room in the lounge, so you almost always have to wait with the buzzer. In the lounge if you find a spot you're lucky, but that doesn't include the middle tables and back booth tables so it's most just the bar stools and a couple side tables. They don't take reservations. But it's worth the wait. The menu is huge, many pages long. The waiters have always been nice. The drinks and food are well done. The ambiance works, dimly lit and chandaliers, but a bit noisy because it's so busy. Their menu offers low calorie options, not sure about gluten free."
Stephanie C.,"Portland, OR",161,84,386,4.0,4/1/2017,"Love happy hour here. Portions are huge and made for sharing. The three of us ordered the salad rolls, chicken sliders, and nachos with chicken off the happy hour menu, and got the salad wraps off the dinner menu. Happy hour seating is first come first serve, so try to get there when it starts as it gets packed pretty quick. You can also order off the dinner menu in the bar area."
Sidney T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,11,30,5.0,10/29/2017,"Came here for a birthday lunch with my mom since our birthdays are a day apart. I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo with Chicken. My mom ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. The alfredo was delicious!! It was so creamy and buttery! I would definitely order it again. The service was great. The food came fast and he offered us some bread and butter as an appetizer. I also got a free ice-cream sundae as a birthday treat! It was also really good. We finished our lunch by ordering some cheesecake to go. Whenever I go to The Cheesecake Factory, I always order the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake and it never disappoints. I definitely recommend it. I always have a great experience here and I love their food!"
Hannah P.,"Beaverton, OR",4,19,94,4.0,12/29/2017,"This was my first time here and it was awesome! It was very busy, there was a wait when we got there, always a good sign! There was an incredible amount of choices on the menu. From appetizers, to food, specialities, drinks, and dessert. It was so hard to decide. I had the bacon bacon burger and it was pretty tasty, it's huge by the way! The appetizer we had was a grilled cheese sandwich with bacon strips and it was cut into four squares. The description of it, for some reason made us think it was going to be mozzarella sticks.. and it was not. (Our bad) but they were average, not something we'd order again, very plain. I had a alcohol blended drink, it was all peach and it was SO good! Now the drawbacks, the restaurant is very dark, and VERY loud. And by loud I mean the music was just blaring. Our waiter was very nice, but he came by our table at least 30 times asking how everything was interrupting our conversation and it got to be annoying. We were fine, enjoying our food, eating, drinking and having conversation. We felt like he was sort of trying to rush us out of there. Overall, great food, great choices and I would Recommend!"
Frankle Z.,"Bothell, WA",19,63,108,5.0,11/22/2017,"Great location and great restaurant as always. Have been to the Seattle location several times in the past few years and first time trying here in Oregon. Food and service is awesome! Love the cheese cake, steak Diane and pasta here!"
Mary K.,"West Linn, OR",31,78,277,4.0,8/15/2017,"The thick Cheesecake Factory's spiral-bound menu has more pages than War and Peace. Decisions, decisions! Copious selections of appetizers, entrees, drinks and desserts leave me dizzy!  These factory workers must love and never tire of their jobs. Nothing resembles a cookie-cutter assembly line here.  As far as restaurant chains go, this one takes the cake.  The cheesecake. The robust Chicken BBQ Ranch salad rolls off the conveyor belt loaded with romaine lettuce, avocado, grilled corn and chicken, black beans, cucumber; tossed with moderately spicy ranch dressing then topped with soft yet crunchy deep fried zucchini rings. It is worth its weight in cogs and gears.  The dessert shift ramps into high gear and must be on double-time.   Our entrees find us too full with no room for dessert. At the Cheesecake Factory; a dessert emporium no less, the notion of walking away with no dessert is pretty much an oxymoron.  Countless choices fill the display cases. As we mull over the cheesecake appendix to the menu, I envision thousands of cheesecakes stacking up on the the factory conveyor belt. We MUST stop the bedlam and choose a slice to go or cheesecake carnage will ensue.  So many choices!  We select a piece of cheesecake so thick and filled with gobs of milk chocolate, gooey caramel, crunchy peanut butter; topped with about five silos of rich, dense whipped cream, why a dedicated dessert conveyer belt alone must deliver this decadent dessert to our table. Sorry Willy Wonka.  This factory stole our hearts."
Jenny Y.,"Portland, OR",91,175,287,3.0,8/19/2017,"3.5 Stars. I have a love/hate relationship with The Cheesecake Factory. I love that they have a extensive menu option for everybody to love. They choose from burgers to pastas to steak to salads. You name it. They start you off with complimentary (unlimited refill) of bread (sourdough & pumpernickel). Service was pretty good too. Water refills were on point. Food was pretty delicious, if you pick the right dish (I had chicken bellagio- chicken was a dry for my taste). Presentation was on point though, however the dim lights makes it hard to Instagram. I dislike the long wait. A party of 7 had to wait 1 hour and 45 minutes before seated. Someone did keep coming to update us regarding the wait, however the way they said it sounds like they ONLY HAD ONE table that can accommodate our large party (they had to wait until that party to leave....)  The Cheesecake factory is a pretty big restaurant and you're telling me that you only have one table big enough for our party? dangggg, if it wasn't for a birthday gathering, I'd have left years go. Once we were seated and ordered, it took 48 minutes before our food to arrive.  Recommendations: Do not come hungry. Do not come with a party more than two. Bring a snack while you wait."
Andrew A.,"Portland, OR",4962,830,442,4.0,1/5/2017,"The menu reads like a novel.  While I appreciate the choices, I'm more partial to the ""here are five items, pick one"" system. Portions are huuuuuge.  Really, a ""normal"" person can finish a four taco platter the size of my torso and a milkshake the size of my head in one sitting? This is a place to experience with others, or be a fan of doggie bags.   Almost everything is better than average.  Today our party of 13 enjoyed a plethora of dishes.  Standouts: spaghetti and meatballs (simple, but effective), Avocado Toast, Huevos Rancheros (wish they offer refried rather than black beans), calamari, carrot cake, one of the cheesecakes (only 50 to choose so just guess), and fish tacos.   Average: cheese burger, fries, bread basket, Mac n Cheese, shrimp pasta and crab dip.  The Sangria was good, but very ice heavy.  Server did a great job, especially as we had seven kids in tow.  Food arrived fast.  It's a chain, it's in a mall, but the old formula still works. Given the portion sizes and taste, it's definitely value."
Teza Ria G.,"Beaverton, OR",0,3,1,5.0,12/26/2017,"I love this place !!! They have great staff, amazing food and atmosphere. I also love how the staff goes above and beyond. Not to mention, their Cheesecake and desserts are to die is for!!"
Karli D.,"Elk Grove, CA",91,340,768,4.0,3/26/2017,"I have always been a fan for the chain restaurant of the Cheesecake Factory (mostly for the dessert)!  Today I took my family out to brunch at a busy time on an early Sunday afternoon. The party of the four of us sat down within 5 minutes of walking into the restaurant and we were served quickly and efficiently.  Even though the restaurant was packed by the time we had finished our meal, the service was fast and the waiter was friendly and attentive.  Definitely would come back here!"
Cassie H.,"Portland, OR",348,94,201,3.0,3/25/2017,Came here on a Friday night for my brother-in-laws birthday.  Service was fine. Food was not so great. My ceaser salad had practically no dressing. My clam chowder did not even taste like clam chowder. My brother in laws cheesecake had a piece of plastic in it. Which they comped it once we brought it to their attention. It's loud and dark inside.  I'm not crazy about the place.
Summer C.,"Bentonville, AR",992,1005,3062,4.0,9/16/2017,"You gotta love Cheesecake Factory. Consistent in their menu, most items are good, but not great, but that is what happens when you have a ginormous menu. However, I do really like their food! The best part is the cheesecake though. No matter what Cheesecake Factory you go to there is always a wait, so make sure to plan ahead and at least you can kill time by walking around the mall! Great customer service here too."
Eyal G.,"Hillsboro, OR",17,24,1,1.0,12/6/2017,The pasta was filled with oil you could fill a glass of it. The hamburger was burned and had a bad oder. The cheese cake we orderd was frozen inside of it. Too expensive for bad bad food. Sorry!
Jenny R.,"Seattle, WA",5,263,93,3.0,10/15/2017,"Probably more of a miss day at the Cheescake factory. The wait staff made up for the over cooked dry black pepper shrimp (normally my favorite). They were packed when we came in at 8:55 with a 45 minute wait. We decided to sit in the bar instead, which was fine but certainly doesn't make it as amazing of an experience. I feel like Staff we're just really busy and not that happy friendly atmosphere I expect though when our food came out they were responsive and fixed it immediately. Will give it another try just not soon."
Donnie W.,"Portland, OR",41,10,,2.0,1/3/2018,"It was very busy and loud, but being dec 30 I guess that was expected. Long wait to order. We order 2 appitzers and brought out a wrong one. So my husband had to eat his along while I waited for mine. By the time I got mine he was all done  mai. Dish was ok. Only one basket of bread wS delivered.  Whencee went to pay we were charged for the appetizer we sent back.  Not happy"
Vijay S.,"Providence, RI",211,627,961,3.0,10/12/2017,"Decent food, this place is always packed. 30 min wait on a weekday. Their cheesecakes are obv good. Also like their lettuce wraps and Thai coconut chicken curry. Their avocado roll is decent as well as the pasta Napolitano. Their veggie pasta is horrible. Big plates but not so big portion sizes. Overall I'd say 3.5 stars. Service was good."
Kayla L.,"Vancouver, WA",198,191,238,3.0,5/13/2017,We came here at 4 on a Saturday hoping to beat the long wait time but there was still a 40 minute wait. We ordered the everything pizza with a salad to share as an appetizer. The pizza crust was soggy so we had to eat with a fork. The salad came with no dressing on it or on the side. For our main course we ordered the chicken taco salad rolls and the bacon bacon cheeseburger. The lettuce for the salad rolls were too small so you couldn't eat them like tacos and had to use a fork. The flavor was good though. The bacon bacon cheeseburger was delicious! The burger patty was large and there was two type of bacon on it.  I think our servers name was Leon. He was friendly and energetic.
Mohamad M.,"Beaverton, OR",0,6,2,1.0,10/17/2017,"Ordered vegetarian omelet the first bite I got burned potatoes the second bite I got a mouth  of bacon in my veggie omelet they reunited my brunch date with my wife by having an upset stomach all day long   Their cheesecake all have pork gelatin a warning to all the vegetarian, Jewish and Muslim friends out there Update: After speaking on the phone with their manager I do stand behind my bad review comment"
David G.,"Forest Grove, OR",15,3,,1.0,12/6/2017,"We came here to have a birthday dinner yesterday, it's our first time here after we had a good experience in the LA restaurant. Yesterday was awful, we ordered pasta and a hamburger, the pasta (Shrimp bistro) was soaked in oil... the shrimps were fried to death. The hamburger had a ridiculously thick layer of melted cheese and was cooked to death as well... we preferred to take the cake and eat it else where and found out they also didn't include the whipped cream with it. Our first and last visit here ..."
Yiran G.,"Tacoma, WA",0,2,,1.0,11/24/2017,"Good portion, bit pricy for the quality of food. Slow, indifferent and memory-impaired staff. Unbelievably, latte is served in a tall glass, very funny. Not bad for few hungry souls on Black Friday night, but would never come if any other places near by is open."
Carlos F.,"Amboise, France",5,17,38,5.0,6/26/2017,I live in France and I've been visiting The Cheese Cake Factory each time I am in US (hopefully on a regular basis). The food and recipes are excellent (even comparing to well known French cuisine).  That time we again enjoyed our meals and obviously the Cheesecakes as deserts. Find some photographs here attached ... Service was great thanks to Megan and this is usual here ... everything perfect once again.
Charmaine S.,"Portland, OR",3,60,19,4.0,3/1/2017,"Tried this for the first time today! To be honest, I only wanted to eat here because I have heard the name so many times on the Big Bang Theory tv show. But I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of the food! I got a pasta dish that was on the little specials list. Great price of $14 with yummy spaghetti noodles, mushrooms, meatballs, pepperoni, etc. It was delicious! Half of it filled me up. The menu is gigantic, I kind of want to go here to just try everything.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice, it's mood lighting (but not too dark) inside with beautiful decorations. We got sat after two minutes on a Wednesday at 6pm, but it was at the tables where you're sitting pretty close to other people. A little loud inside and definitely funny when the people next to you can hear everything you talk about!  Our server (if I can remember, I think his name was Charlie), was very nice! Checked in on us, refilled drinks, and happily asked if we wanted more bread. It was great! I didn't get to try the cheesecake or any cocktails, but definitely will next time!"
Ernie C.,"Tigard, OR",231,92,13,4.0,4/21/2017,"For a national chain restaurant, this place is pretty great. There are plenty of options. In fact, sometimes it's takes us a little bit to figure out what to eat. They cover just about any kind of dietary restrictions, and offer quite a bit of ethnic style foods as well. For the price, portions are generous. They also offer many seasonal items as well.  Everything I've eaten here so far has been good. And, of course, the cheesecakes are the big reason why people come here.  The big drawback for me is the wait time to be seated. Do not, I repeat, do not come here if you're in any kind of rush as wait times can be over an hour, or longer on weekends."
Tammy H.,"West Covina, CA",0,2,,2.0,11/17/2017,"Pretty bad customer service. From the front to the general manager who clearly doesn't care about customer satisfaction. Have been to wayyyy better Cheesecake Factory's across country and have to say, people are usually pretty nice but not here. Didn't want to help pack out to go boxes, was asked to ""go wait in the lobby until I was called"" And food was cold. Wouldn't come back."
Sevin H.,"Tigard, OR",52,8,110,5.0,11/13/2017,Oh the good old cheesecake factory  every time i go thereI feel like I'm in Vegas :-) Decour is beautiful and  food / service excellent. I love it they are so nice to me every time I go there. another one of my favorite place to go.
Bechinda L.,"Portland, OR",56,74,2,3.0,11/9/2017,"I love this place most everything is delicious.  I am commenting about the service at the bar.  Today was the last straw. I literally got up and got a table. The bartender was just plain rude!!!  I don't care how busy you are, you can at least be courteous.  Barking at me, slamming dishes, acting like you are  too damn busy to hand me a menu and water?  Really?   2 nights ago I was in for happy hour. The girls are really sweet, but they are so busy chatting with each other they ignore customers. I Had to ask for water, then a menu then silverware, then a bread plate and finally interrupted them to ask for a drink. Come on!!! This has been going n for a very time and I finally need to say something. I am a regular, and now I've gotten to the pint I don't want to come in. Btw I've never had an issue with a server, ever. Hence 3 stars"
Lisa H.,"Portland, OR",146,106,185,3.0,12/9/2016,"Solid place.  Good desserts, as the name suggests, and decent food. In chains, you know what to expect and get what you expect.  Here I appreciate the consistency of the food and good service.  I wish the location was larger and there were more seats because my complaints are that the wait is long to get a table and that it's too loud. It's so loud that the first time I brought a friend in, we walked in and out in under a minute. We couldn't tolerate the sheer volume. Perhaps, some soft sound dampening panels or curtains could be added? The only time it's not crazy loud is rare because the restaurant isn't full... which doesn't happen frequently. Maybe the corporate higher ups haven't been out to this location and experienced the decibel level of this location. Or maybe they like loud restaurants."
Jennifer Y.,"Mililani, HI",117,109,291,5.0,11/11/2016,"THE LOCATION Perfectly situated at the ginormous Washington Square Mall, this restaurant is located in the Northwest corner of one of the top grossing malls per square footage in the US. It makes for a excellent pit stop to refuel and recharge before tackling the remaining acreage of the stores.  THE PARKING Endless and ample free lot parking surrounding the entire shopping center.  THE ATMOSPHERE The last time my husband and I visited a Cheesecake Factory was many many years ago. It was the one in Waikiki where it's always crowded, dimly lit and so noisy that you can't even hear yourself think. This location in Tigard was a pleasant surprise. As soon as you enter the restaurant, there's enough space in there to ballroom dance. The charming decor, elegant lighting, soothing color tones, exaggerated high ceilings and well-spaced tables make for a comfortable yet grand feel.  THE FOOD Even though it's typical Cheesecake Factory fare, it's consistent and done really well.  ---Teriyaki Chicken $16.95--- Sure it's not the best teriyaki chicken, but it's a good healthy alternative though it contains way too much sodium for someone on a low sodium diet. As usual, the portion size is generous. However, my husband didn't have any trouble polishing off the chicken and mashed potatoes plus 1/4 of my salad. He left the accompanying sautéed plantains untouched. I ate the sautéed pineapple chunks which came with his dish.  ---Sheila's Chicken & Avocado Salad, dinner size $14.95--- I love salads and this one certainly satisfies without high calorie ingredients like bleu cheese and bacon. It contained a generous mix of romaine lettuce, mixed greens, cubed avocado, a sprinkling of cashew nuts and some sliced chicken breast. The honey peanut dressing was requested on the side which was flavorful but turned out to be slightly too sweet for my taste.   THE SERVICE  Extremely professional, courteous, attentive and prompt.  THE BOTTOMLINE We would definitely return to this location again."
Priscilla S.,"Portland, OR",98,257,357,2.0,12/3/2016,"Fast counter service if you're just picking up some cheesecake.  Service was attentive and friendly but kind of... cold?  They did what they needed to bit it was like being read a script, no real care behind it.  Oh well.  I ordered a couple slices of cheesecake and they were sloppily thrown into containers, bagged and given to me. My cheesecakes were smashed and cut so that I was actually missing a good chunk of the ends. At $8 a slice you better give me the whole slice and I don't want it smashed up against the containers so I have to wipe it off in order to eat it"
Alex B.,"Portland, OR",12,143,331,4.0,8/25/2016,"Pineapple Moscow Mule: very good! Very pineappley and has a decent strength of oomph STAY AWAY FROM THEIR CLAM CHOWDER! Plus they don't have crackers. Really?!  Sweet potatoe fries: very flavorful!  Classic Hamburger: non descript but that's not a bad thing. Classic hamburger is still quite amazing!  Chinese chicken salad: Classic taste for what the salad tastes like, like the burger, but again - a compliment.  Linda's Fudge Cake: meh. Very rich and dense. Fudge topping tasted like a box mix, but the cake itself was good."
Larry P.,"Sherwood, OR",1,22,11,1.0,11/1/2017,Ordered three meals and two were horrible.  Cold food mushy cat fish.  It was a long wait and the food was bad.  I never send back food but two of the three meals were gross.  Even the vegetables were not cooked correctly.  This was my first time here.  You know what they say about first impressions.  Obviously very disappointed.  I won't even be staying for the cheesecake.
Mei W.,"Clackamas, OR",101,60,1044,1.0,3/26/2016,"My daughter requested a cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory. So my husband called in an hour before to reserve a strawberry cheesecake. Most of us are lactose intolerant and therefore requested a 6 inch cake. Lucas confirmed over the phone they had it set aside for us.  I went in to pick up the cheesecake. I had to wait in line and when it was my turn, Lucas knew exactly who I was and told me the 6 inch strawberry cheesecake was no longer available. There were a few 6 inch plain and one strawberry in the front case. I asked if I can get one of those. He told me they are not for sale, although I saw someone pull some from the front case. I asked him what is the smallest cake he had and he told me a 10 inch one for double the price. Since it was my daughter's birthday and she specifically asked for it, I went ahead and bought it. Lucas told me they were ready made. I was very surprised to see him go in the back area and put strawberries on a plain cheesecake, then charge the higher price.  I had to wait over half an hour for Lucas to make the strawberry cheesecake. He did not apologize for the wait or say thank you. Will never go back nor recommend this place to anyone.  After reading a few other reviews, it is highly recommended to never pre-order a cheesecake here.  There are too many good restaurants and better bakeries that do a great job and get the orders right without the wait."

She hooked us up pretty well, was very welcoming and happily smiling and full of excitement. We came in for lunch, to celebrate my cousin's birthday. I was feeling a bit down/tired when we got in, but she lightened up the mood with her smiles and happy comments. When we placed our orders and the complimentary bread came in, I expressed my joy for the wheat bread of course, and she noticed it, and got us two more orders of he complimentary bread before came out. Now for the food, I had the southern grilled chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. The mashes avocado was so much goodness :), oh and the sweet potato fries, heaven; really well cooked and salted. I also got a strawberry smoothie which was really good and refreshing too. Come time for desserts, we mentioned it was my cousin's birthday and she was like oh nice, they do have complimentary sundaes for people celebrating their birthdays and that they would sing too. And so more servers from the restaurant came in and we all sang cheerfully for him. Such a great experience. We also got some order of cheesecake slices to, and she made sure to pick out the biggest slice for me :). Of course I got the Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake. It's usually my favorite. Great great experiences at this Cheesecake Factory in Hillsboro. I highly recommend. Ask for Krista too :)"
