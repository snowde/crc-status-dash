Pam L.,"Salem, OR",0,9,1,5.0,1/8/2016,"Best service and best vegetarian burger I have ever had. The flavor, consistancy, and toppings were delicious and the french fries were very warm and crispy. The fettacine alfredo was the best we have had. The passion fruit iced tea and the hibiscus lemonaide were both delicious. But the best part was our server. He was amazing. We have yet to try the cheesecake as we were too full. We did have a 15 minute wait but one sign of great food is a wait time."
Jeff P.,"Portland, OR",1,22,,2.0,6/10/2015,30 minutes since we ordered and no meal in sight. Have to ask for water refills. Not worth returning. Guess this place is for those with 2 hour lunches.
Justin R.,"Portland, OR",22,11,1,1.0,3/25/2015,"it was a busy night, but i thought i would give it a shot anyway. i ordered the carolina bbq pork sandwich. the menu said it came on a brioche bun, it came on a sesame seed bun that reminded me of mcdonalds. needless to say, it couldn't handle the bbq sauce and was soggy and soaked through the bottom. the bbq pork part was bland. overall the sandwich reminded me of something served in a school cafeteria. i ordered my cheesecake slice to go, figuring that at least they can't screw that up. i was wrong. instead of what i ordered, a caramel pecan turtle cheesecake, i get the white chocolate macadamia. the lone macadamia nut was stale and soft. maybe its my fault for always giving this place another chance. i should know by now to not believe the hype."
Tuan L.,"Portland, OR",6,13,75,5.0,4/16/2014,Consistently good.  Great service even though it's always crowded.  My go-to meal here is the garlic butter noodle accompanied by a virgin... long pause... okay...  pina colada.
Amy L.,"Ellensburg, WA",0,5,,3.0,7/6/2016,"Wait time seemed long considering many empty tables.  Server was not very attentive.  My water refill took 30 minutes to get.  Appetizers came after meal...too full to eat.  Music way too loud, could hardly talk to person across the table.  Food good, but service and atmosphere took away from that."
Lacey P.,"Portland, OR",12,50,7,2.0,10/14/2015,"What happened?!? I've been here many times, but hadn't been it about a year. It's gone downhill. I ordered the Bellagio. It was so salty, it didn't have flavor. The chicken it seem freshly breaded. More like came frozen, from the main distributer kitchen that preps for all CF restaurants. It's become an upscale aka overpriced Applebee's. Yeah, I said it."
Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,382,737,5.0,6/28/2014,"Came in about 3:15 PM to dine @ this location- it was still very busy during that time frame.  We were greeted promptly & received our beeper and were told we would have a 15 minute wait. We went to the restroom, came back out to sit in the waiting area and a hostess came over and directed us to an open table at the bar. Our wait time was then less than the 15 minute that was our estimated time! Anastasia was our server and she was a-tentative to our every need. Had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (didn't realize it was a ""bow tie""pasta ) and when it came; I asked to have it with the fettuccini pasta and they made that accommodation happen for me. When they brought it out, placed in on the table: the portion size was HUGE and a very generous amount of the Parmesan Crusted Chicken Breasts. In our party of 3- We also ordered the Catfish which was amazing and the Chicken Chipotle Pasta which had wonderful flavor and tasty. It's served a top a Penne Pasta. We ended our meal with the fabulous White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake that is just Devine! Pricey, but great meal and great service. Treat yourself to the Cheesecake Factory when you can afford it. It's a wonderful experience and the wide variety they offer a unique and colorful menu to choose from!"
Lisa S.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,1,,1.0,7/5/2016,"Called to make reservations and told me they stop taking reservations after 5 o'clock, so she told me I needed to call back within five minutes. I called back and the manager Ashton said they are not taking any reservations. I tried to explain to him that the Lady on the phone two minutes ago said we could..he told me no we stop seating reservation people at five that's not what the lady told me on the phone. Ashton the manager was very rude and William the store manager shouldn't have a manager that rude to customers working for the restaurant! I will never eat at this place again after being treated like that on the phone. Lack of customer service will make any business fail no matter how big or small."
Wendy G.,"Portland, OR",1,5,,2.0,3/18/2015,"CANNED PEARS in their Pear & Endive salad??? Absolutely pathetic and disappointing. The chicken in the salad was dry and tasteless, the candied pecans were few in number, and the dressing was bitter. Yet another menu selection to avoid at the Cheesecake Factory!"
Virlie B.,"Portland, OR",108,625,174,4.0,4/19/2014,"The shrimp scampi with steak Dianne combination doesn't come with pasta. So, there's 3 small steaks on your plate with 3 breaded fried shrimp Mash potatoes."
Kelly G.,"Portland, OR",55,69,53,4.0,9/7/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is always consistent. My favorite thing about the menu is the small bites because I like to order several things and have a taste of each. And of course, you must always have a piece of cheesecake to take with you when you leave. One thing you can always expect, it will be busy and it will be noisy so if you were looking for a place to go have a business meeting or quiet conversation, this is not your venue."
Eric S.,"Beaverton, OR",20,16,,4.0,3/13/2014,"I feel slightly ashamed giving The Cheesecake Factory a 4 rather than a 5. The only justification I can give to this is solely on an establishment comparative basis. I'm giving them a 4 our 5 because I have seen other Factory's of Cheese churn out some incredibly bites with exceptional service. Call me naive, but we all slightly have a basis to judge an establishment against itself. I believe anyone can go here and enjoy a delicious dinner with out busting your bank account. The food is really good. The service is pretty darn good as well (seems to a dip a bit when SUPER busy). The problem? I just hold them to a higher standard. I definitely suggest people to eat there. My additional one star to give may have gone to a different Cheesecake Factory though if, for whatever reason, they decided to build another one right next door.  But please, do go there. Try some of that cheesecake that will blow your allotted calorie intake for the day. I promise you that part of it is much worth it."
Nicole D.,"West Linn, OR",3,6,,3.0,10/9/2015,"I had the factory burger, it was a little bit dry and I wish the waitress would have asked me if I'd like any condiments other than the ketchup they brought with the burger. My wife had the catfish and absolutely loved it. The service was pretty good but there were times when we wondered where our waitress was for refills and questions about our meal or the menu. Overall it was a decent experience but we would've preferred a more private table where we didn't feel pressured into talking to the people next to us."
John F.,"Salem, OR",0,11,,2.0,2/16/2014,"My Wife and I had the herb crusted salmon salad, it was the worst salmon i have ever had.  It appeared to be some farm raised bland no flavor variety. Would not recommend that dish.  The service was very good, and quick even though it was very busy the day after Valentines.   Overall pretty disappointed for waiting an hour and 40 minutes for really bad salmon.  Ultimate margaritas were very good though! Seating arrangements led me to feel a little like a sardine.  We were in s hurry to make a 9:15 movie so the fast service was appreciated, although in hindsight it now appears we were being rushed, likely to increase turnover on tables.  Will not go back if spending my own money!"
Jonathan G.,"Vancouver, WA",0,7,2,1.0,2/14/2015,"First off the Food here is great. The servers are friendly and I love the atmosphere. But, the girls who they have working the front desk are idiots.. I can not put in words how stupid they are. First off I have been waiting to be seated for 2 and a half hours. I checked in about an hour and a half ago and they said they forgot to ""activate"" my pager. Ok kinda ticked now but not the end of the world because hey she said she would get me seated in 10 minutes. It has now been 2 hours and 30 minutes the line is literally to the front door so I guess it will take about another 20 to get to the main counter. What's interesting is that I see open seating... Beware great food sh*t hostess counter.  Bet on the plus side I am now being seated. 2 hours and 50 minutes later!"
Salah H.,"Portland, OR",15,2,,4.0,12/24/2015,Good cake and OK service
Kianna C.,"Portland, OR",67,27,6,1.0,2/6/2015,"So they are supposed to take reservations, but that goes out the door when there is a holiday?!?  That makes no sense at all.  I'm not very happy about this and they should put that on the site or yelp site at least."
Debbie H.,"Portland, OR",56,16,,1.0,11/18/2016,"I had lunch today.  I got there a little after 11 and since I was alone I sat in the bar.  I ordered fish and chips, which I have had there before.  When the entree arrived it was warm and the fish was half cooked.  I took a bite and there was a weird filler in the fish and it was mushy.  Also, there were four pieces an two of them looked like little nuggets and not actual fish.   I sent it back.  The waitress didn't seem too concerned  I ended up leaving and was never approached by a manager.  I am working two jobs for the holidays and this was one of my few days off and I was served half cooked fish.  The fish was comparable to frozen fish sticks from the grocery store that have that weird filler.  I have had so many bad experiences in the past few years from being served a salad with wilted lettuce to burnt nachos.  I have had it with this restaurant. Every time I go there I have to add one more thing to the list that I will never order again.  Your restaurant needs to get it together.  I wrote a complaint online so hopefully I will hear back.  Just over it."
Melove F.,"Portland, OR",18,39,183,3.0,2/24/2012,"Pros: 1. Best place to eat at WA Square 2. Consistent quality and service 3. Large menu  4. Comfortable seating 5. Provides kids with complimentary app's (diced fruit, bread, veggies, etc).  Great way to keep them occupied Cons: 1. Long, long, long wait 2. Crowded 3. You're eating in a mall"
Ja M.,"Lake Oswego, OR",1,4,,2.0,2/10/2015,"Started out great...only had to wait about ten minutes! Bummer was, our waiter was just that. Nothing more. Took our order, brought our food. That's about it. Didnt check on us. We had to track him down if we needed anything. Dissappointing."
