Jennyfer M.,"Hammond, United States",14,101,55,5.0,13/1/2011,"I keep coming back again and again to this restaurant. Their menu is outrageous. So, many choices to choose from. Plus you can't leave without ordering dessert. My all time favorite is the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cheesecake. Mouthwatering delicious. For drinks I recently tried the Tropical Martini very yummy, but pricey $10 for a glass. Pasta dish I recommend the Louisiana Chicken Pasta you'll love it I gaurantee. Appetizers the   is messy to eat but a lot of fun and so good. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and it's always busy all the time. That's when you know the food is good. The longest I ever waited for a table was 30 min which wasn't bad. They have an area where you can sit and wait or the mall is right there so you can shop while waiting."
Andrea C.,"Portland, United States",185,156,1211,4.0,20/12/2017,"I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory a handful of times back home in Hawaii. My parents were in town visiting & we were at Washington Square doing some Christmas shopping. When we entered the parking lot of the mall, she saw Cheesecake Factory & said, ""Let's eat there, I got a $200 gift card!"" Of course we aren't going pass up on free lunch, so yes let's do it. The wait was about 15 minutes, not too bad at all considering at home it's about 30 minute - 45 minute way (sometimes an hour) but they did open a second location in Kapolei. Anyways, getting off topic... Our server was little all over the place & actually his behind bumped into my mom's shoulder a couple of times while he was talking to the table next to us (& he didn't apologize about it either). He would walk past our table, then it would kind of click in him that he forgot what we asked for.  Their fresh bread is super good, which my stomach definitely appreciated. Food: I've been dying to try their  , Create Your Own Thai Lettuce Rolls! Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew. It was soooooo good. I definitely would get that again! My fiancé ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair, Large Shrimp Sautéed with Tomatoes, Lemon, Garlic, Herbs and Fresh Basil on Top of Angel Hair Pasta with a Touch of Marinara Sauce. I ordered The Club, Freshly Roasted Turkey Breast, Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato and Mayonnaise on White Toast. Served with French Fries or Green Salad. My mom ordered Grilled Chicken & Avocado Club, Grilled Chicken Breast with Avocado, Bacon, Tomato, Melted Swiss and Herb Mayonnaise. Served with French Fries or Green Salad. And my dad go the California Cheesesteak, Thinly Sliced Grilled Steak Covered with Sautéed Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers and Cheese on Our Toasted Sourdough Loaf. Served with French Fries or Green Salad. Everything was really good. That was the best club sandwich I've had in a long time & It's such an easy dish too. Their French fries were really good as well.  My mom & I did order cheesecakes to-go. I mean you can't go to Cheesecake Factory & not get a cheesecake!  Happy Eating!"
N B.,"Vancouver, United States",3,35,136,2.0,27/3/2017,"Went here soon to close, this is what we got  -- so good, order it, it's worth it.  Crab and artichoke dip-- it honestly tasted fishy, not crabby, didn't find any lumps of crab it was mostly artichoke, and I would never order this again.  Chicken taquitos -- again another miss. Verde didn't taste like verde, the Pico was old, you can tell right away when the tomatoes don't have any integrity, mushy, and also if you look at the skin of the tomato it ends up turning white. If you go, just get the  . And then you feel bad for saying the crab and artichoke dip and taquitos are not Good. Maybe it was just an off day.....  Great, happy service, but the food did fall short. Super short.... (Besides the  )  :("

The atmosphere is casual. And if you love cheese cake there's no better place. Today I had  , and my husband had the salmon on the lunch menu."
Anjelah S.,"Prescott, United States",1182,346,935,4.0,22/1/2010,"Ok, I may be lactose intolerant and I may be insane by going to a cheesecake factory, but I actually enjoy their salads and LOVE the  . I honestly think they put some kind of addicting agent into their peanut sauce, because I just can't seem to get enough of it. I could pour that stuff on anything to make it taste better. It must be the sugar. BTW.... Make sure you go online to read your menu first, otherwise it will take you a 1/2 hour to figure out what you want. Believe me, the Menu is HUGE."
Vinay P.,"Beaverton, United States",10,37,5,4.0,12/9/2008,"Yes, there is usually a wait, but I am not sure what the previous reviewer was talking about when he referred to a three-hour wait - unless maybe he was trying to make a statement by using a hyperbole.  I am also not sure what he meant when he talked about the restaurant serving 'instantly-forgetable' food.  Unless he is  a connoisseur of fine food and used to eating frequently at the one of these restaurants ( ),  I don't see how he could be blasé about the food at Cheesecake factory.  Anyway, this is not intended to be a a review of another review,  but I just couldn't resist. I have always enjoyed eating at the Cheesecake Factory. Always. The food is great and they do have a pretty exhaustive menu that offers reasonable variety. The service usually varies between  3 and 5 on a scale of 1 - 5.   This is what we (party of 4) ordered today: Appetizers ( , Firecracker Salmon rolls) - both these dishes were excellent.  The sauces that were served with the lettuce wraps were flavorful and I think one of them was had Indian spices.  Main course: Miso Salmon, Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Pasta Carnonara. Our collective feedback in short: The chef delivered as promised.   Dessert: I don't remember the kind of cheesecake, but it had 3 layers, we each got a slice and we ate in silence - it was a good kind of silence and the kind of silence that you go into when you're indulging in a guilty pleasure ( I'll be paying my dues for this indulgence by running 4 miles tomorrow morning) The expected wait time when we checked in today was 25 - 40 minutes. Our actual wait time was 20 minutes.  We're going back. Soon."
