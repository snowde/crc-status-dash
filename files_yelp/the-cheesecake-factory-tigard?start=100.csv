Kelly K.,"Portland, OR",47,101,123,5.0,3/31/2016,"Came here for a birthday dinner. It was all four of our first time here. Waited about 10 minutes for a table. We drooled over the Cheesecake display case while we waited. Menu is HUGE. There is something for everyone,  including my vegan husband. We order and about 30 minutes pass and I notice other tables getting their food before us. No biggie, we were all having fun in our conversations. Our server came over and apologized for the wait for our food, he accidentally forgot to put in my order correctly. Manager came by about 5 minutes later and once again apologized.  My husbands food comes out, as well as both my daughters. 5 minutes go by, still no food for me. Manager comes out with my food finally and she has the look of fear in her eyes. She apologies again profusely and tells me that my meal, along with my husbands app would be taken off my bill. I tell her that wasn't necessary but she insisted. She thanked me for not yelling at her like most people would. Why the 5 star rating?  Accidents happen. Food gets dropped, an order put in wrong, a ticket getting lost... My server kept my iced tea full, our water glasses were never empty, and they were honest about the mess up. My Steak Diane was absolutely worth the wait. Vanilla bean Cheesecake was outstanding! We all enjoyed our food and service."
MRose S.,"Henderson, NV",6,53,34,3.0,3/31/2015,"This would have been a 5 star if it weren't for the rude manager. The food was top notch  our waiter was a gem.  Went there with my family. My husband is disabled and in a wheelchair. She kept glaring at our table. I ask the waiter who she was and why is she staring. We felt very uncomfortable. He told us that we weren't the first people to complain. She walked behind my husband while he was adjusting his wheelchair and under her breath she said ""watch it"".   We left and while in the car I called the corporate office. I truly believe she did not take well to people with disabilities.  Our complaint was addressed and took seriously. She then wrote an apology note via snail mail. We are fans and frequent the Honolulu and San Francisco locations."
Jesse S.,"Washougal, WA",0,4,4,1.0,7/12/2016,"Omg, I have always had a very good experience at until today. To set the stage we were a party of 8, for of which were kids ages 6-10 all hungry. 1) we where informed that it would be 20 min to be seated, after 45 min we were finally seated.  2) we were informed that there was no bread in the restaurant after being seated. With 4 hungry kids this is now a melt down after a 45min wait. 3) the bathroom was disgusting dirty, paper towels on floor and water everywhere. 4) we ordered the kids drinks to come with the meal. All kids were finished with their meal prior to the drinks arriving.   5) I ordered an old fashion cocktail, it was horrid!Tasted like the alcohol used had dirty socks in it. Gross 6) manager comes over and apologize for lack of bread. . . .  .  And leaves, would have been nice if he would have asked a few more questions. I come to the Cheesecake Factory with friends and family for relaxing Meal with no drama. What a failure tonight."
Karen T.,"Mount Hood, OR",0,15,2,5.0,6/25/2017,"Girls date Thursday 6/22! Amazing food, great service! We shared the Tamale Corncake Appetizers, so yummy. The Cucumber Mojito was so refreshing. I had the Baja Fish Tacos and didn't even get to the sides, I was so pleasantly stuffed! My sister had the Asian Salad, she said it was delicious. My daughter had the Chicken Mango Salad and it too was beautifully prepared and scrumptious! We shared a new cheesecake with coffee and chocolate and I wish I could remember what it was called, but it was so good! I must get back soon!"
Christi D.,"Knoxville, TN",195,44,99,4.0,2/16/2016,Always satisfied! And very pleased that I exercised strong willpower to walk right past the raspberry white chocolate cheesecake I adore so much! I always try to plan my shopping trips just before lunchtime and got to malls that have a Cheesecake Factory.  Until next time!
Chris G.,"Portland, OR",71,104,75,5.0,3/20/2015,This place is not just cheesecake although that is awesome as well.  We have to drive a ways to get here since they don't have one in Portland but it is well worth the drive.  The inside is huge and has dim lighting which is perfect for a date or really any occasion.  The food is top notch and the nachos were probably the best I've had. The chicken was like actual breast and the cheese was real. My girlfriend always gets the orange chicken. I had a bite and it was great. The price can be spendy but that is to be expected with such great food. Overall I thoroughly recommend!
Amy G.,"Gresham, OR",3,61,73,4.0,5/17/2016,"Food was really good steak was nice cooked well and potatoes were good, calamari was good and was a good portion, cheesecake was really good too service was good as well table was a big cramped up only complaint"
Cindy W.,"Bend, OR",35,214,404,4.0,5/4/2016,I LOVE this place I had the bacon bacon cheese burger and it was cooked a perfect medium just like I ordered it... I asked for my burger to be lettuce wrapped and they happily obliged ... it had two types of bacon on it and I liked that... the service is always great here and the cheesecake is the bomb !! Do yourself a favor and take some for the ride home... you'll be glad you did
Julie S.,"Prineville, OR",26,35,79,5.0,8/29/2015,"My favorite sandwich was the Navajo, but is no longer on the menu.  So I was forced to order a Cuban instead.  Was not disappointed.  Haven't eaten a Cuban since we left Florida for Oregon. Perfect balance of pickle, mustard, cheese, and meats toasted to perfection.  Great service. Friendly and pstient staff. Lovely ambiance.  Overall great return to this family favorite."
Dale K.,"Peoria, IL",1,6,,5.0,11/14/2016,Haven't been here for years. Amazing the service and food is just the same. Atmosphere super!!
James H.,"Beaverton, OR",0,4,,1.0,9/2/2016,"I ordered 3 meals for curbside service for my daughter's birthday dinner.  She ordered a Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad.  It was supposed to include sliced cucumbers.  When I got home we discovered that they had omitted these. We called the restaurant and spoke to the manager. He offered to give us cucumbers if we picked them up (30 min. trip).  We asked if he could give us an allowance or rebate on our next order.  He replied that they would get it right next time.  There will be no next time.  The curbside service is prompt and good. The customer service is not.  This establishment is highly over rated and over priced.  I will not be going back and will share this with everyone I know.   Not So Fondly,  James M. Hesla, DMD  Beaverton, Oregon."

Aaron C.,"Newberg, OR",0,3,,5.0,11/16/2016,Where do I start. The Cheesecake Factory never disappoints even if you do have to wait it is well worth it. The Tex Mex egg rolls are amazing! Drinks are made well an there is an endless amount of options of food for everyone in the family. Will always be a favorite spot of mine!
Gisela P.,"Liberty Township, OH",0,27,2,4.0,11/16/2016,"The food is excellent, the atmosphere is fun but the wait is horrible!  Way too many people and the same time, maybe because it is located in the mall."
b r.,"Lake Stevens, WA",1,4,,1.0,5/6/2017,We have been waiting for 75 MINUTES!!! Large party sucks to be at this kind of place! Celebrating college graduation which is a Huge achievement for a family should have started but this place just sucks all our patience!! You can't book a reservation! You have seen people come by the door and left after meal and we're still waiting to be seated :/ Supervisors can't help you much!
Jemma M.,"Portland, OR",170,2,,1.0,4/19/2017,"I came here with my fiancé and my family on a Sunday afternoon. I started recently coming here more often, but this time was the last. We went in, was sat after a 20 min wait (which isn't horrible it usually is way longer) and was then greeted by our server. He came by and got our drink order, and then later delivered the drinks when he came to grab our food order. When he brought the drinks, he forgot half the drinks. Then after he grabbed our food order, he came over and brought bread and such. This is where EVERYTHING went downhill, and this is NOT the first time I've experienced this. After the food arrived, he forgot the cream and refills we asked for a while back. Then he came back by to tell my fiancé he forgot to put his order in, and that it would be out soon. While we are waiting for his food, the server neglects to tell us it will take a long time, and drops of some kind of soup to compensate for his late food I guess? We look at what kind of soup it is because the server never asked if he even wanted soup, nether the less what kind. It ends up being clam chowder, which my fiancé is allergic to shellfish. Wow. Okay so 15 minutes later the food shows up, with the tomato he asked to have not be on the sandwich. And after all this, NO MANAGER CAME BY AND THE FOOD WAS NOT COMPED. Never again."
Micah D.,"Lake Oswego, OR",4,30,23,5.0,7/26/2015,This place was freaking awesome!!!!! Edna our server was actually the best part of the night believe it or not. She was legitimately happy and wanting to make sure our night was perfect.  The wheat bread they bring out is unreal.  Come eat here and you will be a happy camper!  Ask for Edna!!!!!!!
Mikhail H.,"Beaverton, OR",1528,1081,1680,4.0,6/11/2013,"I am actually in shock that I have not written a review for you yet Factory of Cheesecake. You see we met years ago when you first opened. Everyone for some reason wanted you so badly they were waiting in line for HOURS. A friend decided to have her birthday at you and were willing to start the wait (even with reservations) for an hour. We arrived after they had been waiting, no joke, for an hour and a half and then we waited, again...no joke, another hour. We waited forever for ok food, crap service and an insane bill at the end.  I swore I would not go back...until I did...reluctantly. No line...really tasty food and a crazy long menu full of tasty looking suggestions. Ok, warming up... I went back with my husband once and had another wonderful meal. After everything though the other night I met Mike. After working 14 hours I was exhausted and hungry and wanted something non-takeout like. So I called and met Mike who was beyond helpful and friendly. You know how most places you call for takeout make you regret calling. I was in shock as to how easy it was. Then I went to pick it up and Mike brought it to my car with a smile. I got home and everything was packed up perfectly - they gave us tons of extra bread and butter, napkins etc which a lot of places don't do even when you beg them."
Chelsea S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",28,74,23,4.0,1/10/2016,"There's not too much to be said in a Cheesecake Factory review, to be honest. The decor, the overwhelming business and sound, the twenty+ page menu, it's all very...dependable.  I'd been to this location in the past and the food wasn't all that great - it was very clearly frozen. They seemed to have improved, though, as my visit tonight was very enjoyable!  My guy and I, on a date night using a gift card we received for Christmas, had the avocado eggrolls, a veggie burger with fries, and the falafel salad. All VERY good. I would highly recommend the cucumber lemonade!  Our waitress was friendly and efficient, keeping us moving through the dining experience quickly but not rudely. We were lucky enough to be seated in a dark corner for our date-night, which really added to the enjoyment. Social anxiety + those awkward tables that are too close together along a long booth DO NOT MIX.  I typically only make the trek to the only Cheesecake Factory in Oregon when it's on someone else's dime, so I'll definitely be back...next time I receive a gift card!"
Bryant W.,"Kalispell, MT",1,3,,1.0,7/12/2016,This was awful. Genuinely and honestly awful. the service was pretty good our waiter was friendly and prompt. The space was over crowded and loud. The food was simply bad. I got fish and chips a simple meal should be relatively edible everywhere. Not here. It was over cooked I'm pretty sure it wasn't seasoned. The tartar sauce was pretty much just mayonnaise. The fries were good but honestly if you can't make decent fries you shouldn't be allowed near kitchens. This was terrible experience. I will never and I mean never return can't believe we spent so much money on that swill.
