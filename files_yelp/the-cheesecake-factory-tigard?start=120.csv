Shannon H.,"Portland, OR",381,154,174,3.0,9/10/2015,"You should kinda know what to expect since this is a big ol' chain. It's ""pretty,"" it's overpriced, the food is fine but nothing I'd go out of my way for, and they have really delicious cheesecake.  My daughter likes this place so I find myself overpaying at this establishment from time to time. The staff can vary not just by day, but by who happens to be delivering something to your table. I've had really great service and I've had incredibly bad service. It is what it is and I go here knowing what to expect, the bar isn't set high.  What I learned in my last visit is that they tend to always try to seat you in the lounge area unless you state a preference. This is a bad idea for you as a diner. The lounge is busy, it's loud, the tables are tiny, you're so close to your neighbor you might as well just share food, and almost every time I've had a bad service experience it's been in the lounge. So heed my advice, just sit in the dining room where you don't feel like a sardine in the middle of the stock exchange (seriously, where do all these food runners come from?? Where do they store them in the back?). I'm bumping them from 2-stars to 3 only because the cheesecake is so good and they have so many kinds. So basically they're 2.5-stars."
Tony F.,"Beaverton, OR",0,19,,1.0,9/24/2016,Two hours in and still haven't seen food or drinks. Hour and half wait so we grabbed menus and had order ready when seated. Wait is expected for table but 40 minutes on food at ten pm is unacceptable.  Im sure food will be fine but this doesn't work.
Leah M.,"Gresham, OR",2,65,15,2.0,3/12/2017,"Only good thing was the server. Almost every entree came out wrong. Most of us sucked it up and ate them because we had just waited 40 minutes for food. However one was a major mess up so my son had to wait another 30 minutes for his food and it still came out gross. I had the Monte Cristo which for some reason came with no egg on it, first kid ordered chicken and waffles (adult menu) with no hollandaise. First came out with it second came out with the eggs soaking in water on top of the waffle. Second person ordered a cheeseburger it came out literally bun, cheese and a burger. Not one condiment. My mom ordered the chicken avocado sandwich , came out with no avocado. Extreme fail!! Have been to multiple locations but this one definitely needs new cooks. To top it off we got not only a full bill but they charged me for the kids drink that came with my daughters meal. Basically asked the waiter to at least comp one of the meals, my sons as he never ate it since it was wrong then nasty.  If there are that many problems on one ticket there is a serious issue here and we will definitely not be back."
Hunter P.,"Portland, OR",21,8,,5.0,11/25/2015,"Love the Cheesecake Factory! My favorite would have to be the Pasta Carbonara and the carrot cake cheesecake is the BEST. Also, shoutout to the best server, Danielle Perkins!!"
Leigha T.,"Albany, OR",11,29,12,2.0,9/11/2016,"Instead of going to the food court we opted in to try the cheesecake factory with our two little girls it took forever to get a table forever to get our food. When the food did come the corn dogs for 2 1/2 year-old were not cooked all the way through and had a gooey center, yuck! At this point everybody is starving and the food was less than good. Wished we would have gone to the food court."
Justin M.,"Salem, OR",0,3,,1.0,12/14/2016,"Not impressed. No wait getting in midweek. We took our kids in to have lunch, they forgot about us after seating us. Had to get up and ask for service, hadn't even gotten water yet. Our kids were hungry, and we put their orders in first. Rather than get the kitchen to put the children orders out first on a rush, the kids got served with everyone else. At least we could fend them off with bread. From seating to paying, our dining experience at lunch took 2 hours. The food here is not the best in the world, but it was convenient and we figured we could have a bite before hitting the road after our mall trip. Probably would have been better to go across the parking lot and eat at Red Robin or Noodle Company. Definitely not a two hour dining time for a lunch mall trip. Probably won't be going back."
Jacki B.,"Lebanon, OR",30,1,,1.0,3/24/2016,"This had to be one of the worst dinners I've had eating out in a sit down restaurant in a long time. I ordered the meatloaf entree. The mashed potatoes were barely warm, the green beans flavorless & the meatloaf was burnt on the bottom side! When I mentioned it to our waitress, she tried to offer me new pieces of meatloaf to go or for eating there. When I asked her if there was anything else they could do, then she finally says they can take the meal off the bill! Yes, take the meal off the bill. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it. My son had a regular hamburger & fries. The fries weren't hot & the burger was again, burnt. He didn't complain much thou. We don't live in Portland, so it's been a few years since we've eaten at that particular Cheesecake Factory. I seem to remember that it used to be good. We've also eaten @ the one in Seattle also & thought it was good. The service was OK, but I was a little disappointed that our waitress didn't even apologize. Wow. We will not be returning."
Daniel B.,"Queen Creek, AZ",57,62,5,5.0,5/20/2016,"If you read my reviews, you can see I'm a foodie with a distinguished palate.  I have a 90dB hearing loss which heightens my other senses.  But, I'll be the first one to say that a dining experience isn't just how the food/drinks taste and smell.  So tonight I have the pleasure of writing a recommendation for a restaurant that I've enjoyed many times, but mainly for the quality of service: I have a 17 year old daughter with IBS. If she eats gluten, dairy or a small list of ""FODA"" forbidden foods she will be sick for SIX WEEKS. Yes, imagine your child crying and in pain for six weeks for one bite of the wrong stuff -- this is our life.  My wife took our daughter out for a special mother-daughter shopping night at the mall, and they decided to try to eat at Cheesecake Factory,  My wife came home praising her experience!  Two managers, Daniel and Cathy (sp?), sat in the booth discussing the menu and my daughter's allergies, to insure she would get a safe meal.  The chef apparently did their best to use separate equipment etc.  The waitress was extremely understanding and communicative.  My wife could not be more impressed. We used to love this place just for their happy hour and the experience my wife and I would have on our own, now we're just amazed at how supportive and caring the restaurant staff is. P.S. my food and service has always been good here -- obviously you're not getting fine dining, but very good food and prices and selection. I personally love the hot dog happy hour option, served on mini wood cutting board."
PatrickJ T.,"Bakersfield, CA",193,2911,14296,3.0,6/13/2014,"Some notes from our two visits to this Cheesecake Factory located at the Washington Square Mall in Tigard, Oregon.  Both times, we ordered at the counter to get cheesecake slices to go. 1.  Very dark inside.  3 stars for atmosphere. 2.  Snickers cheesecake was disappointing.  Thought there would be some snickers candy mixed into the cheesecake, but there was not.  There were just some nuts on top and some pieces of snickers bar on top of the cheesecake.  2 stars 3.  Caramel pecan turtle was delicious 4.5 stars 4.  Dutch Apple Streusel Cheesecake is delicious 4.5 stars 5.  White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Cheesecake is yummy 5 stars 6.  Service at the counter was great the first night.  Not so great the second night.  3 stars for service. 7.  $7.50 for most slices including the four we tried.  Most of the cheesecakes were so good.  All of them are overpriced! This Cheesecake Factory restaurant was not one of the better locations we have experienced for this chain.  3 stars overall."
Zack S.,"Vancouver, WA",71,80,27,4.0,10/3/2015,"When I came here, I experienced some of the best service I'd ever had. The place was incredibly busy, but our drinks were refilled every single time they were emptied. The food came out incredibly quickly, and was delicious. This was amazing to me, especially with it being the most busy I have ever seen it. THE best place to go in Washington Square, and even though the wait may be a while, it's worth it. Highly recommend!  TL;DR: The best food you're going to find inside a mall."
Greg S.,"Beaverton, OR",0,1,,4.0,3/5/2017,"food was good and the service was great. A little bit loud, but it is a big place."
Kim T.,"Vancouver, WA",127,4,1,2.0,7/23/2016,"My party and I ordered cheesecakes and they tasted good. However, towards the end of the meal extra food was placed at our table. I was revolted. THE FOOD WAS CHEWED. How could someone be so careless. Giving food to paying customers. It is today's economy that is runining our youth. Anyone who thinks differently than is WRONG. Also it was chilly outside, decreasing my overall experience. THE FOOD WAS CHEWED."
Fai C.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,2.0,7/30/2016,"Food is fair. Nothing impressive, except that you might want to take a slice of cheesecake which they claim to be awesome. I visit there since I need to shop around, but definitely not because of their food or anything else."
Scott S.,"Keizer, OR",16,20,,2.0,6/22/2015,"We normally love Cheesecake factory. I am sure our recent experience was an anomaly, but worth writing about.  We called on Friday and asked about pre-ordering two cheesecakes for pickup late afternoon Saturday. They assured us this would not be a problem, took our name and number ans said they would be ready.  We showed up as planned the next day and went to the front counter and told them we were there to pick up our order. They scrambled around for about 15 minutes before finally telling us they were out of the key lime cheesecake size we ordered. How can a cheesecake factory be out of cheese cake, especially when it is ordered ahead. They offered to give us half a full sized cheese cake for the same price (it was supposedly more cake than the smaller one we ordered). Fortunately, it wasn't for a special event (it was for father's day, but my dad loved it in ANY form).  I was just disappointed the way they handled the situation (the staff were nice enough).  Not sure how to avoid this problem in the future.  For as much as it costs to go to Cheesecake Factory to eat, or even get cheesecake, you would think it would be more organized in how it is run."
Renee W.,"Vancouver, WA",3,26,6,1.0,7/3/2016,"Zero stars First     Host stand .... Go stand over there.     Next gal to seat ""party of three?""      Yes, that's me ..... ""I'm gonna seat this other lady"" (behind me in the queue) Second    Food ..... Hello, there's a long black hair in my food.    Many apologies but here we've re plated your food.       Um ..... I kind of expected new food.     Third       Bill....   We comped your dinner.     This just indicated what we had to enter to get the kitchen to remake your food.   ......   Um but you still charged for the plate with the hair? Totally reinforced why I hate chain restaurants with a gizmo. Items on the menu"
Jinmeng Z.,"Bend, OR",0,2,11,4.0,7/30/2016,"no need to wait if you get there before 12:40 workday. the miso salmon so great, but galic noodles kind oily. the cucumber lemonade such lovely in summer time! overall good place to go!"
Sandy G.,"Estacada, OR",28,22,,3.0,7/29/2016,This is the worst customer service I have ever seen. Very rude. Do not pay attention to the surroundings. They give you a buzzer and then lie to you about when you got it and oops forgot to put you in needing a seat. Then they let people just sit where they want and disregard anyone that may be waiting with a buzzer. Very Rude Customer Service at Front Desk so I am giving  zero for the first part of this. For the second part I give a five.. Tiffany and Deb in the bar were awesome. They were very nice and proof of what customer service should be...
Sara W.,"Spokane, WA",64,156,127,3.0,8/1/2014,"This is a standard American Restaurant. The portions are huge, so definitely share. Appetizers, salads, entrees, doesn't matter - all are enough for two people! I usually only come here for the Cheesecake. It's the best. So many yummy choices and all of them are delicious. My favorite's are the Red Velvet, S'mores, and Oreo. Expect a wait if you have more than two people, though."
Julie M.,"Gresham, OR",30,9,,1.0,4/11/2016,"My husband and I went in last night without our kids ""date night"" we ordered 2 apps and 2 dinners my husband's bacon burger and mine cheeses stake sadwich. My husband's burger was raw he ordered it well done. His dinner came out and I ate all mine. We waited and waited and no hamburger came out. So we asked for our check and left. We hold this restaurant to a high r standard, and we are shocked that he never received his dinner."
Brittany C.,"Portland, OR",34,59,17,4.0,5/10/2015,"It was my birthday and I was determined to have a wonderfully tasting cocktail and a delicious entree from my favorite restaurant. I got there at 7pm and the wait was an hour, after the hour they said another one would be needed. I was getting impatient and finally 2 hours passed. I was talked to by a manager and gave me my birthday dinner for free, with a slice of cheesecake! The waiter we had was on the ball and very happy and made me smile a lot! Overall I had want I wanted and I appreciate the effort of the staff! I can understand how big parties can be frustrating on a Saturday night!  :)"
