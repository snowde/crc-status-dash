Rachel G.,"Beaverton, OR",17,120,19,4.0,5/31/2017,"i was pretty hyped when my mom got me a gift card for this place and told me to go with my guy for my birthday. we went and had a great time and got a huge spread of food. he had been before but i had never. i thought this location was a bit odd, being in a mall, but i love that they are open so late. he and i usually can't get our act together for the ""what do you want for dinner"" game so them being open till 11pm/12am works nicely for us. walking in at 10pm, we have never had a wait. the menu was indeed a novel, he prepped me for that. i loved everything i ordered. my bae is a carnivore and i am a vegetarian, he kept trying to eat my vegetarian dishes. we got dessert to-go and ate it on the couch later that night. a few weeks later i made him take me back again so i could try new stuff on the menu. we again had a great time. my main gripe is that it is, in fact, too loud and dark in there."
Wade N.,"Portland, OR",40,265,79,4.0,6/2/2016,An old favorite. Food is usually very good. Best strawberry shortcake of any chain I'm aware of.
Jessica V.,"Portland, OR",2,58,53,1.0,3/20/2014,Came to celebrate my friends birthday ...arrived and was welcomed greatly ...for a group of 7 we received our table fast..... Once seated our server was not great...didn't seem to care for us or make any conversation. .The place is not even that busy.. When we told him it was my friends birthday he brought a dessert and said he was not going to embarrass us by singing and still had the decency to charge us for her dessert even though it's free on your birthday!!  Didn't wanna embarrass us ...whatever!...plus when speaking to the ladies in front..The lady was just as rude ...not happy..
Chris C.,"Scappoose, OR",0,34,16,1.0,12/21/2016,I was planning on eating here but found out that The Cheesecake Factory does not support our police officers. How a general manager kicks out police officers tying to eat is beyond me. Will never eat here again.
Ale D.,"Medford, OR",0,1,,1.0,7/9/2016,staying the weekend at the embassy suites for special olympics and couple of us ordered out. it was our first time trying this restaurant out and it was a horrible experience. when we got to the hotel we noticed they didnt give anyone plastic silverware or any condiments! the food was tastelessand the ranch tasted horrible too. it definitely was not worth all the money we spend. if we could give thumbs down this place is definitely it.  ps i think taco bell would have been a better choice.
IL B.,"Liberty Lake, WA",0,6,,2.0,5/30/2016,"Okay, for the cons: So busy! Waited for 45 minutes for a table...Service was slow. Utensils were dirty and had old food stuck on them. Fish was mushy. Steak over cooked. Potato soup tasted super funky. Was told a manager wanted to stop by (we never requested this and come to find out that wasn't actually the case) manager never came by. Waited 25mins for the check. Ended up being over a 2 hour event with 2 small kids... For the pros: Amazing Lemon drops and Wonderful cheesecake (that we ended up taking home)"
Jenny S.,"Portland, OR",62,70,9,1.0,1/19/2016,"Loved the place until I found out their Cheesecakes aren't vegetarian and neither is their mac and cheese. I've been at least 4 times and ordered the same thing, the macaroni and cheese burger sub a veggie patty. The server said that she could do that, but that the macaroni and cheese balls contain meat broth as well as the cheese sauce that they put on it, so I may not want to eat it if I was a vegetarian. I am a vegetarian and I was incredibly upset that I hadn't been told the previous 4 times I had ordered this same meal. If you add meat to something that is generally meat-free, it should be noted on the menu and your staff should make it known to people who are specifically ordering their meals to be vegetarian. My boyfriend and I ordered an appetizer while I looked for something else, but I wasn't really in the mood to eat there after that. I started looking at the desserts so we could get something to go. Our waitress noticed and informed me that the cheesecakes are made with animal based gelatin, which is completely unnecessary. Not only is there plant-based gelatin, but as a baker, I have made cheesecakes that didn't require gelatin and were the same rich consistency. TL;DR - Staff should make people aware of meat that is in dishes that are typically vegetarian, especially if the customer is altering the meal to replace meat with a veggie patty. I am incredibly upset that 4 servers didn't do so."
Colleen F.,"Albany, OR",5,48,5,4.0,9/22/2015,"We give it a four because of the dessert...Key Lime Cheesecake.  My husband gave the Jumbalya 3 stars, I'd say 3 stars for the fettuccine Alfredo.  The Alfredo sauce had a good flavor at first, but noted way too much sauce. As it congealed it became thick and inedible.  And I do love Alfredo sauce but I think they need to rework the recipe.  On the positive side we were seated within a few minutes.  Our server was very friendly and accommodating as were the hosts.  We'll go back because we like to eat there while shopping at Washington Square. (We're from Albany)"
Dana M.,"West Richland, WA",81,102,219,4.0,4/11/2015,Make time to review the menu because it is gigantic! A really fun place to have dinner. The portion sizes are large enough to share and there is something on the menu for everyone!
Travis H.,"Portland, OR",333,15,,4.0,7/18/2015,"Love this place. The menu is well rounded with an option for everyone! I love the interior decor, definitely not a Pacific Northwest feel however. As with all corporate restaurants you have the comfort of knowing what you're going to get when you order. Heard they have a great happy hour, looking forward to trying that soon!  Oh, and I'm the only one who's meal portions are so big and filling that I don't have room for cheesecake?"
Casey Y.,"Portland, OR",3,56,22,5.0,3/29/2015,"Ordered the Bacon Bacon Burger with a few changes to make it epic! Ditched the two cheese options that came with it and instead asked for bleu cheese crumbles! Without a doubt, the best Bacon Bleu cheese burger and sweet potato fries I've ever had! The topper to this epic meal was my raspberry lemonade. It was just the right amount of tart and sweet with sugar around the rim! First time eating here and it's clear that I'll be back!"
Kelsie V.,"Portland, OR",72,638,278,4.0,2/23/2014,"Is it okay to write a review and critique the patrons next to you rather than the establishment itself? Anyway, I popped in after some shopping anxiety.  I wanted a quick ale while I waited for some jeans to be sewn at Nordstrom.  This place was sooooooo packed, people lined up with their beepers on their lap--waiting for their table to buzz them. I got the last seat at the bar.  I was very impressed with the bartenders efficiency, while it was so busy.  I could have easily gotten ignored, bypassed, or overlooked with how busy they were.  I didn't eat here today, but their menu is enormous and I know they have a good rep.  I think I had happy hour once and it was solid. I think the couple next to me might have been on a first date.  This woman wore a wild, but kind of cool jumpsuit with vibrant flowers all around.  Very cool.  The dude was typical Portland, flannel shirt, puffy vest, and my biggest pet peeve a BASEBALL CAP....on a first date, in a semi-nice place.  Good Grief!!??  deal breaker.  Their conversation, I couldn't help but overhear some of it....was pretty boring, but the gal was getting her drink on!!"
Yvett R.,"Portland, OR",267,473,170,3.0,1/2/2015,"We had visited another Cheesecake Factory location a few years ago really just because of the hype. It had just opened in our former city and everyone was still in love. We left unimpressed and not in any sort of hurry to visit another location again.  Fast forward a few years and now my husband won a gift card from work. We'd had it for a while and found ourselves with some unexpected free time, no dinner plans, and near this place. So, pretty much the perfect storm for dining here.  Oddly enough the wait wasn't that long. We were quoted 15 minutes, but didn't wait that long. Our server was lovely and nice. I just can not get over those menus, you know. I'm a fan of a one page menu and these give me some sort of anxiety. I even dissect the organization of sections. The novel-like menu turns me off like you wouldn't even believe. I seriously lose my appetite.  The food was ""eh"". It was really good, it wasn't the worst. It just tasted like any other chain that doesn't really stand out. I couldn't even remember what I had until I really thought about it. I had some sort of burger, my daughter had some type of pasta and I can't remember what my son and husband had. The kids had to have one of the cheesecake slices after the meal. I only had a little taste but found it to be too sweet.  Cheesecake Factory never leaves me feeling like I can't wait to come back. With so many other dining options available, I suppose the only way I'd go back is with another gift card."
Takeyla M B.,"Gresham, OR",18,3,,3.0,10/24/2015,Beautiful design and wall paper .very clean and   not like the seating I think it should be up to the customer if they want beer seating or private seating. Having a date night sitting side by side like 4 couples I'd not a romantic type evening we expected.. Besides that customer service was amazing and very friendly and helpful and taste amazing.. Didn't like the strawberry shortcake with ice cream dessert was not out taste.but looked wonderful. Had to send that back. Cheesecake was very amazing and enjoyed it. I day for a couple spending 53$ for dinner and desert and drinks is an amazing way to spend an evening priced very well and big portions worth your money and wait
Kristina V.,"Tualatin, OR",61,17,1,5.0,8/24/2015,"Always a pleasure to come into this business. If you don't mind the chatter, the sound of rustling feet and dishes being places around you.  None of these bother me, and I'll tell you why.  Our food is ALWAYS delicious, hot, well prepared and given with a smile. Our waitress Justine, I believe, was by far the kindest. We watched her bust her rear to get everyone food, drinks and refills.  I don't mind the little wait we had because of such a pleasant informative waitress.  You will be seeing me here again."
Nathan B.,"Portland, OR",27,69,11,2.0,2/10/2016,"Last time I was here I was given the wrong cheesecake in a take out order... when I called to confirm that I could come back and get the right one I was told ""that shouldn't be a big deal"". After a 20 min drive back I was then told by a ""new guy"" at the takeout / dessert counter that they had been out of the cheesecake I wanted since the afternoon and thats why I was probably given the ""other"" cheesecake instead of the one that I wanted... REALLY FOLKS DON'T EVEN GIVE ME THE CHOICE JUST BILL ME AND SEND ME ON MY WAY WITH THE WRONG THING... come on..."
Kathy B.,"Portland, OR",0,13,,5.0,5/28/2016,"This place is awesome.  The people are great and the food, OMG, it is SO good!  Do yourself a favor and take the family for a really nice time out."
Seth K.,"Salem, OR",40,347,777,5.0,3/10/2012,I got a referred by a homeless man in Seattle. My wife and I have eaten at three different cheesecake factories in three different states. They food and serves was first-rate. They get really busy during dinner but worth the wait. The menu is very extensive and will make anyone happy. My favorite is the Steak Diane and my wife's is the Four Cheese Pasta with chicken. We try to make it out a few times a year. I haven't had the cheesecake but I heard it was wonderful!
Autumn B.,"Gladstone, OR",1,10,,4.0,5/8/2016,"Amazing food. 2 complaints: 1. Because it is a chain restaurant, it's extremely over priced. 2. The wait times are always crazy long."
Jared A.,"Sherwood, OR",70,103,23,3.0,1/10/2015,We haven't been here in a couple of years and truthfully it is just meh. I had the Louisiana chicken pasta and my daughter had the tomato basil pasta. It was flavorful enough.  The service was adequate. We were here on a Saturday at 5 so it was packed just like any other place.  It is way to noisy for my taste. The music was cranked and it just meant everyone needed to talk that much louder.   But for 2 dishes of pasta and two pieces of cheese cake with tip it was 55 bucks.  There are plenty of other places closer by that are worth a 55 dollar meal.  I am sure we will try it again in a few years and feel the same way.
