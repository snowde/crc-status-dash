Amy W.,"Sammamish, WA",0,22,,1.0,7/30/2015,"This location opened quite a few years ago and I've only been there three times. I'll tell you why...and I was reminded AGAIN, why tonight....THE WAIT. Are you kidding me? I waited 1 hour and 15 minutes for a table that they told me would take 40 minutes. I had two little kids with me and by the time we got a table we were cranky and starving. While waiting, I could see several tables open. So I ask, if you are ALWAYS crowded then get more staff to wait on tables rather than leaving tables open for us to stare at while we are waiting. To top it off, the food is not worth the price. I swear, I am NEVER going to this restaurant again (for real this time). PS: An apology (sorry for the wait!) would help...but you never hear that from any of the wait staff."
Xiomara V.,"Beaverton, OR",0,7,,3.0,5/19/2016,I came in today to order a cake... The selection looked great but I have to admit the service was awful. Myself and a group of about eight people waited in line with the cashier nowhere to be found for 10-15 mins that was very unprofessional.
Tripura M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,,3.0,2/14/2016,Walkin in at 10pm to be seated in less than 5 min We waited for 2.5 hrs when we went in at 7:30pm
Annie C.,"Chicago, IL",83,237,45,2.0,6/21/2015,"Nothing impressive at this location.. It was a super slow lunch hour and our waitress was super slow. Service was super slow. I saw so many customers who just looked completely annoyed because the waitress never showed up until about 5 minutes after they sat down, unacceptable, especially on a slow day.  My boyfriend had the french dip sandwich and his bread was super burnt and crispy, very hard to eat. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and my bread was drenched in grease. I didn't realize they were going to grill my sandwich bread in butter. I will say the actual chicken salad part was good, but the bread just brought it down.  I don't think I'll be going back."
Jamie C.,"Vancouver, WA",0,39,,4.0,4/6/2016,"To go service was outstanding recently! And the food was delicious. I go here about 3-4 times a year and it's usually pretty good, depending on what is ordered. I would always recommend this place as a staple.. Yummy stuff too much to choose from!"
Mark W.,"Portland, OR",2,15,,5.0,5/13/2016,"I do the whole deal when I come here, appetizer, main course and dessert.  Everything is always great.  I always have cheese cake for dessert and they are always good."
Jenny W.,"Beaverton, OR",29,4,,5.0,5/13/2016,"Love this place, great food, portions large enough for leftovers, amazing cheesecake, duh. Had a problem with our orders once and the staff took great care to immediately remedy the problem. Favorite place to go with our without the kids. Plan on waiting for a table, but you can walk the mask while you wait."
Sarah G.,"Beaverton, OR",33,30,,4.0,1/23/2015,"Great drink selection and appetizers. It's best to go for Happy Hour but we were 30 minutes too early so we got seated right away in the bar. My husband and I shared the french dip sandwich with fries and we also shared the lemon raspberry cheesecake.  Everything was amazing, but there are way too many choices! It takes forever to decide what you want!"
Erica R.,"Beaverton, OR",1,41,11,4.0,1/17/2015,"Stuffed mushrooms and Pear Martini are to DIE FOR! OMG! It was nice that yes, it was packed on a Tuesday night but we didn't wait long to get a table.. Althoe we then asked for the next avalibale booth and never herd anything.. Complimentry bread and butter.. Blue berry mojito and stuffed mushrooms... and the wait.. Lets just say I wasn't hungry by the time my dinner came.. I got the Salmon dish on a bed of cous cous w tomatoe, green peas and artichoke w/ pesto or cilantro sauce.. Very good!  I can wait for a table and wait for food but for that kind of a resturant.. Higher prices etc I did not appreciate sitting aside strangers in a crouded space. Next time I will ask and wait for a booth. Pros: There food is amazing! The drinks were very tasty! Cons: The wait for food and how packed it is.. Not so fun.. Mm I guess it was a bit dark and the people beside us were purty noisy.. Also our waitress could have done a better job..."
Jeremy H.,"McMinnville, OR",10,7,12,5.0,4/25/2014,Food was yummy.. Our waitress Stephanie was fantastic! Cheesecake...to die for!! I've never been here before but it was well worth the trip. Being a vegetarian can make it hard when you dine out but they were willing to accommodate our needs. Don't hesitate making a stop here!
Daniela M.,"Portland, OR",47,5,2,1.0,4/11/2016,"Worse than sharis food was burnt and everything took 45 min plus ... Food was bland and waiter was late on bring everything .., and forgot my soup .. And this was all on my birthday"
Kristy W.,"Eugene, OR",288,414,437,3.0,12/13/2014,"I used to be in hog heaven when it came to going to Portland and stopping here to get the cashew chicken, and some cheesecake! My guy tried to warn me that the food has really gone down hill, but I was dreaming of the cashew chicken!  We stopped in yesterday and he was right! The rice was drowning in sauce, and the flavor was just not as heavenly as it used to be. It wasn't bad, but it surely does not have me begging for more! I will most likely either come back just for drinks and cheesecake but that is about it because the food is about average for the price, and I am a foodie who would rather have a good meal while I am in Portland!"
Mark B.,"Portland, OR",0,41,,4.0,10/23/2016,"Always good food and service.  Not a 5 star restaurant, but always solid food.  The waiter we had last time, Ben, was incredible.  Knew the menu so well and was able to give us perfect suggestions.  Just made the whole experience at my last visit great.  Thanks Ben."
Lata P.,"Beaverton, OR",0,46,,2.0,1/3/2016,"I have eaten here only once since this is such a hyped place .Anyway, I don't like cheesecake so I didn't even try. We had a few appetizers ,soup and pasta dishes. Appetizers were good. Pasta was almost uncooked. To lighten the mood, I told my family it was healthier to eat al-dente pasta, but it didn't fly :). It was raw pasta.  The server and service was good. I took the pasta home, cooked it and flavored it so we didn't waste the food, but have never returned to buy uncooked expensive pasta."
Travis N.,"Ridgefield, WA",0,2,,2.0,7/5/2016,"Had a very underwhelming evening at the Cheesecake Factory tonight. Servers were nowhere to be found, complimentary bread was not brought to the table even after being asked, waters stayed empty the majority of the meal, and appetizers arrived after entrees. We were also given cocktail napkins instead of cloth. When asked the wait staff claimed they were out, but multiple empty tables had them at the ready. Our daughter received extremely hot food from the kids menu and ours was tepid. Waiting for the manager and the check took another 30 minutes without a drink refill. The free slice of cheesecake offered was a pittance at best. This will likely be our last visit to to this location"
Jess Y.,"Portland, OR",0,1,,1.0,11/7/2015,"Usually my family likes to come here for dinner, but this time we decided to order a whole cheesecake for my dad's birthday. It was our first time ordering a cake from here and it certainly will be the last.  I ordered a 10"" Tiramisu cheesecake with a chocolate plaque TWO DAYS before the pick up day. Went in at 8pm like I said I would and waited for 30 minute to find out they had no cheesecake ready for me, only the chocolate plaque. The lady at the front apologized but did not give me a reason why the cake wasn't ready when I asked. I was already late and short on time, so I ended up buying the 7"" cake since she told me they had one ready. I also told her I needed one ready-to-serve. Opened it up at the party to find it frozen. This is the first time I've been so upset with the service. Dining there is still okay, but I would not recommend ordering a whole cake."
Kayla M.,"Beaverton, OR",0,16,,5.0,4/6/2016,"I've been here twice now and the staff is always SO FRIENDLY no matter how busy it is. It's beautiful inside, there's so many food options (all huge portions at a reasonable price), and of course the cheesecake is amazing :) I love this place!"
Charlie C.,"Burbank, CA",3,432,,4.0,2/17/2016,"Went in for breakfast on Valentine's Day. The long line along the dessert case looked intimidating, but was moving fairly quickly. A very nice breakfast menu, quite extensive.  I went with Huevos Rancheros.  Most of the time, this type of meal is quite simple, eggs with tortillas and a Mexican sauce and most of the time they taste pretty much the same.  But the sauce on this meal was excellent. Not too spicy, but not bland.  My friend's loved their omelettes and fresh fruit. But the best part of our meal was our waitress, Angelita.  She was on top of our orders, was very polite, had great suggestions and was a very nice person.   Good meal, great company and great service.  Will return."
Teri E.,"Clackamas, OR",20,10,,1.0,12/12/2016,"We were directed to sit in the bar AT the bar for a busy lunch hour. The tables in the bar were also on the wait list for patrons. We obliged and the three of us sat at the bar. We ordered our drinks and bread as well as our entrees. One person with us was 17 but NO one told us she could not sit at the bar to eat as there were lots of kids already in the bar itself. The bartender asked her how old she was AFTER we had all ordered and of course she said she was 17. We were told she would have to stand behind us to eat as she could not ""sit"" at the bar itself. We were not directed to a free table which would have been appropriate since we had already ordered everything. We were told to go back to the front desk after we had already ordered. We saw an empty table on our way out and thought we could perhaps sit there since we had already ordered. ""NO"" was the answer due to the table being a wait list table. This was the WORST customer service we have EVER experienced! Unbelievable that we had ordered everything and were not given a table that was on the WAIT list since we HAD ordered already. ALSO, someone should have said prior to ordering that someone who was 17 would have to stand up at the bar rather than sitting down to eat. GOOD GRIEF. I would NEVER go here again, EVER! I love cheesecake too! Too bad for VERY POOR customer service!!"
Novy D.,"Puyallup, WA",688,523,1501,2.0,2/12/2013,"Who would've guessed that this place, a chain, holds a beer place in my heart. While the food was less than memorable, the bartenders kept giving me tastings of sweet, sweet beer. Mmmm. And that's when I first laid lips on Oregon honey beer. Excellent service at the bar. Plenty of food left over, but I sure wished they could send me off with growlers of their Hood River Ales, Deschutes and others..."
