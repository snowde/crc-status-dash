Elizabeth L.,"Clackamas, OR",38,71,194,4.0,12/7/2013,"We tried The Cheesecake Factor for the first time this evening.  We arrived at dinner rush so I expected there to be a wait but not a 90 minute wait. Oh well not a huge deal as it is attached to the mall so we walked around while we waited for time to pass. When we were seated they brought our two year old a complimentary plate with bananas and bread on it. I wish more placed did this! Our waiter then came took our drink order, he returned right away with water and a coke but forgot my strawberry lemon-aid and then disappeared for 10 minutes still not bringing it when he came back.  He did eventually bring it but it took much longer than it ever should have even with them being busy.  We ordered tomato-basil pizza, shrimp scampi (served with angle hair pasta), and a side of french fries to share.  The portion of the fries was huge! Three to four people could definitely split this and not feel like they got cheated out of fries.  The kitchen messed up the pizza and they brought out a tomato-basil flat breas by mistake and just comped us that. This was good, the bread was thin and crisp the edges were not burnt nor were any of the toppings. It was light but better as a shared appetizer than a meal. The shrimp scampi was not 100% what I was expecting but it was good. The shrimp was large and was breaded and sautéed, no sauce on it. The pasta had a light garlic cream sauce which was very tasty but more sauce was definitely needed. Finally the pizza was brought out. I had them take it back and boxes up to take home so I cannot comment on it. Lastly we decided to order a dessert. We chose the Linda (?) cake it was very chocolaty and very rich between the two of us we did not finish half of it, but it was so good. So aside from the horribly slow un-attentive waiter we had it was a good first experience."
H M.,"Portland, OR",0,212,,2.0,8/9/2016,"Service was nice but really scattered, food was good and drinks really good. I think you could get better for the price nearby though"
Leslie L.,"Portland, OR",0,4,,5.0,9/12/2016,My son and daughter took me to lunch it was very elegant and good food service excellent .waiter was very attentive
Marklin M.,"Los Angeles, CA",102,467,391,5.0,9/7/2015,"This place is awesome. I have been to many cheesecake factories but let me tell you this one is big it's spacious it's brand-new it's beautiful inside everything is tiptop clean the bar is awesome the service is fast and friendly the food is amazing. You are not going to walk away from this place disappointed, I promise. Aside from the fact that every time I eat here I think that I'm looking around to find Penny, I will tell you that whenever am in Tuallitan I make it a point to go out of my way to come here for dinner. I will warn you though that is very busy and you can expect a 30 to 45 minute wait to be seated."
Michelle W.,"Portland, OR",0,9,,5.0,8/22/2016,Eat here all the time. Drinks are great and never had a meal here I didn't like. Try the avocado egg rolls and the luau salad. I'd like to mention that on our last visit we had Leo as our waiter and he was fabulous! Five star service! Best dessert is the Lemoncello Torte Cake and the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake.
Kyle R.,"Salem, OR",33,1020,240,4.0,8/24/2015,"despite the 45 minute wait to be seated, food was same ol' good Cheesecake Factory food.  got their quesadilla app (VERY good).  then a California salad (VERY bad), which tasted like pesticide and didn't have enough dressing, so had to ask for more (still wasted most of it).  main food, hubby got their meatloaf...HUGE platter of food and he liked it very much.  i got their veggie burger for the first time, and it was 7/10.  kinda weird flavor, but i ate most of it.  and finally, we FINALLY ordered a cheesecake.  it was SOOOO rich but good.  this location we've walked by before, and it always seemed packed.  but if you only have to wait less than an hour, it's worth it...especially since you can roam the mall until your pager beeps."
Kassy C.,"Portland, OR",123,14,35,3.0,3/9/2016,"Service is good food is good and drinks are good. Pretty average food. I'll definitely come back because it's convenient and tastes good but it's not a ""wow let's go for a fancy big date night"" kind of place."
Bussifur M.,"Redding, CA",1,17,2,1.0,5/21/2014,"Jennifer the server dropped my food in front of me while going to box it to go. She promised to have another re made. She came back within 3-4minutes. I said "" wow, that was fast"" and she said she took someone elses order out of the window... now when my food came out originally it was so hot. I noticed this food was very cool to the touch. I lifted a piece of zucchini and there it was.. my half mushroom from earlier. She had indeed boxed up my food from the floor and waited a few minutes and gave it to me. I confronted her and asked that it be taken off my bill. I told her why. She wasn't even slightly embarrassed. ??? Gross. Then she had the nerve to ask if I was sure the kitchen couldn't remame me another. Three times a charm? No Way! I will NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN. YUCK! See photos for my receipt. I had to take a picture because there was not a duplicate given. Shady and Nasty."
Mandy A.,"Portland, OR",0,12,1,3.0,2/21/2016,"Biggest menu ever. I opted to stay on the first few pages and ordered appetizers, due to being overwhelmed. I ordered Frien Mack & Cheese $9.95. Chicken Samosa with Celantro dipping sauce $5.95. 1rum & coke $7.95. + tip. That's over $25 for 1 person."
Rita W.,"Lynnwood, WA",148,156,1737,3.0,6/19/2013,the service at this cheesecake factory location was outstanding.  our server was pleasant and funny and happy and checked in on us 3 times during our stay for lunch. at other cheesecake factories i have been ignored with slow service and servers who were definitely not happy to be at work. one nice thing about chain restaurants is that one can expect consistency in the dishes. i was not  disappointed at this location. my favorite Old Fashioned Burger was delicious as usual with the signature charbroiled flavor and the green salad with house dressing was exactly the same as in seattle and lynnwood and spokane.  other favorites at cheesecake factories are the lettuce wraps and the huevos rancheros.
Rae T.,"Portland, OR",6,5,,5.0,1/19/2016,Been meaning to do this review for about a week now. My meal was amazing! First time ever eating here and went for happy hour. Portions were a lot bigger than I expected and everything tasted delicious. There was a mix up when we ordered our desserts to go but the staff went above and beyond my expectations to make it right. Will definitely be coming back again.
Shelley M.,"Sherwood, OR",18,9,,3.0,2/12/2016,"Horrible lighting.  It was 5 PM and dinner time.   We could not read the menu because of the lighting.  I was told I should use the flashlight on my phone.  Really?  I don't like eating in the dark and it really bothered me to be told to ""use a flashlight"".  I told them I wasn't doing that and they brought over one of the electric candles that have little or no affect.   The food was good and so were the servers.  The manager did come over and I expressed my thoughts about the lighting.  They did not offer to move us although the entire place was dark.  The lights were on but at the lowest dim. Would I eat there again?  Yes if they had the lights turned up.  Otherwise I'd turn around and find a place that really cared about my concerns."
Sarah C.,"Eugene, OR",84,49,304,4.0,11/21/2014,Kale salad and the dressing it came with tasted amazing!
Meredith K.,"Portland, OR",14,15,1,2.0,1/2/2015,"We went here because we had a gift card from Christmas (we got a PetSmart card too, despite being anti-PetSmart, so go figure). It was a long day at work so we figured we would use the card and have a nice 15,000 calorie dinner (this is not an exaggeration). We get there around 5:40 on a Friday and it's packed. The place is fairly large and has twice as many tables than would be comfortable and there's still a huge line. We get the pager and learn it's an hour wait. Cue wandering around the mall... We ordered the buffalo blasts as an appetizer. I have no idea what we expected. It's basically a chicken and cheese pot sticker that you dip in buffalo sauce. On my first bite I immediately noted that the aftertaste is similar to the taste you get when you throw up in your mouth. I wish I was kidding.  I got the spicy cashew chicken as an entree which was entirely underwhelming. It was much more sweet and didn't even hint at being spicy. I'm a big spice fan so I expect a lack of heat, but come on. At least make an attempt! The rice was plain brown rice, not even jasmine. Womp womp. My boyfriend got the fish tacos which mostly like tasted like the lime he out on them. I had a piece of fish (tilapia, I believe) and could only taste the lime-- pretty strange concept. Of course, tilapia is always a mild taste but a disappointing choice for tacos.  We figured things couldn't get worse so we decided to shoot for the 1,000,000 calorie mark with the Reese's cheesecake. Definitely the best part of the meal, but that bar wasn't too high.  We had the leftovers boxed up and realized once we got to the car that we forgot them. That was the silver lining of the whole experience. +1 star for the server being quick, +1/2 for the cheesecake, +1/2 for the guy who could set tables in roughly .4 seconds"
Chelsea Z.,"Ridgefield, WA",0,6,1,1.0,5/9/2015,"The waitress was good, her name is Kerri. The other food was good that my family got but my friend and I ordered pasta. Our pasta was cold-which was weird cause the plates were hot and the food came out quick- and the chicken was dry. The waitress was nice enough to get us new ones with even less than what we got before. The chicken was not worth the extra $3 we paid for. We all ordered cheesecake too. They were delicious (as always) except they said they were out of meringue for the topping on the lemon meringue, but didn't want to replace it.  This was a mother's outing for us, but my mother had the worst experience. She went to go to the bathroom and the stalls were all out of toilet seat covers. Because they were out of toilet seat covers you could see into the other stall! My mother came back surprised that there would not be solid panels in between each bathroom stall. When the waitress came back around she had the manager called over and when she explained the situation he just looked and said I'm sorry and walked away like it was no problem. We all had to go to the restroom while we waited for the check so four of us girls went so we could go in pairs so that we did not have anyone peeking through the hole in the panel at us. We went and all saw the hole for ourselves. There were still no toilet seat covers in either stall (this was 20 minutes after we had complained to the manager). So we once again informed the manager and a female employee that there was no toilet seat covers and that there was a hole in the wall. We insisted that the manager fix Tue problem and we would wait for him to finish before we went to the bathroom. He rolled his eyes and sighed at us, before going to fix the problem. This is a problem that needs to be fixed immediately with patching up the panel somehow. The manager was rude and didn't seem to care about any of our problems. The waitresses cheerful attitude was the only thing that went good during this experience."
Singaravelan V.,"Beaverton, OR",35,176,96,4.0,11/12/2014,"Always had pretty good service here even though the wait time could be a little longer in the weekends. Service is pretty fast and attentive. They get the warm bread to your table in a few minutes and i am a fan of their brown bread. The menu is huge and you have to spend quite sometime to figure out what you are going to have. I have tried a couple of dishes over the past few visits and liked most of them.  Some dishes i liked here: Chicken Samosas, Chicken lettuce wrap tacos, Texmex egg rolls, Pizzas are all great. Chicken sandwiches were good and also the breakfast omlettes are very nice.  Overall a very good place with good service and ambience thats not too expensive and has wide menu options. Not to forget the cheesecake here."
Laura D.,"Portland, OR",0,43,,1.0,5/5/2015,"Their food has gone downhill significantly over the last few years.  It used to be that when you went you'd get lush, soft warm bread to start the meal, followed by huge portions of decadent well seasoned food.  Now, you get hard lumps of partially burnt bread, followed by bland, dry, overcooked and under-seasoned food.  I emailed to follow up with the company after our most recent meal, and was informed that they did not have new staff nor had they changed the recipe for their whole wheat bread (which is the type we ate).  There was no excuse for why two out of three loaves of bread we received were burnt.  Nor for why all three of the loaves were super hard crusted with barely any softness to the inside (despite being freshly out of the oven). Nor for the dry, overcooked and under seasoned steak and shrimp.  Nor for the absurdly stale ""children's plate"" they brought when we arrived (with brown sliced bananas and hard little stubs of bread that looked like turds).   They offered to send us a gift card to try the place again (I suppose under the presumption that the staff simply had an off day), but it was for such a small amount it would be impossible for my family to try again without spending some of our own money.  And quite frankly, there are so many wonderful restaurants out there that I wouldn't risk spending money on another terrible meal here, even if half of it was paid for by somebody else... If you need to go someplace around the mall, try Red Lobster instead (just as expensive, but the food is well seasoned and not grossly overcooked).  If you're just looking for good food in general and location isn't as important, check out all the other wonderful places Yelp has to offer."
Valerie W.,"Seattle, WA",750,1056,350,3.0,7/9/2012,"Cheesecake Factory is always such a love/hate relationship. Their food is good don't get me wrong but there always seem to be consistant issues.  Forgotton orders, food poisoning of a co-worker, cold food, etc.  What brought me back? They have a skinnylicious menu now thank goodness. Their nutrition menu would always make my jaw drop....literally. If you eat here often, don't look.  The mexican salad on the skinny menu is quite good but I would ask for salsa or extra dressing. As a person whom doesn't go for the cheesecake they have a plethora of other options both food and dessert."
Alison M.,"Newberg, OR",183,655,641,3.0,2/21/2013,"I came here with my family last night for dinner, there were 9 of us. It has been at least 2 years since I have been here. We ordered a few apps for the table. I had strawberry lemonade-great & the mac and cheese burger-fine. I also ordered a slice of cheesecake to go. My family overall seemed to enjoy their food. They were out of several desserts. The service was as expected. This was a really difficult restaurant for a group. It was crowded, loud and the restaurant was dark. Some of my family were using cell phones to light up the menus. This was a problem.  With the crowds and wait times, I don't get the hype. Everything was just ok, ambiance below average."
Yuliya M.,"Portland, OR",20,32,43,5.0,10/25/2015,"I really love coming here with my family . It's always good food and a nice menu with variety.  I always like to try something new where as my husband likes to stick to his basic traditional food, which they have and is prepared well . It's a nice family friendly restaurant . There is usually about a 15-20 min wait every time we come but we just walk the mall and before you know it our food is ready"
