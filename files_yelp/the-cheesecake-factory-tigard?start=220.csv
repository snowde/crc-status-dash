Jerry M.,"Portland, OR",8,494,1318,5.0,5/14/2015,"I know the Cheesecake Factory is usually really busy at dinner time which can mean a long wait.  So, we went early (just a few minutes after 5 o'clock) and were seated immediately, getting dinner off to a good start.  Service was friendly and efficient.  We asked if they had a ""happy hour"" and our server explained that was available only at the bar, and she was willing to relocate us there if we wanted.  We decided to just stay in the dining area and order from the regular menu.  Well, their menu is huge with lots of things to choose from.  She brought us a couple of tasty baguettes to munch on while we were deciding.  One was a sweet dark bread, and the other was a crusty sourdough.  Good stuff.  I ordered Chicken Madeira for my entree.  It consisted of two chicken breasts pounded flat and coated with egg, then sauteed. This was covered with melted mozzarella cheese and Madeira sauce with mushrooms.  It also included asparagus spears and skin-on mashed potatoes.  It was totally excellent, and the portions were good sized.  My friend ordered Garlic Noodles.  It had asparagus, mushrooms, tomatoes, and grated Parmesan in the garlic sauce with the noodles.  The noodles were cooked just right, with the proper firmness.  She really liked it. . .and finished off every bit of it.  Even though we were at the Cheesecake Factory, I'm not too fond of cheesecake, but I do love chocolate.  So, for dessert, I had a slice of Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake.  It has alternating layers of chocolate fudge cake and chocolate mousse.  I liked that it was moist and ""pliable"", not dense and hard like some chocolate desserts tend to be.  There were three big blobs of whipped cream to dip each bite into as well.  It was BIG too. . .not some little bitty slice like at some other places.  OK, I think the Cheesecake Factory has all the good qualities I look for:  good food, generous portions, fair prices, friendly and efficient service, and it's a nice looking place too.  It's really obvious to me why it's such a popular and busy place."
Amancia K.,"Portland, OR",40,38,24,4.0,8/28/2015,"Typical CF. this location is large and loud, fitting for the mall location. Staff is friendly, service is good. Something for everyone, on the menu."
Meagan S.,"Gresham, OR",261,116,200,5.0,3/18/2014,The Cheesecake Factory is always good. Their lunch specials are reasonable and are usually a large portion. I've been to this location 5 or 6 times and it's been good every time and the waitstaff is always great.  I do think $8 for a glass of house white wine at lunch time is ridiculous.
Evelyn S.,"Portland, OR",202,491,70,4.0,1/6/2012,"What can you say about a successful chain of restaurants that serve pretty darn good food and an amazing selection of desserts with a heavy emphasis on the cheesecake variety in an atmosphere that always seems to be up to date with above average service?    On the rare times that I go I say, Yay! I'm a fan! Things we like to eat at CCF: Evelyn's Favorite Pasta BBQ Chicken Salad Chinese Chicken Salad Romano Crusted Chicken (my personal fave) Corn Fritters (tried for the first time tonight and decided I could definitely eat them again, and again, and again...) Avocado egg rolls Mashed Potatoes Cheesecake of choice: Adams Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple or Godiva Choc."
Pamela Y.,"Canyonville, OR",7,112,65,4.0,6/30/2014,"This place is great for a ""get together"".  Love the shopping in the mall... And the place is always clean.  Food is fresh,  have never received a bad meal.  Good drink selection.  If you can't fit in the cheesecake get it to go!"
Jo R.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,149,,4.0,3/30/2015,"Surprisingly nice dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. I say ""surprisingly"" nice because normally, it's... well, marginal at best. I say normally but that really means that this was my 6th trip ever- I manage to get invited to an outing there about once a year. Good service, remarkably quiet, tasty if unimaginative food (I had a club sandwich and fries, both of which were done well, seasoned and prepared to my specifications). We ordered a series of decadent and delicious cheesecakes to share, all chocolatey and all were consumed to the very last crumb. All of that said, it's a place that's fun to go for a group event when you want a wide selection of desserts to end the meal with and you don't mind waiting for a table. If you're with friends and have an open schedule, it's a great place. If you're in a hurry- good luck."
Pui S.,"Amboy, WA",240,633,11655,5.0,7/22/2012,I can't imagine life without cheesecake! :)
Gina A.,"Portland, OR",148,252,241,2.0,1/6/2014,"I don't HATE it here.  I don't LOVE it here.  I just go here because it's convenient and needed relief from shopping in the mall plus everyone and their dog knows where it is and lastly,  they can serve everybody something edible.  The atmosphere is expansive and though I gather the CHEESECAKE is the thing to rave about, I don't want their humongous portions, so I just order off of the small plates menu and forget the cheesecake until they can make a smaller (like 1/5) size.  On the plus side - they have excellent quality wait staff - speedy and professional. FYI:  Almost always a wait for seating in bar or dining room."
Michael X.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,148,4,1.0,10/11/2013,"I only leave one star reviews for dishonest businesses or absolutely horrible experiences - this one is for the latter. I've been to this Cheesecake factory location a few times, and have been underwhelmed each time.  But my visit last night takes the cake, no pun intended.   Before I get to last night, I've been to quite a number of Cheesecake factory locations and this one by far is the worst I've been to.  For starters, they seem to have somehow packed in way more seats than they should have - you're literally bumping elbows with the people sitting next to you.  Not pleasant.  Next, in my opinion, the food at this location is not as good as the other CF's I've visited.  So last night, I happen to be close to this location and for some reason decide to stop here for a meal.  I go up to the reception area, told that it's a 10-15 minute wait, say that's fine, handed a pager, and I have a seat and wait.  Pager goes off, ushered over to my table (which is about the right size for an elf) yet the table hasn't even been cleaned yet.  So I patiently wait until it's cleaned and sit down.  No menu, so as soon as my server comes over, I kindly ask for a menu.  She then has the audacity to ask me where I came from and did I come from up-front - clearly implying by her words and tone that I had somehow cut in front of everyone else waiting and just plopped down at this table. I'm thinking really? did this person really just ask me that question? Given the elbow to elbow seating, I waited for the people sitting next to me to leave before I spoke to my server - as I didn't want to embarrass her in front of those people.  Yeah, I had a little more respect for her then she had for me. So the people next to me leave, and I tell her how inappropriate it was to tell a customer that, clearly implying they're some dishonest schmuck who can't wait in a line.  She goes on to say something along the lines of ""well we have a problem with that"" - people just sitting down apparently.  And how that's my problem, I've yet to understand.  Total lack of accountability and I think my telling her this sailed right over her head.  If this location has a problem with people sitting down at tables, perhaps they should look into fixing their seating issues, but treating customers like criminals is totally inexcusable.  Needless to say I won't be going back to this establishment again.  Even despite this unfortunate event, this particular Cheesecake factory isn't worth waiting in line 30 seconds for.   PS: The manager, at least it seemed to be the manager, was going from table to table like some Disneyland automaton asking each person the exact same canned question if they were enjoying their ""experience"" or something along those lines - with as much genuine interest as some Washington DC politician.  He didn't even seem to pause long enough to hear someone's answer :) Priceless. No wonder this place is running like it is."
America V.,"Boise, ID",48,9,4,5.0,9/10/2015,Food was amazing very nice atmosphere but what stood out the most was the service  desnond has a funny personality and makes you feel welcomed .will definitely come again !
Amanda B.,"Hillsboro, OR",35,64,1,4.0,7/19/2015,"I love the buffalo blasts, the pasta carbonara, and the tuxedo cheesecake. Therefore that is all I ever order because I'm not that adventurous to try the seemingly hundreds of menu options they have. I stick to what I know is going to be good when it's a more expensive menu. Meanwhile my more adventurous fiancé was let down by his enchiladas and Kahlua cheesecake."
M Q.,"Marion, OR",4,40,2,3.0,10/2/2015,Well they have the most confusing menu on the planet  Place is decent but omg why so many choices  It seems they have gone more and more into prep  Overall the cheesecake is the reason for the visit
Kenyatta L.,"Fort Irwin, CA",1,18,,1.0,2/26/2015,"Not impressed!!! I went here while visiting. I've been to several Cheesecake Factories and I must say, I'm very upset. I usually order the same thing which is the Pasta Carbonara with Chicken and I'm always pleased. My experience at this particular restaurant was awful. My food was very under seasoned. I added tons of salt and pepper but that didn't help. My waitress was awful also. She never came to check on our table. Didn't offer to refill any drinks and then got my dessert order wrong. Overall, not impressed and wouldn't go back if I was in the area again."
Brittanie M.,"Portland, OR",83,251,115,2.0,8/25/2013,"Even though this place is so very ""chain"", I used to love it. USED to, that is. The food is truly mediocre at best, and worth noting that each dish is seriously 234234 calories. They do have a large, extensive menu and they seem to be known for their large portions, but what good is that if it's not even that good?  This location in a mall does nothing for their ambiance and last time I was here they totally screwed up my order. Pretty upsetting when my party was waiting unusually long for our meal to begin with, they gave me the wrong dish, and then made it again, which took so, so long. I finally just asked them to package it to go. To make matters worse, it was almost more irritating when the manager comes to our table to apologize, nice gesture, but I just wanted it fixed in a timely matter and not once did he offer to compensate the meal which would have been nice given this particular incident."
Tam F.,"San Ramon, CA",489,1397,253,3.0,8/20/2011,"I am a CF fan and sadly come to them so often that I know page numbers, what comes on dishes that the menu doesn't indicate, what has left the menu, how the dishes should look,taste, etc. This could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the day/location/staff.  Since we had two trips to Washington Square Mall-and it was the daughter and SIL who are doing the low/no carb diet, we decided that CF would give them the most options. What we found at this location is that the service is wonderful(on both visits) but the food is inconsistent. CF, all over the nation is in the process of rolling out their new ""Skinnylicious menu"" that won't hit the Bay Area until the 9th or 11th of September. It just rolled out here in Oregon this past week and my theory as to why my staple (miso salmon) was off both times I ordered it is simply because the new menu (with 40+) items is just a tad overwhelming for the kitchen to learn and the rest of the staff to execute.  The management here is great-offering to fix just about anything, giving us gift cards to return (Tuesday's gift card was used Thursday), wanting to give us dessert either to eat there or to go, etc. We declined the dessert but the attempt to ""make it right"" would make both Tim Gunn and Gorden Ramsey happy."
Freddie O.,"Portland, OR",0,7,,2.0,1/2/2015,"I went there about a week before Christmas and took a group of 9  in my limousine there. They told us it was going to be an hour and a half wait. But when we showed up it was only 30 minutes. It was great that they got us in quick , but somebody on the phone didn't know what the heck was going on. To cut to the chase I ordered the ribeye steak , it look like it was a small New York steak I was very surprised I didn't complain it wasn't what I wanted but the surprising thing is that I paid alot for a steak and all I got was a Steak oh and some mashed potatoes and bread, I ordered an iced tea when I walked out of there my bill was $49.00"
Shitaytay D.,"Beaverton, OR",0,727,319,2.0,7/20/2013,"Update 7/2013 I had a 20 dollar gift card I carried around for a year before finally deciding to use it.  We decided to get our food ""to go"" to avoid the crowds and wait.   I ordered some appetizers, Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip, Chicken Samosas and Spicy Cashew Chicken for an Entree.  The total was $38.00.  They did include complimentary bread, chips for the Dip, along with Salsa, Sour Cream and Butter.   I was not impressed with any of the items ordered.  The Samosas are supposed to be tender and crisp, they were not at all.  The Spinach and Cheese dip was bland.  The Spicy Cashew Chicken was fairly bland and they did not separate the chicken and the rice, which annoys me.  It was kind of a mess and certainly not worth the price. Their food is overpriced and bland, I don't get why people flock to this place to overpay for mediocre food."
Karen M.,"Beaverton, OR",26,11,,2.0,7/8/2013,"I don't understand the appeal of Cheesecake Factory. This location is always jam-packed, so the wait for a table is frequently ridiculously long. The menu is the restaurant equivalent of War And Peace in length. I mean, it has advertisements for other businesses, like a magazine. Once you finally make a decision on your meal, the portions come and are massive. I mean MASSIVE, to the point of complete gluttony. The food itself is just ok. With all of the amazing choices available in the Portland area that are fresh, local, independent, reasonably priced, and delicious, TCF is on the bottom of my list of choices for eating out.  On the positive: the service is very good. The few times I've been there. The servers have been prompt, attentive, knowledgable of the massive menu, and courteous. This is a typical American corporate restaurant - feed the people massive amounts of food and then encourage them to eat MORE by offering a gigantic piece of cheesecake."
Melissa K.,"Portland, OR",45,119,160,3.0,3/22/2012,"When you have so many things on your menu, none of them will be very memorable. Except the cheesecake--their specialty. The  food portions are ridiculously large but not the greatest as far as taste goes. After trying a lot (though no where near their entire menu), my staple go-to's are the chicken sandwich, Romano's crusted chicken with pasta, chicken madiera, and any of the pizzettes.  They taste good, the price doesn't mean quality though, it means quantity! I know everyone goes for the cheesecake but seriously try the truffle layer cake--delicious!  A good choice if you have a lot of people and you don't know who doesn't eat what/you have picky eaters."
Shayla W.,"Beaverton, OR",33,13,,3.0,6/6/2015,"Not so sure if I will go back, except for maybe a cheesecake to go.  The food was okay. I got the shrimp scampi with steak danie. The shrimp scampi was over cooked and under garlic ed.  The steak was great. The side of horseradish was super bland. The complementary bread tastes good but they don't cut it through so you have to tear it. And smash it. But it tasted good.  The chocolate mousse cheesecake was awesome. The reason for the 3 stars is the waiter took so long between visits, except while we were starting to eat he came by 5 times asking if it was good.  Anoying when you have a mouthful. Anoying waiting forever to order and to get your check."
