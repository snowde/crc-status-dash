Kevin F.,"Reno, NV",1,16,,3.0,8/3/2015,"Around the time this location first opened almost 10 years ago, I had my first date with my now wife. This restaurant has always had a special place in our hearts. As time has passed, the euphoria of that experience has worn off, and we are able to see the cheesecake factory for what it is; a fairly good chain restaurant with a menu clearly designed to satisfy the masses. The food, atmosphere, and service are good but not great. Nothing about the experience is exemplary or unique, but sometimes a good lunch that is certain to not disappoint is exactly what we want. The wait times vary from 15 minutes to an hour, and the food can be pricey. The restaurant is very popular so they obviously do enough right to make anyone happy. If you are looking for a solid, can't miss option, the cheesecake factory is great, but be prepared to spend some money."
Gillian W.,"Beaverton, OR",130,351,1631,4.0,2/24/2012,"Who doesn't like this place? I've been many times but I think on the spendy side, especially if you get booze. DH ordered a couple of Nkasi's and a burger. I had the SkinnyLicious™ Shrimp Summer Rolls that were Delicate Rice Paper Rolled Around Asparagus, Shitake Mushrooms, Carrots, Rice Noodles, Green Onion, Cilantro and Shrimp - Served Chilled and an order of the  Ahi Carpaccio Thin Slices of Raw Ahi Tuna, Wasabi Pesto which was pretty interesting to say the least. Not quite what I was expecting.  The salad rolls came on these little puffy rice noodly things that, I'm sure were Ok to eat but they were messy- almost like long rice crispies. I think this  place is complete fluff. In other words is great for the ambiance and area, but way over sold and the value isn't good here you are getting way less than what you're paying for. That tuna stuff I had? It was 12 bucks.. you could go broke off the appetizer menu alone.  On the plus side, it was a great intimate place for me to have lunch with the DH.. had a some great conversation and  this place allows you that. It does afford you that it's not so loud you can't hear yourself think."
Michael G.,"Hollins, VA",33,5,,4.0,5/25/2015,The chicken and biscuits are delicious. The portion size is large so it seems the high price tag is legitimate. The brown bread that they bring is also delicious. They also bring to you as much as you want and allow you to choose only the brown bread if you want as well. Then I had the red velvet cheesecake that tasted like an ice cream cheesecake. Very good but a little too sweet for me.
Christine D.,"Portland, OR",235,654,301,5.0,9/6/2011,"Well, they've finally done it.  They brought in a Skinnylicious menu.  Thank goodness because I usually have to bring half the stuff home and while that's not a bad thing...I probably shouldn't be eating this much of their food as it's all pretty calorie laden. I was pleasantly surprised at the smaller burger with salad for only 590 calories.  Very tasty and it looked like a hand made patty (probably because it was smaller only way to get it).  I was very pleased and just full enough.   I skipped the cheesecake which isn't really my thing to begin with.  I actually can't wait to go back and try something else off this menu.  I looked on the internet, apparently it's been around for a couple of years but this if the first time I've seen it. Keep up the good work, CCF. I'll be back again."
Stuart E.,"Portland, OR",0,20,,2.0,12/26/2015,IT's a solid OK.  Nothing great. My food was incredibly greasy and took forever to get our order. We were there mid-afternoon with few customers.  I asked for no onions and the sandwich was covered in onions.  The limp salad was dressed with a very watery and sour dressing which pooled on the plate.  The wait staff spend a lot of time behind the main reservation station chatting.
Josh N.,"McMinnville, OR",85,57,22,5.0,6/9/2015,"Love their food, great customer service, love their bar drinks. Prices r a bit expensive for the drinks, food is very inconsistent with other states cheesecake factories! THIS ONE IS MUCH TASTIER. The ones in cali sometimes are really bland!"
Josh B.,"Newport, OR",4,228,48,5.0,4/22/2015,"I do not just dish out five stars, but Cheesecake Factory deserves it. Wonderful service. The meal itself was amazing. They brought us some of the most tasty bread i've ever out in my mouth. So tasty, I savored every bite. Finally, for desert, the cheesecake. Oh wow. You get a large serving. It was so good I joked about having a cigarette after. The entire meal was so good. Better than sex. Yes, they get busy there, but it's a great atmosphere. The cost is well worth it."
Khevan A.,"Hillsboro, OR",25,6,,5.0,5/9/2015,Tried a chicken pasta and bloody marry which was just mind blowing ... It was a sunny afternoon and loved the ambience
Kaleinoheaokaainahau B.,"Makawao, HI",68,4,,5.0,5/20/2015,I did the take out yesterday went in orderd walked back oit and did some shopping cane back and the food was ready wasn't even gone for more than 30min brought it home and it was tull hot as it came out. And my cheesecake was still cold to. All in all it was yummy
Harat H.,"Crystal Lake, IL",5,89,19,5.0,10/1/2013,"Superior to all the other cheesecake factories I've visited around the country. They were incredible! From the moment we sat down the hostess drew attention to the server and told her we had a little one who was one year old. The server brought out some sliced up bananas and graham crackers with our waters. This was so thoughtful! More restaurants should do things like this for kids to keep them occupied and happy whole their parents order and spend money!  We had a wonderful appetizer, drinks, and them meal, and of course couldn't leave without delicious cheesecake and homemade whipped cream!    Wonderful experience from start to finish and service that was superb! Compliments to the management and maybe they need to go train some of the Midwest locations. Staff ran flawlessly! These are the type of experiences that make you brag to your friends and family about and make you want to come back soon!!"
Majed A.,"Lloyd District, Portland, OR",0,2,3,5.0,2/9/2014,Every thing in their minue is perfect.  I recommend Macaroni and cheese balls--buffalo chicken plats for appetizer. Chicken piccata--Louisiana chicken pasta--Cajun jambalaya pasta--four cheese pasta as a main order.
Joe G.,"San Diego, CA",47,110,50,2.0,3/23/2013,Usual. Redundant. Typical. Corporate chain restaurant with very large menu. Wait was 45 minute when quoted 30. Hostess was not friendly and seemed like she didn't want to be there.  Not really anything unique about it. Just another CA restaurant preparing decent food. There is better food out there!
Janessa L.,"Spokane, WA",4,75,4,1.0,2/25/2013,"I'm from Spokane and whenever my husband and I are in places with CCFs, we go. We like the food that much. We were staying in Vancouver, but made the 45 minute drive (from our hotel) down to Tigard. When we got there they were out of pagers which should have been a sign, but we put our names in and were told to check back in 45 minutes (saying the wait was an hour). We did some window shopping and returned, only to be told the wait was another 40 minutes--but that the current wait was 2 hours, as if that were some consolation. We waited...and waited...and waited. 40 minutes came and went, husband checked on our status, was told another 5-10 minutes with only 5 other couples in front of us. 20 minutes after that, I sent him in to cancel our table, and it was finally ready. The table they took us to, in the bar, should not exist. It was up against a wall and less than 12"" from the couple next to us. Husband could barely get into his seat. His ass was basically in their dinner as he squeezed by. Awesome. We are not large people by any means. We wouldn't have been able to move our arms to eat, let alone converse, in the terrible configuration they stuck us in. We finally cut our losses (that would be 2 hours of our lives we'll never get back), and bailed.  We've gone to many very busy CCFs before, and have never had to wait more than about an hour, maybe 1:15 once. Clearly, this one has issues with slow service and/or food. We chose to leave hungry rather than endure any more torture to find out. Update 5/30: I contacted the restaurant directly after writing this review, expressing my concerns. I got a call from the manager saying he'd send me a gift card so I could try them again. 3 months later and I'm not holding my breath on him ever following through."
Nicole M.,"Portland, OR",67,12,2,4.0,4/12/2015,Good food. Good drinks. Good desserts! However it can be a little bit pricey. The service is typically speedy. I enjoy stopping by for some cheesecake to go.
Janice L.,"Rochester, NY",0,3,7,4.0,4/19/2015,"The portion size is huge and the service was good! I got the Pasta Da Vinci and the sauce tastes great, but is a bit too watery."
Marilyn M.,"Beaverton, OR",12,36,78,5.0,4/19/2015,"The 40 minute wait on a Saturday night was worth it.  Courteous & efficient staff.  My family & I ordered the crispy crab wontons, chicken pot stickers, fried mac & cheese & pretzel crusted chicken, chocolate tower truffle cake, carrot cake, smores galore & Hershey's Chocolate Bar cake.  Our appetizers & desserts were delicious & arrived timely.  Brittney M. at The Cheesecake Factory helped make our teen's 19th birthday extra special!  We'll definitely return to The Cheesecake Factory!"
Marina S.,"Portland, OR",69,16,77,5.0,2/20/2015,"Always great food, ginormous portions (I take half 'to go' every time), and friendly staff. I seriously don't know how this restaurant is able to offer such large menu selection while still keeping quality of food under control."
Lunatec 2.,"Portland, OR",0,52,11,1.0,10/25/2015,"FILTHY location. FIVE TIMES IN A ROW we got dirty glassware and/or dishes and/or silverware. I don't know what the dishwasher is doing back there but he ain't washin' dishes I can tell you that. FIVE TIMES in a row! We gave them SO many chances to make it right. You'd think the servers would catch it when they're bringing your wine to you or setting the table. Nope. And the manager Molly? Not only is she useless but actually she tried to come off like a heavy to me. She followed me out of the restaurant like I was being kicked out! Am I being kicked out? Am I being kicked out because I don't want to eat from dirty dishes and drink from dirty wineglasses? Then why am I being followed out the door? I turned to confront her and in her best nursie voice she said she just wanted to make sure I was OK. Huh? I'm a 55 year old woman exiting a restaurant because it's in violation of health codes. Of course I'm OK. Then she tells me, in her most manipulative way, if I'd fill out an incident report. Incident? What incident? She's creating one by treating me like this though. DIRTY DISHES, GLASSES and SILVERWARE are the incident. I, having standards, refuse to eat from filthy dishes. I guess that makes me ""trouble"". I wouldn't go here again if you actually paid me. I value my health too much. People are filthy. Look around. Would you want their mucous in your mouth? If not then stay away from this location because they simply do not clean their dishes, glasses and silverware. And the manager, Molly, is better suited to a nursing home than managing a restaurant. Shame too. I was a regular at the original Cheesecake Factory. Boy has it gone downhill since then. Al Pacino would be dining at the next table. Apparently even Al values cleanliness because I haven't seen him in a CF in over a decade. :( Sad."
Erica M.,"Lake Oswego, OR",19,10,,5.0,1/13/2015,"Wonderful lunch, I always love coming here.  Love their brown bread.  I had the ""Skinnylicious Chicken Pasts"" and it didn't seem like it was only 590 calories!!  If you do come here for lunch, sit in the bar and have Cameron wait on you, she is amazing!!!'"
Katrina W.,"Portland, OR",285,467,514,1.0,11/15/2012,"You know why I don't have very many one-star reviews? Because I like to avoid places that suck. Unfortunately, I have friends who don't share this aversion. When visiting from out of town, they'll make the Cheesecake Factory a destination, right alongside the outlet stores (which don't suck, really, I'm just saying it's a package deal). I used to not be a jerk and just go, just to spend time with my people, but I cannot do it anymore. I had to break it to them.   There are so sososo many good places to eat in Portland. SO MANY. The Cheesecake Factory is not one of them. The meat products have the texture of soggy sawdust mixed with wax. The cheesecake weirdly has the same texture. Everything comes with an extra helping of clogged arteries with none of the pesky flavor that gets in the way of a really unsatisfying meal.  It's not exactly false advertising. The cheesecake really does taste like it was made in a factory. Maybe a Jell-O factory. Maybe Dr. Scholl's. It's not the fault of the people who work here, either. I recognize that. Also, the space is huge and built for big gatherings and family-friendly, etc. Bully.  Were there not so many 5-star reviews of this place, I might be more inclined to give it a two just for kitsch. But this food is gross, man. Hey, at least it's expensive."
