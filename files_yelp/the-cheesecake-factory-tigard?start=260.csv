Alex V.,"Portland, OR",1,6,1,2.0,10/2/2015,"The place looks nice and spacious inside. The staff is decent, not great. When it comes to the food I was definitely disappointed. The food was tasteless and just plain. Cheesecake wasn't too bad, but again over priced and not worth it. I wouldn't return."
D C.,"Hillsboro, OR",12,16,13,4.0,3/11/2015,"Great ambiance, good food good drinks, awesome dessert. Our sever was a little spacey though forgot to ring in our drinks, but overall a good experience definitely will be coming back more often, been awhile."
Raja S.,"Hillsboro, OR",99,310,12,4.0,8/21/2011,"The first thing that you like about this restaurant (once your wait for seating is over) is the nice ambience for a restaurant jostled inside a mall. [the wait is bearable as you get a pager so that you can shop, don't go too far as JCPenney as it will not work that far in the mall]. The servcie is amazing, been there ~4 times and was always blown away by the service. The restaurant is almost always full, but they have enough servers to keep good check of all their customers. Coming to food, their menu is quite expansive. Some items are really good... we loved the Firecracker Salmon: yummy and spicy: an innovative dish and a must eat. We ordered the Jamaican Black pepper with Chicken and Shrimp - that turned out to be really good as well, the shrimp and chicken were cooked to the right amount (nice and juicy).  Avacodo rolls appetizer: very good.  The sauce (cilantro based) is very good. Chicken Madeira: Not so great. Herb Crust Salmon: Decent to good. Vanilla Cheesecake: Very good. 30th Anniversary Cheesecake: Awesome. Tiarmisu Cheesecake: Good, but not as good as other cheesecakes. Mango Keylime cheesecake: Just okay, my wife liked it however. On an earlier visit, I ordered their Chicken & Shrimp gumbo, which wasn't as spicy as expected. Had these at a LA cheesecake factory: Bang - Bang Chicken and Shrimp: Awesome dish: should try out at other locations as well. Chicken samosas: turned out to be good as well. Overall, very pleasant dining experience."
Roxana M.,"Brush Prairie, WA",7,2,,5.0,1/26/2015,"My mother and I have been known to trek from our small town of Brush Prairie, WA to WA square for Cheesecake Factory-it's fantastic. It's where you go if you want the ambiance and amazing food, aside from a few hidden treasures in Vancouver."
Roman S.,"Portland, OR",384,634,304,3.0,7/6/2013,"when you step into TCF you feel luxury, extravagance, kind of larger-than-life feel. it would probably be better off being a dance club. as far as a restaurant and cheesecake joint it barely scrapes by. the food is really pricey, the quality and taste hovers around mediocre. the food is not actually that bad but not worth the hefty price. some of the menu items sound too insane for me to even try ""tex mex eggrolls"" - get out of here drinks and everything is $$.. cheesecake slice runs about $7-8. the cheesecake is alright but, only for a few bucks more i could have a whole cheesecake that will likely taste as good or better.  can't quite figure out why this place is so popular"
Vincent A.,"Burnaby, Canada",8,39,12,4.0,9/4/2013,"Your typical Cheesecake Factory experience.  Everytime I go I get the Tomato Basil Chicken Penne, and it didn't disappoint. I always ask for the brown bread (pumpernickel?) as it's so much better than the plain sourdough.  I didn't get dessert this time, but if you haven't been to one before I'd suggest any of their great cheesecake flavours, including the red velvet one (my personal favorite). It's still better than anything I've had in Vancouver BC. Thank goodness we have locations much closer than Portland."
Dayla C.,"Eugene, OR",21,39,9,4.0,9/15/2014,"Had a wonderful time here. Resonably priced, beautiful decor, great staff and tasty food. Totally gonna re-visit this place ecery time im in the area!"
Angelia A.,"Salem, OR",10,41,43,5.0,1/23/2015,"First time going to Cheesecake Factory. It was on my birthday. The wait sucked because we were starving, but felt pretty fast. The food was great! The cheesecake was even better! I would recommend this place."
Jacob C.,"Fremont, CA",25,33,2,3.0,1/6/2015,"I've hit up Cheesecake Factory restaurants  all across the West Coast. I have not commented so far, because each time I went, it was great, except for this one. The Bistro Shrimp Pasta's shrimp was far from crispy--in fact, the fried outer shell was practically falling apart when it was served--and the service left something to be desired. Seattle's location was far better on a consistent basis."
Batoul S.,"Beaverton, OR",14,21,1,4.0,12/21/2014,"Good service. Good food. Lots of variety, especially when it comes to the cheesecake options. Managers tend to always walk around and check on costumers. Always busy, especially on weekends. Expect a wait unless going early in the morning or late at night."
Alpha 1.,"Gainesville, FL",0,125,,5.0,2/12/2016,Love their bread condiments! I love the interior design and their service is spectacular! Their menu is huge! So many selections! I will definitely be coming back to try as much as I can! Their strawberry shortcake dessert is yummy but I definitely recommend you share with someone due to portion size.
Chris O.,"Portland, OR",590,1676,261,4.0,9/25/2014,"Yep it's a Cheesecake factory like all the rest. But I will say that I loved our server and I feel stupid for forgetting his name but he has a 10 month old kid so he sympathized with our special requests being we had our 9 month old with us which was awesome. Food is always good at the Cheesecake Factory and if you can just try to order something on the lighter side there maybe you'll only consume a 1k cal meal, or you can try my new diet the one CF meal a day diet where you get to eat just one meal each day at CF picking anything you like, which should get you up to a full 3k cal meal no prob so in retrospect maybe not a good diet plan but it would be delicious!"
Jamie C.,"Portland, OR",50,77,49,2.0,1/26/2013,The cheesecake is good--as it should be since its the speciality. However the food is mediocre. I'm scared to go back after ordering biscuit and gravy chicken meal that was sweet. It was disgusting. I don't know who wants sweet gravy and biscuits in a savory meal. Puke. The advertisements in the menu are weird too. I'm sure they make enough money. The place is always packed.
Dan H.,"Medford, OR",52,8,1,5.0,2/8/2015,"Had to wait 30 minutes to get seated, but it is a Sunday evening.  The food is delicious and the service is phenomenal. I got the Shepard pie and  was very satisfied."
Dave F.,"Beaverton, OR",2,52,3,2.0,12/13/2014,"I can't comment on the food cause I only ordered cheesecake but I am not impressed.  The cheesecake was good, but not $9 good.  I'm expecting a pretty big wow factor when I pay so much for a dessert.  Maybe its just not for me, but I don't feel like I would ever go back."
April G.,"Seattle, WA",23,143,19,3.0,7/8/2013,"I know it's silly...but I normally LOVE the Cheesecake factory.  The Menu is literally 25 pages long, it has something for everyone, it is tasteful, it is good quick food, and it is healthy.   So when I was in town for a race, it felt like a safe choice to choose here to eat to carbo load for my race.   We asked to be seated outside in the shade, we were seated at a table in the full sun and the hostess told us we could move the umbrellas however we wanted.  To make matters worse, the lady at the table next to us had a loose dog!  How is that allowed? So we have the dog running around, we have the sun in our eyes, but the waiter came quick and we thought okay we're hungry!  But this should have been a sign! I was happy that I could get my standard race meal, Penne Pasta, Grilled Chicken, and Marinara, almost exact, I just had to order it without the basil butter and oil.  The waiter confirmed my order, I was happy.  The order came out wrong.  First, I hate sending food back; ever since the movies ""waiting"" and ""still waiting"" came out it scares me enough to eat out and then to send it back?!?  Well it had to go, and so I sat, and my food came, and this time it came out right. (?)  Secondly, the waiter that was waiting on us we had to ask him to speak up 4 times.....I'm not hard of hearing and it wasn't loud; we were sitting on the patio.  It just felt like he was doing it to be annoying. It wasn't the best experience I've had at the Cheesecake Factory, maybe it was the location."
Kenny P.,"Portland, OR",94,148,,3.0,10/10/2012,"I have been there multiple times and this will be my first review of it. The service It is a pretty packed restaurant with a decent service. The servers are usually pretty nice and they will assist you and ask you to wait politely. The good thing is they give you thing that can vibrate (not vibrator) when your table is ready. So, while waiting (usually always packed) you can go for window shopping at the mall. Once you are sit on your table, they are pretty nice and fast to take your order The food I have tried different kind of foods here. Nothing really stand out. The cheesecake was good. Any kind of cheesecake will not disappoint you. Pay attention, i said Good not exceptional. Nachos was pretty basic. The portion was huge but the taste was ""ummm"". Firecrackers salmon for appetizer is recommended. It was actually pretty good. For main dish, the most memorable one is cajun jambalaya pasta. The other pasta was pretty plain. But this one is pretty flavorful. The Atmosphere It was nice place to hang out with friend. I recommend to call in for reservation if you come in big group. It will be pretty noisy but you can join in the crowd and be noisy as well. If it's summer time, sitting outside might be a good idea The location Located in Washington Square mall, so parking is super easy. They have big parking lot. And of course, it's easy to find Will I come back? Only if my friends visiting from outside country in which they dont have cheesecake factory in their countries."
Mike G.,"Forest Grove, OR",0,11,1,2.0,1/21/2013,"The food here is good, if you are willing to wait an hour.  The main problem with this restaurant is the GIGANTIC portions!  You can feed a family of four on one order!  Don't fall into this company's obesity trap! The menu really needs to be pared down, too.  Just stick with dishes you do well instead of trying to serve every type of food under the sun!"
Jason P.,"Portland, OR",37,37,12,3.0,9/26/2012,"We've been here a couple times now over the last year and its such hit or miss - lines can be long and not very fun to wait - Came in with a decent size group, i believe 8 of us (that includes 2 toddlers) and they had us seated within 20 mins or so right around noon time on a Sunday - Bread was on the table promptly and the waitress took our order shortly after -  the only real downside to this place was that our food took unexpectedly long to come out. We ordered Brunch food for heaven's-sake - how long does it take someone to make a pancake and some eggs/bacon - definitely not 30 mins!  Anyways, food was good, not the best, but we ended up enjoying ourselves quite pleasantly!"
Summer B.,"Portland, OR",74,176,172,5.0,8/6/2014,"Five stars because cheesecake. Frankly, smooth, flavorful, great selection, and one of my favorites any day of the week. Don't believe me?? Watch me stand on my scale. ;)"
