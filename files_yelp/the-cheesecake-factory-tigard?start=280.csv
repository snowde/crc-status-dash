Laura H.,"Tualatin, OR",30,114,4,2.0,7/30/2012,"Overkill is the name of the game at The Grand Ol' Cheesecake Factory. Overkill on the menu, overkill on the food portion sizes, overkill on the waiting and waiting and waiting, overkill on the Vegas meets suburbia decor, overkill on the amount of sugar in the cheesecake. Who runs this place, Paula Deen? The cheesecake is okay, I sound probably sound like a major ***hole complaining about cheesecake of all things but.  Whoa! The amount of sugar, is truly excessive. I bake so I can confidently say, good cheesecake does not need that much sugar. It's just overkill.  I love my sweets mind you, but I put a bite of that cheesecake in my mouth and literally recoil from the sugar. Even on Monday night, a 30 minute wait? Looking around I notice what others have mentioned. For many, this is the ultimate restaurant. The place they go for their birthday. The ultimate *special occasion* destination. Well, okay. I don't get it and don't dig the whole having strangers loudly sing happy birthday int the middle of the restaurant and so on and so forth.... You will wait, and wait, and wait for your meal as though it were a feast being prepared for a Pharaoh. And then the food arrives and it's good, nothing extraordinary besides the ridiculous portion size. Cheesecake factory is just not an experience that I enjoy. C'est La Vie!"
Julie S.,"St. Helens, OR",18,31,10,2.0,11/7/2014,"Came here to meet my mom and cousins for lunch today.  I am giving 2 stars only because the waitress was nice and I like the brown bread.  I ordered a lunch sized BBQ chicken salad.  It was large, but really lacked flavor.  The chicken was sparse and dry.  My cousin's chopped salad was disgusting and covered in too much bad tasting vinegarette.  (sp).  I will remember next time someone suggests this place I will give a firm NO.  It is overpriced for what you get."
Louise F.,"Auckland, New Zealand",0,24,,4.0,1/14/2016,"Good food, good service, great cheesecake. Perfect for everyone with a 20 plus page menu and everything you could possibly want. Had a nice atmosphere and our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Make sure you don't order anything too big as you have to leave room for cheesecake. I had the red velvet and it was amazing!"
Karen W.,"Portland, OR",7,22,,1.0,11/22/2014,"O.M.G. Horrible! Expensive and the food wasn't to die for. The seating is RIDICULOUS. They seat you so close to people. I ended up hearing two conversations going on at the same time. This place is a joke. The cheesecake wasn't good either. Either the staff was having a very bad day or this place sucks...I just think that this place sucks. I am sooo glad I did not spend my hard earned money here, luckily I had a gift card. Never coming back."
Rebecca W.,"San Diego, CA",20,249,42,3.0,10/2/2012,"The decor is incredible, the cheesecakes look incredible, the huge lines almost convince you that this place is incredible, but I dare say it's too much hype and not enough there to back it up. Sure the cheesecakes are decent, some are even great, but overall I find the cheesecakes from my local bakery to be much better. Many of the cheesecakes at the Factory are waaaaay toooo sweet!! Total sweetness overload!  The food is...meh. I mean, it's not horrible by any means, and it is better than a million other joints, but the prices are steep, portions WAAAAAY toooo big, and the food is nothing to rave about. I would rather pay a smaller fee and get a much smaller portion and would likely dine here more if there was more selection in the smaller portion sizes. Put all that together and factor in the long wait to get a table on most days and times, and then factor in that you have a server who is mega busy waiting on table and likely to be less attentive than servers at less crowded establishments and it just doesn't make much sense to me why this place is so popular. One kudo I have to give the local Factory though is good management. Managers do show their faces and address problems. That is a big deal in my book! This is a location we will dine at once ever year or so....no more. I just don't get the hype personally."
Heather E.,"Chico, CA",2,97,,4.0,1/15/2013,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory on a weekday afternoon.  I wanted to go ""before the rush"" so I walked around the mall for a bit and then was seated around 5.   I was seated at a smaller table for two and promptly greeted by my server.  He brought water and asked if I had any questions about the menu. The menu is fantastic because there are so many different things to order, but at the same time, it takes forever to look at everything.  They serve breakfast all day, there's appetizers, salads, sandwiches, burgers, simple dishes, fancier and more expensive dishes, a whole menu of ""skinnylicious"" items which are designed to be low-calorie, two full pages of desserts and on and on.  After taking probably 15 minutes to look over everything, I decided on a veggie burger and salad. My server brought two small loaves of bread (one wheat, one white) with really good real butter, and dinner came out shortly.  My veggie burger was AMAZING.  When you order veggie burgers at restaurants, most of the time they are handmade.  Some places use veggies and grains, others use black beans, every place kinda does their own thing.  Cheesecake Factory makes theirs with black beans, brown rice, farro grain, beets and onions.  It was so flavorful and unique and just simply amazing.   I also wanted to try some cheesecake because they're famous for it, so I decided on the original plain flavor.  I was actually really disappointed with my cheesecake selection.  The cheesecake is made with a lot of sour cream, and it definitely has that tangy flavor to it.  Also, it was really soft in the middle, almost running off my fork.  Maybe I'm just used to eating a more firm cheesecake, but regardless, I wasn't a big fan.  However, I don't think it would deter me from eating there or trying another dessert.  It could have just been a fluke. Overall, I'd say a great experience with good service and solidly good food.  Just, make sure you come early because this place gets really full really fast."
Don W.,"Salem, OR",0,11,1,4.0,8/29/2014,"Oye family had a great time.  The place was packed but service was quick,  friendly,  and food was fantastic.  We all ordered different things and passed around.  Everything was great."
Nichole M.,"Salem, OR",121,13,1,5.0,11/9/2014,The dinner was great!!  This was my bf first time and said other than the wait everything else was good!!  Will go back for sure!!!  I am not a fan of the chairs at the tables tho they are uncomfortable!!!
Marissa T.,"Portland, OR",55,224,211,5.0,12/5/2012,"NEVER EVER EVER, I mean NEVER disappointed! Came here for dinner last week.  However, I've been here lots. It was a Monday so we were sat right away. Just like every other Cheesecake Factory, the interior is dark and romantic.  Perhaps a little too dark.  Thankfully the servers are flying about in all white, which makes them easy to see. LOL. Had a really great margarita.  Later had a yummy Lemon Drop. The menu is way tooo diverse and intimidating to navigate.  Over the last few years they tend  to change it frequently.  So, I tend to just ask the server to find the page of the type of food I feel like having.  It was salad night for me.  This salad was the BEST I have ever ordered at any restaurant, EVER.  The LUAU Salad.  I love it when the lettuce isn't the main ingredient, but merely part of the whole!  This salad was loaded with tons of veggies, chicken, and mango.  Stacked on top are two GIANT wontons that cover the whole top.  The salad was way too big for me. ( I don't mind) This meant I had the rest for breakfast.  Pretty good as leftovers!!!!!!! The only thing I would recommend is that the servers not bring out bread that appears to have been SAT on!!!!! Not very pretty!!!! Love me this place!!!!!!"
Ryan B.,"Portland, OR",4,2,1,5.0,1/25/2014,"They have an extensive menu.  I like dessert!  We came in on a Saturday after a brief tolerable wait we were seated.   The drinks we ordered from the bar were amazing, colorful and strong.  The wait staff here are top notch, food came out hot and quick.  Our server was awesome and checked on us often.   And of course the cheesecake was so incredible."
Jenene Y.,"Portland, OR",32,36,4,3.0,5/17/2014,"For the quality of the food it should be priced the same as an Applebee's, while the feel of the place is like an Olive Garden and they are known for their desserts, I just wasn't as impressed. I getting spoilied by the more trendy restaurants of downtown Portland, I guess. We didn't even bother opening the menu. We ordered everything from the the Skinny menu, where everything is under 540 calories. I can't imagine what the meals in the regular menu have. We didn't try any dessert because we were full. The waiter was nice. Oh and they ran out of clean butter knives and we had to use the bread to get the butter out of the wrap. Maybe it is better if you don't go on a weekend."
T N.,"Portland, OR",31,119,,3.0,9/1/2012,"The food is not anything particularly special. It certainly isn't bad, but it doesn't blow my mind or anything. It's food. The cheesecake is pretty good.  I shared the banana cream cheesecake with my friend (we got it to go), and it was delicious. It was a good sized slice, (plus extra whip cream and banana slices), for the both of us to share; however, I think that $7-$8 for a slice of cheesecake is a little pricey. Sorry cheesecake factory. I won't be going out of my way to buy cheesecake from them, but there's nothing wrong with going back to have a little treat there every few months I guess. (I'M LOOKING AT YOU KAHLUA COCOA CHEESECAKE!)"
Ana M.,"Beaverton, OR",40,19,,4.0,10/25/2014,The other night we came here for my brothers birthday and it's really quite good. I always go simple when at a new restaurant so I just got a burger with green salad on the side. The salads dressing was a little heavy but the burger was pretty good. After dinner we both bought to slices of cheesecake mine Apple streusel which was so good OMG! It's like carmel and apples and the tartness of the cheesecake was so yummy.
Steve A.,"Portland, OR",39,85,,4.0,1/30/2013,"I had my reservations about going here but we wanted to do something different and stay close to home rather than head downtown. Bummer that we did have to wait 50 minutes after arriving at 5p (Sat) but our kids hung in there and it paid off.  After being seated, we had nothing but great service from everyone serving our table and most importantly, our kids were taken care of first. There is a very good wine selection, and I was a bit surprised with how much is offered on the menu but our dinners were fantastic, It was really, really good (at least what we had!) and we will be going back soon..."
Paige V.,"Portland, OR",0,62,3,3.0,12/6/2014,"For having so many choices (an immediate turn off to me), their food was pretty good!  Our server prefaced our ordering with a warning of the portion sizes, which I have never experienced elsewhere.  She was right, so I appreciated her taking the time to tell us. My friend got a lunch salad, and it was still easily two meals.  Why everything (including the space and menu) is so enormous is beyond me.  Finished with Adam's cheesecake (can't remember exact name---but know there was peanut butter!), and it rocked.  A little creeped out that they are called the Cheesecake Factory, and don't make the cakes there.  Had chosen a different slice originally, and server said it ""just came off the truck and is still frozen"", so chose Adam's as my second pick.  I know they are a chain, but WHAT?   This being the case, I only gave it a 3-star rating, but it was a decent experience."
Tatiana P.,"Junction City, OR",0,13,,1.0,10/6/2015,"Wow, I just left from one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. The meal was bad from beginning to end and now I feel horribly sick. Not food poisoning sick, just sick from all the many many very bad quality ingredients that they use in their food. First of all, we started the meal with a margarita and a mai tai. The margarita was more like a waterita and the mai tai was one of the scariest cocktails I have ever tasted in my life. It tasted exactly like the syrup that maraschino cherries sit inside of. I could not drink it at all. Next, we asked the waiter for some glasses of water. Instead of bringing us both water, he only brings water for one person. One of the next times he came around I asked him to please bring another water. Instead of bringing another water, he quickly grabbed the 1 cup of water that was already there and refilled it and came back. Wow. Next, we had some guacamole which was actually not that bad aside from the salsa that accompanied it which was basically just diced tomatoes out of a can. After that, I ordered a margherita pizza. The pizza was one of the scariest parts of all. It was literally just pizza crust with a smear of sauce and some tiny scattered slices of mozzarella. All the places that did not have mozzarella we're literally just crust. Also, I just remembered I forgot to mention the chicken samosas. This was also one of the scariest parts of the meal by far. Usually samosas are made with a delicious combination of curried vegetables. The outside of the samosas were exactly like egg rolls and the inside was just ground chicken, that's it.  I instantly felt sick. What can I say, another way that a big restaurant chain in America is scamming Americans out of their money while getting rich and laughing about it. What is our country coming to? Do Americans have taste buds anymore?"
Jessica N.,"Beaverton, OR",22,5,2,3.0,7/28/2014,"What a place. What a place. Or should I say palace? The high pillars and Greek inspired paintings really make this a special treat. The wood work and tiling in the restaurant too leave you feeling well taken care of. While the food accompanies the most important part of your visit, along with your company, everyone will be sure to enjoy. The food combinations and varieties are near perfection. Some of my personal favorites would have to be their salads (yes, any of them) and the bang-bang-chicken and shrimp! And the prices are fair! I really don't have any complaints here. Except the servers, they're always so awkward to me...it's a busy restaurant, anytime that I go, I just wish they could find a balance in the crew to make it a perfect experience. Thank goodness for wonderful company in my parties. ;-)"
Jason H.,"Ridgefield, WA",4,168,62,4.0,6/14/2014,This place is always very busy so expect to wait a bit to be seated. The service is always great and food just as good. This place would be a 5 star but the restroom wasn't clean.
Casey Ashley B.,"Eureka, CA",0,6,1,5.0,11/18/2014,Was told it was a factory. Definitely lied to. There is an angry chef with a microphone in the kitchen.
Angelique M.,"Beaverton, OR",3,7,,4.0,11/15/2014,Best lettuce wraps...love that they have the sauces in jars to go ! Extensive menu that us sure to make everyone d happy. Only problem are the crowds and wait!
