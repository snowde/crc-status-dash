John L.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",118,914,2,3.0,9/13/2012,Only been here for take out yet.... they took forever with my order. The food was decent.
Mark S.,"Portland, OR",95,167,133,3.0,11/13/2011,"Headed here for an early lunch (11:30am) and was welcomed by a line of 15+ baby strollers... instant thought, should I stay or go? We stayed and waited the 30 minutes for a booth. After reaching the booth and having a Long Island the environment got a lot better. I was overwhelmed by the menu which looked more like a novel with over 20 pages to decide from.  *The waitress was awesome & any questions we had she answered & gave us suggestions! -I ordered the crab cake sandwich ($14.95), stuffed mushrooms ($4.95), Thai tacos ($5.95), & bread (free). All the food was delicious & served hot. ***Next time, I'll wait for dinner and maybe there won't be so many children. I don't mind children but when they're EVERYWHERE screaming & crying... ...it takes away from the experience. DECOR: reminds me of the Motel 6 in Vegas off the strip!"
Annette V.,"Portland, OR",24,163,1,3.0,9/4/2012,"Normally the wait deters me from ever wanting to eat here.  But twist my arm and I'll show up, ready to overindulge in their huge portions.  The basket of warm bread  is also a nice bonus. On my last visit we showed up at 11:30 on a Saturday morning and surprisingly there was no  wait.  I shared a burger with my brother and it was enough to fill us up, with a little room for shared dessert with everyone else at the table. It was my first time trying the banana cream cheesecake and it was actually really good.  Would definitely order that again."
Tucker T.,"Portland, OR",0,6,,1.0,4/1/2015,"Worst customer service lately. I have tried three times thinking maybe next time it will be okay but nope last time they mess up my order, over charge me, and have their incredibly rude women manager not help at all."
Kitty N.,"Portland, OR",15,29,34,3.0,2/15/2012,"The epitome of American gluttony. There is nothing on the menu that an average person could actually consume all of. Not even all of the leftovers. That being said, the menu is expansive. Literally 40 some-odd pages of stuff. The food is fresh, nicely presented, and tastes pretty high quality...you know, real meats, cheeses, fresh baked bread, fresh veggies, and the like The staff is friendly and always quick to greet us, take our order, and keep our drinks full. They also have a huge bar with an expansive specialty drink menu. A girl-drink drunk's fantasy!  I don't ever choose to come here on my own, I always get talked into it by family or friends, and I always kind of regret it. I feel awkward in their huge building (very Vegas feeling), and I hate not being able to order a 'normal' portion of anything. I always end up paying $15+ to eat, even lunch, and waste 3/4 of the food. I like to share, but rarely end up there with people who want to share because everyone always wants something different and they always seem to think they can eat all of what they order. And, often, they get closer to finishing than I do. Waits are long at dinner time. Go at lunch if you can."
Wendy S.,"Vancouver, Canada",34,85,302,4.0,4/29/2014,Always stop by for cheesecake on every trip to Portland. One slice is enough for two to share. Had tiramisu this time and it was just like the dessert.
Gretchen O.,"Portland, OR",0,20,,2.0,4/23/2016,"We waited 40 minutes, which is to be expected during a Friday night. Since it was the end of the work week, I thought I would get something exotic at the bar. The Mai Tai was a delight. Fun to look at and tasty. By the time we were seated we were hungry. The service was efficient but rushed. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to drink when the waiter came. He took the my husband and son's order and left while I was looking at the menu. When he came back with my husband and son's the drinks and we placed our order, he did try to bring my drink to me quickly but the place was slammed and he was hustling. When I got my order my first bite was disappointing. My habachi steak was cold as was my plate, meat and vegetables. I had the waiter bring me hot potatoes because I could manage to eat the other food cold, and I really didn't want to wait to have the whole meal recooked or have the medium rare steak come back well done. My husband enjoyed his steak and salmon. No complaints. My son's pasta dish was miniscule. My husband and I laughed when we saw it, although our son didn't find it funny. Poor guy wasn't even close to full after eating so of course, he had to order a dessert. The Cheesecake Factory does live up to its name. He enjoyed the cake. Still, considering the atmosphere, the price, the cold food/small portion and the fact that the Portland metro has so many really great places to eat, we won't be going back any time soon. But if we are in the neighborhood and have dinner elsewhere, we wouldn't hesitate to have our dessert at The Cheesecake Factory!"
Anjelah S.,"Prescott, AZ",1182,346,935,4.0,1/22/2010,"Ok, I may be lactose intolerant and I may be insane by going to a cheesecake factory, but I actually enjoy their salads and LOVE the Thai lettuce wraps. I honestly think they put some kind of addicting agent into their peanut sauce, because I just can't seem to get enough of it. I could pour that stuff on anything to make it taste better. It must be the sugar. BTW.... Make sure you go online to read your menu first, otherwise it will take you a 1/2 hour to figure out what you want. Believe me, the Menu is HUGE."
Ariel M.,"Leawood, KS",23,66,13,4.0,3/11/2014,"Had the combo shrimp scampi and steak medallions for $19. So first off the meal itself did not fill me up but the mashed potatoes that came with it did. They weren't anything special but after eating a bit of it I just couldn't eat anymore. The steak and the shrimp however were amazing. The steak I had medium rare and it was amazing, great seasoning, perfectly balanced, and properly cooked. Then the sauce just pushed it over the edge and made it divine, I wish I had more of it. Then the scampi was also pretty amazing. The sauce it came with however was a little too overpowering, but when lightly applied to the shrimp it provided a good balance of flavor, I also wish I had more shrimp to eat, but between the two the steak would be the definite winner. If you want just the steak it was called Diane's steak. I also don't feel like they gave enough food for the money I paid but company meal, so I can't complain too much. Ambience was good, service was good, only down side was the last persons dish didn't come out till about 15 minutes later. They did end up giving the meal for free though along with a free soup or salad, would have been nice if they gave a free cheesecake slice though. Otherwise it was a great experience. P.S. - I'm not a fan of mashed potatoes, otherwise someone else probably would have enjoyed it."
Mar S.,"Portland, OR",0,4,,2.0,9/16/2015,Had to wait an hour to get seated. An hour to get food and 30 min for dessert. How long does it take to cut a cheesecake. Been here before and had better experience.
Jeff H.,"Salem, OR",91,270,9,2.0,1/24/2012,"I debated two or three stars, and even though I didn't actively hate The Cheesecake Factory, I was just underwhelmed for what I got. It's a chain, but it's a high end chain.  The decor is over the top, but I can't help but feel like it's just trying too hard...like everything else here. The menu is huge and has a wide variety of styles and options.  Mexican, American, Italian, Asian, everything is represented.  I chose the orange chicken and my friend got a chicken salad.  We also had an order of fried cheese as an appetizer. Well, the fried cheese was actually kind of cold.  Cold like....out of a freezer and heated up and not quite gone all the way to hot.  Either that or it was sitting out for a while for somebody else, who didn't want it or forgot it, and we got it, because it came out almost immediately.  Eh.  It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't that great. Just like my orange chicken.  Not horrible, just...nothing special.  In fact, Panda Express does it equally well (if you get it right out of the fryer, at least). The complimentary bread to start with was very good though. A sour note was the diet coke I drank.  It came from the bar and presumably came from the cocktail gun...and was very watery and thin.  I guess it's mostly for mixed drinks, but still, it just wasn't that great.   And I like my diet coke, gosh darnit. All that for about fifty bucks.  It tried really hard...but it just wasn't that great.  I guess the emphasis is really on deserts, but since we were going to the Moonstruck Cafe later that night, we didn't want any of that. I don't see any particular reason to go back, but I wouldn't turn it down if someone else wanted to go there really bad.  It just would not be my first, second, or even third choice."
Mike M.,"Vancouver, WA",73,168,519,4.0,12/22/2011,"I like The Cheesecake Factory.  We've never had meal there that wasn't less that really good.   Last night however, I made a mistake.  And by mistake I mean I ordered the Bleu Cheese BLT burger...and it was pretty good.  It won't make me forget about The Halftime's burgers anytime soon, but it was good.  The mistake came from ordering a burger in the first place.   I had never had one of their burgers because there are so many menu options that sound good (and many have proven to be awesome), that settling for a burger is simply a waste of the 20-45 minute wait you will most likely incur to get a table.  So my simple review for TCF is this......order something more elaborate than a burger, enjoy it, have cheesecake, enjoy it also, and waddle out."
Alex D.,"San Ramon, CA",149,19,1,1.0,10/24/2013,Have eaten here several times. The food is overpriced and the service is mediocre. they always seem to be crowed and you generally have to wait at least 30 min.
Brett L.,"Portland, OR",35,113,18,3.0,5/21/2012,"This is one of those places that could easily be a 4 or even a 5 star review but just didn't quite make it there because of the overall atmosphere set by the staff. First, if you are going to have your staff dress in white, make sure it is a crisp clean white. The crew as a whole, other than the hostess was kind of dingy and frumpy.  Never once, other than tableside, did I see the staff smiling. The two female bartenders looked like they were moments away from shooting themselves in the face. Rarely have I encountered such a dour group of people in one spot. No one looked happy to be there, even though it is a beautiful restaurant  and one would imagine, a nice place to work. What should have been a fun experience, was just kind of depressing. If you are in upper management of Cheesecake Factory and you are reading this, take a look at the faces of the people working here. They are not happy. On to the better part of my experience, beer and food. I had the Salad Rolls and the Artichoke hearts and a nice cold IPA by Ninkasi. Salad rolls weren't the most beautifully crafted, but they tasted fresh and the accompanying peanut sauce was good as well. The Artichoke hearts were my favorite part of my visit. I didn't care for the baslamic dipping glaze, but the aioli was a nice addition."
Nasim J.,"Portland, OR",0,13,,1.0,7/20/2015,"I was excited to dine there since they had outdoor seating and I had never eaten there before. We asked to sit outside since I have a small dog. They sat us and after 5 min they asked us to change our seats.  We did so, then a few min later they asked us to leave because I had my 3lb dog with me sitting outside!! We told them we are with a small dog before we ask to be seated! So unprofessional and rude. They didn't even ask if the dog is a service dog!"
Sean M.,"Hillsboro, OR",11,24,9,1.0,7/11/2013,This review is over a year old since visit but I have not been back since.  Never again nope this place sucked.  We ordered some edamame and the potstickers.  We got the potstickers and then 5 mins later got the edamame.  5 mins after that we got our entrees.  I ate mine but my waife was eating the edamame because it doesn't tend to reheat well.  The waitress didn't even ask what was wrong when my wife asked for a box when almost the entire plate of food was still there.
Pink A.,"Portland, OR",9,7,2,3.0,6/25/2012,"Service was awesome but the 3 stars is due to the quality of food. I had the fish tacos - it came with 4 tacos that I asked to get half tempura fried and the others grilled. I enjoyed the grilled better than the tempura, it was too oily and left a oily coating in my mouth. Not the best fish tacos I've had...could have been better."
Mark S.,"Portland, OR",107,135,33,3.0,8/4/2013,"Large display of cheesecakes, little on the pricey side. We have only been here once in all the years of walking past it. It might be a good place to take an out of town guest or gift card but other than that there is no need for us to go back."
Joyce O.,"Portland, OR",87,42,68,4.0,2/18/2014,"Busy busy busy.. But the cheesecake, so worth the wait! :)"
Jena L.,"Oregon City, OR",36,147,79,4.0,2/16/2012,"For a chain, they do a pretty darn good job with the food.  Especially when you consider the GIGANTIC menu -- seems like it would be the death of most places, having so many different and diverse foods, but CF handles it pretty well. Portions are HUGE.  You don't eat off of dinner plates -- you eat off of serving platters.  Good luck having any room left at the end for actual cheesecake. There is almost always a wait.  A long wait.  Once you're in though, the service is good.  In particular, our last server Angel did a stellar job.  Had the patience of a saint!  Hopefully her manager reads this.  ;) The goods: Chicken Madeira Vietnamese Tacos Hibachi Steak Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes (I think that's what they're called) The looked good when I saw other people order them: Shepard's Pie Chicken & Dumplings Salads Pass on: The mixed drinks.  I've had a couple and they are not that good and definitely overpriced."
