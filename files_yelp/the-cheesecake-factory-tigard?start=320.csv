Nancy L.,"Beaverton, OR",179,60,2,4.0,5/6/2011,"This place is popular for good reason.  The presentation is great, the service is always spot on and the desserts are excellent.  The only downside is that it sacrifices quality for quantity.  However, the food is consistently good. So, it's great to go and split an entree and dessert with another person.  It seems pointless to order two entrees because leftovers from any restaurant hasn't been my bag. We went for happy hour and had $5 appetizers, which were nice.  I loved the crab wontons, but I've had better salad rolls.  Anyway, I'll go back, we had a fun time and I enjoyed the time with my girlfriend."
Matt R.,"Portland, OR",43,44,4,4.0,2/11/2012,"Although this location adjoins to the mall, you'll forget all about that as you step inside.  The interior of the restaurant made me feel like I was back in Vegas. I really enjoyed the ""buffalo blasts"" for my appetizer. Chicken and cheese stuffed inside some delicious breading and deep-fried, with spicy buffalo sauce and/or blue cheese dressing to dip them in. The sauce was flavorful and not overwhelming, although I can always handle (and enjoy) the heat. Delicious. For the entree, I was served crusted chicken romano, with pasta underneath in a light red sauce. Very filling and no hint of being microwaved. Then....the cheesecake. Oh, the cheesecake. A slice of Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake was the perfect ending to the meal.  The only downer was my seat. Usually when I go to a restaurant, a booth is my preferred place to sit. We were instead put at a table, one side with a chair, the other with the cushioned booth. You know what I'm talking about. I took the chair. Oops. Mistake of the day. I like space when I'm eating, and I did not get space. Crammed in tight with nowhere to move. It didn't distract me much from the meal though. This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory, and it won't be my last. Great food!"
Jeremy P.,"Fairview, OR",0,3,,4.0,4/3/2016,"I've heard a great deal about the cheesecake warehouse, how awesome the food is and whatnot. Well after waiting for a table(which isn't a problem) the table was still dirty and then our hostess disappeared and the guy sent to clean the table was snotty about telling us we had to be seated by the front desk. After we explained to him we were, he was even snottier. So that's the end of the bad stuff. As soon as our actual waitress started helping us, our experience was amazing. The avocado egg rolls were so flavorful and delicious. My wife had the veggie burger and I had the California avocado salad. Both were very well prepared and extremely flavorful. Now to the finisher. What we came for. What the Cheesecake Factory hangs it hat on, the cheesecake. I had the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake, and my wife had some kind of chocolate chocolate super chocolate cheesecake.  We decided it was so good that the next time we eat here we will order to go and recommend it to everyone who asks."
Missy C.,"Fort Myers, FL",90,128,538,5.0,6/1/2011,"The Godiva chocolate cheese cake is fantastic. It's really rich so you may want to cut smaller portions. We purchased the 7 "" thinking it would only have a piece or 2 left over.  We were wrong.  We had 1/2 the cake left.  It is my favorite of all the cheesecakes I have tried. I will say this... they are expensive, but well worth the money.  You can purchase single slices for around $7.50 a slice.  They are large and come with fresh wipped cream."
Mike W.,"Portland, OR",6,23,1,2.0,2/2/2011,"I guess you just have to check your expectations at the door and they will be more or less met. The mall gives me the scabies. This is my problem. I was needled into being there because my iPhone needed service which means I am loping around the mall waiting for the one genius at the genius bar to free up his time (that's another story). A man craves a beer in a mall. In Tigard. Panic? Shame spiral? AA? In a fit of all three I found myself in the CF right as happy hour ended, so the bar was packed with check payers. Not a seat in the house. After a few minutes the whole place cleared out and I grabbed a seat while the bussers and servers and barman tidied up the remaining service gear. I even got a, ""thank you for your patience, sir,"" from the busser as he ragged off the bar surface. I received a prompt, cold delicious beer selected from the bar menu that has no prices on it, which is but a minor annoyance. Ahh, sweet relief. Check the old iPhone and...oh yeah. Then the smell of old bar rag and vinegar starts to waft around and I know that rag has been in use since the Nixon administration. This happens. I get it, but things are going down. The restaurant is filling up and the bar has a few customers now, but our barman seems to have it under control. Then: abject horror. I hear the bar tape clack clack clack for what seems like a minute. The bartender fills up three blenders with about ten scoops of ice cream and all sorts of other nonsense. Martini glasses are being rimmed with blue sugar. The remaining bar seats are filling up. my beer is getting empty.  Why is this guy alone behind this bar working as service bartender to the entire restaurant as well as hosting the 15 people in front of him? Ice cream? The man should be in tears. It takes me 20 minutes to get my check and go because my man is so in the weeds I can feel and smell his anxiety. People at the bar are screaming out their orders like they are yelling across bleachers for hotdogs and beer at a ballgame. The barman just slouches a bit and exhales, head lowered as if maybe we will all go away and he will wake up somewhere else. Somewhere without blended drinks and people carrying bags from Hot Topic and the lego store, smelling of fruity soaps and wild, designer impostor perfume. Somewhere without vibrating hostess call beepers. Somewhere else.  I feel your pain, barman. Get out."
Laura D.,"Wilsonville, OR",27,199,164,5.0,12/29/2011,"I actually doubt I will go here often, and I don't think I'm quite their target audience, but I was still very impressed. The selection is *huge*, if a little spendy, and in spite of a lot of their stuff being something I can't eat right now (I will be so glad when I can have dairy again, even with pills!), I was able to find plenty of good options. Because of the selection - if I had it to do again I'd review the menu online before going. Oops! I didn't like having to have the stroller away from our table and just set the carry-basket on the bench, but they were polite and helpful about it and I must agree that the available space they have would *not* work with the stroller parked at the table, not in the least. (I prefer not to set the basket on any raised surface, but it really was well-settled on the bench with the table helping keep it in place. And obviously the floor was a worse option.) The decor is beautiful, and I was astonished we didn't have to wait to be seated, considering we walked in during the brunch rush the Sunday before Christmas. The food was tasty; even my (finicky) toddler liked his meal. The portions are utterly huge - I saw people with ""appetizer"" salads that would be a whole meal for me. I ordered from the light menu and was stuffed even so - I'd have taken half a regular meal home, maybe more. The staff were incredible. Very helpful, very on top of things, very friendly and polite - just excellent service. We were actually seated while the ""regular"" server for our area was on his lunch break, and when he came back on, he immediately circulated all his tables making sure a) we had what we needed and b) we knew what he looked like to flag him down if we needed him. (Basic courtesy, but basic courtesy that is not always seen!) Also, the waitress who helped us while he was on break made sure we knew which page the Sunday brunch was on. My husband was sad to be so full he couldn't even face the dessert menu. (I would be, but their specialty is so far off my diet right now, I would be sad just looking at it.) Gorgeous decor, convenient location, good staff. High prices but lots of food for the high prices - it largely balances out. :)"
Heather M.,"Portland, OR",0,11,,2.0,11/6/2012,"I have heard rave reviews about this place so we decided to try it, and were sorely disappointed.  We arrived at 6pm on a Sunday evening, and had to wait for over an hour for a table. Once we were seated, it continued to go downhill. It is so loud, it was difficult to relax or communicate without shouting. It is so dark, it is really hard to read the menu.  While we were having our pre-dinner bread, we noticed that my spoon had food crusted on it, as did one of the plates. When presented to the waiter, his attitude was uncaring and he seemed annoyed by our concern.  The menu, while expansive is very random and the food choices are not paired well. For example, several dishes included a starch but not a vegetable. When we asked if my salmon came with a vegetable, the waiter simply said ""no"" and did not even offer any suggestions. Spaghetti did not include a salad, and once again no input from the waiter other than ""no"". The waiter told us that the items on the ""regular"" menu came in gigantic portions. However, the only things that were large were the plates and cheap starches such as potatoes and noodles. The meat and veggies were very very small portions.  Food was OK, but obviously prepackaged and reheated. Service was average at best, but we were forced into paying a 18% gratuity. We asked for the bill to be split between 3 credit cards, and the waiter had a lot of difficulty managing that. The cheesecake was good, but that is about it!"
Ben S.,"Washougal, WA",0,4,,1.0,8/9/2014,We have been going to this location for over 3 years regularly. Today is the first time we received extremely bad service. Frederick our server was glad that we received bad service. Amazing!!Very disappointed. Talked to manager and he said he will talk to server.
Sarah B.,"Beaverton, OR",0,12,,3.0,6/1/2015,"Place is a chain and is what you expect. Food is pretty good, a little over priced. Always busy, mostly because of location, the food is pretty standard chain Italian food, but decent. If you are in the mall, try it, if you are in search of good food, don't go to far out of your way!"
Jim E.,"Vancouver, WA",31,20,1,2.0,4/7/2013,"I don't get this place, while the cheesecake is good- to wait 40 to 50 minutes for just so so food is beyond me. It's rather expensive as well.  There are better options out there. I've eaten here 3 times and can not fathom why this place is so popular"
Dmitriy K.,"Camas, WA",54,63,7,5.0,1/27/2014,"BEST CHEESECAKE IN THE CITY!!! Get any cheesecake, you won't be sorry. The cheesecake is so soft, light, and creamy. Love this place and highly recommended!!!"
Mike G.,"Gaston, OR",0,11,,4.0,1/21/2014,"Easily my favorite big restaraunts in the area. I've had many items from thier menu and almost all of them were homeruns. The only negative was that once we went, my meal came with mashed potatoes and there was a blue string in the potatoes, probably from one of the dish towels. Nedless to say the meal was free."
Jen E.,"Beaverton, OR",280,264,97,3.0,1/8/2014,so I love the food.....if you have not tried the avocado egg rolls..... you have not lived...not really. the menu has a little of everything and if you cant find something that sounds good then it is quite possible that you are not from this world. The only draw back is the acoustics. When it is packed it is almost deafening especially if the music is on. I would avoid coming here during peak hours as you will have a long wait..... but that is only because the food is that good. avocado egg rolls people......avocado egg rolls
Amy B.,"Tualatin, OR",21,4,,4.0,11/14/2013,The new parmesan garlic bread and Chile Rellenos are great. And the beet salad is always my fave.
Lucas Z.,"Hillsboro, OR",10,20,1,4.0,12/4/2011,"long wait time.....as always here!  We waited about 40 minutes to get a table for 2.  Once seated our server, Jasmine, came up and took our order for drinks and apps.  I ordered a Martini and the wife a raspberry martini.  We asked for reccomenditions on apps and our server was VERY helpful and offered MANY suggestions.  We ended up getting the chicken Samosas. Our appetizers ended up arriving before our drinks from the bar.  The appetizers were DELICIOUS! After our appetizers and bread arrived our server came back with our drinks from the bar and asked if we were ready to order..... We were.   I ordered a chicken mazarella dish (sorry can not remember the name but it was the first one on the menu under the chicken section).  My wife had a cobb salad.  After a short wait our food came and it was outstanding as well!  Good flavor and textures, not much to complain about here! I would have to say the only thing I would have to complain about is the prices were slightly higher than I would have thought.  I know the prices are posted on the menu and the portions are generous.  However, when my bill came and our martini's were $10.50 each that raised my eyebrows! All in all a good experience and great food."
Megan S.,"Pasco, WA",18,327,37,4.0,4/5/2011,"Five stars for the cheesecake, 1 star for the food, 4.5 stars for service.  Our server was very pleasant and knowledgeable. Our sodas were never empty. He was prompt to offer extra bread and to bring our check.  We ordered a Pulled Pork Sandwich and a Chicken Parmesan Sandwich. Both were...weird. I could only eat the fries that came with the Pulled Pork sandwich (pretty good fries) because I couldn't choke down the sandwich. The pork tasted like turkey and had an odd texture. My fiance liked it, so he ate it for lunch the next day. I tried a bite of his Chicken Parmesan. Yuck, the bread was soggy and there was some weird flavor combinations in there.  Next time, I'll definitely order the pasta (which is good) with my Red Velvet Cheesecake.  I wish they had sampler platters for the cheesecake."
Kal C.,"Portland, OR",143,601,438,4.0,8/10/2011,"Had a FABULOUS meal here.  I haven't been since I frequented the location back home in Green Valley. We will be coming here a lot after last night's meal. We both got the filet mignon - his medium-rare, mine medium. Both were cooked perfectly. I substituted the french fries (with filet mignon, really?!) for sauteed spinach. The menu is huge, and everything sounds delicious. I was upset to find they got rid of the bruschetta. I loved it.  :( But they bring you delicious sourdough baguettes with butter. Good enough. The filet mignon was amazing. Best steak I've had in years. No joke. I was surprised. Then we HAD to get cheesecake to go. I got the pineapple upside down cheesecake (for the love of food, get this!), he got the Oreo cheesecake. I'm not a fan, but it's popular. The interior reminds me of a casino in Vegas. Am I alone in thinking this?"
Robin S.,"Ashland, OR",53,81,21,4.0,9/8/2011,Usually I frown upon such an extensive menu because it tends to result in sloppy unfocused dishes.  Such is not the case at the cheesecake factory. Everything is awesome - especially the cheesecake.
Veruca S.,"Lynnwood, WA",27,181,101,4.0,9/6/2013,Ahhh...great way to beat the heat!
R S.,"Eugene, OR",4,71,,1.0,1/9/2013,"Please, just don't go here. Pick another place in the 'great food' city of PDX. The only reason why we went was because we were given a gift card. The food is total crap. Americanized, out of the freezer, greasy, unhealthy.. And, after we got home from dinner, we were both in the bathroom sick.. Not sure what food item made us sick, but we will never ever go back here, and never recommend this pace to anyone.."
