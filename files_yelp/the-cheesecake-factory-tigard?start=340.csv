Betsy B.,"Portland, OR",324,263,266,4.0,9/30/2010,"I love that I am so close to this wonderful place! Inside decor is fabulous, those lamps hanging from the ceiling must have cost a pretty penny. It's a bit dark, cold, and loud inside and some of the food can be a bit greasy. But overall food quality is very very good and fresh, and the atmosphere is just splendid. The menu is freaking huge and the cheesecake selection is naturally impressive as expected. The portion sizes are also generous. They clean the shrimp so I don't have to eat shrimp veins and shrimp poo like some places expect me to. Nice. Outside seating, yey! Service is pretty much consistently very good. I feel at home here, this is my kinda place. One star removed due to not taking reservations, being louder and darker than I like, and not offering happy hour on weekends or later on weekdays. But then again the happy hour isn't anything special, it's just half off fried appetizers. No need to speed on over from work to make it before it's over, order better stuff from the yummy regular menu. Maybe someday they will offer tastier and healthier HH options. People like to put down the chains. I call them chain snobs LOL. But you know what!??! I LOVE chains. Yeah, that's right. Chains rule. That's why their all over, because they kick butt. Not all, but enough of them to justify their existence. Their usually consistent at least, whether you like what they offer consistently or not. P.S. I WANT to love the mom and pop businesses, I REALLY do, but many, (though not all of course) are disappointing to me. Why disappoint me!?!? Why when I want to love you so bad!!?!?"
Cristi Y.,"Baker City, OR",2,16,,4.0,9/30/2013,"Delicious mojito, friendly staff, great food, best cheesecake I've ever had! Four stars only because they would not accept a reservation when I called and once we arrived after a long trip we had to wait a long time for a table..."
James D.,"St George, UT",144,14,1,4.0,10/20/2013,"Great food, as always. Great service, as always. Great atmosphere, as always, except it was a little dark. And the cheesecake is divine, as always.  A little overpriced and I wish the cheesecake slices were bigger. Overall, a yummy experience."
Jim G.,"Hillsboro, OR",2,19,,5.0,10/8/2011,"The name does not say it all!! Sure they have an almost endless list of fantastic cheese cakes that will all make you wish mom cooked like that. They also have a real menu of great food. They have chicken, seafood etc. Not just cheese cake! One big surprise was the Kobe Beef burger. Being a burger freak I had to get it and it was great. I finished that up with a Red Velvet Cheese Cake. Oh yea! That hit the spot!! I highly recommend this place. Be prepared to wait. I have never had less than a 45 minute wait."
Kathy L.,"Vancouver, WA",1,5,,4.0,9/8/2013,"Cheesecake, YUM! Food, always good every time. This is a chain restaurant so I do expect the food taste to be consistent, which it is. The servers we get have always been very friendly and accommodating. LOVE the Avocado Rolls. My favorite is the Steak Diane & Shrimp Scampi, it never fails me."
Conrad T.,"Downtown, Portland, OR",0,35,3,4.0,8/12/2013,Good food and good cheesecakes. I've been told different things by employees about if they take reservations. But on Fridays and Saturdays you want to come at least 15-20 minutes before you want to sit down because there's always a wait.
W S.,"Portland, OR",15,21,,2.0,4/28/2014,"Went here to meet a friend. Wait help was so surly I vow never to return. They were very busy, that's true. It is no excuse for not being pleasant to deal with.  They may never realize the effect of poor treatment of a customer. I have many choices of where to go to eat. This will not be one of them."
Jan A.,"Vancouver, WA",15,81,,3.0,6/21/2011,"HaHa!  Cheesecake factory, with the portion sizes big enough for a week's worth of meals. HUGE-est menu, ever. Yum-OH cherry cheesecake. pffftttttt.......wait time.  forget it.   .....but i really want that cheesecake!  ;) ;) ;) an experience to experience."
Zy X.,"Portland, OR",19,56,,4.0,7/6/2013,"My first visit to a Cheesecake Factory was years ago in Chicago. I always remembered a good experience of reasonable good food and an overwhelming selection of delicious cheesecakes!  I've been to the Portland/Tigard location several time since they opened. As some people indicated, I've also experienced the long wait to get seated. However, our wait today was only 15-minutes for two people! Although I haven't returned to a Cheesecake Factory for two years, things hasn't changed. The decor remained the same, as well as the superb service, good food, and overwhelming selection of cheesecake.  Oh yea, today I ordered The Navajo (sp?) sandwich. It has a lettuce, tomato, breaded fry chicken, and avocado with seasoned mayo. This sandwich was very delicious! I highly recommend!"
Larry C.,"Portland, OR",0,1,,2.0,11/1/2014,"I have really enjoyed the service and food every time me and my wife have had lunch or dinner, but yesterday we were very disipointed with are food that was brought to are table because it was not hot only warm, are waiter was very pleasant and even told me to be careful because my plate has hot. Sorry I have to complain but we expected a better experance!"
Glenn L.,"Maple Valley, WA",3,41,6,1.0,9/24/2012,Wife got food poisoning at this location when we last visited Portland.  Spent that night and the next day praying to the porcelain god.  Will never go back to any Cheesecake Factory.
Glaciala A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,830,,3.0,5/13/2013,"This Cheesecake was fine, I feel that they generally all feel pretty similar. Solid service and really nice waiter. Ahi tuna roll was fine, but nothing spectacular."
Misty B.,"Portland, OR",60,120,16,4.0,4/21/2011,"My husband and I were at the mall on Friday dropping our macbooks off at the Apple store. Decided to hit up Cheesecake Factory if the wait wasn't long. We only waited about 2 minutes for a table. It was about 2pm, the place was busy but no line at all. Our server was an absolute sweetheart. She doted on my 16 month old son, brought him out a plate of sliced bananas and thinly sliced bread to keep him occupied while we waited for our food.  The food was good. We ordered a few appetizers to share. The Vietnamese tacos were delicious. I thought I would like the avocado rolls more than I actually did. Don't order them unless you plan to eat them all on the same day. Having avocado in them, they obviously don't make good leftovers. We split the Farmhouse Cheeseburger. It came with pork belly instead of bacon. I heart pork belly. It was a damn good burger. All in all, good food, great service. I'm sure we'll be back again sometime."
Jennifer P.,"Portland, OR",4,33,,5.0,2/11/2011,"We had lunch there today. We split the chicken avocado club with sweet potato fries. My husband had the sweetened iced green tea and I had lemonade. We finished it up with a slice of classic cheese cake. It was all delicious. Their tea was amazing, the lemonade was exquisite! The sandwich was huge and perfectly done and all of the fixings were very fresh. Our sweet potato fries were warm and yummy. The cheesecake was, of course, to die for! Our waitress was really fun and personable as well! Definitely recommend this place! But either come hungry or split a dish!"
Mr. O.,"Sacramento, CA",9,303,14,1.0,6/23/2010,"Same old cheese cake factory corporate formula: nice surroundings, happy workers, food full of sugar, fats and sodium. Pay through the nose here if you can't find a decent mom and pop restaurant nearby. Did I mention the wait. Not worth it."
Jacob M.,"Portland, OR",98,330,51,5.0,3/22/2013,"I llooovvveee me some Cheesecake Factory.  For a chain, they have such an amazing menu and delicious cocktails.  I was VERY pleased with the staff here as well."
Darlene H.,"Klamath Falls, OR",0,46,,5.0,5/11/2011,"First off, I want to declare that I am not a huge, flag waving fan of chain restaurants.   So now that you liberal ""I can't stand chains"" loonies are off me, here we go. I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory, was not overly excited to go, because I would generally rather try the local flair.  But I was with co-workers and majority rules, and for the most part, I am up for anything once.   We went on a Thursday evening, were quoted a 20 minute wait which was about 3 minutes.   I had the Ultimate Margarita that our fabulous waitress Nicole suggested.  I am glad I took her advice, this was well balanced, not too boozy, just a nice drink.  Sure, you pay for it, but I paid $8 for a lousy beer at an airport bar, so this is small potatoes. We had a couple apps, the ahi tuna and the artichoke dip.   I am not a big fan of tuna or artichoke, but I liked these, so they must have been OK. I bought into the hype and tried the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.   When the server set it down, I thought I made a horrible mistake.  I like spicy, but the first scent notes were FIRE IN THE HOLE!   But while I waited for the other entrees to be delivered, the aroma toned down, so I dove in.   Well done, but not the ""our #1 dish"" I was expecting.  Hype, ya know.    I tried the Steak Diane off another plate and it was the best bite of beef I have tasted in a long time.   Just lovely. We ordered cheesecake, I think there is a law that this is required.  Both the banana and the chocolate something something scrumptiousness were fantastic.  I suspect it is hard to get a bad dessert here.  What topped off the meal for me was our lovely server Nicole.  She quickly assessed that this was a table she could have a good laugh with and RAN with it.  We loved her!   She was quick witted, skilled at her craft and gave amazing service.    I would go back, certainly."
Jennifer M.,"Portland, OR",0,14,1,1.0,5/4/2014,"Okay we waited for two hours they said max one. Now before you think who on earth waits 2 hours let alone one for a chain food it was my neices 16th bday and she likes the place. Well Todd one of the  manger is an ego mantic rude dbag. He treated my Dad so rudely that our party of 15 will never come again. Even my neice said the cheese cake lost it's flavor due to the managers crap attitude. Sad times, a fun birthday party turned into a stressful experience. : ("
Ann K.,"Hillsboro, OR",10,172,9,4.0,12/27/2010,"Date Visited: Monday 12/27/10 (Lunch) I thought arriving at the Cheesecake Factory around 2 p.m. would mean no wait, but I was mistaken.  Apparently, the Monday after Christmas means tons of shoppers eating at all hours.  So, we had a 20-minute wait, which wasn't really bad.  The problem is that they don't guarantee the little buzzers will work outside the door of the restaurant, so you can't walk down to Sephora or something and browse while you wait for a table to open up. Anyway, we were seated and asked what we'd like to drink.  Our teas were brought along with bread/butter.  I wanted a nice casual meal and definitely didn't feel rushed at all on this particular visit.  Spazz got the hummus as an appetizer and I was surprised by the massive bowl of hummus delivered.  The bread was stacked beside the bowl.  I ate some of the hummus with the bread (not the pita bread).  Delicious.   We both ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (lunch-sized portions are $10.95 as opposed to the dinner-sized $13.95 portions).  I've ordered this dish nearly every time I've gone to Cheesecake Factory.  For some reason, this time was the absolute best I've had it.  It was FULL of pasta, sundried tomatoes, broccoli, eggplant, pine nuts, peppers, and kalamata olives.  I didn't feel like I ran out of anything before I was out of pasta, so it was perfect.   We mainly went here for lunch because we received a gift card for them.  In addition, we received 2 cards for free cheesecake.  Spazz is vegan, so it was up to me to pick a piece of cheesecake and bring it home.  I ended up getting one full of candy bar goodness and it's awesome!  I can't wait to go back."
Allan K.,"Hillsboro, OR",234,295,47,4.0,4/7/2011,"Don't know why, but I am always quite pleased after my meal at the Factory.  I ordered the meatloaf with Mash potatoes and it was simply delicious.  It's crowded, noises, but definitely worth it!"
