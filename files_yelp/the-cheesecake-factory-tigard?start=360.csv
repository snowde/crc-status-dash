Sean A.,"Portland, OR",58,155,61,3.0,5/24/2014,"Normally I'm a bit more forgiving, but this visit was a bit off.  We came in to treat ourselves for a very hard working week.  Came in early afternoon, and waited 15 minutes, not bad for CCF.  While our server was on top of things at first, what seemed to be a shift change caused some problems.  Not all our food came out on time or together for that matter.  The shift manager apologized, but that was about it.  Once finished, we sat, for a while, till we finally got our server again.  She was asked to cover a shift for someone else and was trying her best to close out her current tables and cover another area across the restaurant.  While not her fault, it was not the best experience especially for how much we paid.  We even got dessert to go.  While in enjoy most of the menu, the place is rarely worth the long waits in addition to the expense.  If there was another location in town it might help."
Janie P.,"Portland, OR",2,12,,4.0,5/19/2013,"We went there after a piano recital just for dessert. The food was fantastic, but the place was kinda loud and too busy for what we really needed at the time. We chose 2 types of cheesecake to share - one with raspberry, one with chocolate. Very decadent!"
Jaime L.,"Hillsboro, OR",33,58,88,5.0,2/2/2011,"Not just cheese cake Large menu they have everything from classic Chinese dishes to Mexican favorites and everything in between! Their cheese cake menu is a long list of mouth watering flavors, making it almost impossible to choose!"
Julie C.,"San Francisco, CA",90,387,1343,3.0,12/14/2010,"The wait is usually long during peak hours, but I love that it's inside Washington Square Mall.  It's close to all the great stores.  The Cheesecake Factory has good food which always has my coming back.  I love the Avocado Eggrolls and my all-time favorite drink is the Frozen Iced Mango.  I can go there anything for these 2 items.  Any of their salads are pretty good - all really filling though so I'd recommend to share.  The club sandwich is always a favorite... I'm not a big fan of the pastas - I found some to be a little bland and more carbs than I can handle."
Josh T.,"Hillsboro, OR",35,17,,3.0,2/9/2013,"Well, the food was good but nothing extraordinary. Overall a pretty good meal but I have a few major gripes.  First off, the menu. How large does it need to be? And many different cuisines?  What type of restaurant is this?  Italian? Burger joint?  Chinese?  Seafood?  Pizzeria? Pick a specialty and go with it. I'd can only imagine how they kitchen staff can prep for a service. With the menu so scattered, a feel like the quality goes down. Second gripe: lighting. I feel like I had to strain to see the person in front of me.  It was also kind of jarring to transition between the mall lighting and the restaurant lighting.  Last gripe:  the wait. Nearly an hour. It seemed a little excessive since the service and food were quick (one of the big pluses): the wait was probably due to people having too many choices on the menu.  Overall, not bad if you have time to wait and like lots of choices as well as moderately good food."
Hungry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",151,143,139,1.0,11/12/2014,found bug in my salad. quality check? showed it to Manager and his reaction was as if  he's seen this scenario a dozen times. while i love nature I don't want any crawling creatures in my food. GROSS and unsanitary.
Monica A.,"Portland, OR",75,199,174,4.0,12/14/2010,"Work in the area and love the ginormous menu they offer.  I am also loving that they have smaller portions available for those who's eyes are bigger than their stomach (which is me).  I like to order a couple of things and the smaller portion menu is fantastic.  If you order anything that's not 'small' be prepared to get oversize portions that is enough for two decent meals. I really like their bread with a side of their chipotle dressing.  Such a delicious combo, but watch the calories..... I also like their carside to-go. When the mall is swamped with cars and I'm too lazy to keep looking for parking-- it's the way to go."
Kendall M.,"Portland, OR",76,15,1,1.0,4/19/2012,"Overpriced, overrated, overcrowded. This place pretty much is everything I hate all rolled into one restaurant. There is always a wait no matter what time a day. The customer base is always those people who never get out and think the cheesecake factory is the definition of fine dining. The wait staff i appreciate though, memorizing that menu would be a nightmare."
Jacob G.,"Portland, OR",183,343,75,3.0,2/13/2010,"We actually went here because we expected a long wait for a table; had some time to kill and were hungry. This place might have a whole lot of marks against it: gargantuan food, way too many choices, in a mall. However, it's one of the only choices in the mall proper. Anyhoo. 20 minutes later, we were seated. It was about noon; guess that's a good time to get seated ""quickly."" Our waiter was a bit too enthusiastic, but service was good. He seemed excited that I ordered the Memphis Burger. this thing was actually a normal-sized burger with...um...barbecued pulled pork, cheese, cole slaw, and pickles. It was OK. Good thing they included some sauce on the side or there wouldn't have been much flavor without it. My girlfriend's ""lunch-sized"" salad was still gigantic, by the way. We couldn't resist the red velvet cheesecake. It was two red velvet cake layers with the usual cheesecake. It didn't blow me away, but it was still good. Can't come up with a end for this review other than I didn't die after eating at a *gasp* chain restaurant."
Sushane G.,"Beaverton, OR",0,20,2,5.0,8/2/2012,"First of all, the Cheesecake Factory is considered to be the ""Worst Restaurant in America"" in terms of nutrition-  .  But don't let that stop you from indulging in this heavenly place. The ambiance is nice, the service is nice, the seating options are nice (inside or outside- outside tables even have heaters!), and the wait is very moderate.  Only like 15 minutes and with the mall being right there, it was not a problem. I've had never really ""dined"" here in the sense that all I ever sat down and ate prior to Tuesday was the Cheesecake.  But on Tuesday, with Cheesecakes being half off and I having over $70 in gift cards, decided to sit down and experience the entire dinner.  And it was great.  The menu is huuuuge.  For the appetizer, I went with the fried avocado rolls, apparently one of their specialties, and it was awesome.  Very expensive, but truly something I'd never eaten before.  Tasted like a Chinese spring roll biting in but then immediately changed flavor to a more American taste.  For dinner, they have so many options that it's hard to decide what to get.  I was going to order from the Skinnylicious menu before I realized it's really the exact same thing as the normal menu except served in smaller portions, and hence cheaper.  So I ordered the normal veggie burger from the ""unhealthy menu"", probably having at least 800 calories, and it was delicious.  I also had some of the cheese pizza, which was excellent.   The desserts...  Before I even came, I knew was going to go with the cheesecake, but couldn't decide which one.  They are all extremely unhealthy, with some cakes having up to 1300-1500 calories in just one slice.  I didn't let that bother me and ultimately, I ordered the Godiva Cheesecake and split it.  It was a good thing I split it, because that thing was huge!  No one should be able to eat the entire thing after dinner and I'm not surprised it has that many calories.  For a four person family, you really only need two slices.  I also had some of the Tiramisu cheesecake, which was good, but nothing in comparison to the layered Godvida cake which was bursting with flavor.  I don't even remember what the layers were, but I remember it having a bottom brownie crust, a second layer consisting of cheesecake, actual Godiva chocolate in there somewhere, and topped with a bunch of whipped cream.   So yeah, excellent place.  And bill only came out to be $44 with tip for four people.  Pretty cheap considering we had no coupons.  Oh yeah, checked my weight the next day- not a single pound gained (hehe)."
Karey R.,"Portland, OR",97,216,22,5.0,10/14/2010,"Lots of vegetarian options.  Beautiful decoration.  Dining here is a real treat, great for celebrating special occasions."
Ruth W.,"McMinnville, OR",0,42,,5.0,12/30/2012,We just moved into the area about 25 miles south of here. Due to us looking for housing we have been in a hotel of course eating out. This has been the BEST experience we have had since we've been here in 2 months. The waitress Angelita was fantastic!  We asked for the mgr & let him know because it is so rare to have a waitress that is so pleasant.  We will be going back here & asking for her. Hopefully she will be there!
Alyssa H.,"Southwest Portland, Portland, OR",1,7,2,5.0,9/14/2013,I've always had great service every time I've gone. The food is beyond great and not to mention the cheesecake. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!
Dan S.,"Salem, OR",2,242,10,5.0,8/19/2010,"I know it's all cool to hate on The Fac (we're on a nickname basis), especially if you're a food snob, but if you want a tasty meal you can't go wrong here.  The menu is huge and covers about every major area: pasta, steak, seafood, chicken, salads, sammiches, pizza, etc, etc, etc. I've never been disappointed with anything I've had. I think the specialty chicken dishes are their best offerings. Do yourself a favor and try the Thai chicken pasta. The cheesecakes are of course amazing, and I've heard a rumor they have other desserts, but come on like you're not going to get cheesecake! Their key lime cheesecake may be the Greatest Thing on Earth. Service is always good and even though the place is packed during prime hours the food arrives quickly. And they're always happy to substitute sides or whatever else you need."
David G.,"Portland, OR",1,28,,3.0,12/24/2012,"MENU SIZE! Do you think Cheesecake Factory corporate is compensating for something? Too many items? Probably,but most of the appetizers and drinks are really good. I've been here many times and have not had a bad entree yet. I'm a salmon lover and their salmon dishes are very good.  My youngest  daughter and I stopped in a couple of weeks ago. We had   pasta dishes we enjoyed. It wasn't Italy, what do you want from Tigard.  Service is as expected. Atmosphere, big and loud."
Valerie Lynn M. M.,"Hagatna, GU",43,6,5,3.0,4/11/2010,"We don't come often and it's nothing against the food but mostly the crazy wait times. Contrary to some of the reviews here, it seems everyone in the Portland metro wants to be at the Cheesecake Factory because the waits are pretty long. Aside from that the food is pretty tasty. Our favorites are the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo and the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. I've also had several of their appetizers including the Egg Rolls, Calamari, and the Spinach Cheese Dip, but not at this particular location, it was one in California. Either way i've never been dissappointed with my food. There's much to choose from on the menu which can be rather overwhelming for some. And the Red Velvet Cheesecake was yummy!!!"
Hideo M.,"San Jose, CA",83,110,56,2.0,4/25/2012,"Even though there's a Cheesecake Factory where I live, I decided to eat here since it was late and just flew in to the area. I had a combination of Herb Filet of Salmon and Steak Diane with sautéed spinach. I asked for the steak to cook rare but it was overcooked and served at medium-well. The steak was tough and dry. Since it was late and the server wasn't around to check up on us, I just accepted it as it was. Fortunately, the Salmon was good but the lemon sauce was quite heavy and overly buttery."
Vicki C.,"Portland, OR",0,8,,2.0,10/10/2014,"Food is average and portions are HUGE-- if that is what you're looking for.  My meal could feed 3 people and I was so bored and tired of eating it that I didn't want to bring the left overs home.    Offer half portions, pay more attention to quality."
Brian I.,"West Linn, OR",62,256,33,4.0,7/25/2010,"The architecture of the interior of The Cheesecake Factory, to me, feels distinctly like I'm in a buffet at any casino in Las Vegas.  Huge, soaring ceilings with unnecessarily intricate artwork, carefully planned lighting - everything you'd expect from said casino.  I definitely prefer more intimate settings, but CF gets away with it. We started with the corn fritter appetizer, and honestly I wasn't expecting much.  They exceeded expectations.  Sweet little fried balls of corn/batter goodness with some kinda tangy/salty dipping sauce. I had the fried shrimp platter, which includes several nicely fried jumbo shrimp, fries and some cole slaw.  The shrimp were prepared exactly to my liking, they were crispy, fresh and tasty.  I didn't particularly care for the fries, but I really enjoyed the cole slaw.  Crisp, tangy and a nice way to clean your palate between bites of shrimp. Mrs. Brian I. had the vegetable salad, minus cheese, dressing on the side.  This is a giant freaking salad, and she was entirely happy with it.  The veggies were fresh and crisp. Semi-unrelated: I find CF's website hilarious.  You're ""greeted"" by this animated server that explains various aspects of the restaurant.  The way they've animated her is... acceptable, but her movements remind of the strippers in the original Duke Nukem game.  Kinda jerky, strangely robotic animation.  Hilarious. Back on topic: CF gets an extra star from me for 2 reasons.  First, they have Mac & Jack's African Amber on tap - one of my absolute favorites and seemingly a rarity around town.  Second, for our server, Jen.  I'm really picky about ordering shrimp.  If it's not cleaned/deveined then I have a real problem with it.  When I asked her if the shrimp on the platter were cleaned and deveined I wasn't expecting her to know.  However, she immediately responded ""Yes, they're cleaned, deveined, breaded and fried in-house"".  I was thoroughly impressed. I recognize why CF has averaged 3 stars over the course of it's reviews.  I think they deserve a 4th star because the place is simply ""working as intended""."
James D.,"Tigard, OR",0,2,,5.0,6/19/2013,Don't come here if you starving since there is always a wait. Don't come here starving either since they serve dinosaur portions for everything. Great HH too.
