Erin O.,"Camas, WA",7,70,12,4.0,9/14/2010,"Stopped in and grabbed a quick lunch with a friend.  Be forewarned - this place has become popular on Saturdays for baby/wedding showers and birthdays in general.  How does that affect you - well, they take up large tables and stay and stay and stay.  Which means as the masses come in - you wait and wait and wait.  It was 1:30 and we had a 20 min wait.   The menu is like a book (which I like) - it has something for everyone.  Pasta, sandwiches, asian, italian, mexican, etc etc.  Which probably goes back to explaining why large groups eat here - everyone should be able to find something they like.   I have yet to have a meal that is not good - is it jaw dropping amazing?  No, it is solid good food.  Huge portions, enough for lunch the next day or to share with a friend and start with an appetizer.  My friend and I usually order something we both may like and give the extra to the other for the next day just to mix it up.  Works great with sandwiches or just asking for a extra plate beforehand and putting the portion on it before you start eating with your own utensils LOL One more thing - it is loud and kind of dark.  Lots of kids - definitely not a romantic lunch or dinner."
Ronn C.,"Roseburg, OR",52,264,859,5.0,9/5/2011,"My only experience with Cheese Cake Factory is that Penny works there from the Sitcom ""Big Bang Theory"".  While in Tigard an opportunity came up to give it a try.  I was really impressed with the pasta dish I ordered.  I had the chicken chipotle penne pasta.  The dish was very creamy with a hint of spiciness.  I like my food VERY spicy, so I thought it could have been more so, but for the average ""Julie or Joe"" it was probably just right.  They had some excellent table bread that's served warm with butter on the side.  The service is top notch, and of-course the dessert was awesome too.  I had the coconut cream cheese cake."
Buzz F.,"Redding, CA",143,295,40,1.0,7/23/2009,"Tigard must be where all of the conservative Republicans who don't live in Portland go to be suburbanites.  Avoid Washington Square Mall and the Cheescake Factory within if you can, people.  The huge servings of mediocre food are a metaphor for and microcosm of the mall as a whole. Our bored, detached, careless Russian immigrant waitress had the vacant, cold, no-soul-behind-the-sky-blue-eyes stare of an assassin (which, frankly, was the most appealing aspect of my dining experience).  The order took forever, and the food came out well before the drinks.  My enormous Caesar salad tasted better than cattle silage, so two big thumbs up for that huge accomplishment. I ordered an amber ale and got a heffeweisen.  Not exactly a disaster in itself -- I didn't even bother to send it back -- but wholly in keeping with the overall experience of cumulative ineptitude."
Ryan X.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,9,,4.0,8/26/2012,"Their lunch menu is less expensive than the dinner menu and is still a large amount of food. Sure, they are known for their cheesecake, but I like and recommend their huge hot fudge sundae.  Big enough for two people."
Elise T.,"Palo Cedro, CA",4,20,,1.0,7/23/2009,"I hate malls, but the purchase of many Apple products made a visit necessary.  After spending over an hour in the Apple store we were hungry.  This mall has very few sit down choices outside of the food court, so we settled on CF.  I really don't get the appeal of this place.  The food was mediocre:  my wilted lettuce French farm salad, Hanna's boring pasta sauce, Steve's bland caesar salad.  The service was crappy - our food, all of it, came out before our drinks, even after reminding our server that we were waiting for them.  And the ambience -- Vegas casino meets Olive Garden.   My recommendation: Only go here if you need drinks to take the edge off of the whole mall experience and be prepared to wait."
Stephanie H.,"Portland, OR",3,25,24,2.0,7/4/2013,"This was our 2nd trip to this Cheesecake Factory location.  Our first time there was shortly after they had opened and it was a poor experience.  We attributed that to the fact they were still working out the kinks of a new place.  We finally came back to give it a 2nd chance after receiving a gift card.  It was on the 4th of July and it was surprisingly not busy.  There was no wait and since it was really nice outside we sat on the patio.  This location is nicely decorated and well kept.  The waitress who took our order was very nice and friendly.  She brought us our drinks and bread very fast.  We had a calamari appetizer and it was really great.  The dipping sauce was super.  My sons both ordered burgers.  My husband had the Factory Burrito Grande and I had the Hibachi Steak.  The burrito and the steak arrived promptly but the burgers did not.  We waited about 5 minutes for them to appear after the adults had already been served.  I absolutely hate when restaurants do that.  Bring everyone's main dish at the same time please, or at least say here's part of your table I'm sorry the rest will be out real soon.  Don't just leave us hanging.  Anyhow the burrito was cold and so was my steak.  I'm guessing they had already been sitting back there for awhile.  I cut into a piece of steak and it was completely raw I had ordered a medium rare.  I usually cook my steaks at home pretty rare but this was still ice cold in the center with just a sear on the outside.  Not good.  I hate sending things back but I just couldn't eat it raw.  The waiter who took over for our waitress was not too happy with me.  I guess he thought I was picky?  So after a few minutes it comes back and I swear they didn't do a darn thing to it.  I ended up just having it boxed up.  Never going back.  If we get a gift card again we'll be using it on cheesecake only.   By the way if you go in for a whole cheesecake they will say it's been deeply chilled and will be ready to eat in 2 hours, that really means completely frozen.  At least that was delicious."
Tet W.,"Portland, OR",44,225,90,3.0,4/29/2012,"The food is good but a bit generic.  They have a wide selection of items including sandwiches, pasta, steaks, pot pies, salads, etc.  This is a nice place to grab a bite while shopping in the mall.  Food portions are very large as well as drinks.  It's a very noisy place, but the food service is good and they are prompt in getting your orders.  Their fresh baked bread is good, but nothing special. They have a wide variety of cheesecakes to choose from many of which you can't go wrong and worth trying."
Brent P.,"Gilbert, AZ",13,1,,5.0,12/11/2011,"Food is wonderful, atmosphere is wonderful, customer service is great!  I was having dinner with a group of 6.  Everyone's dinner came and mine didn't come until 4-5 minutes later.  A manager brought my plate out, apologized, and insisted on giving me a free piece of cheesecake.  That is the way to keep customers happy!"
Jack J.,"Portland, OR",10,90,4,1.0,8/20/2013,"I came in for lunch with my two children to the Beaverton location. Sarah B. was our server. From the start, she was not nice and had kind of ""attitude"" about her. Didn't say hi or introduce herself, just took our drink orders and left. Came back with our drink and took our order for lunch. I ordered a dish that is not cooked, my son order a hamburger and my daughter had fries only. She brought bread and then left again. After about 15 minutes I asked her where our food was. She said she would check. Never came back to say anything to me. Then 15 minutes later I started to get really mad. She would walk by us but never made eye contact with me. I finally caught her eye and then I think she knew at this point I was mad. Another girl brought out our food and I told her this is ridiculous waiting over 30 minutes for a burger and salad rolls. She said she didn't know anything about it and left. Then we ate and the manager came over and I told her what happened. The thing that got me mad is that Sarah B. never came over to ask us if everything was ok, nothing about why the food was so late, avoided me actually. My son ordered dessert but I told her I wasn't going to wait another 30 minutes. We paid and left. This whole thing ruined my day."
LindaLu N.,"San Francisco, CA",11,15,,4.0,5/29/2010,"if ya wonder why i keep giving out 4stars and more, why?! simple, why would i eat anywhere that's not good and tasty, waste my hardearned $$$.  Don't be silly, never will there be a time 4such an activity. First time in this area of Oregon, and boy did we have a superb time enjoying the fine weather, nice stay in nearby hotel, checked out Moto shops and yep found a few, 1 in particular of a fine ride that we wanna take back to Cali.   What do say about Cheesecake Factory?  This as y'll know is a chain of fine eatery with their trademark/landmark of amazing variety of cheesecakes like you won't believe.  Such a huge menu and handsome servings... love to come back for more anytime :)"
K R.,"Hillsboro, OR",4,37,202,3.0,3/18/2012,"I give them 3 stars.  It's rather a mixed review.  I've had overall decent service here, not too thrilled over the food, but o.k. once in a while.  However,  I recently went to pick up a late night craving for tiramisu cheesecake and the girl at the dessert counter was borderline rude.  It would be nice for management to teach their employees that the customers help pay their wages.  BTW, tiramisu cheesecake,  the BEST!!!!  Yummm, it gets the five *****."
Ziyad A.,"Portland, OR",16,72,10,3.0,9/23/2011,"Good restaurant. Specially If you planning on celebrating some event. Their dessert is amazing (obviously from its name). The only complain I have about this restaurant is the prices vs. food portions. Their food portions are really big. They can on the other hand decrease the price and the portion. Would be a good idea, i guess!"
Ashley F.,"Portland, OR",83,415,2,2.0,8/17/2009,"This is probably the biggest Cheesecake Factory I've been to, to-date. Lots of seatings and ceiling.  It's a cross between the Nile + Willy Wonka factory. It doesn't do much for my taste, but it works for them. I would skip the food and go directly to dessert, because, really, there's a reason why they called it Cheesecake Factory.  So many flavors, it's hard to stay away."
Lin N.,"Queens, NY",16,322,13,4.0,1/7/2012,"I'm a fan of CF and this location is on par with the other restaurants in the chain. Re: seating, I recommend requesting a booth if you want even the slightest bit of privacy, as the center seats (long booths) leave about 12"" between you and the person sitting next to you. If their conversation happens to be annoying or their kids are screaming or any other variety of annoying dining behaviors, there will be no way to avoid it. Save yourself! Request a booth."
Hayden N.,"Portland, OR",163,591,501,4.0,11/30/2011,"There's always an incredibly long wait at this place, but that's because it's always consistently good.  My guilty pleasure is the fried macaroni balls, I can't resist them when I come here.  I love the avocado eggrolls and miso salmon as well.  Yum!"
Nikee W.,"Woodburn, OR",62,346,57,4.0,12/10/2011,"I normally avoid eateries with 20 page menu's and cameos in Kanye West songs, but I make an exception for Cheesecake factory. There are things about this place that I dislike, like the long wait times and the tragically dumpy white pants they make the wait staff wear (no matter how good looking you are, those outfits suck). Overall, I'm not a big cheesecake fan either, which i realize is ironic.  The thing that keeps bringing me back here is the food. They make hands down the best lettuce wraps ever, and they have a never ending list of sauce options. I can also tell you with confidence that the tuna tartar and avocado rolls are winners. For a chain, they do an excellent job of keeping a consistently good menu. I've never had to send anything back or wished I had ordered something else. The prices are a bit high but you get about 3 meals worth of food on your plate. It's a great place for a date or a family gathering."
Taylor M.,"West Linn, OR",0,6,,5.0,3/3/2012,"I love it!! Yes it's cheesy and a chain but it's good!!! Red velvet is great if u feel like cheesecake, and reeses is great if your in more of a rich chocolate dessert!!"
B R.,"Portland, OR",0,81,8,5.0,3/17/2012,Happy hour menu is one of the best I have ever seen and service is great
Rocco D.,"San Diego, CA",0,63,,4.0,2/26/2012,I liked this place a lot.  The Shepherd's pie was excellent and was very big.  I had enough to take home with me and I eat a lot.  Overkill on the onions though.   The chocolate cheesecake was also good but kinda expensive.
Erin O.,"Portland, OR",0,12,2,1.0,5/29/2013,"Wait is intolerable. Bar seating is sparse. Busy. Hurried. Stressful. Not a fan of the food, either."
