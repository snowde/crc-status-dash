Tracey J.,"VANCOUVER, OR",1,38,,1.0,7/23/2017,"I have never heard anything positive about this restaurant, but it was a group dinner and since I'd never eaten there, I figured...cheesecake...it's my favorite. The place was packed, which is always a good sign, and the menu was abundant, so I ordered a steak and asked what the ""veg"" was that came with it...the waiter said, ""I believe it's either green beans or asparagus, do you have a preference?"" Why, yes, kind sir...I hate asparagus just a tad less than green beans, so let's go with that. The steak was ""meh."" I've actually had a better one at Denny's, and the mashed potatoes were VERY peppery, but still quite good. The asparagus was cooked in a way that doesn't disguise the fact it is asparagus, so that stayed on the plate. Cheesecake was fine, but not as good at Costco's cheesecake (you know what I'm talking about, people...Costco's is orgasmic).  Now, time for the bill. They up-charged me $1.50 for the asparagus. Oh, hell, no. Not only did you give me that as a choice, you NEVER mentioned an up-charge and then when I bring it to your attention, you ARGUE with me? Um, nope, I'm done."
Jennifer E.,"Woodburn, OR",45,5,,2.0,10/14/2017,We have been going to The Cheesecake Factory a few times a year since they opened. We have always had great service until tonight. We waited forever for our meal and was never checked on. Then a manager came out and apologized for the slow service but we still had to wait another 10 minutes for our food. We were not offered any kind of compensation for our long wait. So very disappointing!!! Plus our food wasn't even that good!
Pariah B.,"Portland, OR",81,13,3,2.0,4/24/2017,"Always a horrendous wait because no reservations or call-ahead seating accepted. The restaurant forces customers to sit and wait in its lobby for often 2 hour waits. Why? Once you finally get in after your 90-150 minute wait, the food is fantastic."
Jennifer H.,"Brightwood, OR",0,3,,3.0,12/8/2017,"I love The Cheesecake Factory, have been going here for years. I don't know what it is about this particular location at the Washington Square mall, but it was the very first place I ever had the powerhouse salmon salad which was extremely good. I have had it in Indiana as well and it was extremely good there. The last two times I've had it here at this particular location, was put together very quickly, hardly had any of the ingredients on it that was supposed to come with it. The dressing that they put on the side was very sparse. After I expressly told the server when I ordered it that I would like the dressing on the salad, as this was a kale Salad which is a lot better when the salad dressing is massaged into it. They've opened a new location in the happy Valley area so I'm looking forward to trying it there to compare."
Julie S.,"Hillsboro, OR",78,28,2,4.0,9/26/2017,"One of the best cheeseburgers I have ever had. A bit skimpy on the fries. TERRIFIC service. The cheesecake is quite good, too."
Lynne D.,"Portland, OR",33,4,,1.0,4/2/2017,"I knew there was a reason I hadn't been here for ten years. Went to brunch with 3 others. My egg dish was dry, over cooked and flavorless. The rest of my party were equally underwhelmed. Guess I'll wait 20 years this time. Nice server, though."
Niki H.,"Beaverton, OR",0,15,3,1.0,3/22/2017,"I was actually really disappointed with my first experience here. The shrimp scampi was recommended to me, since I'm a fan of seafood. It arrived, and the pasta was cold, the breading on the shrimp was soggy, and the sauce was a bit sour.  The server brought me mashed potatoes to make up for it. I ate one piece of shrimp, and maybe two bites of pasta. Extremely disappointed.  Will not recommend, and will not be coming back."
Michal G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",36,2,,5.0,6/13/2017,"I have went today to Cheesecake Factory in the Washington square and it was great experience after along time that I didn't been here.  The service was great, that food was delicious and the waitress was very lovely with my nephew!l. I am sure that I will be back again"
Mina A.,"Portland, OR",0,3,,3.0,8/30/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is one of our favorite restaurants between me, my sister, and my mom. The three of us would travel down from Portland OR to Washington Square just to eat at Cheesecake Factory. However the downfall to this is that me and my family tend to visit during their busy hours ( past 7-8 pm on weekends ) which usually have us waiting between 40 minutes or an hour just to get our table for 3 people. Depending if the mall is close or not, my family just buys time by shopping around the mall till the buzzer, buzzes us up. Service quality is quite nice but sometimes we would get a server who's not really on task. A man once forgot to give us our bread till our main course came out but he was giving other people their breads and helping them but did not bother to check on us and when we asked him to, to-go our cheesecakes he said he already told the front desk to have them in their boxes, but then they ended up bringing the cheesecakes in their plates and not in boxes.  But besides that one server who wasn't so great towards me and my family, the others who served us were great and nice. The restaurant serves many different type of food from salad, salmon, pastas, and sandwiches. Their cheesecakes, of course, are greatly made and taste very delicious! You must have one before you go."
Ranjana S.,"Portland, OR",28,67,64,4.0,10/25/2016,"Great place to dine-out ! FOOD: 3.5 star ,I have been to this place like 6 times so far.I love their complementary brown bread with butter.  APPETIZER:Our all time appetizer fav is crab cakes and avocado egg roll. we tried  chicken lettuce wrap once and didn't like it ,felt like it was missing the Asian touch ,PF changs  has better chicken lettuce wrap. ON TRAY: southwest chicken sandwich : always my fav -juicy chicken breast with slightly spicy sauce and avocado,love their fries too. Fish and chips: ok tasting, I can give 3 star on it.batter was too oily. Factory combination -steak Diane and herb crusted salmon: my husbands fav,He never missed to get this combo. baja chicken taco: 2 star , i did not like the flavor , not a Mexican style. they gave a green rice instead of Spanish rice. orange chicken: 2 star ,says uts sweet and spicy . its more sweeter ,i did not felt its even little spicy. chicken Marsala and mushroom: liked the whole dish.

Darbie E.,"Battle Ground, WA",13,201,93,4.0,8/15/2016,"We've been sitting on two gift cards for a long time, so Husband & I treated ourselves.  We ordered an appetizer, cocktails, dinner, and dessert.  The always-delicious avocado egg rolls were great and my margarita was good. I got a turkey burger sans the bun and I thought it was really good (the garlic aoli was amazing!).  My husband, though, got the beef dip without onions. It came with the onions, but they were large enough chunks that he could easily pick them out. Unfortunately, he said it just wasn't very good overall. The cheesecake, however, was perfect.  Our waitress was darling and the manager came by to apologize for the onion goof.  The only thing I don't like about The CF is the noise level. Because of that, my elderly folks can never go here. Boo!"
Robert B.,"Portland, OR",1,33,1,5.0,9/14/2017,"So glad I came for lunch today. Breakfast all day long. Bread is fabulous, breakfast potatoes are the best ever. Boxed up half my meal for dinner. Service is outstanding."
Jenn W.,"Wilsonville, OR",79,78,28,4.0,3/4/2017,"I know it's a chain, but I truly am never disappointed with the cheesecake factory. The bread they bring out is good, there are an unbelievable amount of choices, and the food has never been bad (granted I'm writing this as someone who has only been to about 3 different Cheesecake Factories... and only that many times). The cheesecake is always so fresh and good! My favorite is the key lime. But the red velvet is also amazing! Food wise, I've been happy with salads, the shepherds pie, chicken parmesan, and I was super surprised at how great even their nachos were! The only downfall is that they are pretty expensive. As in $15/person, even for salads. And sometimes its crowded and you get stuck at small tables really close to other (chatty) people. But I still love going there!"
Devinnie F.,"Portland, OR",6,31,7,3.0,9/9/2017,"I think the food is overrated here honestly but the cheesecake is to die for!!So many different flavors and choices,it's delicious!"
Blnde842 L.,"Lake Oswego, OR",11,215,28,4.0,1/4/2017,"I love this place !!!!!! Another great chain restaurant steppin up their game ! Fried mac n cheese balls are literally heaven. The guac is fresh and huge chunks of avocado which I LOVE. Happy hour (if you can manage to get a table/bar seat) is so beyond reasonable for the quality of food you get. 4-6 m-f get there early because this place BECOMES A ZOO AFTER 3/3:30pm. Drinks on HH as well are fantastic and reasonably priced. I have yet to eat off the full menu but I've gotten almost every single food option off the HH menu and haven't had one thing I dislike. CHANEL IN THE BAR WAS FANTASTIC ! Thank you for the couple going home and enjoying some cheesecake for you (; your service was awesome specially seeing you just kiiiiilllllll the game like a champ ! Super friendly and awesome at her job, kudos to that gal she deserves a round of applause and then some ! Get it girl ! THANK YOU !!!"
Joy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,252,346,3.0,7/11/2016,"I'm still giving the 3 stars, but feel I need to update my review. Let me start with hostess: super friendly and efficient.   Cheesecake counter at the entrance: obviously way too much choice which is an absolute luxury.  Excellent cheese cake.  But things inside the restaurant seem to have changed.   After we sit down service isn't as attentive nor friendly as it used to be, maybe a bit rushed, maybe not so interested, but it actually annoyed me the last time. I've had 3 different cocktails during  my last visits and they were all SO sweet: please, mr or mrs bar tender, slow down and take it easy with the simple syrup... This isn't funny anymore.   Sending it back didn't exactly help.    So you're losing me on this one.  Food wise it's consistent.  No complaints there.  It's just the waiting staff I'm underwhelm with."
Cody D.,"Portland, OR",0,5,3,4.0,9/8/2017,"In the decade I have lived in Portland, today's lunch was the first time I had been to cheese cake. I will say the menu is massive and quite overwhelming to look through. They have some skinnylicous menu I believe is what it's called, for those worried about what they're eating. Settled for a chicken Cesar with a glass of red wine. Not too noisy, but was very busy considering it was 1pm in the afternoon. I'm still burping from my Cesar so maybe a little less dressing would have been ideal."
Jennifer S.,"Portland, OR",666,562,1974,3.0,8/25/2015,"FOOD: Good. It's the kind of food you'd expect from a chain restaurant but better. I do believe that they're menu is far overwhelming, but I kind of believe that what makes this place so great when you have a group that can't decide what they want. We ordered an appetizer, a kid's meal, and my fiancé and I split an entree. We started with the crab bites, which was a small plate, and it really is just a little food. They come out with six, little balls and dipping sauce. It seems more like a personal appetizer, but it was good nonetheless. The kid's meal was grilled chicken and vegetables, and it was pretty good and looked pretty good for a kid's meal. My fiancé and I split the adult version of chicken strips, and it came with mashed potatoes and corn succotash, which was all good, too. I would've given this place four stars, but I had to take off one for: SERVICE: Meh. Our server had absolutely no personality whatsoever. The service was blah. The bare minimum a server would have to do to get a tip. No smile. Monotone. Least amount of words a server could say."
Brenden R.,"Salem, OR",0,2,,5.0,4/15/2017,"My fiancé and I came in on a Friday night for a special occasion. Wait was about 40 minutes. We got sat in what I thought was the bar but it was little 2 top tables/booth things. The gentlemen helping us was great. Drinks were never empty and appetizers came out fast. Avocado egg rolls were amazing! After our apps were delivered we were ready to put our order in. The server was patient with us and never did we fill rushed.  I got the cheesesteak with sweet potato fries and It was great. My fiancée got the The chicken Alfredo, it was really good too! We only ate half to save some room for dessert, again the server was extremely patient and gave us plenty of time to make our choices.  There was a busser working this shift. Holy smokes. Watching him clean a table and set it up was a show in it self. It's cool to see and experience people passionate about their jobs.  This was an awesome first experience, I'm excited to try this place again!"
JoDee M.,"Raymond, ME",31,24,15,2.0,9/1/2016,"The service is fine, but for the price the food is rather meh. It tastes like over priced food aimed for my mom's pallet and the names are such that you don't realize you are walking into bland city.   The beets were cute huge and tasted like more sugar and less vinegar than I typically desire.  12 dollars for crappy salmon rolled into an egg roll served with mai Thai sauce out of the bottle? No thanks."
