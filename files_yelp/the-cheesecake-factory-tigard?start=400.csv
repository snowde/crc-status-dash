Tamra R.,"Vancouver, WA",0,4,,1.0,5/9/2015,The waitress was pretty nice and she did absolutely fine. But I ordered the Alfredo and my sister ordered the four cheese pasta both with chicken. Unfortunately the pasta was only lukewarm and the chicken was dry and bland. Fortunately they did replace them.  My mom then proceeded to go to the bathroom and there were no toilet covers and she could see straight through to the next stall and could see everything going on in that stall. She returned highly upset. She talked to the manager who was highly condescending and insincere but said he would have the seat covers replaced right away. 20 minuets later after my sisters and i had to go to the restroom and my mother came with us. The bathroom was gross. There was toilet paper on the floor one of the toilets wouldn't flush and not only was there still no toilet seat covers and the hole still there but also the doors locking the toilet paper and seat covers was unlocked and kept hitting me as I tried to use the restroom. My mom was furious this time as the ever so great manager had done nothing to make the women of the restaurant feel comfortable instead of getting the opportunity to be stared at as we pee. So thank you cheesecake factory for making my moms mother day dinner one for the memery book. Though not at all a good one.
Well-Traveled T.,"Bothell, WA",47,165,4,2.0,12/13/2008,"I'm not adamantly opposed to chains, but I do prefer to give my money to local businesses. (I won't lie; I could live on Olive Garden breadsticks alone.) That being said. The Cheesecake Factory is like Disneyland or Disney World; everyone wants to go but there are far better places to visit. Both my friend and I had never been and wanted to see what it was like. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, which was $11.95. Portions are huge and the prices are a bit high for a chain, but I've noticed prices are up everywhere in all restaurants, and so it goes... The sandwich was served with the sauce on the side, so I had to dip my sandwich in the sauce, which made eating it awkward. It was good, but I wish I went for something lighter. Warm bread is provided before the meal. If you order a drink, it's served in huge glasses and water is served in plastic beer mugs. Maybe it was me, but the food seemed rather salty because I actually asked for a Coke (I typically don't drink Coke or any soda at meals) because I needed something sweet to balance out the saltiness of the meal.  It's VERY noisy, so don't expect a romantic evening without the kids unless you like it noisy. Also, don't be prepared to linger and have a nice conversation - our waiter kept coming by after we ate to check on us. Tables are a premium."
Holly H.,"Seattle, WA",497,103,530,3.0,4/21/2009,"Firstly: You're in Portland! Eat somewhere interesting! The food here is okay, average, with an overwhelmingly large menu. They have good cocktails. The service is always fantastic. There is nothing here that will ""wow"" you, but nothing will leave you disappointed either (shouldn't, anyway) it's all very safe. I would, however, come here for dessert and an appetizer. The avocado eggrolls are worth mentioning. As is the Lemon Raspberry cheesecake. Not too sweet. Just right."
Shana C.,"Woodburn, OR",4,24,1,5.0,10/28/2011,"Stopped here to pick up desert and decided to get the red velvet cheesecake, and it was delightful!! A bit rich but sooooooo good. It was very busy but we only waited a few minutes ;0)"
Faye F.,"New York, NY",20,875,57,4.0,10/26/2013,"always good food and delicious cheesecake. cheesecake was divine. tried the 30th cheesecake and it was scrumptious! service was pretty good, except until the end when my waitress tried to get more money out of me (after i already gave her more than enough)!"
Ian R.,"Portland, OR",20,37,,1.0,9/12/2008,"Maybe the Cheesecake Factory could combine with the Spaghetti Factory to create the ultimate American restaurant where everyone waits three hours to get a table, then gets served an absurdly large portion of instantly-forgettable food. Or maybe people could figure out that it's best to avoid restaurants with ""factory"" in their name."
CeeCee P.,"Portland, OR",12,49,19,3.0,9/13/2009,"I wouldn't say that I'm anti-chain... but chain restaurants don't impress me very much, and though the Cheesecake Factory wasn't an exception to this, they're still ""A-OK."" I hate waiting, and I definitely hate having to wait in a confined area, so I usually go to the Cheesecake around 2 o'clock to beat the lunch crowd.  I do notice, though, that once you're seated, whether during prime-time or down-time, you're attended to quickly and your order comes out at a reasonable time. I've come to realize, after trying their pizzas, pastas, salads and other entrees, that I'm not a fan of the food here.  Not only are their portions larger than life, but the food itself isn't very inspiring.  I'm looking for quality, not quantity!!! Why 3 stars then, instead of 1 or 2?  Well, for one, as I've mentioned, the service is quick once you're seated.  Two, I love love love their strawberry shortcake with its juicy, sweet strawberries and heaping scoop of ice cream.  && three, I liked that their mojitos come with a ton of mint leaves! Aside from these few perks, however, the Cheesecake Factory should not be a go-to restaurant for your foodings."
Samantha G.,"Portland, OR",27,32,,5.0,9/14/2011,My favorite restaurant in Portland hands down. I know its a chain restaurant but they give HUGE portions that are spot on every time. You get warm bread as you wait for your meal which is always something I look forward to. Their drinks are delicious and have a TON of food to choose from. Not to mention their cheesecake yum lots to choose from there too. They have a seasonal menu too so there is always something different to try when you go.The only downfall is they are usually busy and there is a long wait.
lucia j.,"Portland, OR",12,83,,1.0,11/2/2008,"No, the food doesn't taste better if there is more on your plate than you can possibly eat in one sitting.  No, the food doesn't taste better if you paid only 20 bucks for your oversized semi-premade meal.   Ironically, the only part of the food where the portions aren't val-u sized or val-u priced is the cheesecake itself, despite the fact that this place is called the CHEESECAKE factory.  It's disgusting to imagine anyone actually having room for dessert after they finish an entree here anyway. I won't be going to this place after my sole venture, but I'm sure there are enough people out there happy with suburban-corporate ambiance and mid-scale mediocrity, as proven by the many 4-5 star reviews I see here."
Sean G.,"Anchorage, AK",250,335,68,5.0,7/4/2011,Very good every time. The staff was amazing. Very friendly! I ate to much had to get my cheese cake to go but it was amazing when I ate it. Fresh strawberry always a good choice!
Clare M.,"Milwaukie, OR",104,168,23,4.0,6/24/2011,"I have to say as far as chains go this place is pretty consistent.  My main gripe with their dinner is portion size.  They WAAY overdo it.  I went today for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the price and smaller portions.  I really wish they offered lunch portions all the time, then I would go more often.  Why pay 16 bucks for something when I'm only really eating half?  I'd much rather pay 10 bucks and eat almost all of it!  Their food is pretty good, but their cheesecakes are the star of the show.  Next time were shopping in Washington square I will be back, but I probably won't ever make a trip out of the way for this place."
J. D.,"Beaverton, OR",9,21,,5.0,8/1/2011,Went again.  Key lime cheesecake was perfect again.  Service was great.  Chipotle chicken pasta was awesome.
Amber F.,"Kelso, WA",15,158,411,3.0,6/3/2011,"I don't write novels like the other people, so this will be short and sweet! I have eaten here a few times, and there always seems to be something that is just 'off'... The food is usually pretty decent, but they usually get at least one component wrong. The waitstaff seems to need more training on what comes on each menu item, I think then there wouldn't be so many mistakes. If we return, it will only be for the cheesecake."
Z Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,575,67,2.0,7/13/2008,"I find it amusing that Cheesecake Factory has a Weight Management mini-menu that has salads that are around 590 calories.  Umm, how is that healthy?  Ugh.....well, whatever....the only thing that I usually get from there is the grilled cheese and I add tomatoes to it.  Healthy?  No...but one of the only items that I find tolerable there.  My husband likes the food more than I do but overall he just finds it OK.  He got the chicken piccatta today and said that it was (as usual) just 'OK'.   What I find even more bothersome than the food is the clientele.  Granted, I was eating there so I shouldn't be too critical but, check out these gems: #1:  Our buzzer rang along with a few other couples.  They had us all gather around the booth and still had to wait a few minutes to be seated.  This other woman that was waiting kept being super rude to everyone saying that people were cutting in front of her and that she was waiting too.  Ummm, yeah all of our buzzers went off...deal with it! #2:  OK, this one was really gross....This couple sitting next to us was sharing buffalo wings and fries.  After they were done the woman pulled out this cream from her purse and starting rubbing it on her foot.  While she was sitting at the table!!!!!!  She then put her bare foot back on the floor and then started eating her cheese cake with the same hands!  I was nauseous.  She then proceeded to point out all these pock marks on her arms and was discussing how much worse they used to be.  Oh, and then she picked at her teeth in the mirror before finally leaving. So, yeah.....all around, The Cheesecake Factory is just the pits.  Too expensive for the quality.  The portions are way too huge, I couldn't even finish the grilled cheese, I only ate half of it.  Oh, and I tried ordering the low carb, low sugar cheesecake and found out that they don't carry it anymore.  Granted, that does sound ridiculous (trying to order the low fat cheesecake) considering I ordered the grilled cheese but still..... I guess if you want a family friendly chain restaurant this is the place to go though, the strollers sure were lined up outside that place!  For some reason it is always crowded...no matter which Cheesecake Factory you go to and no matter when you go there is always a wait.  It just isn't for me.  One positive....it was a nice way to get out of the heat, the air conditioning was in high gear today."
Sabrina P.,"Beaverton, OR",6,16,,4.0,1/22/2012,"I love this place! well, i love the food....not so much the parking, or the wait for a table, or even sometimes the wait for your waiter to return...but the food is worth it. i am a creature of habit & so i only have ordered one item (& it's only been messed up one time - undercooked noodles) - a cajun kinda pasta w/ bowtie noodles & breaded chicken. i don't like bowtie, so i put it on penne & i don't do breaded so i do grilled & let me tell you it's yummy! but what i love best is the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake! talk about mouth watering!! the menu is entirely too large though, chef ramsey would have a hay day with that..."
Jessica R.,"Eugene, OR",11,143,1,2.0,6/20/2008,What is the appeal of The Cheesecake Factory?  Noisy restaurant? Check. Dizzying array of fatty crap? Check. Oversized portions of mediocre mass-marketed food? Check. Mall location? Check. Why not just go to Sbarro's and save yourself $10?
Ron T.,"Portland, OR",167,623,295,3.0,7/13/2008,"We all know that waiting can be painful here specially during lunch/dinner time.  Here's a tip: Drop someone (preferrably the one member of your group who doesn't like shopping. They can people watch while waiting) by their door to get your tables later.  You can freely shop for around 20-30 mins cause that's how long the waiting time is. By the time you're done shopping, you've already developed an apetite for The Cheesecake Factory.  I would recommend their chicken marsala and veggie thai wrap. Have some dessert after. Try their seasonal cheesecake aside from their classics. You'll be in for a treat.  Their servings are huge. You can even share it with the people who are still waiting or you can take it home as a midnight snack/meal.  I haven't tried the bar area yet as they are always packed."
Thorby B.,"Novato, CA",1,102,4,4.0,12/30/2010,"Having been to two Cheescake Factory locations in the S.F. Bay Area, I entered this one with low expectations and a high degree of certainty that I would be in for a long wait for a table, mediocre service, average food and great desserts.  That way, I knew I would not be disappointed. While the wait WAS long (over an hour when we were told 30 minutes) we were a large party to accommodate and I was anticipating the wait.  But, the rest of my somewhat low and negative expectations were turned upside-down. Food was very good to excellent for all diners.  We had one entree that experienced a kitchen delay.  But the server quickly explained what the problem was along with a very sincere apology.  Because the portions are so large, two in our party eventually wound up sharing a VERY large entree and the ""problem entree"" was then canceled.  Absolutely no problem.  Even the manager came over to inquire, ensure everything was satisfactory and apologize for the kitchen's error, made sure we understood what had caused the problem and sincerely apologized AGAIN.  In our collective minds the problem was very minor but the wait-staff's treatment of it and of us was golden. The service:  absolutely excellent all around.  Water glasses constantly filled.  Ice tea refilled.  Bread refilled.  Very quick acknowledgement, a smile and an ""absolutely no problem"" attitude throughout the meal.  Personal, yet appropriate, conversation with the server.  This location could and should give customer service lessons and training to the S.F. Bay Area locations.  The tip was 35% and the server was highly praised directly to the manager on duty."
Lindsey C.,"Portland, OR",90,18,8,4.0,6/11/2011,The menu is overwhelming but portions are huge. Find a way to save room for any of their cheesecakes. They are delicious!
Alyssa V.,"Salem, OR",0,6,,5.0,2/23/2012,"My husband and I decided, on a whim, to go there last night (a Wednesday around 7:00 p.m.) for dinner. We have been meaning to go for a couple years, and decided to finally try it.  We were seated VERY quickly. As in, we checked in and less than 5 minutes later were being taken to our table. Our waiter (named Donovan) asked us how we were, to which we replied good and that we had never been there before. His first warning: the menu is very big. As in, 20 pages and then a couple for the cheesecakes and drinks. They also had a ""skinnylicious"" menu, which were all under 590 calories and smaller portions. He recommended a few things, let us know about their loaded baked potato soup, and then excused himself to get us some water. After bringing the waters and taking down our orders for strawberry lemonade (which was the best we had ever had), we looked over the menu. As our server passed by with cheesecakes, he would stop and briefly show them to use, tell us which one it is, and explain what was in it. We finally decided on the chicken madeira and the soup for me, and my husband had the spicy cashew chicken. The soup was great, and although I ordered the cup, it was the size of a bowl. Definitely glad I didn't get the bowl. They might have brought me a trough! When he brought us our entrees, I was shocked at the size of the plate. Two pieces of chicken the size of my head, and a hefty serving of mashed potatoes. I wasn't wild over the sauce, but it was still very good. It also came with steamed asparagus, which was done perfectly. The mashed potatoes (made with red potatoes) were well seasoned. I barely made a dent in my food. My husbands chicken was spicy, but not overly so. He asked for the brown rice, which complimented the chicken wonderfully. He actually ate half of his plate. Thanks to the cheesecakes our server had shown us, it wasn't hard to decide which ones to get. My husband got Adam's peanut butter cup cheesecake, and I ordered the Banana cream. We very light and creamy, and a fairly large slice topped with whip cream (mine also had freshly sliced bananas on it). I was shocked at our bill as I wasn't paying too close to the price (about $63), but very satisfied with the quality of food and service we got. We will definitely be going back, but maybe more on a special occasion or just to grab a slice of cheesecake."
