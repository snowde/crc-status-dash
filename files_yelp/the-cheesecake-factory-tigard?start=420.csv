Olivia T.,"Portland, OR",563,1065,9,4.0,5/24/2008,"My bad experience with bad service finally broken with my trip to Cheesecake Factory. I came here with my friend and we got seated right away at 6 pm on Tuesday night. The fried calamari appetizer was excellent and my dinner combination of Salmon and Steak Diane was really good. By the time we ordered the cheesecake, I feel full already, but I ordered that damn Pistachio Chocolate cheesecake anyway and made myself really bloated. I couldn't finish the cheesecake so I took it to go with half of my meal. Our waitress was really nice. She's polite and not pushy. I love cheesecake factory, not only because it made me bloated, but they made me feel like a good customer. :)"
Kalila A.,"Portland, OR",0,8,,2.0,1/20/2014,"I ordered the four cheese pasta and the fresh vegetable salad. I love almost all salads but this was DISGUSTING. The tomato was wilted and the dressing was incredibly nasty. I ended up taking it home, washing off the nasty dressing and dousing it in other dressing just to make it edible.  My boyfriend ordered the Huevos Rancheros and was looking forward to the quesadilla it came with. He ended up receiving tostadas instead. Tostadas are fried in oil and make him sick, while quesadillas are grilled. The waitress was nice about it but did not understand him and the cook the waitress brought out to talk to him did not understand the difference and argued with him and ended up remaking his meal the same way but with completely uncooked tortillas and called it a quesadilla. Since he comes from a hispanic culture, he felt insulted that they gave him the wrong thing and then replaced it with still the wrong thing."
bridget n.,"Portland, OR",2,53,,3.0,8/30/2008,"This place is beautiful!  It kind of makes me feel like I'm back in vegas... the food isn't all that great to me though,  it's more like an overpriced Applebees.  They usually have a really long wait, and everyoone that works there seems to have a frown plastered on their face.   I have to admit, when they first opened, i waited in long for an insane amount of time to get in.  I enjoyed the oreo cheesecake, but really, I don't see what the big hype is."
Vinay P.,"Beaverton, OR",10,37,5,4.0,9/12/2008,"Yes, there is usually a wait, but I am not sure what the previous reviewer was talking about when he referred to a three-hour wait - unless maybe he was trying to make a statement by using a hyperbole.  I am also not sure what he meant when he talked about the restaurant serving 'instantly-forgetable' food.  Unless he is  a connoisseur of fine food and used to eating frequently at the one of these restaurants ( ),  I don't see how he could be blasé about the food at Cheesecake factory.  Anyway, this is not intended to be a a review of another review,  but I just couldn't resist. I have always enjoyed eating at the Cheesecake Factory. Always. The food is great and they do have a pretty exhaustive menu that offers reasonable variety. The service usually varies between  3 and 5 on a scale of 1 - 5.   This is what we (party of 4) ordered today: Appetizers (Thai Lettuce Wraps, Firecracker Salmon rolls) - both these dishes were excellent.  The sauces that were served with the lettuce wraps were flavorful and I think one of them was had Indian spices.  Main course: Miso Salmon, Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Pasta Carnonara. Our collective feedback in short: The chef delivered as promised.   Dessert: I don't remember the kind of cheesecake, but it had 3 layers, we each got a slice and we ate in silence - it was a good kind of silence and the kind of silence that you go into when you're indulging in a guilty pleasure ( I'll be paying my dues for this indulgence by running 4 miles tomorrow morning) The expected wait time when we checked in today was 25 - 40 minutes. Our actual wait time was 20 minutes.  We're going back. Soon."
Miss F.,"Beaverton, OR",0,12,,2.0,6/8/2013,"This was not a good experience.  My cheesecake was frozen solid.  I had to take it to go while others ate there.  There was no compensation provided.  It's also way too dark to the point where you can't even read the menu at night. On the positive side, for once we had no wait at quarter to five on a Saturday!"
Greg G.,"Vancouver, WA",115,235,65,4.0,12/19/2010,"Very reliable for a chain. Also, they actually cook here. The portions are huge and so is the wait because they're not smart enough to have more than one in the area.   I recommend the Chinese chicken salad and the charbroiled chicken ranch salad. Very tasty but watch out for duck fans as they are everywhere until their stupid team loses."
Erin M.,"Woodinville, WA",117,501,87,3.0,7/21/2008,"Today I learned that it's a bad idea to eat cheesecake for breakfast. And yet, I want to return to the Cheesecake Factory to get another slice (entire cake?) for dinner. Oh, Erin.... I don't generally enjoy the food at the Cheesecake Factory & this location was not much of a change. I just find it really difficult to find tasty yet healthy fare at this place. Yesterday my boyfriend and I enjoyed a late lunch on the deck, which was nice- the right amount of sun and people watching for a nice time. I settled on the $15 seared ahi tuna salad, which was underwhelming value-wise, but still tasty. Boyfriend had his usual club sandwich ($11) which he loves. Two slices of cheesecake later ($5-7 per slice) and we were food-coma induced and ready for a nap. I'd return to the Cheesecake Factory for desert, and I love the outside seating option for a nice day. But, I'm going to have to dock a few stars for the lacking healthy options & steep prices."
Corey B.,"Vancouver, WA",64,5,,4.0,4/26/2013,good place to eat. if you guys were closer that would be great. but the drive is worth it!!!
Rex S.,"Newberg, OR",10,150,12,3.0,3/24/2008,"I'm giving three stars...nothing spectacular but nothing bad either.  If it wasn't for the decor and location, this would be a so-so place to eat.  The menu is vast, and the food was pretty good.  The place is too busy for it's own good, and the decor screams ""I'm trying to be Las Vegas"".  The staff was friendly, but the overall busy atmosphere made it seem like the staff was barely in control of the chaos.  I thought the pricing was ok.   Yes, I would eat there again, but this wouldn't be on my list for places to impress someone."
Walnut N.,"Meridian, ID",0,22,,1.0,5/6/2012,Where to start.. My food had to be remade twice and it still was not correct there after but I just settled eventually. By the time my food had arrived my husband had cleared his plate. It was not the nice dinner we had hoped for. One of the most horrific parts of the dinner was our waitress Courtney H. She complained to us the whole time about how she didn't want to be at work and how she was in a bad mood. To top it off she was cursing as well. It was the most unprofessional experience from a waitress we have ever endured. She should be fired! I wish I would have made the time to call in and speak to a manager but while we were there and they messed up on my food the manager never came over to apologize or offer anything so I don't think anything would have even been done had I called in. This all happened on 04/10/12 if anyone is curious. Never going back to the cheesecake factory!
Brad W.,"Beaverton, OR",11,21,1,5.0,7/14/2007,"I could go on and on about The Cheesecake Factory, the way too long menu, the advertising in the menu, the humongous portions.  But really I'd only like to mention one thing...the drinks. I ordered a Georgia Peach on my last visit and I have to say, this was the best alcoholic beverage I have ever purchased in my entire life.  I've had exotic cocktails on cruise ships, happy hour concoctions downtown, and holiday themed intoxicants a plenty, but this way above and beyond. The bartender started by pouring a think red mix in the bottom of a snifter glass, then pured in the drink mix.  The orange mix spreads the deep red mix through the outer of the glass making the entire drink look like...you guessed it, a peach!  It was phenomenal, and should be for $11. All around, the single best alcoholic beverage I have ever purchased.  Very few have even come close and it will be awhile before I am awed by this sort of creativity again."
Courtney W.,"Annville, PA",317,160,43,4.0,6/9/2007,"Talk about enhancing the issue of over-eating! Portions to feed a small elephaunt = GINORMOUS. Asking them to box half of it BEFORE they even bring it to your table may help with the issue of over-indulging. It's a beautiful place - with almost an eqyptian twist. How cheesecake and Eqyptians came together, I have no idea.  Betcha it's an interesting story. After being ignored for a good 15 minutes; Our server came and helped us, finally. He apologized repeatedly for the suffering service, THANKS! Now take our DAMN FOOD ORDER. No, 10 more minutes of apologizing ... Yes, when you GET the service, it's great here =) Over-the top, actually ... Ordered a chicken and avocado club. It was good! I'm not a fan of foo-foo drinks, but foo-fooness runs rampant on their drink menu =) I tried the Georgia Peach; the cutest drink, with the weakest amount of alcohol - EVER. Did they forget to put it in there? Lots and LOTS on the menu =) I think it's a shame if you come here and stuff your face and don't leave room for dessert. I mean, this IS the Cheesecake Factory. So, keep that in mind, or you'll get too full, ya hear?"
Jennyfer M.,"Hammond, OR",14,97,55,5.0,1/13/2011,"I keep coming back again and again to this restaurant. Their menu is outrageous. So, many choices to choose from. Plus you can't leave without ordering dessert. My all time favorite is the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cheesecake. Mouthwatering delicious. For drinks I recently tried the Tropical Martini very yummy, but pricey $10 for a glass. Pasta dish I recommend the Louisiana Chicken Pasta you'll love it I gaurantee. Appetizers the Thai Lettuce Wraps is messy to eat but a lot of fun and so good. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and it's always busy all the time. That's when you know the food is good. The longest I ever waited for a table was 30 min which wasn't bad. They have an area where you can sit and wait or the mall is right there so you can shop while waiting."
Traffic G.,"Redwood City, CA",2,31,,4.0,4/23/2008,"HUGE portions abound here.  It's too pricey for daily lunch, but if you're on expense account, you can do it.  Of course, the cheesecake is to die for. My measuring stick for a place to get lunch is the good old Clubhouse Sandwich.  If it's done right, typically, the rest of the fare is done right.  Here, it's done right. I must return upon my next flight north.  4 1/2 stars."
Sarah M.,"Vancouver, Canada",38,57,69,5.0,8/23/2010,"My boyfriend and I went to this Cheesecake factory (it was his first time to one) and we both loved it! The menu is huge, you really can't go wrong and the cheesecakes are to die for! We had the fried macaroni which was great and the crab dip, yummy as well.  He ordered a burger and I had the fettuccine with sun dried tomatoes.  For dessert we had the red velvet cheese cake which was SO GOOD, he looked at me and was like ""we have to have this for our wedding cake!!!"".  We also tried Linda's chocolate cake, and the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake they were both very tasty but rich.  The service was wonderful, we couldn't stop raving about how nice our waiter was, he always made sure we had refills and was checking in on us he was EXCELLENT! We loved the Cheesecake factory and can't wait to go back on our next Portland visit."
Liz T.,"Portland, OR",9,34,1,5.0,9/27/2007,"Thank you franchise gods for bringing The Cheesecake Factory to our world of small plates and foreign language menus! I first fell in love with The Cheesecake Factory at their original location in Beverly Hills, where the restaurant is more like an old house and seating is limited so I can see how some may be overwhelmed by the atmosphere and design of the large Washington Square location, but no matter which location  you're at, you will be served the same great food.  Yes the portions are large, but that's what to-go boxes and the gym are for. To me (a girl who likes to eat and get what she's paying for) large portions earn the restaurant a star, as long as the food is good, and it is! My favorite is the four cheese pasta, but I've taken everyone I know to the Cheesecake Factory and I've never heard a complaint about what was served, from the salads to the Cajun chicken littles to the appetizers.  Along with  your main course, they serve two kinds of super yummy bread and of course cheesecake. They always have about 30 flavors of cheesecake to choose from and they're all quite tasty. They range from great plain cheesecake with fresh fruit, to peanut butter-cookie dough cheesecake. Many are quite rich so I do vote share or get another to-go box. If you go on the weekend you will more than likely have to wait a while for your table, but it's worth it. They have a nice bar with yummy Bellini's (and other drinks) if you wanna grab a drink while you wait. Or you can venture into the mall and people watch.  Bottom line- You will not leave hungry, but you will leave wanting more!"
Catie L.,"Portland, OR",115,200,226,4.0,6/4/2007,"Yes, the wait sucks, but every time I have eaten there the food has been super tasty.  The portions are a bit over the top, but hey for the price you are getting like three meals!  Ha!  Sharing is a good idea.  The Crispy Spicy Beef is awesome, the Hungarian Goulash is so rich and delicious, and their Steak Diane isn't too shabby.  I like this place for special occasions, or to take people from out of town.  The Mojitos there are super tasty and not skimpy.  The menu is a book, and has such a vast variety of food options that I could never hope to try them all.  I adore the whimsical decor, and the staff is always running around like chickens with their heads....you know. Then there are the cheesecakes.  Oh glory!  I have tried the lemon raspberry, the white chocolate latte, the coconut chocolate, and the god of cakes ""Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cake"".  It is an amazing mountain of cheesecake, German chocolate cake, and fudge frosting.  It is probably the only cake I have ever loved."
Bobbi J.,"Vancouver, WA",53,199,35,4.0,8/8/2010,We have been here a few times.  There is always a wait to get a table.  I am not too fond of their food here and it is very pricey  I do however love their cheesecake.  The Red velvet Cheese Cake is my fave!
Matt K.,"San Jose, CA",39,366,13,3.0,1/11/2010,"Sometimes you just feel like you want Cheesecake Factory. How can you go wrong with a menu that has as many pages as a telephone book? This one is much like the others. Except for the fact that I was sat in a section where the floor had obviously been spilled on with some soda...sticky floor, yuck! They walked us right through the sticky part and the entire time we were there, nobody cleaned it.  Otherwise, my BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad was HUGE and tasty as always. Service was friendly, but I felt our server was a little TOO friendly and eager. But overall, still a decent dining experience."
K K.,"Portland, OR",0,17,,1.0,9/20/2013,"I used to go to cheesecake factory quite often when I lived in Pasadena California. I thought the quality of food would be the same since it is a chain store. Well, I am wrong. We came to have lunch at the Washington square mall location last Sunday. I ordered the louisiana chicken pasta. It was the worst I every had. It was very very greasy, and it had absolutely NO salt in it. I guess the chef was too busy such that he/she forgot to put salt to the dish. I tried it, and had my husband try it, and we both agree, it had NO salt. We added salt ourselves using the salt shaker on the table, but the salty flavor could not mix well into the pasta, and the pasta ended up tasting weird, kind of bitter. Because we have touched the food, I felt too bad to ask the server to replace the food. We took it home, but no one wanted to eat it. We ended up throwing it away. I still feel bad for throwing away food."
