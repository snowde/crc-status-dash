larisa i.,"Vancouver, WA",0,6,,5.0,3/25/2011,"I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory! It is my all-time favorite restaurant! Since it is such a popular restaurant, we expect a wait, which is fine-that's when you get a little shopping done!  My favorite meal there is the Chicken Madiera Combo with Steak or Salmon -yummmm. Also their Avacado Eggrolls are to die for! Very Yummy.  This place is filled with awesome food, you won't regret going :)"
Kevin H.,"Portland, OR",0,60,,5.0,9/22/2012,"1st thing is 1st, I love Cheesecake Factory. I have eaten at them in several locations but the one at Washington Square in metro Portland Oregon is by far the smallest and also the best.  It is better than its sister Factory in Seattle.  This place has a massive menu with enough unique flavors to satisfy any pallet both gross and subtle.  If you have a group of picky eaters I strongly recommend this restaurant because there is almost certainly something for everyone in your group at this restaurant. Also as a side note, their avocado egg rolls are insanely addictive!"
Jessica M.,"Hollister, CA",4,4,1,4.0,7/23/2012,"My family and i went to the cheesecake factory today for dinner and indulged ourselves quite a bit. but fist, let me go over the service. We where seated quickly (but it was an odd hous 4:30ish), our waitress was amazing, she went over what the specials/soups of the day where before we had to ask and wasn't fake at all and was extremely plesant. As for the food, we where brought bread to munch on, a small white french loaf and a small brown bread loaf with oats on the top, and they also brought butter pats.The menu was huge and they have a vey nice bar with plenty to choose from, they also have a new skinylicious menu for the ones watching their weight. We ordered the fried macaroni and cheese (extremely fatty and caloric i know but as i said, we indulged ourselves tonight), and it was amazing. The noodles where well cooked and not soggy or dry from being fried, the sauce was very flavorfull, and the breading kept everything together well. They put a cream marinara on the bottom of the plate for dipping and my family and i agreed that it was perfect with the macaroni balls, (did i say they where formed in four golf ball-sized portions on the plate? no? well now i did.) My dad ordered the fetutini alfredo with a side of sauteed spinach and the spinach was cooked only with a little butter, salt, and pepper in a cast iron pan. my dad said the pasta was well cooked in the alfredo, the sauce wasn't too thick or to runny and he said it stuck well to the pasta. I had a chipotle crispy chicken sandwich on a kaiser roll. the only thing chipotle about it was a mayo sauce.I agreed with my mom's following notes on the fies but i liked them that way. Mom had a wild mushroom burger, she said it was tender she asked for rare and got blood rare ""the way she likes it"". she didn't like her french fries, had potential with seasoning, but where twice cooked which made them rubbery. After dinner my family and i decided to have desert which i extremely recommend, dad had the red velvet cheesecake, he says it was very good. (not very talkative tonight) Lol. Mom had the Raspberry Lemon Cheesecake she said the sauce topping was way too tart so she pushed it off to the side, commented that the whipped cream on the side was nice and tasty, also said the amount was just right. Both my parents had coffee's which had been freshly brewed, mom said it was above average coffee, i observed that it was quite hot, needed 3 sugars and plenty of cream, depending on who was drinking it. I had a cappucino which was, fair warning- huge, alot larger than your average cap. So i had the adams penut butter fudge ripple cheesecake, which was, O.M.G. Indulgent, it had Resse's on the top, caramel, cookie bottom, and choco swirls, with a topping swirl of penut butter icing. It was amazing. Beware and prepare for a sugar high! All in All, we loved it, it was our first time to a cheesecake factory and we where extremely happy."
Steven R.,"Austin, TX",88,48,2,5.0,1/8/2008,"The food here is delicious there is plenty of selections for you to chose. I normally get there pasta. Although, the first time I went there I had a burger. They are humoungous. So, if you have a big appetite it's a perfect place for you to go. I don't even remember if I finished it or not. The only drawback is that the portions sometimes are huge, but other then that I have nothing to complain about oh and since it's so popular it can get very loud. The cheesecake is delivcious. It's like you're in heaven. There are plenty of selections for you to chose from. Which is definitely a plus since I'm not a huge fan of chocholate it's nice to know that there's a place that will have a very good selection."
San D.,"San Francisco, CA",28,257,12,4.0,5/7/2008,"I'm giving the manager and waitstaff of this Cheesecake Factory 4 stars.  Why, might you ask?  Well, it was a busy shopping Saturday during the post-Thanksgiving weekend.  We were in town and wanted to see all of our friends and celebrate my hubby's birthday.  I made a reservation for about 12 people for 1pm.   Unfortunately, they screwed up my reservation, and we had to wait about a half an hour to get the tables set up for our large group of hungry adults and children.  Well, this was no biggie, since all of our friends love to make a (late) entrance.  Everyone was on-time, or early for this celebratory lunch.   The manager was genuinely sorry and apologized profusely.  I was mildly annoyed, but oh well, it's only a reservation.  To make it up to us, she told us we could order 4 appetizers, on the house.  It was a good time...we got to see all our friends, celebrate a birthday and enjoy a ton of yummy, FREE food."
Eric R.,"Grosse Pointe Woods, MI",11,26,5,5.0,6/1/2010,Service is top notch!  Food quality is excellent!  I ordered the fresh fish tacos with Mahi and they were delicious!  Topped it off with the Godiva chocolate cheesecake.
brian c.,"Portland, OR",3,36,,3.0,12/18/2009,"What do you expect for a chain. I have only been to a few chain restaurants that i would give 4 stars to. This place is OK, they have a big menu with something for even the most picky person. The food is fine, not great but good enough. The waitstaff is pretty good. Every once in a while you get somebody that you will annoy the hell out of you. The cheesecake is about the best thing going here.... hence the name cheesecake factory."
Mark B.,"Portland, OR",186,1071,2819,2.0,2/4/2009,"OK, Ive been here a few times with my family (not my choice) overall the portions are huge and expensive and to say the food is forgettable means you got lucky. As for the namesake cheesecake the Trader Joe's New York style is way better and you get the whole cheesecake for the price of a slice here."
Kevin K.,"Vancouver, WA",156,163,7,3.0,1/10/2010,"For a mall restaurant, the atmosphere is really nice.  The tall ceilings with a nice tone provides a nice dining environment.  The service is excellent and polite.  The food portions are huge and the price is actually not too bad.  The quality of the food isn't as good as some of the other Cheesecake Factories that I've been to, but it's still really good.  I would recommend it over the food court, if you're willing to shell about $5 more per person."
Patricia W.,"Portland, OR",41,80,190,3.0,1/26/2009,"Last night we decided to take the trek to Washington Square to come here for dinner, our motivation was we had a giftcard. The wait wasn't so bad, 30 minutes on a Sunday night. (I thought it was going to be worse).  We got seated and order drinks and appetizer's, the calamari was good and honestly the best cocktail sauce I have ever had, it was nice and horseradishy! When our food got there I couldn't believe the enormity of what was in front of me. I ordered Chicken Capoletta(?), there were 3 flattened chicken breasts on my plate with mashed potato's and asparagus. This meal could have fed a family of 3., seriously, and they would have brought home leftovers.  One thing that I did'n't like is that they call themselves a ""Family"" restaurant but don't have a kids menu, we had to purchase an $8.95 appetizer for our 7 year old, again, it could have fed 3 if not 4 people. If you go here split the meal and you will be fine and as always....GET the cheesecake, it is finger lickin' good!"
Lauren G.,"Portland, OR",155,226,20,3.0,8/15/2008,"sometimes I reflect fondly upon days (like, when i was in college) when I didn't know the Cheesecake Factory's Asian Chicken salad had approximately 1 million zillion calories and i could just enjoy that hellofa salad. oh well. maybe if i jog to tigard and home it'll be a wash."
Beth B.,"Portland, OR",26,43,,3.0,8/29/2008,"Something on the menu for every last soul.  If you want to get fat on cheesecake and whipped cream with a half life of 20 years,  this is your place.  I like sitting at the bar and drinking some cocktails like a pomegranate mojito or a lemon drop.  I know, foo-foo all the way but something about this place just makes me swing that way.  It gets way dark in there at night...the lighting is way too low BUT... if you are there with a romantic interest..that can prove to your advantage.  I have any pretty much everything on their menu and never been disappointed.  The outside seating is pretty decent; could people watching spot!  Yes, I enjoy the occasional people judging at the mall while I eat my cheesecake sport. ;)"
Sara Q.,"Portland, OR",124,242,811,2.0,11/20/2010,"so yesterday my classmates and i had an exam and since we all passed we decided to do dinner. so i figured about 12 ish of us would be attending dinner so i called in like the great planner i am and tried to make reservations. well unfortunately, they only take reservations on certain days and certain times of the day as well. yesterday being friday.. they weren't taking reservations (and saturdays) .. so i asked the women, what should i do if i had a party for about 12-15 people? she said come in about an hour to two hours early to put my name on the list. so i did so because we were in the mall.. i could just shop while we waited. so i told everyone dinner around 730. i showed up at 640 and the manager told me it will be about a 50 minute wait. i was like okay, i can dig it. told everyone to come around 8, that would be a more reasonable time so they wouldn't have to wait around. so 50 minutes rolls by and another 15 i go and check to see if they called our table they said no and the wait now should only be about 10 minutes while they put our tables together. we're all there and we're all hungry. another 15 minutes rolls by, nothing. my friend went to go check and they said, oh someone from your party said that you would like to be split into two groups so your wait time would be shorter. WTF????? helllls no. i call the manager. he says, on let me check and see about that, that's not right. im standing in front of him waiting to hear whats up.. and he get's diverted. then a party of 10 gets called in and then a table of 8 get's called in.. more time pass and i'm like, for real can you tell me how long the wait is now because we're all here all waiting and it's been over an hour and a half. so he said, okay looks like the table we have you guys set up for has people still there, they have already paid and usually we estimate a big party to dine for about an hour to tops an hour and a half. it's now been an hour and 45 minutes and it's our policy that we can't ask them to leave. sooo i'm like damn if you guys can't ask, i sure as hell can. he standing there offering free appetizers and stuff.. im like damn. and just as i was going to walk over there, the party decides to leave. so he's like, a few minutes as we clean your table. great. they pretty much gave our table away and mixed up our ""reservations"" big bunch of jerks. manager was nice afterwards.. and our waitresses weren't terrible. food was good and the cheese cake was even better. i got the factory chopped salad and b had the meatloaf. both never fail and b had an extra slice to take to work in a meatloaf sandwich whoop whoop! friends had really good food too.. bbq salmon, mushroom burger, tomato basil shrimp angel hair. i know for sure the tomato basil shrimp pasta was good.. as for everything else, i didn't get to try it. everything was pretty spendy. i wasn't so happy about my drink. they DO NOT make a mean mojito. don't get it here. what else..? that's all for now. ill update if there's more. 3.5 stars for the food. 1 star for the customer service. ultimate FAIL in customer service."
Andrea S.,"Portland, OR",0,6,,1.0,3/31/2010,"I wish there was a no star option. Firstly, and I know this isn't the waiter's fault because he was clearly trained to act completely fake and overbearing, but he was fake and overbearing. All of the staff had giant 'cheesy' smiles. It was uncomfortable. We went for happy hour and I ordered $5 nachos, a good deal, right? Wrong. Halfway through my plate of grease, I started having debilitating stomach cramps. The food made me so sick that I had to leave the restaurant. I will never, ever eat here again."
Sean S.,"Portland, OR",46,9,4,4.0,6/4/2009,Don't listen to these reviews it pulls of the complex menu quite well and has great food but I must say their cheesecake is not that great
Jens J.,"Seattle, WA",735,1234,496,4.0,6/20/2008,"I've always had good dining experiences at Cheesecake Factories, even though I think cheesecake itself is disgusting.  It tastes sour and awful.  I've heard a couple women remark that it reminds them of the taste of ........"
Kristine R.,"Portland, OR",53,35,16,5.0,2/19/2009,"This place always seems to be busy, and for a good reason! The service is always outstanding, and the food is excellent. I especially love their new ""special menu"" which has the same size portions, the same quality of food, but lower prices. So spend $12 and get enough food for two meals, doesn't get better than that."
Kenny P.,"San Diego, CA",21,229,13,1.0,4/23/2007,"Rude service and bland oversized portions of food await! The Cheeseflake Factory is the epitome of why 1/2 of America is overweight, and the other 1/2 are just plain rude. Don't bother."
Y M.,"Portland, OR",2,79,22,5.0,11/21/2010,"Not sure why some people don't think it's ""cool"" to like chain restaurants, my husband and I LOVE the CCF.   It's super busy and there are waits because it is fantastic and popular.  I have never had a bad meal here, and we've been going to CCF long before it ever came to Portland.  Great food, awesome selection, always yummy leftovers to take home.  Service is always amazing, too.  Now we take our daughter and she loves it as well..thank you CCF for finally getting a kid's menu, which in the past was the only thing we didn't like."
Katie W.,"Everett, WA",200,226,41,4.0,1/8/2008,"Ok, so the menu takes forever to go through. Maybe they just want to have everyone covered? Most of the food is pretty average, but oh. my. god. I love cheesecake, and I love tiramisu... so the tiramisu cheesecake is my dream come true (to be honest, I usually skip the meal and just get a drink and tiramisu cheesecake)."
