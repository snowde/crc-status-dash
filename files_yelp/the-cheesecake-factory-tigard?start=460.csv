CaLiLu H.,"Happy Valley, OR",39,175,21,4.0,4/30/2010,"I just came back from Cheesecake Factory happy hour and it wasn't bad.  I had the mojito which was good and at only $5 it was even better!  My gal pal had the dirty raspberry lemonade which was tart and refreshingly sweet and my other friend had the strawberry lemonade which was great too!  The most positive thing about this HH menu is that they offer their most popular appetizers for only $5 and the portions are the regular sized ones so it was enough to fill us up.  Of course we got the fried mac and cheese which was so divine I ended up ordering some to-go for the husband.  We also ordered the crab dip which was ok but the bread served on the side was too greasy.  We also had the calamari which didn't have much flavor and the potstickers which were unimpressive.  Overall, I am impressed with the portions you get for the price and it's a great deal, but the food could use some flavor (aside from the fried mac and cheese of course!)  There are limited seats in the bar during happy hour though so come early or prepare to wait!"
