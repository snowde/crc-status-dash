Rose E.,"Portland, OR",446,462,2334,2.0,8/4/2015,"They weren't very busy on this day, and for a party of two, the wait at 6pm was very short, only a few minutes. But once seated we seemed to be forgotten.  There were two of us, and also parties of two on either side of us. Even though we were seated and ordered first, they both received each course long before we did. We had the same server as one side and a different server than the other side.  I'm not sure what would have caused the delay, it was just strange sitting there so long after two sets of customers came and went while we were still waiting for our food. The food was very good though, as always. Service was friendly too. I'd forgotten that they box up the leftovers for you, they don't just bring you the box. The box and bag both leaked horribly though, even though I was VERY careful to keep it perfectly level. So the leftovers had to go straight to the trash. Had I boxed them up myself, I'd have left out the sauces, especially the one I clearly hadn't touched (why would I want to take that one home if I didn't care to eat any of it there?) Still, it's a nice once-in-a-while treat. I enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I'll forget all about this experience before I go again next year."
Jessica B.,"Hillsboro, OR",135,132,116,3.0,11/23/2015,"The spicy chicken chipotle pasta (hold the chicken) has gone downhill in flavor over the years. I also asked for no peas, but the dish came out with peas. One time I got the vegetarian ""burger"" and the taste would cause a meat eater to think vegetarian food is gross. From what I remember, the appetizers were good the times I did get them. However, the price of an appetizer is the same as an entrée that I would get elsewhere at a decent restaurant. The cheesecakes are always a bit too sweet for my liking. The item I love most is the complimentary bread! Regardless of food quality and taste, the service is always excellent. I admire these people for the work they do in this hectic environment. The ambiance is alright if you don't mind crowds of people. The fact is, CF will always get good business even with a low Yelp! rating. People love this kind of stuff. I don't intend on coming back here anytime soon. The price you pay is just not worth the food you get."
Holly V.,"Seattle, WA",73,67,483,4.0,1/9/2017,"I love coming to Cheesecake Factory it's really pretty inside. Went on Sunday so it wasn't busy at all and got seated right away. The menu is huge!!! There's so many food to choose from. Our server was super friendly and our food came out at a good time, didn't have to wait too long for our food. The portion was really big but worth the price we paid. The food we got was really good and tasty and flavor just perfectly. Was super full after lunch but we still had room to share a piece of cheesecake. It's a must to eat a piece of cheesecake when coming here since their know for that. Just like the food menu, the dessert menu for cheesecake is crazy huge too. So many flavors and options of cheesecake to choose from."
Sienna P.,"Southwest Portland, Portland, OR",0,8,2,5.0,8/18/2017,"Yum! Big shout out for Deborah  great service, funny lady, she's the best. I got the spicy chicken chipotle pasta and it was amazing."
Ken F.,"Kaneohe, HI",0,5,,1.0,7/30/2017,"The food was poor at best. My wife's order of Marsala chicken was tasteless and incorrect- it came with potatoes and she asked for pasta.  They forgot our appetizer and, once seated -we waited more than 30 minutes just to order. I ordered chicken and biscuits.  The chicken was over cooked and dry.  The chicken was pounded so thin ( 2-4 mm thick) it barely resembled meat.! The gravy was tasteless and was slight more viscous than water.  The only other Cheesecake Factory that I have eaten at was in Honolulu and I enjoyed it.  I would never return to this particular location again!"
N B.,"Vancouver, WA",3,35,136,2.0,3/27/2017,"Went here soon to close, this is what we got  Thai lettuce wraps-- so good, order it, it's worth it.  Crab and artichoke dip-- it honestly tasted fishy, not crabby, didn't find any lumps of crab it was mostly artichoke, and I would never order this again.  Chicken taquitos -- again another miss. Verde didn't taste like verde, the Pico was old, you can tell right away when the tomatoes don't have any integrity, mushy, and also if you look at the skin of the tomato it ends up turning white. If you go, just get the Thai lettuce wraps. And then you feel bad for saying the crab and artichoke dip and taquitos are not Good. Maybe it was just an off day.....  Great, happy service, but the food did fall short. Super short.... (Besides the Thai lettuce wraps)  :("
Lori B.,"Battle Ground, WA",0,7,,2.0,12/16/2017,"Went there for lunch today, yes we expected a long wait and it was.   The hostess that took our buzzer appeared to really be having a bad day or doesn't like her job.  ""Wait here for you name"" almost rude!    Got seated ordered our drinks I asked for iced tea with extra lemon, there was 1.   We asked for extra lemon and sweetener,   Brought the lemon but then had to ask again for sweetener,  this is 20 minutes in now.    Finally got it and asked for silverware so we could butter the bread.   The busboy was in such a hurry almost tossing the knives and forks towards us.   Could have left them neatly at end of table.   Once we ordered another 30 plus minutes for food, I get it they were busy.   My husbands and sons food looked and tasted amazing.   I got the lunch special with soup and salad,  with dressing on the side.   It was all mixed up and was more of ceaser than the ranch I requested.   My soup was good,   Luke warm.   I am sure if it was hot it would have been great.   Asked for to go containers she brought one and nothing to put a full bowl of soup in.   Had to ask for another one, twice.   Was not impressed, for the price we pay I expected more."
Jeanette Z.,"Beaverton, OR",79,8,5,5.0,7/23/2017,"We ate here late. So our waiter was on it. I wish I could say something bad about it, because 5 stars is a lot I know for a chain restaurant. First time eating at a CF, they didn't have where I'm from. The salad, the roasted mashed potatoes and filet was perfect! Just like I ordered. The filet was literally so tender I could have cut with a fork. Too full for cheesecake. Our waiter was so nice. He asked us if we wanted to take home a couple pieces for all of us to share that they could not sell because they got a little mushed on the corner. My niece and nephew loved it when we got home. I was surprised how good everything was. I mean I'd heard good things but their steak and cheesecake are terrific! There are so many good sounding things to try on the menu that it would take  forever! All the different items would take forever to try."
A B.,"Brea, CA",6,54,25,1.0,10/8/2016,"Today was not the day for Cheesecake Factory.we were a big party and instead of seating us at open tables we were squished in booth.   Service was so slow. Bread was stale. I had to ask for cream and sugar for the coffee. Food was slow to come out and when I asked the response was because we ordered too much food all at once. We ordered a sandwich and 4 appetizers.  It was not a good impression for our visiting guest so we left without ordering full meals.  Adding insult to injury, management couldn't care less."
Jace R.,"Vancouver, WA",98,46,8,2.0,11/4/2016,"My wife and I had the day to spend together and we thought, why not treat ourselves to lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. Service: main reason for less stars.  It was not busy, but yet they made us wait 10 minutes to be seated.  Then seated us right by the kitchen with what sounded like a dish throwing war going on!  We asked to be moved then they put us right in the center completely in the open.  Lol.  It felt like I was eating on stage.  Food: It was decent.  Portions were small for the price and ratio of food was not right.  Flavor was there though. We'd go back, but we'd be more selective as to what we'd order, etc..."
Katie S.,"Brush Prairie, WA",3,83,5,2.0,7/6/2017,Super mediocre experience and we left asking if we just ate fast food? There was nothing romantic or personalized about this place. Our dinners came out at different times. We probably won't be back
Aleksandr B.,"Salem, OR",43,68,49,5.0,6/26/2016,"Atmosphere amazing, food was great, service lovely, and our waitress was best of all.. Thank you Katherine! ;) Kept checking on us and making sure drinks were filled and everything..best waitress I think I have ever had anywhere in my personal experience and opinion. ;)"
Jane V.,"Newberg, OR",43,197,362,3.0,12/8/2015,"Before we walked in we saw customers with the digital callers waiting for a table. Not a good sign. Walked through the restaurant door and 30 plus customers sitting, standing, and waiting to get signed up for a table. We headed straight to the bar hoping for a shorter wait.  The bar area is quite large with many tables and a long bar that must seat 20. Everything was full  except two chairs on the end of the bar. It was being cleaned off and we did not see anyone waiting. Lucky us. We snatched it up.  The bartender greeted us right away and asked if we are having cocktails and/or food. We took our time to order food since the menu is quite extensive. It was very difficult to read the menu due to the very dim lighting. We really like the atmosphere. The lighting made it quite intimate  even though the restaurant was packed. I guess this is when one can use their phone for additional lighting in reading the menu. I know my dad would not have been able to read it even with glasses. We ordered the bar size Asian salad and the Cuban sandwich with sweet potato fries. My daughter and I share everything. Even with the smaller salad we could not finish it all. We thought the salad had a good combination of chicken and vegetables with some mandarin oranges and dressing. The Cuban sandwich  was on a baguette with a assortment of meats and a few pickles. Very simple, very filling, very large. The sandwich was brought to us with a side salad not the sweet potato fries as we ordered. I was surprised that the server took the salad of the plate in exchange for the fries. Not that we would have room to eat it anyway but most places just leave it and also bring the correct item. We waited for a good 10 minute for the fries. Got charged for them too. 10 minutes was a long time. We did not have dessert which I am sure going to The Cheesecake Factory and not having cheesecake is a crime. Maybe next time if we have a lighter lunch. I blame it on the bread and butter they offer after we ordered drinks."
Berenice C.,"Portland, OR",0,1,,3.0,10/20/2017,Don't understand the hype over this place. The fettuccine Alfredo was very bland tasted like water with uncooked noodles the drinks were alright and service was pretty decent. Biggest complaint is the over pricing for the disappointing food
Michael B.,"Portland, OR",201,107,12,2.0,3/26/2016,"This is a difficult review because I don't necessarily like chain restaurants and the automated nature of them. So here is as unbiased review I can write.  1. I've been here twice and there's an ungodly wait for lunch. Why people would wait 45 minutes to eat at a chain attached to.a mall I don't know.  2. Service was very good and no complaints or issues. 3. The food is decent for a chain restaurant. I had a sandwich which was good but nothing special. GF had a salad which looked good. Tried several apps which were good. Overall, maybe a notch above an Applebee's food. 4. Prices seem decent but not great.  In conclusion,  not a place I would go on my own but good enough if dragged to for a birthday celebration."
Robert H.,"Eugene, OR",195,2,,1.0,7/8/2017,This place is so over priced and horribly managed. Spent over 30 mins waiting for 3 slices of cheesecake that was pre sliced. They had so many people just standing around talking not helping out customers. I won't ever go back here.
Agathe D.,"Santa Cruz, CA",143,18,19,3.0,12/3/2016,"Food is good. Service is impeccable. Bring a flashlight, or a small lamp. It's basically pitch black in there. Was sad to hear they won't be serving ahi anymore :("
Debbie F.,"Sherwood - Tualatin South, Tualatin, OR",10,3,7,5.0,6/21/2017,"Been a big fan of cheesecake factory. The portions are a good size and the food is excellent. The atmosphere is casual. And if you love cheese cake there's no better place. Today I had Thai lettuce wraps, and my husband had the salmon on the lunch menu."
Laura C.,"Portland, OR",164,791,140,2.0,8/22/2016,"While I love the food here, I was very irritated yesterday when I put a gift card and cash in the book with my bill and the server used the cash up and gave me the gift card back with $10 left on it. Clearly the gift card was meant to be used up and the cash to pay the small overage. I would have had him re-run the bill but it was super busy and we were all leaving and he'd disappeared. For future reference servers, if you are not clear about what the customers intent is, ask - because now I have a bad taste in my mouth, whereas my shrimp dish should have left a good one."
Serena R.,"Lincoln City, OR",0,5,,5.0,2/4/2017,"Kudos to the team for handling a very challenging customer this evening!  This restaurant was busy and quite full on a Saturday evening. I chose to wait for a spot at the bar which ended up being a thirty minute wait. No problem for me, perfect time to do some people watching while my husband shopped in the mall I witnessed a lady get very disgruntled over the fact that some low tables in the bar area opened up and she was told she was not able to sit there. The staff member informed her super politely that these tables were part of the restaurant seating (which there was an hour wait for at this point) not bar seating. In her defense it isn't super obvious that this is the case while waiting for a spot at the bar. However my personal tactic would be to say okay and continue to wait for what is the bar section to open up. Not this lady! She proceeded to stop most every member of wait staff who walked by and engage other patrons in her frustration. Someone (I'm assuming a manager)came over and with wonderfully disarming body language and polite words she somewhat settled the lady. Fast forward another five minutes to getting a seat at the bar (where I got the distinct honor of sitting next to this gem). She was still berating the employees for the seating policy and all three of the people behind the bar were so respectful to her. She had some challenging requests like a not very sweet MaiTaiand she didn't like the lighting. I watched a waiter bring her a candle. Mostly the point of this ridiculously long post is to say well done staff! You all showed a lot of kindness and genuine care to someone who wasn't so easy to handle. I left this experience admiring all of you. Thank you!"
