Michelle D.,"West Richland, WA",0,30,8,3.0,5/13/2017,"We came just for the Cheesecake. Never been to any cheesecake factory before. Service was good, I think our server was Greg, but not sure. I got the raspberry lemon, my boyfriend got the salted caramel.  Both were AMAZING! Not to sweet.  This was 2 days ago, and I'm still thinking about it.  We will stop here every time on our way to the coast. They're food looked really good too, hoping to stop in for lunch one of these days... and if it's as good as it looks, I'm hoping to up my review to 5 stars."
Angelica A.,"Vancouver, WA",94,148,30,5.0,12/7/2015,"Thought we'd try this location after shopping at Washington Square on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was clean, however wasn't much seating for the 30 min wait. They were passing out samples of Pumpkin Cheesecake which I loved, and we were called about the given wait time.  Our waiter was a late 30's, early 40's woman which black hair. I wish I could remember her name, because she was phenomenal! Very sweet and attentive to my son, had his food out first, and made sure we were taken care of. If you haven't been to Cheesecake Factory, your missing out. The food is phenomenal and is a great price for the large portions they give. Plus their French bread is my favorite!  Favorite Dishes: - Chicken Mediera  - Habachi Steak - Fish Tacos & don't forget to try Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake while your there!"
Conrad G.,"Beaverton, OR",9,12,7,3.0,6/19/2016,"I got the combo shrimp scampi and steak plate for $21 and it only came with 3 bite size pieces of steak and 3 pieces of shrimp with about a measuring cup full of mashed potatoes. Seriously under portioned for just about anyone besides a child. I left hungry needless to say. Also the waiter was unprofessional and argumentative, oddly he walked around with his shirt untucked and his pants below his butt as he waited on tables. Not really impressed by the overall experience. Make sure you don't order the combo plates if you come here, unless you're just looking for a snack!"
M. C.,"Eugene, OR",3,10,14,4.0,7/8/2016,"I love the cheesecake factory and come here almost every time I visit Washington Square Mall. They have so many food choices and almost everything I've tried turned out to be successful!  My most recent visit was during the lunch hour so I was able to get lunch portions, the full portions are HUGE! I had the Thai Cashew Salmon.. I believe it was? I loved thai curry and I wish it had a little more sauce to go with my brown rice(white or brown rice option) but I had too much rice anyways. The salmon had good flavor, only I think it was a little on the dry side. Again, I think more sauce may have made the dish a little better. I usually get their pasta dishes, and was a little hesitant trying out something new but I'm glad I did!"
Lance M.,"Vancouver, WA",2,23,7,3.0,3/4/2017,The food always gets a 5 star but man this location sucks! We were called to be seated after a 40 min wait which is no big deal at Cheesecake Factory but when we waited at the counter two more couples that came in after us were called to be seated while we stood and watched then they acted like we never handed in our buzzer. So strange. Anyways we are seated and our waitress says take a look at the menu and we already knew our apps and drinks so she told us to hold that thought and she had to help other tables. So drinks came 15 mins later. Just doesn't sit well with a $100 bill to be herded like cattle and slung slop. Hope they can turn the staff around because the chefs still got it there wait staff sux!
YingTsung C.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,3.0,4/3/2017,Wrong dishe delivered and salmon we ordered  didn't well cook. When our meal was redone I can't find my mesh potato. They send us a cake as apology but we don't feel good for overall dinner. So I give them 3 star this time.
Yeshua I.,"Portland, OR",0,51,5,1.0,2/3/2017,40 minutes after we ordered to food at table... very slow and dangerously slippery floors. Half restaurant is empty still 40 minute wait going elsewhere seems like cheese cake management needs to open alternate location.  2/3/2017 fish and chips were disgusting.
Paige H.,"Portland, OR",0,30,,2.0,3/7/2017,"Fun atmosphere, nice waitstaff. I have been getting the fish tacos for years. They changed the item and they now are 4 mini tacos instead of 4 normal size tacos. So you are getting less than 1/2 the amount of fish and toppings for the same price. The rice was hard and crunchy. This was 8 pm on a Tuesday night, next time I'm just going to Chipotle."
Liesl S.,"Vancouver, WA",0,5,,3.0,8/8/2017,"Meh. Went because someone gave me a giftcard. The Caesar salad was good, pizza was a bit crispy (read: black), and cheesecake was good. Impressed with the variety on menu, though! A bit noisy and crowded for my liking, but works fine if you just want to shovel decent food into your mouth (like lots of people around us did), rather than actually visit with a dinner companion. On the upside, the service was great (even if it was with the goal of turning tables over quickly), and we didn't wait more than a minute for anything. Definitely don't regret going, but probably won't be back unless I end up with another giftcard!"
Jennifer A.,"Vancouver, WA",8,84,110,5.0,2/4/2017,Kearra was great tonight for my family 12. On a super busy Saturday night with a large family  you know you're going to have a long wait. But once we were at our table she really took care of us.
Marina M.,"Portland, OR",1,34,16,1.0,5/1/2016,"Our water glasses were dirty, we had to get new ones. The darker colored bread tasted like a brick. It was so hard and old and dry. My cheeseburger was burnt and we had to wait 45 minutes for a burger and a sandwich. So terrible and awful!"
MA S.,"Vancouver, WA",0,9,,2.0,8/7/2017,"We have been here many times. Have had birthdays and other special events here.Had a not so great experience Sunday night. They were super busy as is typical. We were seated. The service was slow but we figured it would be. My husband ordered a dish with chorizo and stated he did not want bacon in it. We finally got his food which was served awhile after the rest of us got our food. They put it in from of him and said, "" no bacon."" There was bacon all through the dish. My husband commented on it. The manager came over and apologized and said he would talk with the chef. They didn't give us any money off the dish or do anything except a curt apology. My shrimps were over cooked and still had a lot of peel on them. Granddaughter's burger was over cooked. Anyone can have an off night. We will likely go back but the manager handled this very poorly. Overall experience was just plain bad."
Andrea H.,"Beaverton, OR",60,175,28,2.0,1/5/2017,"After living right by this location for almost two years, we finally dined inside the actual restaurant. We've gotten takeout several times and it's always a nightmare. No matter what time of day you go, there are lines spilling to the door, the wait is long, and just trying to pay and pick up your food can easily take 20 minutes.  Nonetheless, we felt adventurous and thought perhaps going on a Monday at 5PM might help our chances. Nope. We walked in and stood in line for about 5 minutes to put our names down - 40 minute wait for a table for 4. We didn't feel like going anywhere else so we stuck with it. My parents went shopping and my husband and I somehow found a spot at the bar. Super friendly and attentive bartenders, and the happy hour menu was enticing just because of the value, but we figured we would wait to have food until being seated. We were seated after about 45 minutes, and were given a nice booth.  Our server was fine, nothing special. We ordered our food and it came out fairly quickly. Everyone was satisfied with what they ordered. However, my mom ordered the Chicken and Avocado salad, and it came with no avocado. The restaurant was so dark that I used the flashlight on my phone to get lighting so we could see if we were just crazy. No avocado in a salad that has avocado in the title? We thought maybe it was just at the bottom, but no, there was none. Simple mistake. However, when we told our server he looked at us like we were from another planet. He assured us there was avocado in the salad and left. My mom took several bites and there certainly was no avocado in her salad. We got him back over and he looked at us as if we were trying to pull something on him, so he just said he would bring her a side dish of a sliced up avocado. It was a weird exchange. I also had to remind him to bring me my side of fries, twice. I usually order the chicken salad sandwich because it's just that good, but this time it was bland and missing something. It seemed a bit dry and tasteless so i was disappointed.  Overall, it was a lackluster experience. I don't expect much from chains, but everything just seemed a bit disorganized and as if they didn't really care about their guests. Oh well. Perhaps we'll stick with the bar next time since they were the friendliest and most attentive?"
Joe S.,"Beaverton, OR",1,143,152,2.0,1/14/2017,"Been to The Cheese Cake Factory in many cities and I honestly I don't get the big deal people make about this place. I only come here because the people that I'm with insist on coming here. Apart from the desserts, the have food is just average for the amount of money you pay. This location at Washington Square is particularly the worst that I've been to. Yes presentation is nice, but what's the point if it doesn't taste good. On a slow night like it was there shouldn't be any excuse for food to come out as tasteless as it was. Barley any seasons on the meat, fries taste okay but not fresh and hot (been sitting under the heater for a while), fish and chips mediocre, first bite from both ends is just batter with no fish, coleslaw and sauce tasted good. Service was okay. Waited a while for food to come out."
Kristie G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,9,9,2.0,1/28/2017,Very slow service. Alfredo came out way over cooked. And I waited ten min to tell the lady I didn't want it anymore. Wish my service was great like the last time I was there.
Joseph T.,"Camas, WA",79,21,4,4.0,2/10/2017,Come by and enjoy a huge selection of food! Great place to eat out when you're in the area. Would suggest it!
Rian A.,"Beaverton, OR",10,137,,1.0,12/21/2016,"Thanks to this companies refusal to serve law enforcement, they lost my business."
Weston P.,"Sanger, CA",406,192,103,5.0,5/6/2015,I come here not because I'm in a hurry. I come here to relax get excellent service for the most part and get decent food. For me I love the small plates menu. It has an excellent choice of items that are low calorie for restaurants. Personally I love the lettuce wrap tacos Asian style. It's a lot of food for cheap. On the even lighter side the Greek salad and beet and goat cheese salads are pretty tasty. Tonight I had Daniel N. For a server and he had a huge table to take care of and I never felt like I had to wait so he deserves recognition for pulling that off.
Stephanie M.,"Eugene, OR",457,136,366,4.0,5/26/2015,"I hardly think I need to actually review the food here... I am a Cheesecake Factory snob... suffice it to say I drove 2 hours to be able to eat here for my birthday because there isn't one in Eugene... I used to live in San Diego and visited one at least once a week.  Here are some food suggestions -- Lemon Chicken Costoletta (sp?), Chicken Madeira, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps (yes its an appetizer and yes its big enough for an entree), Buffalo Chicken Blasts, Cajun Chicken Littles, Steak Diane, BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad, Boston Salad -- the list actually goes on and on -- but these are some of my favorites! So this visit was a bit disappointing ONLY due to the fact that we waited 2 HOURS to get a table.  After driving 2 hours though I wasn't going to leave (which I believe the hostess secretly wanted actually). It was just too insanely busy though and it was rather disappointing to know that they were severely unorganized at the hostess stand.  Some people waiting near us had been told that they were out of pagers and to return in an hour to see where they were in line.  They came back in an hour and were told their name had already been called -- then after some insistence were told it would be only another 10 minutes and 30 minutes later they were called -- NOT OKAY -  Once seated, however, service was outstanding!  I love the food and drinks here.  I even took an extra entree home for lunch for the next couple of days.  Just be prepared for quite a wait...  LOVE this place -- definitely get the bread basket -- you can get it at lunch if you want just ask... dinner they should serve it automatically.  Also try the ranch they make it and it is  FANTASTIC! Cheesecake -- well I am not a sweet lover -- but you can't go wrong with their cheesecake -- really any of them -- I am on a mango key lime kick -- but others have served me well over the years."
R C.,"Lake Oswego, OR",0,6,1,1.0,10/10/2016,"I feel bad for the wait staff having to serve the sub par food at this establishment. This was my second time to this location this year resulting in the same opinion of the food. Although my 1st visit did not receive a review, this one does.  My food came out warm(ish) and acceptable however my guest was not as lucky. Her tacos were ice cold and the (semi-soft) tortillas were cold and brittle. Sending the order back resulted in a 15 minute wait and an awkward eating arrangement as I had a plate and she did not. The replacement order of chicken tacos were slightly better and appeared fresher. However the portions of chicken in each was poultry. (Pun intended). If these are predetermined portions, someone needs a raise because they are saving The C.F. a ton in food costs. The meal was terrible! The manager on duty stopped by to offer his apologies and acknowledged that the replacement order was taking an inordinate amount of time as did our embarrassed server.  OK, here's the kicker.....$65.00 meal, cold food, measly portions and one returned entree. Not one item was comp'd, not a slice of cheesecake, glass of wine, beer.....nothing! I don't enjoy complaining or sending an item back and certainly don't make a habit of it but when I do I expect some form of compensation for the ineptitude of the kitchen staff. There are too many excellent places to eat in this town to have to suffer this places poor form again. The Cheesecake Factory should be ashamed of requiring their servers to present food like that! I doubt that I will return and hope that readers of this review choose other quality places around there like Nordstrom Cafe, Thirsty Lion or even Orange Julius for that matter.  Thanks for reading."
