Katherine V.,"Toronto, Canada",105,4,1,4.0,1/10/2018,"So far I've visited Yorkdale's Cheesecake Factory twice and both visits were pretty great. Their selection of specialty dishes and cheesecakes is so large that it is a little overwhelming when it comes to choosing what to eat, especially for someone as indecisive as myself.  The first time I went, I tried the Chicken Madeira which was recommended by the server and the Tiramisu cheesecake. The Chicken Madeira is supposedly one of the most popular specialty items and it was really good; the chicken was very soft and the mashed potatoes were smooth and creamy. The size of the specialty dishes are very large, however they can be a little pricey (the Chicken Madeira costs $26). Although the portions are large, it may not be quite enough for two people. I shared the Chicken Madeira with a friend, however I think we both have a small appetite and we had plenty of bread with our dish. The Tiramisu cheesecake was very nice and light--would recommend! What's really great about the Cheesecake Factory is its unlimited bread and butter to keep you busy while you wait for your food to arrive. The servers are also pretty good at checking up on you and making sure that you have enough bread and water at all times. The servers I had during both visits were very friendly and attentive.  Although the wait can be quite long, I'd much rather wait 1-2 hours to be seated at the Cheesecake Factory than dine at Pickle Barrel."
Greg F.,"Toronto, Canada",5,74,65,3.0,1/10/2018,"My friends and I went to the Cheesecake Factory intending on eating lunch at 3pm but we had to wait 3 hours for a table and ended up eating dinner instead at 6pm.  I ordered the fish tacos and for dessert their classic strawberry cheesecake. The food was delicious and it was a good portion size, but really expensive!! Usually ordering some tacos at any other restaurant wouldn't be more than $15 -- but at the Cheesecake Factory basically every menu item is $20+. Plus the one slice of cheesecake I had for dessert was an extra $10 (ouch). In the end I ended up spending roughly $35 for dinner with tax and tips. The food was definitely good, but not worth the price or the 3 hour wait. I know everyone wants to experience the cheesecake factory for themselves, regardless of the wait times and prices -- so my advice would be to bring a laptop or predownload some shows ahead of time on your phone. You'll thank me later."
Laleh H.,"Markham, Canada",6,113,48,5.0,1/8/2018,"Wow - i'm stunned by the negative reviews on here. I am a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory, i have been to several locations in the US including the Walden Galleria location (check out my review!). One thing remains the same - great quality, great service, amazing variety and huge portions! We arrived at Yorkdale Mall at 12pm. The idea was lunch and if the line up and wait time was too long, we would leave and eat somewhere else. The first thing i noticed when walking in was there was no direction or signs posted to let people know where to check in to give their names, or to line up if there was one. There was a counter to the left with 3 people behind it and a podium to the right with 1 person behind it, so i walked over to the podium. I asked if there was a wait time and how long it was. The answer was ""75-90 min with no guarantee"". That threw me off because other than people walking in & out of the mall, the entrance was clear. I asked her where we could leave our name etc. and she answered back ""there is a line up in front of Victoria's Secret"". Glad i asked otherwise there are no signs or anyone directing people that are trying to get in to the restaurant other than Security once someone tries to walk in. FYI at that time, she hadn't bothered to tell me that the line up in front of Victoria's Secret was just a line up that we had to wait in, to come back to her and give our names. That was my biggest issue with the process, not the wait time! It's a mall people. If you can't find something to do with a buzzer in your hand that allows you to go as far as Sporting Life, then that's your issue. We lined up at 12:15pm. It didn't look too bad and moved 3 times in 30 min which got us back to the main podium near the door at 12:45pm. I was given a buzzer and told to come back in 75-90 min. We sat on the benches in front of the Godiva Store with a bunch of other people also waiting for a table. We did some shopping and window shopping to pass the time. Kids had some snacks & their tablets to keep them busy.  Honestly, if it were a stand alone location, there was no chance in he$$ we would've waited even half of that. Thankful for the mall being there and so much to see & do to keep busy. We were finally seated by 2:45pm. Our server (Brittany) was great! She apologized for the wait time after introducing herself. I mentioned our daughter's peanut/nut allergy right after she greeted us. She listened carefully and said she would talk to the kitchen before any of our orders were put through. She took the kids orders and our appetizer order and went to get our drinks. We never had to flag her down or look for her. She was at our table & others frequently and made sure drinks were topped up, empty plates were cleared and ALWAYS asked if we needed anything else and how we were doing and how our meal was. Our order: Hibachi Hanger Steak w/shiitake mushrooms, onions & bean sprouts, wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura battered asparagus. My hubby loved this dish! His steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I couldn't try it as i have an allergy to shiitake mushrooms, but he said it was perfectly cooked & seasoned and it was a nice large portion and definitely something he would order again! I ordered the Grilled Steak Tacos - OMG this was super super delish! Honestly, i was looking at the large salads & burgers that i usually have, but decided to try something new. Hands down one of THE best steak tacos i've ever had at a restaurant - ok, other than in Mexico! 4 small tacos filled with perfectly grilled tender steak seasoned so well that i could eat nothing else and be happy! It was topped with chopped avocado, tomatoes, cilantro, crispy onions & chipotle sauce. On the side: a small bowl of black beans & a side of rice.  Our 7 yr old with the peanut/nut allergy wanted macaroni & cheese. Her food was brought out right after our appetizer by another server. She explained that it took a little longer because all the bowls & utensils to make her food were cleaned for her order to ensure no cross contamination or contact with any nut products. I was floored by this. Who does this at restaurants?! AMAZING! My daughter LOVED the macaroni & cheese! Our 4 yr old ordered chicken tenders & fries - 5 lightly battered crispy chicken tender strips. Served with 2 dipping sauces - huge hit! Red Velvet Cheesecake - OMG YUM - just try it! FYI - you can order take out at the counter to the left of the mall entrance. There is a counter with cash register & menus. Wait time is 20-30 min. If you want to order dessert to go, there is a line up at the bakery inside, or you can put an order in through your server when you are ordering your food. It saves time! They don't serve any frozen food - everything is made fresh to order. Would love to see a location at Markville Mall after their current expansion. Or Vaughan Mills. Another location would certainly help the wait times & line ups. We can't wait to go back!"
Mel C.,"Scarborough, Canada",159,330,1816,5.0,1/5/2018,"I've always been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory because of their large selection of food and big portion. I was excited to try The Cheesecake Factory to see if it'll be the same as the States. The fried zucchini ($7.95) was very good - perfectly coated and deep friend. There were no issues with the batter falling off the zucchini. I remember enjoying the avocado eggrolls ($14.95) and they were also really good especially with the minty sauce. I like how they took two very healthy food and turned it unhealthy :P The Pasta da Vinci ($16.95 - lunch portion) had caramelized onions, mushrooms, and chicken. The chicken was very tender and the overall dish was very flavourful. I thought the portion was decent for the price. The service was great and the food came quite quickly. They were incredibly organized with the whole lineup (which they should be since they've been opened for a while now). I'm so glad there's finally a restaurant I like inside Yorkdale!"
Janice L.,"Markham, Canada",96,76,204,4.0,1/4/2018,"Lined up for 1.5hour to get the pager to try out the new cheesecake factory at Yorkdale. The lineup was quite the experience, they had security escort us through different segments of the line throughout the mall. After we finally got to the pager, the wait was about 30mins more. Food: I really enjoyed the food in terms of taste and portion size. Ordered the chicken Bellagio and  the combination with pasta was good. Chicken was nice and crispy, sauce was good balance of flavour and creaminess.  I ordered dulce de leche cheesecake and celebration cheesecake. Celebration was Allright, nothing special since it has too much of the add ons which take away from it. Dulce de leche is good! Atmosphere: The atmosphere and service was great. Very accommodating and attentive. They advised us that there was a long wait for cheesecake and to choose early and order it at the same time as the entree. Although I changed my mind halfway through the meal, they were still able to accommodate with getting it to me in a reasonable time frame after my meal.  I wish there wasn't such a long wait for a table so that I can visit again more."
Sheena Y.,"Toronto, Canada",876,449,1854,4.0,12/26/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory and not because they have yummy cheesecakes.  They have a huge selection of things to eat from all day breakfast to yummy sandwiches.   I love their nachos, and the banana cream pie cheesecake.  I think they need more locations cus the lineups are insane! Also our server Darren was super nice and attentive.  He made our experience at the Cheesecake Factory a lot better!"
Yune L.,"Markham, Canada",27,70,64,4.0,12/21/2017,"I lined up on a Monday at 11:00. The restaurant opens at 11:30. Now that's dedication. I was absolutely determined to eat here! I ended up sitting at 12:15 - they don't want to overwhelm the kitchen so they seat tables slowly. Beware if you come in a big group - they do not reserve for tables bigger than 7. You would need to split your group into two tables and based on the lines, unfortunately there is no guarantee on where they will be sitting (may not be close to each other). Luckily I lined up early enough to get first pick of the tables and the hostess kindly arranged for our two tables to be together. Now onto the food. Yes these are big portions but you are definitely paying for it. The pasta I got costs $25 but it doesn't not feel like it's worth the $10 extra for a bigger portion. You are definitely stuffed from eating one entrée. Food wise, definitely good for a chain restaurant but there is more focus on quantity than quality.  I really liked the cheesecake. I tried the tiramisu cheesecake - so surprised by how light it was! I think the slice looks smaller than the states but it was good! Would definitely get cheesecake takeout next time. Id definitely be back for cake but I don't think I'll be lining up again..."
Danny C.,"Toronto, Canada",85,77,98,4.0,12/27/2017,"As the hype train is still roaring on since it's grand opening only a few short weeks ago, my friend and I opted for take-out instead of dining in. We waited about 30 minutes in total from start to finish to get our take out versus probably 1.5 hrs minimum to be seated.  We ended up ordering the Red Velvet and Mango Key Lime cakes. The cakes themselves are quite something; tasty, moist and definitely lives up to their reputation. My friend mentioned that the cakes pale in comparison to the American counterpart, but is similar enough to warrant a pass. As good as the cakes are, for $9 a slice this is one experience I would recommend only once in a blue moon unless you are dying to unload your wallet for the sweet tooth fix."
Darryl C.,"Mississauga, Canada",50,65,209,4.0,12/15/2017,"Had to try the first Canadian location after countless visits to the US. Both my fiancé and I agree that it did not disappoint. The portion size, interior design and menus are all the same. The prices are slightly higher which is to be expected since it is in Canadian dollar.  We ordered the buffalo blasts as a starter and they were great. Fried chicken fillets stuffed with cheese and buffalo sauce with blue cheese and more buffalo sauce on the side for dipping. For a starter, this came with 7 huge pieces, good for sharing in larger groups rather than just us 2. For the mains, I ordered the louisiana chicken pasta while the fiancé had their daily special which was a Thai glazed salmon. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the crispy Louisiana chicken complemented it well. The salmon tasted very fresh and was not overcooked. To finish off our meal, we ordered the strawberry shortcake which consists of 2 shortcakes cut in half, with ice cream in the middle, surrounded by a mound of fresh strawberries, a must try. We also had a few cheesecake slices for take out.  My only gripe however is the lineup to get in. Had to wait about an hour for a buzzer and came back an hour after we were given one to be seated. Granted, it was only their second week of operation so I'll give them a bit of a reprieve. For those who do not want to wait that long, they have a take out counter as well outside of the restaurant. Will definitely be back."
Chantal Y.,"Toronto, Canada",43,84,316,1.0,12/14/2017,"Where do I start off? Luckily skipped that horrendous line up that wraps around Victoria secret just to get that buzzer and your name down.  We got sat down at the booths near the mall entrance ( try not to sit there because it's freezing cold cause of the mall entrance door)  Problem is they seated us fast, however have awfully lazy servers who never checked up on our table, and our food took 1hour to come!!! We ordered the Topical blended drinknwith raspberry swirl, Nashville  bites, Pizza Parmigana with angel hair pasta, Orange chicken ( for fun) and the Spicy Chicken and Shrimp Cajun pasta.  Now these are all dishes we enjoy very much in the USA. And find delicious and well balanced flavours.  However at Cheesecake in Canada, our rules, regulations and safety standard's definitly tweaked the taste ... and not in a good way! The meat all tasted like a Tofu substitute or maybe 30% meat and rest filler. The Pizza Style Parmigana is supposed to be chopped up and seasoned chicken breast. Like I said it tasted like seasoned tofu or processed fake chicken meats! Didn't expect that with Canada's high food standards.  The food was all SALT salt salt. But not no sugar to create the blissful perfection of sweet and savoury ( which is for sure the reasons why we eat out ! Seasoning)  So salty we couldn't stomach It, and packed up to go containers.  Getting back to the sad part of waiting 1 hour to received our food, while watchinf others getting their mains, who had arrived before us . There were others in the same or worse boat than us ! Waiting 2 hours for their food.  Now this is where it gets good, the Cajun pasta, changed the seasoning from the USA one added more salt and less Cayenne and Paprika. The seasoning wasn't spicy like usual. This dish is the reason why my husband and I are on the toilet and sick!!! Very disappointed in the standards and how this restaurant was run. No good first impressions here.  The staff were dismissive when complaints were made by us, snickering and gossiping about customers at their attendent station, and management was so flustered they forgot why they are even at our table. I watched endlessly as our experience also was what everyone else felt too in our section !  The management blamed our one dish as the reason the rest of food was late, however it happened to be the coldest thing we got lol....  Anyways I have said enough. I understand it will never be the same as USA. But it isn't even close to reaching the first hurdle in service, quality and taste. ! I dont recommend this or even wasting time waiting. Your better off hopping over to Buffalo and having it where it's made right !!  Seriously disappointed at this opening of an amazing Chain but ONLY when you eat in the USA.  Good luck everyone with your journey to Cheese cake Factory !"
Daniel A.,"Vaughan, Canada",7,42,47,4.0,12/24/2017,"My experience at The Cheesecake Factory began on a good note as I was lucky enough to have not waited to get in! And the good continued... Our server was pleasant and took the time to talk to us much longer than a server would normally have time for. I later learned that this is because servers here only have 3-4 tables at a time - probably because they just opened? We ordered a couple dishes - a Pizza-Style Chicken Parmesan and the Chicken Bellagio, one of their best sellers. Both dishes were HUGE and surprisingly decent, though not overwhelmingly (come here for portions, not for great food). And as always, the cheesecakes were decadent and delicious. I'm typically not a fan of ubiquitous chain restaurants, especially restaurants with hundreds of items on the menu (e.g. Pickle Barrel), but The Cheesecake Factory exceeded my expectations!"
Harry L.,"Markham, Canada",11,61,31,4.0,12/20/2017,"The lines for The Cheesecake Factory are still insane to eat in, but today I got a slice of Tiramisu cheesecake for take out, it's really expensive at $9.95 + tax but it was a nice treat. The cheesecake was very smooth and creamy, had great flavour and texture. It seemed to taste better than when I had it at US stores, maybe it's just extra fresh cause of the high turnover at this location. I'd come again to maybe get a whole cheesecake next time."
Shaheer M.,"Ajax, Canada",47,165,187,2.0,1/5/2018,"Giving a perspective of somebody who has never been to any cheesecake factory ever and have never tried their cheesecakes. We did a takeout for cheesecake on an evening. We got two cheesecakes and I didn't like any of them. We got Red Velvet and Peanut something and I found both of them to be overly sweet, the sugar took all the flavour and none of the other flavours could thrive. Going by my previous experiences with cheesecake, I am under the impression that every good cheesecake has a sour touch to it, its the balance of sweet and a little sour that makes the cheesecake tasty to me but I didn't find that taste in any of the offerings that I have tried."
Nadia A.,"Brampton, Canada",59,64,120,3.0,12/16/2017,Extremely overrated I went on a Saturday morning for bring at 10:30am there was a wait for the dining room but the high tables at the bar were open so I sat there. The waiter was full of life a little lost but still fun. I ordered the chicken and waffle Benedict's. The egg was poached perfectly but I couldn't taste them because of the thick over powering hollandaise sauce. The waffles were fluffy but again lost in the sauce and the chicken taste like your average chicken fingers.  The home fries were okay. I did order the Hershey crunch cheesecake to go. Now that was delicious I would definitely recommend trying the cheesecake such rich and creamy flavors. Unfortunately the cake turned over and I didn't get a good picture of it.
Chris T.,"Toronto, Canada",25,92,457,3.0,12/2/2017,"The food was just ok. Definitely not worth the average wait time of 1.5+ hours - unless you REALLY want their cheesecake. But if that's all you want get it to go. Our family decided to go today on a Saturday morning while doing some Christmas shopping. I was hoping the food would taste as good as it does in the United states. But alas, it did NOT. We ordered the factory nachos: 5/5 stars - it was LOADED with cheese and had a generous amount of guacamole & jalapenos. Only get it if you like it heavy! The Dynamite tempura shrimp and Ahi tuna tartare were a disappointment. Did not taste good at all. Both 1/5 stars and costs about $10 each.  The Philly cheese steak sandwich was 3/5. I've had better, at a fraction of the price.  Do not get the fries as your side!! The fries were hard, cold and tasteless.  The Diane steak (3/5 stars)was nothing to write home about. And at almost $28, you might as well go to a buffet.  $100+ later.... We should have just gotten the cheesecake to go."
Shahin S.,"Innisfil, Canada",128,244,416,4.0,12/4/2017,"My experience was good. I went two days after opening. Saw the huge line in the mall so opted for takeout (entrance outside). Once in line I saw that half the restaurant was empty - so I proceeded to the counter and asked why they were building a line with so many empty seats inside.  Was offered a seat at the bar, which I gladly accepted. Total wait time: 2 mins.  Staff were friendly and helpful. Gave us tips on ordering cheesecake (to go) before we ordered so that it would be ready by the time we were done eating.  Ordered a bunch of delicious food (see pics). All in all a great 1st experience at the brand new Toronto location. While I don't like a lot of American companies moving into the Canadian space, these guys do it properly so welcome to Canada!"
Rob K.,"Brampton, Canada",3,67,79,4.0,11/29/2017,"My wife really wanted to go to the first Canadian location of this American fixture.  First off, come early.  The wait is broken up in to two groups.  The main wait line of 2-3 hours and the small group of 15-20 they bring over to wait (see 25 minutes) to be seated.   So we opted for the take out which took 30 minutes    If you are here for cheesecake you can duck into the store ahead of the que.   My wife had coconut Thai chicken.  She thought it was amazing.  My daughter had the teriyaki chicken.  She liked it in spite of the fact the chicken came in one piece and was a bit tough.  That was my assessment of the piece.  I had the white chicken chilli.  I found they use far too much pepper and the flavour was over whelmed.  Now the real treat the cheese cake.  My daughter had the red velvet  My spouse had the salted caramel  I had Dan's peanut butter fudge ripple The rating was 5/5 for the daughter and the wife.  I found both to be very rich and smooth.  As for mine?  As far as I am concerned it is worth the traffic, parking chaos and the crush of people to have this piece of heaven.  Fabulous!"
Sasha T.,"Mississauga, Canada",1,52,14,5.0,1/5/2018,"Just went for takeout dessert: originally came in for an early dinner at 4pm on a Friday but was told the wait was two hours so I went in the mall for dinner and came back for dessert. The lineup for that wasn't bad, we waited approx. 15 min from getting in line to receiving our cake. The cake was delicious and tasted the same as the locations in the US.  If you're planning on going for dinner, expect to wait a long time until things cool down in a few months. (Written Jan. 2018)"
Danielle B.,"Toronto, Canada",168,266,734,2.0,11/25/2017,"It pains me to write this review, but I'm hoping the management will see it and make some improvements.  I know it's the first week being open, but come on. I've been to The Cheesecake Factory in Vegas and lineups can be crazy there, too. But they managed things much better in Vegas.  My experience was for takeout. I called in my order at around 11:45am. The person I spoke to said my food would be ready in half an hour.  I knew it was going to be busy, but the website stated they had designated parking for takeout orders and you could call when you arrive to see if your food is ready. It even says they'll bring your food out to your car (not true). I called the number when I arrived at the restaurant and they said it wasn't ready but they were working on it. When I asked how long it would take, she hung up on me. To avoid the nightmare of parking, I stopped in the parking lot and my friend got out to pick up the food.  I waited ten minutes and called the curbside pickup line again. No answer this time. I called twice more with no luck. I finally got a parking spot and went inside. I was immediately blocked by an employee who told me to get in line. Look, I understand it's busy, but employees should ask ""how can I help you?"" Instead of, ""you need to get in line"". I told her I was meeting my friend who was already in line so she let me in. There were lines EVERYWHERE. You basically had to line up to get in another line. When I found my friend, she was in the mall side in a very long line with four or five people in front of her. There were bags and bags of food lined up for people to pick up.  I thought it would be about five more minutes to get our food, but no. We waited another 20 minutes, because this line was for both people ordering takeout as well as picking up. I've never waited so long to pick up my food from any restaurant. When I finally got to the front, they confirmed my order by checking every item in the bag. Perhaps they've had a few mixups in the past, so it was good they verified everything. However, it was 12:48pm at that time. A full hour after I ordered and more than half an hour waiting in line, the whole time my food was sitting there. Of course, the food was cold by the time we finally got to eat it. I nuked mine, but some things just don't taste as good when you do that. We shared the egg roll sampler, chicken quesadilla and zucchini sticks and another friend had a chicken pasta lunch special (don't recall the name).  They really need to get things sorted out. One line to order takeout, and one line to pay/pick up your food that you already ordered. Simple. The food was fine, but would've been so much better when it was hot (or at least warm enough that it didn't require reheating) I'll go back in the new year after the hype has died down a bit, and update my review."
Kelly Z.,"Toronto, Canada",10,48,68,4.0,12/16/2017,"This is your joint for American style cheesecake - rich, creamy and HUGE!  I went on a Saturday morning (10 am) because it was on the way downtown so I waited in line for 10-15 minutes and got my order within 5 minutes! Got the strawberry cheesecake, chocolate hazelnut and the celebration. I had the celebration - too sweet for my taste (and for the portion), should maybe add a jam in between the layers to cut through all that sugar with something a little sharp and sour. There was a small layer of strawberry filling, maybe make that more tart? But it was decent. Decadent and for the amount of cake you're getting, worth the $10. The choco hazelnut and strawberry were less sweet and even suited the tastes of my family, who have less tolerance for heavy, sweet desserts. So I suggest go for those!  I also had the vanilla bean cheesecake when I was in Chicago - that was delicious! Lighter in flavour and definitely tasted the vanilla.  So I think it's worth checking out if you loooove cheesecake and you're at Yorkdale during slower times. Also kudos to the takeout staff for great service."
Cynthia W.,"Toronto, Canada",195,98,152,4.0,11/23/2017,"I'd tried the Cheesecake Factory about 6 years ago in the States and had an amazing meal, so undoubtedly I was thrilled when they opened up 10 minutes from my house. It was day 3 after opening, so we hoped the wait would be a little shorter. We got a buzzer around 1:45pm, did a little pre-Black Friday shopping, and were seated around 3:15pm.  I ordered the ahi tartare and crispy crab bites, while my friend got the fettuccini alfredo with chicken. I am such a sucker for the combination of avocado + raw fish, so I absolutely loved my choice. We then shared the 'coffee & cream chocolate supreme' cheesecake (each slice is HUGE we could barely finish the one between the two of us). We had originally ordered the 'white chocolate caramel macadamia nut', but were informed a while later that they had run out. Service was overall slow, which was to be expected during opening week, but we were especially confused when the cheesecake took 20 minutes to bring out. Regardless of the extra time spent here, the food is delicious, and I look forward to tackling the rest of their vast menu in the very near future."
Lorraine L.,"Toronto, Canada",30,49,134,3.0,11/27/2017,"Was here on the second day of opening. It was a ridiculous 2 hour wait and crazy line up at both entrances of the restaurant (one was for take-outs, the other was for seating). You have to line up to get your name on the list. Then after, they will give you a buzzer where the furthest you can wonder during your wait was as far as Victoria secret. Our server was very polite and friendly. Even though restaurant was crazy busy, we didn't have to wait long for our food. We ordered three different appetizers which include spinach dip, calamari, and Caesar salad. The spinach dip was good but I thought they didn't give enough chips. It was nice that they also served the dip with salsa and sour cream on the side. Calamari in my opinion was just meeeehhhhhh. Caesar salad was good but the dressing had a hint of spiciness to it. We ordered four different mains to share. There was a chicken filet dish with pasta on the side (I forgot the name but it was delicious), Diane steak with mash potato, chicken and Diane steak combo with sweet potato fries, and a pasta that tasted like a pizza. All the mains were decent.  Last but not least, we obviously ordered cheesecakes. We had four different ones...red velvet, tiramisu cheesecake, salted caramel, and strawberry shortcake. Red velvet and tiramisu were the winners! I loved how the tiramisu one was light even those cheesecake was suppose to be somewhat heavy. Salted caramel in my opinion was just wayyyyyy to sweet. I felt like I ate like 10k calories just from that one (sugar overload). The strawberry shortcake was such a disappointment as well. Was totally not what we expected. We literally expected a cake but it came out as biscuit patties with ice cream. The biscuits did not even taste fresh.  Overall, we had good services from the staffs. There was one who came and took our dessert before we received our mains as she said there was a long wait for dessert and didn't want us sitting around waiting for it after our meal..therefore, she wanted to get it ready first. Her intention was thoughtful but the desserts came out during our mains and we just got super confused by it. Management wanted to make sure everything was alright so they did come around to apologize. I will come back but I will wait until the hype is over because I don't think it's worth the wait especially a 2 hour wait."
Alex N.,"Markham, Canada",55,37,47,3.0,1/2/2018,"Omg. 4 hours waiting in line for decent food. There were too many options to choose from, I really think I got a headache, lol. The food were not bad, but I don't think its worth the wait, but I did it for the gram and I love to give every restaurant a try. Honestly, two cheesecakes are enough for 4 people. I legit almost passed out from the salted caramel cheesecake cause it was so sweet. I wish they offered sugarless cheesecake, but as of for now, get your diabetes. I recommend you guys should just hire someone to line up for you.  PSA: Happy new year, 2019 is going to be great for me as a hardworking and passionate Yelp reviewer. (hi YELP GM)."
Amy W.,"Markham, Canada",47,193,742,3.0,11/21/2017,"Started lining up at 6:37pm and sat down at 9:08pm. Ambiance, exactly like the states. I've attempted to order the Factory Combinations, instead of the Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane, ($29.95) I wanted to substitute the steak Diane with the Miso salmon, unfortunately they wouldn't allow that. It seems that they are particular in terms of substitutions. From the Small plates and snacks, I've ordered the  Crispy crab bites -bite-sized little crab cakes, served with mustard sauce ($9.95) nothing to write home about. Miso Salmon ($28.95) it was way too sweet to my liking and the sauce was too thick. The centre lacks flavour. The portion was huge, I rather the price reduced and the portion reduced so I will have room for what I initially came here for ""a cheesecake"" The manager deserves as 4.5 star as he was very attentive, observant, friendly and came over to see if my bread was refilled. The server did not refill our water. We had a switch in waitress, both seems a little inexperienced. The steak Diane was a bit dry. So out of the two entrees, I think the Chicken Madeira was the better choice. I think next time I will order less of the entrees and focus on trying different cheesecakes. (3.5 stars)"
Nam H.,"Leslieville, Toronto, Canada",54,73,98,5.0,11/27/2017,"We managed to get in On black Friday y'all. Okay, it wasn't the most ideal time for us to have dinner, but I wanted their cheesecake. Just had to stand in line for 20 min around 3pm to get the buzzer, then we just shopped for 80 min until our table was ready. I gotta say the manager escorting the parties in for the buzzer needs to be more authoritative and control that line better. As soon as he came people just rushed to him and some people lost their place in line. I had to speak up so jabronis wouldn't bud in front of me. Aside from the soft manager, everyone else inside the restaurant were superb. Even with all the crazy tempered shoppers, they kept their cool. Our waiter was very kind and tentative. Food was good and cheesecake was amazing. We ordered too much and packed it up for later."
Kenny N.,"Vaughan, Canada",39,66,36,4.0,12/1/2017,"The hype is real.  Coming to the mall on a Friday at around 1 for some Christmas shopping, I saw the line for The Cheesecake Factory and boy did I underestimate how long the wait would be.  We decided to do some shopping first and then head down to eat around 6. The line had gotten longer and we were told that this particular line is just to get a receiver. Then the wait would be about 2.5-3 hours from there. We thought it was just an overestimate from their part.. it was not.  During our wait, we made sure to know exactly what to order so we didn't waste any time. It was around 10:30 by the time we were seated. We were so close to giving up on waiting multiple times lol.  The service was exceptional and prompt. Our waitress (I forgot her name) was very friendly and she checked up on us multiple times throughout the night. The appetizers, especially the stuffed mushrooms were super yummy! I had Evelyn's favourite pasta and I guess I always get sick of too much pasta, but it tasted good to begin with.  The lighting is just so perfect. It's dim and creates a very cozy atmosphere. I wish it was slightly more spacious though.  If you've never had cheesecake from here before, do yourself a favour and treat yourself. The white chocolate raspberry is my absolute favourite.  I'll make it my mission to try every single flavour of cheesecake they offer."
Rachel A.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",158,146,598,3.0,12/21/2017,"As someone who has been frequenting the cheesecake factory for years, I was ecstatic when they opened it so close to me. My first experience was takeout, and I got my favourite Louisiana chicken pasta, plus the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake . The pasta was just like the states, so I was very happy. However, I also ordered the avocado egg rolls, and it wasn't in my bag when I came home. I emailed the cheesecake factory as advised on the phone, and this issue still hasn't been resolved and it's been a few weeks. I find that to be very poor customer service, especially for a new restaurant.  I went back with my gfs last Friday to dine in for our annual secret Santa dinner. We enjoyed their wine, and also got a second bottle. The apps were very delicious, and highly recommend the stuffed mushrooms and avocado egg rolls. We also got the buffalo blasts, which were good, but huge! I ordered the chicken parm pizza and my gf ordered the jambalaya pasta. It was insanely salty. I hate sending food back, but my gf also was not able to eat it. We sent it back, and then got our food with less salt, but then it tasted absolutely bland for both of us. Our gfs were pretty much done eating so, we just ate two bites and asked to pack it up. We felt bad to send it back again but we both just didn't want to eat anymore. Our server Amanda was really nice and apologetic.  We each ordered cheesecake, and found that enjoyable. I liked my red velvet cheesecake very much.  I would say 2.5 stars, as the service was great, as were the apps and dessert. But for my outstanding takeout issue and the taste of our mains, I deducted some huge points. *I updated this to 3 stars because they sent me an apology and a gift card for 25 dollars due to the issues I had."
Stephanie L.,"Markham, Canada",156,56,97,4.0,12/22/2017,I waited for three long hours to get in. I got the calamari for app and two pastas and two cheesecakes to go.  Portions as one can imagine mirror the ones in the states. BIG! The service was excellent people were nice and restaurant did not change from its counterparts in the states.  The cheesecakes were great I got the coffee chocolate one and a strawberry one to go.  I personally do no think it's worth the hype after going. It's well done food but not amazing. If you have patience just go after the hype whenever that maybe.
Liana D.,"Mississauga, Canada",0,1,4,4.0,12/30/2017,"Let me start off by saying that if you let the wait times get to you, all the while holding extremely high expectations (guys, this is technically your standard chain restaurant in the U.S - it's not supposed to be some mind-blowing culinary experience), obviously you'll feel the need to make harsher critiques and are bound to have a more negative experience.  I waited in line for a buzzer at 3:05pm (there's a line that starts by the end of the hall in front of Victoria's Secret), and got my buzzer at 3:10. Even before reaching the front desk, a nice lady warned me about the 3.5-4 hour wait with my 4 person party, which I already anticipated (shopping kills that time so quickly). The tall bald man distributing buzzers was also super nice and patient! We ended up getting seated at 7:20 but he sincerely apologized for the long wait times.  Our waitress (I think her name was Jess?) was so genuinely kind and patient with us as we asked questions about the menu, how to order cheesecakes to go, etc. The food came quickly, just shortly after the warm bread (the brown bread is to die for!) was served, and in huge portions! I was kind of iffy looking at the prices, but the portions here are like twice the size you'd get elsewhere for the same price. Some items are hit and miss, but I would definitely eat here again once (if) the hype dies along with the long wait times. Nothing tasted cold, old, or stale, and pretty much everything we got (you can ask your waiter what the most popular items are, like the mac n cheese balls) was packed with flavour! If you plan on walking around the mall or shopping anyways, I'd pick up a buzzer after the lunch and before the dinner rushes (2-3pm; as soon as I lined up, the line almost extended to Shoppers DM within 2 minutes) so you can have your dinner around 6-7pm! It was well worth the wait for me :)"
Dorsa G.,"Vaughan, Canada",95,47,28,2.0,12/27/2017,"Usually I love the Cheesecake Factory - have been to multiple locations in the States (San Francisco, Buffalo)  We were very excited to see they've opened at Yorkdale Mall. We received a buzzer and had a wait for about 3.5 hours, which I understand it's a busy time and everyone is excited for it's opening.  Shortly after sitting, we noticed all the cutlery on our table had dried up/older food on it and was extremely dirty.. We had also waited this absurd amount of time just for a lunch as we really love the Cheesecake Factory chicken wings.. only to learn that they ran out? Did not expect this at such a big and popular restaurant and all while they are very well aware they have a gigantic lineup for their food."
Mitch S.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",0,3,,2.0,1/7/2018,"Overhyped -- A good spot for desert once things calm down.  This is an okay spot for desert. I would not however reccomend it for dinner. Much of the food at our table was served cold, the chicken and potatoes were bland, the burger was overcooked. We also found the service to be chaotic.  Suprisingly enough, they did have a large selection of cheesecakes that many seemed to enjoy -- the only thing making this a 2-star review instead of 1-star.  Overall, it is very difficult to justify the 3 hour wait and the price paid for truly sub-par fare and service."
Philemon W.,"Markham, Canada",101,65,95,4.0,12/20/2017,"I couldn't help myself and followed the hype and my stomach. No longer do we have to drive 2 hours to Buffalo but instead wait 2-3 hours in a mall. It's exactly what you expect, the food is the same, the friendliness of the wait staff, the menus, the cheesecake line up at the door. We always order the Chicken Jumbalaya and Thai Lettuce wraps which are very tasty. This time we ordered the Buffalo Blasts, Stuff Potato Tots, Avocado Egg Rolls And Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta. The Angel Hair was nothing to brag about but we enjoyed the Buffalo Blasts which was a huge portion. We were disappointed that the pastas were not the expected large portions we are use to seeing in the US. We also ordered the Black Out Chocolate Cake and Godiva Gluten Free cake. They were both very rich and delicious. If you are willing to brave the wait and walk around the mall for 2-3 hours, you get what you expect."
Jennie L.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",72,52,72,4.0,12/11/2017,"Came here with my husband and parents on Sunday of the Black Friday weekend. Got in front of the restaurant at 2pm, and was seated at 530pm. The most annoying part of the wait is that you have to physically line up just to get to the podium and get a buzzer. I waited in line for around 45 minutes before getting my buzzer. Once you get the buzzer, you are free to go walk around the mall and do whatever you want. The buzzer only works in the vicinity of the restaurant, so they'll give you an approximate time of when you should come back to the restaurant. Once you are seated, the service is very good and quick. Our waiter was very friendly, took our orders and checked in on us a few times. He also gave us the heads up that the cheesecakes were taking a bit longer, so had us order the cheesecakes right before we got our main, so that we didn't have to wait too long for the dessert after.  The food was on par with the US. My go to appetizer is the avocado spring rolls. I highly recommend these. It comes with 6 pieces, which I think might be a smaller portion than the US (but I might also be remembering wrong). The appetizer came really quickly, and once we finished that, didn't have to wait very long for the mains. We got two cheesecakes. The banana creme is amazing and very nice and light. The white chocolate macadamia was a bit too heavy for us, the first two bites were yummy, and then it was just too creamy and sweet."
Kay E.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",60,12,2,3.0,12/27/2017,"Came here on boxing day around 9pm, it was just me and my significant other, we waited around 1 hour for a table which wasn't too bad since we were able to wall around the mall and shop while we waited (they give you a buzzer which notifies when a table is ready) The vibe was not bad, enough room between the table and diners. I did not like how the cutlery was placed onto the tables without any napkins. I'm not sure how sanitary the tabletops are and would rather have cutlery at least placed on the dishes or napkins like an ordinary restaurant - it just looks and feels tacky and cheap.  Our waiter lacked a little experience and didn't know much about the drinks menu. They were really friendly and nice though but they had to keep going back and forth to find out about some things on the menu (understandable as the restaurant just opened). Service was moderately fast. One thing I didn't like was when they packed the food they did not pack the dressings/dipping sauce that came with the food. Food was decent, not entirely the best. The cheesecake was good, really loved the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. The portion was huge too we had to take a few things to go. Everything was slightly pricer than average.  Definitely nice to come on a date or once in awhile."
Joyce L.,"Mississauga, Canada",118,128,240,4.0,12/11/2017,"4.5! Yes they lost half a star on the buzzer line up!  CHEESECAKE FACTORY HAS MADE ITS MARK ON CANADIAN SOIL! It's about damn time! First off...yes! There's obviously a line up. Came here on a Wednesday night and I couldn't believe the line up that formed just to get a buzzer! Almost an hour wait for it but once you get the buzzer and they tell you how long the wait will be... you are free to roam the mall but know that your buzzer signal won't reach that far to let you know that your table is ready. The hostess told us 60-80 mins, be here 10 mins before to ensure you get buzzed in. After shopping and going around, we came 10 mins earlier and they buzzed us in 5 mins. They sat us in and we immediately ordered. The decor and ambiance looks the same as any Cheesecake Factory restaurant which is great! The server was great and friendly, the bread and butter tasted amazing (my fave part).  We ordered the buffalo blasts, very HEFTY portion! This lasted till my lunch the next day. I ordered their special for the day which is a Thai glazed salmon and my fiancé got the Louisiana chicken pasta. Both were really amazingly done dishes but I was a big fan of their salmon! It was sooooo jam packed with flavour!  I love Cheesecake Factory for their food and less for their cheesecake, a little to heavy for me but when I do order a cheesecake to share, my faves are red velvet and the fresh strawberry original cheesecake! But that night we ordered strawberry shortcake sooooooooooo gooooood!  Amazing way to be the meal! Cheesecake Factory prices are fair to be honest, it's obviously in CAD dollars so it's a bit pricey but you really can't knock it down because of their hefty portions!  Obviously it's going to be a long time till the crowd dies down which is obvious, but I'll gladly wait again just to eat their food. There is also a huge for take out! Cheesecake Factory will always have a special place in my heart."
Christina K.,"Markham, Canada",15,15,14,3.0,12/12/2017,"Like many have said in previous reviews, it is a huge time commitment to dine in at the Cheesecake Factory and it's true, you might as well drive to Buffalo at this rate.  From the time of getting a buzzer to paying the bill, my experience took roughly 2.75 hours on a weekday (lunch). My time doesn't include getting to eat my cheesecake. Wait times were estimated at 1.25 - 1.75 hours and then expect another hour waiting for your food to come out cold. In my case, we ordered chicken enchiladas and it was cold.  On the upside, our waiter and her manager were very responsive and ended up remaking and waving the meal. However, we ended up just taking everything to go including the cheesecakes in frustration because it was taking too long.  I guess the restaurant is still working out the kinks and you shouldn't expect everything to be perfect as the restaurant is still new. I suggest for prospective customers to wait a few more weeks or even months until they get their shit together and hopefully be on par with the US. Take away for management: 1) Ensure food quality control 2) Improve turnaround time (I'm sure you guys are well aware) 3) Service = Excellent If you're a person who gets hangry (hungry + angry), make sure you have a snack."
S F.,"Scarborough, Canada",0,1,24,5.0,11/25/2017,"I've been to The Cheesecake Factory over 20 times in the States. So happy they have finally opened up their 1st Canadian location in The 6. And it's just as good as it's counterparts in the States. Wait times maybe a bit long but it brand New & in Yorkdale the busiest mall in the city so what do you expect. However the service is phenomenal & as time goes on it will only get better & more efficient. Let's get on to the Food. Note Portions are Huge. And Bread is Free. Do yourself a favor & get the Brown Bread as it's incredible. You can even buy it as a baguette & take it home for $4.50.  For Apps I def recommend the Sweet Corn Tamale Cake. Trust me order this & it will Change Your Life.  For Mains my fav is the Wasabi Ahi Crusted Tuna, but it's unfortunately not on the menu. So I went with the classic Steak Diane with Mash Potatoes. It's always a Winner & you can't go wrong.  And for dessert Hands Down the Best Cheesecake is the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake. It's super light & easy to eat even after a filling meal."
Nick P.,"Mississauga, Canada",131,295,283,3.0,12/11/2017,"2 hour wait to get a buzzer + 1.5 hour wait after you get your buzzer. When you do finally have a chance to get in, the menu is quite impressive. A lot of options for food, although 90% of it is chicken. And somehow they ran out of the chicken entree that I wanted which confused me...because I'm not sure what they ran out of. Unless the chef just didn't want to make it anymore....or their entrees are premade and frozen. The cheesecake options are also huge, but the quality isn't mind blowing for the price you have to pay. Averages meal is about $20 and slice of cheesecake is $10."
Peony L.,"Toronto, Canada",26,200,203,3.0,12/10/2017,Came here on a weekday and still had to wait almost 1.5 hours for. I ate at the Cheesecake Factory in the U.S before and food was mediocre. The service was exceptional though. Our waiter was super friendly and always managed to check up on us even though it was super busy. We ordered the tacos and the spinach dip to share. The fish tacos were good but it was paired with rice and beans which personally didn't go well together. We ordered the salted caramel cheesecake and it was really good but super sweet. My recommendation is to order the cheesecake to go and avoid eating in the restaurant until the hype is over.
E K.,"Toronto, Canada",8,202,723,4.0,12/2/2017,Came here on a weekday around noon and there was already and 1.5h line waiting to be seated. Pros: - Just like the one in the states - Huge portions - Good service -Good food - Nice ambiance  Cons: - Pricey
