S F.,"Scarborough, Canada",0,1,24,5.0,25/11/2017,"I've been to The Cheesecake Factory over 20 times in the States. So happy they have finally opened up their 1st Canadian location in The 6. And it's just as good as it's counterparts in the States.   maybe a bit long but it brand New & in Yorkdale the busiest mall in the city so what do you expect. However the service is phenomenal & as time goes on it will only get better & more efficient. Let's get on to the Food. Note Portions are Huge. And Bread is Free. Do yourself a favor & get the Brown Bread as it's incredible. You can even buy it as a baguette & take it home for $4.50.  For Apps I def recommend the Sweet Corn Tamale Cake. Trust me order this & it will Change Your Life.  For Mains my fav is the Wasabi Ahi Crusted Tuna, but it's unfortunately not on the menu. So I went with the classic Steak Diane with Mash Potatoes. It's always a Winner & you can't go wrong.  And for dessert Hands Down the Best Cheesecake is the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake. It's super light & easy to eat even after a filling meal."
Greg F.,"Toronto, Canada",5,74,65,3.0,10/1/2018,"My friends and I went to the Cheesecake Factory intending on eating lunch at 3pm but we had to wait 3 hours for a table and ended up eating dinner instead at 6pm.  I ordered the fish tacos and for dessert their classic strawberry cheesecake. The food was delicious and it was a good portion size, but really expensive!! Usually ordering some tacos at any other restaurant wouldn't be more than $15 -- but at the Cheesecake Factory basically every menu item is $20+. Plus the one slice of cheesecake I had for dessert was an extra $10 (ouch). In the end I ended up spending roughly $35 for dinner with tax and tips. The food was definitely good, but not worth the price or the 3 hour wait. I know everyone wants to experience the cheesecake factory for themselves, regardless of the   and prices -- so my advice would be to bring a laptop or predownload some shows ahead of time on your phone. You'll thank me later."
Liana D.,"Mississauga, Canada",0,1,4,4.0,30/12/2017,"Let me start off by saying that if you let the   get to you, all the while holding extremely high expectations (guys, this is technically your standard chain restaurant in the U.S - it's not supposed to be some mind-blowing culinary experience), obviously you'll feel the need to make harsher critiques and are bound to have a more negative experience.  I waited in line for a buzzer at 3:05pm (there's a line that starts by the end of the hall in front of Victoria's Secret), and got my buzzer at 3:10. Even before reaching the front desk, a nice lady warned me about the 3.5-4 hour wait with my 4 person party, which I already anticipated (shopping kills that time so quickly). The tall bald man distributing buzzers was also super nice and patient! We ended up getting seated at 7:20 but he sincerely apologized for the long wait times.  Our waitress (I think her name was Jess?) was so genuinely kind and patient with us as we asked questions about the menu, how to order cheesecakes to go, etc. The food came quickly, just shortly after the warm bread (the brown bread is to die for!) was served, and in huge portions! I was kind of iffy looking at the prices, but the portions here are like twice the size you'd get elsewhere for the same price. Some items are hit and miss, but I would definitely eat here again once (if) the hype dies along with the long wait times. Nothing tasted cold, old, or stale, and pretty much everything we got (you can ask your waiter what the most popular items are, like the mac n cheese balls) was packed with flavour! If you plan on walking around the mall or shopping anyways, I'd pick up a buzzer after the lunch and before the dinner rushes (2-3pm; as soon as I lined up, the line almost extended to Shoppers DM within 2 minutes) so you can have your dinner around 6-7pm! It was well worth the wait for me :)"
Laleh H.,"Markham, Canada",6,113,48,5.0,8/1/2018,"Wow - i'm stunned by the negative reviews on here. I am a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory, i have been to several locations in the US including the Walden Galleria location (check out my review!). One thing remains the same - great quality, great service, amazing variety and huge portions! We arrived at Yorkdale Mall at 12pm. The idea was lunch and if the line up and   was too long, we would leave and eat somewhere else. The first thing i noticed when walking in was there was no direction or signs posted to let people know where to check in to give their names, or to line up if there was one. There was a counter to the left with 3 people behind it and a podium to the right with 1 person behind it, so i walked over to the podium. I asked if there was a   and how long it was. The answer was ""75-90 min with no guarantee"". That threw me off because other than people walking in & out of the mall, the entrance was clear. I asked her where we could leave our name etc. and she answered back ""there is a line up in front of Victoria's Secret"". Glad i asked otherwise there are no signs or anyone directing people that are trying to get in to the restaurant other than Security once someone tries to walk in. FYI at that time, she hadn't bothered to tell me that the line up in front of Victoria's Secret was just a line up that we had to wait in, to come back to her and give our names. That was my biggest issue with the process, not the  ! It's a mall people. If you can't find something to do with a buzzer in your hand that allows you to go as far as Sporting Life, then that's your issue. We lined up at 12:15pm. It didn't look too bad and moved 3 times in 30 min which got us back to the main podium near the door at 12:45pm. I was given a buzzer and told to come back in 75-90 min. We sat on the benches in front of the Godiva Store with a bunch of other people also waiting for a table. We did some shopping and window shopping to pass the time. Kids had some snacks & their tablets to keep them busy. Â Honestly, if it were a stand alone location, there was no chance in he$$ we would've waited even half of that. Thankful for the mall being there and so much to see & do to keep busy. We were finally seated by 2:45pm. Our server (Brittany) was great! She apologized for the   after introducing herself. I mentioned our daughter's peanut/nut allergy right after she greeted us. She listened carefully and said she would talk to the kitchen before any of our orders were put through. She took the kids orders and our appetizer order and went to get our drinks. We never had to flag her down or look for her. She was at our table & others frequently and made sure drinks were topped up, empty plates were cleared and ALWAYS asked if we needed anything else and how we were doing and how our meal was. Our order: Hibachi Hanger Steak w/shiitake mushrooms, onions & bean sprouts, wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura battered asparagus. My hubby loved this dish! His steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I couldn't try it as i have an allergy to shiitake mushrooms, but he said it was perfectly cooked & seasoned and it was a nice large portion and definitely something he would order again! I ordered the Grilled Steak Tacos - OMG this was super super delish! Honestly, i was looking at the large salads & burgers that i usually have, but decided to try something new. Hands down one of THE best steak tacos i've ever had at a restaurant - ok, other than in Mexico! 4 small tacos filled with perfectly grilled tender steak seasoned so well that i could eat nothing else and be happy! It was topped with chopped avocado, tomatoes, cilantro, crispy onions & chipotle sauce. On the side: a small bowl of black beans & a side of rice.  Our 7 yr old with the peanut/nut allergy wanted macaroni & cheese. Her food was brought out right after our appetizer by another server. She explained that it took a little longer because all the bowls & utensils to make her food were cleaned for her order to ensure no cross contamination or contact with any nut products. I was floored by this. Who does this at restaurants?! AMAZING! My daughter LOVED the macaroni & cheese! Our 4 yr old ordered chicken tenders & fries - 5 lightly battered crispy chicken tender strips. Served with 2 dipping sauces - huge hit! Red Velvet Cheesecake - OMG YUM - just try it! FYI - you can order take out at the counter to the left of the mall entrance. There is a counter with cash register & menus.   is 20-30 min. If you want to order dessert to go, there is a line up at the bakery inside, or you can put an order in through your server when you are ordering your food. It saves time! They don't serve any frozen food - everything is made fresh to order. Would love to see a location at Markville Mall after their current expansion. Or Vaughan Mills. Another location would certainly help the   & line ups. We can't wait to go back!"
Christina K.,"Markham, Canada",15,15,14,3.0,12/12/2017,"Like many have said in previous reviews, it is a huge time commitment to dine in at the Cheesecake Factory and it's true, you might as well drive to Buffalo at this rate.  From the time of getting a buzzer to paying the bill, my experience took roughly 2.75 hours on a weekday (lunch). My time doesn't include getting to eat my cheesecake.   were estimated at 1.25 - 1.75 hours and then expect another hour waiting for your food to come out cold. In my case, we ordered chicken enchiladas and it was cold.  On the upside, our waiter and her manager were very responsive and ended up remaking and waving the meal. However, we ended up just taking everything to go including the cheesecakes in frustration because it was taking too long.  I guess the restaurant is still working out the kinks and you shouldn't expect everything to be perfect as the restaurant is still new. I suggest for prospective customers to wait a few more weeks or even months until they get their shit together and hopefully be on par with the US. Take away for management: 1) Ensure food quality control 2) Improve turnaround time (I'm sure you guys are well aware) 3) Service = Excellent If you're a person who gets hangry (hungry + angry), make sure you have a snack."
Josey W.,"Markham, Canada",1,9,17,4.0,30/12/2017,"Came to Yorkdale around 4:00pm and waited in line for 30 mins to get the buzzer. Once you have that you can carry it and walk around. At first, they told us the   will be around 2-3 hrs, but around 2.5 hrs later, they call us and told us it will delay. At last, we waited until 9:30pm to get a table for 5. We ordered tomato basil pasta, pasta carbonara, lemon garlic shrimp (forgot to take a pic) and herb crusted filet of salmon. I personally like the tomato basil pasta the best and for the salmon, it ain't too dry or tough but melts across your tongue. Dessert time!! At first, we wanted to order coffee and cream chocolate supreme and tiramisu cheesecake but unfortunately were all sold out. So we changed to fresh strawberry, godiva chocolate and white chocolate raspberry truffle. They are smooth, creamy and also really huge (probably need to share or it will be too heavy). Overall, the food is great but is it worth to wait for 5-6 hrs? Probably depend on.. are you going to buy stuff in the mall cuz actually every store also have lineups, so time actually passes super fast when you are shopping with your friends."
Justin P.,"Mississauga, Canada",1,45,44,5.0,4/12/2017,"We were luckily able to get in within 2hrs (1.5 hrs wait to get a buzzer, then about 15 min to get seated). The food was amazing and big portions, the staff were super friendly, and the decor was nice. I don't recommend coming here if you're solely coming for cheesecake unless they have one that other places don't sell (most of the Coffee Culture cafes, sell the same Cheesecake Factory cakes for cheaper prices and no  ). But where it stands out is the meals. I definitely recommend the porky belly sliders and orange chicken special. Yum! They will let you order your cheesecake for take out towards the middle of your meal so it's ready when you're done eating."
Sophie T.,"Toronto, Canada",0,17,14,3.0,31/12/2017,"With a table of 5, we managed to get a table over the holidays after a total of 4 hours wait time. We waited 30 minutes in line to get the buzzer and were informed the   would be 3-3 1/2 hrs at that point.  We ordered the Fried Calamari as an appetizer, which was great. For mains, the Steak Diane, Chargrilled Bone-In New York Steak and Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon. The portions were large, but nothing spectacular. I particularly did not enjoy the salmon entree, as the sauce had too much of a vinaigrette taste for my liking. Â  As for the dessert, we settled with four different cheesecakes and all were amazing. I highly recommend the Raspberry White Chocolate Cheesecake, although you can't go wrong with any of the options. In conclusion, I would give 4 stars based on the cheesecakes and good service. However, the   and mediocre entrees bring it down to a 3."
Jaravm M.,"Mississauga, Canada",6,1,,2.0,9/1/2018,The location was amazing and the restaurant looks great but the biggest problem that this place has is the   and the service by far. For me I was not impressed with the food as well. I had ordered a coffee and cheese cake slice and I only received the coffee. I will not be coming back at all. I was so disappointed with this restaurant/ bakery. Oh I should mention that I can receive my bill faster than I can receive my cheese cake.
Emad I.,"Milton, Canada",0,9,2,1.0,7/1/2018,"Un considerate staff ,   are a joke and not accurate , the line to get in is not that long to make the wait 3 hours . Owners probably trying to make a big thing out of the restaurant so making people wait for it .  Will never step foot there again ."
Kent M.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",0,3,6,3.0,27/12/2017,"Great food and friendly staff, the food was exceptionally good and are priced reasonably; Other than that, I personally find the cheesecakes a bit ""too common"" and is overhyped and the   is too long"
J D.,"Vaughan, Canada",0,42,15,5.0,21/12/2017,"YES IT'S WORTH IT! Went to The Cheesecake Factory for my birthday and cannot speak on the   because I got lucky... Regardless IM SURE ITS WORTH THE WAIT! Got seated by the bar, which actually isn't so bad at this restaurant. Our server Sean was great and so was the other bar staff.  Ordered the following: 1. Cheeseburger Springrolls - 5/5 Amazing, must try! Although on the greasy side... tasted like a deep friend Big Mac 2. Spinach Dip - 2/5 A bit disappointing. The dip was flavourless, but maybe its because we ate the spring rolls first so our palette was expecting much more lol 3. Four cheese pasta with chicken - 4/5 Nice flavour, pasta cooked nicely al dente 4. Chicken parm 'pizza' pasta - 5/5 Looks amazing, I almost thought it was a pizza... crazy over the top. It was HUGE... also tasted really good except by this time I was super full and wanted space for cheesecake - they gave me a special big box to pack it home in 5. Chris Outrageous Cheesecake - 5/5 For all coconut lovers, this is your flavour! Overall, a wonderful first experience and would def come back. The manager was super nice and made my birthday a lot better. Bar staff were super friendly, down to earth and knowledgeable. They were honest about what they've tried and havent tried, the restaurant is fairly new after all. Cant wait to come back!"
J T.,"Toronto, Canada",0,3,9,4.0,10/12/2017,"Pros: - Food is delicious (in photos: seared ahi tuna, green salad, hibachi steak, peach smoothie, warm honey oat/wheat bread, and mango key lime cheesecake) - Ingredients are fresh and good quality - Price is only slightly higher than the pickle barrel next door, but the quality is better - Large selection of items - Accurate lineup estimate and logistics for so many people Cons: - Long wait. At around 5pm, 1 hour lineup to get a buzzer and then another hour to get a table - Customers must lineup in the middle of the mall corridor - Confused servers repeatedly get items wrong or do not check on the table. If they did not make so many mistakes I would have been able to finish my dinner at least 45 min earlier - Some portions are very small for the price and some are large (inconsistent) - Â Takeout requires a   of 40 minutes - Cannot handle large parties or groups. Most of the tables are small. Good for couples."
A B.,"Toronto, Canada",0,12,,3.0,27/12/2017,"Came here on a Wednesday night during boxing week. Started waiting in line at 7:15 and did not get seated until 10:30 (45 minutes to get the pager and 2.5 hours waiting in line). Completely understandable as it is still fairly new and it's the day after boxing day. The people that were also waiting around us were getting very agitated and took their stress and anger out on the hostess/receptionist person that handled the customers waiting in line and the hosts / servers in the restaurant, which I found to be unfair and unreasonable as the reasons for the extended wait times is mostly out of their control. Also, the mall really helped as we were able to shop around during our  .  Food was great, especially the macaroni & cheese balls! One of the best macaroni & cheese dishes I've ever had. The chicken taquito's were very tasty but it could have had a bit more spice to it, but that's just personal taste. The only thing I didn't like about my experience here was overhearing some of the servers / hosts badmouthing and mocking some of the customers in the presence of other customers. But our server, Michael, was excellent and genuinely friendly; he checked up on us a lot to make sure we were okay. Also, the cheesecakes (Vanilla bean & salted caramel) did take a while to get served to us, but the taste makes up for it. Will come visit again during a not-so-busy time."
Amy M.,"Thornhill, Markham, Canada",0,12,,4.0,6/1/2018,"Have been to various Cheesecake Factories throughout the US so was waiting until the excitement of its opening and crowds wore down. Â Well thats not happening so fast. Â My daughter picked up a buzzer at 10:50 am, restaurant opens at 11:30 and we were told to come Â closer to the restaurant around 11:40. Â By then there was a long line up in the mall. Â We were seated by 11:50 which was great. Â It seems they have figured out the flow of seating better than what I read at their start. Â We ordered lunch sized salads (my fave Santa Fe, a Cobb and a Chicken Avocado). Â Happy to report the wheat bread and salads were exactly the same as we expected. Â The major disappointment was the iced tea. Â Was looking forward to unsweetened tropical yet they don't have it and the alternative was some strange flavour that tasted sweetened? Â  Please please bring north that tea. Â  We bought 5! slices of cheesecake to take home. Â Very pricey and I recall the slices being bigger but still yum. Overall we enjoyed our lunch. Shout out to Amanda who was a terrific waitress. Â Will I go back? Yes. But not until the   are reduced. Â Welcome to Canada Cheesecake Factory."
Raychelle W.,"Toronto, Canada",169,2,,3.0,20/12/2017,At the moment I understand that it's busy at the moment so I will not complain about that. It just sucks that the   for take out is standing in line to stand in line but I'm sure it would get better. I was a little surprised by the price of a slice of cheesecake but the slice was a pretty decent size. Pretty rich taste of cheesecake
Joanna L.,"Toronto, Canada",1,4,2,3.0,27/11/2017,"We decided to check out the Cheesecake this past Saturday. Began lining up at 1:10pm. Thought the line was moving fairly quick, but that was just the line to put your name down. Got my name down at 2pm. Had to come back after 30 minutes to get a pager. Lined up again for another 10 minutes and then finally got one. Gave us an estimate of more than hour and half. Got our table at 4pm.  I ordered the classic meatloaf. Same portion and flavours as when I get it from the states. We had to order our cheesecake while we waited for our main because the   was approx 1 hour. Our food took approx 20mins... the cheesecake took about 1 hour after it was entered. For a slice of cheesecake that's already pre-cut?? We decided to order cheesecake for take out while we were dining as well since the cheesecake take out line was out the front door/over 1 hour wait.  Our server did not offer to refill our waters or bread, but service wasn't terrible. They definitely need more people working at the cheesecake counter. Will wait until after the holidays to return."
Ron G.,"Brampton, Canada",26,1,,5.0,2/12/2017,I understand the   being anew location best time to go is early sat in the bar ceaser salad was incredible very tasty chicken Marsala delicious with the pasta bow ties loved to top it off the 30 year signature cheesecake so so good was so excited when I heard they were coming to Toronto it will be my second home
