Sarah K.,"Thornhill, Markham, Canada",0,3,,3.0,12/11/2017,"Good, but not worth to wait for an hour or two. Those who are allowed time are worth trying."
Glen A.,"Markham, Canada",0,6,,4.0,12/31/2017,"Great restaurant, only issue i experienced is little bit slow and getting the bill takes too long. Need to ask bill ahead not after finish dining"
S S.,"Ottawa, Canada",0,2,1,4.0,11/28/2017,"I sat at the bar because I was a solo diner.  Luckily for me, despite them only opening a week ago, I did not have to wait (because I didn't get a table).  At 4pm on their first Monday, the wait was estimated at 1.5-2 hours.  That's after the 20 min wait to get your name on the list. No bread was offered.  Had to ask for that delicious brown one.  Not sure if they forgot to offer or they just don't if you're seated at the bar ordering dinner. Told there was a 45 min wait for cheesecake so I ordered my cheesecake at the same time as my meal.  Got the Adam's peanut butter cup and it was divine.  It arrived when my meal did which was fine by me. The waitress entered my meal incorrectly so it arrived wrong, and then they sent it back and forgot a key protein in the dish the second round.  Back it went again, and after 20 minutes it came out and was perfect.  Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  One of the tastiest things on that giant menu.  Order it with the ""cilantro rice"".  You won't be disappointed. Servers were super helpful.  It was clear that they brought some from the states to help with opening week.  It was easy to tell who was new and who was experienced.  They were all very pleasant though. Considering I was there for their first week, I was pretty happy with the overall experience.  Because they have so many other restaurants in the states, I only offer a little leniency for not having things running a little smoother.  Th pure volume of people is one thing, but once the restaurant is full, it's like any other full Cheesecake Factory restaurant in the states... and they should be prepared for the crowd and ensure their new staff are up to par.  First Canadian operation though, so I do acknowledge the learning curve."
Simone C.,"Markham, Canada",7,19,9,4.0,11/27/2017,"Came in today around 1230 and surprisingly the wait wasn't too bad, maybe around 40 min. It was pretty busy once we got inside the restaurant so it's understandable that service was a bit slow. Everything we ordered was to die for, especially the Oreo and vanilla bean cheesecake. The deep fried cheese, Mac and cheese balls, and 4 cheese pasta were really good as well but I would only come in for the cheese cake next time. Our server was great and it was a great experience overall"
Christian G.,"Cheektowaga, NY",5,1,,4.0,1/1/2018,"Food was amazing, portions are huge. Waitresses asses are bit bigger. Only reason they didn't get a 5-Star is because women servers are not as beautiful as moxies, and not enough of women working"
Sam N.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",0,3,2,5.0,12/3/2017,"My favourite restaurant,they offer different varieties of foods , delicious foods. They have professional staff, nice environment, good price , ofcourse Best cheese cake .just long waiting line so I recommend go early:)"
Kseniya B.,"Toronto, Canada",1,8,,1.0,12/16/2017,"THE WORST SERVICE EVER! waited in line for a full hour, and were told we could not reserve a spot as they were only accepting parties of four or less!VERY POORLY ORGANIZED, and the hostess had the audacity to roll her eyes when we asked questions! the inadequate behaviour was an extreme turn off, and made us never want to come back. my friend was extremely upset as we came here to celebrate her birthday, but only received negativity and rudeness! 0/5 would not recommend"
Rebecca D.,"North York, Toronto, Canada",30,2,,1.0,11/26/2017,"I usually don't write reviews in general but this was just outrageous. This place is straight up pathetic. Me and my bf started lining up at like 6:45 at the mall. Then we got escorted to get our pager at like 8. Which is fine, I get it, still opening week. When we got our pager, the girl that gave our pager said it'll be an hour wait which we waited patiently. However, we got extremely upset when we waited until 9:40 and saw that the girl who was waiting before us was long gone inside and people who were after us got called in before us. And mind you, these people that got in were a party of two as well and after us were more than a party of 4+. My boyfriend got so fed up that he went inside to ask what was going on, they asked for his name and they kept searching on the list, clearly our names was not written down and the fact the host and hostess at the front desk that my boyfriend talked to said this to each other ""is this another case of no name?"" Like are you serious? My boyfriend was frustrated and said that we waited more than an hour and how people before and after us already went in. It was just me and my boyfriend, we shouldn't even been waited this long. Then they had the audacity saying that it wasn't their fault, no apology whatsoever. Then they immediately said we were next don't worry. If my boyfriend didn't went in and asked, we definitely would have not been called whatsoever. The one star is only for the food we ordered and the efficient waitress we had. Other than that, we were so hungry, angry, and exhausted to the point that our mains and the cheesecake didn't even taste like anything. Will we come back? Maybe if we were in the states and have enough time, but definitely not here again."
Connie F.,"Toronto, Canada",0,13,12,3.0,12/13/2017,"My husband and i are big fans of the Cheesecake Factory! We often cross the border just to eat at the restaurant in buffalo. We went to the Yorkdale location on a Sunday afternoon thinking it wouldn't be too busy during off hours. Staff was very attentive at the podium and asked if we needed a high chair (we waited about 45min to get a buzzer and another 2 hours to get a table.) The food was delicious and portion was generous. We ordered extra cheesecakes to bring home. There were trainers from the US who came to our table occasionally to make sure everything was okay. Our server was okay until near the end when we asked to pack the leftovers. We had 2 separate plates with food left, instead of bringing one plate on each hand, she stacked them on top of each other! How can she be so sure that the bottom of the plate is so clean that it is okay to put it on top of our food?! She also boxed all the food in one container! In the end, we didn't bring the packed food cause we didn't feel too safe about it. Overall, it was a good experience despite the wait line and the incident at the end of our meal. We will go again soon!"
Husman H.,"Midtown Toronto, Toronto, Canada",53,9,,5.0,12/4/2017,"Upon arriving to Yorkdale mall, we had to wait a dreaded 2.5 hours which, surprisingly, went by very quickly as having friends can help pass time so I would highly recommend having friends, bringing 1, or make some while you're there. There are two lines u have to wait through and then you get in. After walking inside, the atmosphere felt very vivid and exclusive as the restaurant had an exquisite feel to it. Finally sitting down, man oh man, the seats were so terrific! felt like chairs from Cuba or some exotic place like that. Bringing the bread out as a starter, the first one was dry, old, and stale like my stats prof, however the second one was rich in flavour and blended well with the butter. The pasta we ordered with the chicken, mushrooms, tomatoes was $23.95 and definitely worth it as the portion size is bigger then my forehead and is suited for 2. The strawberry cheesecake, gurl don't even get me started on that, that shit was  , it was heavenly as  tears came out of my fat little face with each bite, unfortunately I had to share with my gf so don't make that mistake when u go in but it's ok u win some u lose some u know? But yea I give the Cheesecake Factory a solid 9 cheesecakes out of 10 cheesecakes and would go back next time and not share my food cause that shit good yo."
Ron G.,"Brampton, Canada",26,1,,5.0,12/2/2017,I understand the wait times being anew location best time to go is early sat in the bar ceaser salad was incredible very tasty chicken Marsala delicious with the pasta bow ties loved to top it off the 30 year signature cheesecake so so good was so excited when I heard they were coming to Toronto it will be my second home
N L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,1,,3.0,11/28/2017,Long wait times the opening week are to be expected but waiting for over 1 1/2 hrs before getting our main course makes the experience even more tedious. It's a good thing we ordered appetizers as well-which did come in a reasonable time. The food is hit and miss. The baked Mac and cheese and the crab bites are awesome but the spicy chicken Chipotle pasta was hard to swallow. The pasta was undercooked and tastes like eating pasta drenched in BBQ sauce. The waitress/ ppl serving us were super friendly  and apologetic when they messed up a friend's cheese cake order but overall this restaurant is just meh at best. I've been to other cheese cake factories before so in comparison  there's definitely room for improvement.
Foodie S.,"Mississauga, Canada",2,22,8,5.0,12/12/2017,"yes I'm one of those people that waited in line for hrs to get in and let me tell you it was worth it. Me any my friends throughly enjoyed ourselves. Most of the food was delicious, the portion sizes were huge, you honestly cant finish it.  the only thing is that there is a lot of that plastic American cheese on the menu which is no surprise because this is an American restaurant, so just try to stay away from those kraft single slices. some dishes were on the bland side I order a mushroom pasta and it tasted like boiled noodles with nothing on it, but they quickly replaced it at no charge for something else. The cheesecakes were amazing and took me 3 days to finish my slice at home. I had the key lime pie cheesecake which was simple looking but packed a punch. However it was very tart so if thats not your thing I recommend ordering a different one. Lastly I really appreciated that the waitresses were normal women properly dressed. It bothers me when you go to a restaurant and all the waitresses are size 2 wearing skin tight short black dresses."
