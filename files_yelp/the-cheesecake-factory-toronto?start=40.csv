David C.,"Toronto, Canada",0,26,1,5.0,1/3/2018,";TLDR stop being a repulsive hipster, set your expectations straight, ride the line, try it out and have fun, chances are you'll enjoy it and see for yourself that this place is so popular because of the food and the service.  Review: Yeah the wait lines are long and it's not a Michelin started restaurant, but given the price and what it sets out to be, meaning a family friendly chain of restaurant for the masses, the Cheesecake Factory excels at what it does and it's really in a class of its own.  The stuffed mushroom appetizer is to die for. The cheeseburger spring roll is really fun. The four cheese pasta is incredibly tasty and for once the pasta is truly al dente. The chicken medira is spectacular and of course, you ought to try their cheesecake. So far, the white chocolate and raspberry is my favorite. However, what impressed me even more than the food was the service. Our order of California Cheesesteak was way too salty and we had to send it back. I guess there was a screw up somewhere because it was inedible. At once the waiter told us she would alert the head chef. The manager came and confirmed that something was off and apologized right away. In no time they had redone the order (which was magnificent. Highly recommend the Cheesesteak if you crave a good sandwich) and they even offer a cheesecake on the house as an apology. The response to our complain was impeccable and it should be the benchmark against which other big chains should be measured.  Even better, they took the kids menu right away and brought them quickly. The waiters (Jonathan and Crystal) were attentive to our kids and turned the whole thing into a great experience for them. I mean the place is packed. It's probably the busiest restaurant in town right now and yet they really took great care of us. This is probably worth more than the amazing food itself."
Cassandra C.,"Courtice, Canada",3,29,29,5.0,12/1/2017,"We were so excited to make the journey to Yorkdale to try out Canada's first Cheesecake Factory. We arrived at the mall around 11:00 and saw the line was crazy long. We decide it was early and would circle back. Around 3:30 we went back to see there was no line at the host stand. We spoke to the host and she said that we would get a buzzer and to come back in about an hour and check in. So we continue to shop around the stores close to the restaurant and the time passed rather quickly. We went back in a hour and she said we had about 30 more mins. So we just hung out waiting for our buzzer to go off, once it did we basically got our table right away.   We were both starved and saw all the pasta dishes passing us by, that looked very good. So we both decided to order pasta I had the pasta carbonara with chicken and it was SO good creamy and cheesy everything a good carbonara is suppose to be. I had the lunch portion and it was still very large. My friend had a cheesy garlic pasta with chicken and herbs she quiet enjoyed it and her dinner portion was too large to finish.  After we finished our meals our waitress told us that we needed to order the cheesecake we wanted cause there is about a 30min wait due to the large amounts of cheesecake being ordered.  So as difficult as it was we made our choices I had the Carmel pecan turtle cheesecake and my friend had the lemon raspberry cheesecake. We both thoroughly enjoy them and each order a couple slices to go to bring home to jealous and drooling family members. Our waitress was very helpful and accommodating she made it seem like everyone does that.  Overall we thought the experience was great and well worth the trip. We would definitely return again."
Danny C.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",9,32,115,5.0,1/4/2018,We were told it will be a long line up but we still came to try out the food and cheese cake.  We waited a total of 2 hours before getting the seats.  We were asked to order the cheese cake first because it will take 45 mins to bring out due to the long line up for cheese cake.  At the same time we have also ordered the main dish.  The food and services are fabulous.  I did not find any fault from it.  We plan to go there again for Sunday brunch.  It is definitely worth the wait.
Josey W.,"Markham, Canada",1,9,17,4.0,12/30/2017,"Came to Yorkdale around 4:00pm and waited in line for 30 mins to get the buzzer. Once you have that you can carry it and walk around. At first, they told us the wait time will be around 2-3 hrs, but around 2.5 hrs later, they call us and told us it will delay. At last, we waited until 9:30pm to get a table for 5. We ordered tomato basil pasta, pasta carbonara, lemon garlic shrimp (forgot to take a pic) and herb crusted filet of salmon. I personally like the tomato basil pasta the best and for the salmon, it ain't too dry or tough but melts across your tongue. Dessert time!! At first, we wanted to order coffee and cream chocolate supreme and tiramisu cheesecake but unfortunately were all sold out. So we changed to fresh strawberry, godiva chocolate and white chocolate raspberry truffle. They are smooth, creamy and also really huge (probably need to share or it will be too heavy). Overall, the food is great but is it worth to wait for 5-6 hrs? Probably depend on.. are you going to buy stuff in the mall cuz actually every store also have lineups, so time actually passes super fast when you are shopping with your friends."
Edward H.,"Toronto, Canada",35,15,31,4.0,12/4/2017,"Aside from the waiting, everything here is decently priced and the food is delicious. Staff are amazing, and good portions. If you're here just for cheesecake - do take out; it's faster, and usually no line to do it. It seems as if all the other negative ratings here are mostly from the wait - well guess what: the hype is real with this location. If you're just as hyped to visit, then there are at least a hundred others with the same thought. Arrive early. Get a buzzer. Come back in an hour or two after shopping around, and check in with your current wait time."
Monika W.,"Toronto, Canada",1,74,65,3.0,12/11/2017,"Friday night 4hrs to get a table for 6 (started lining up before 5pm). Staff were young and energetic, food was surprisingly good, portions were big, but it's a huge time commitment. The table turnover is very slow; there was major confusion when it came time to bring over the cheesecakes. Vegetarians: there's not much for you in terms of entrees - veggie burger and salad. But there are lots of great appetizers instead. I opted for the fish and chips, they were on the salty side but still good and the potion was generous. I'll come back in a few years or just drive to one in Buffalo to avoid the crowds next time."
Jake Y.,"Etobicoke, Toronto, Canada",57,19,,2.0,1/5/2018,"Waste 2 hours of your life waiting to eat large portions of overpriced mediocre meals.  If you feel like getting HANGRY (Hungry + Angry) decide on a family dinner night to The Cheesecake Factory where they do NOT take reservations and have built out a ridiculous 'in-line' system where they overpromise and under-deliver on their expected wait times.  We were told it would take 55-70 minutes for our party of 6 (4 adults, a toddler and a baby) and 110 minutes later we were confirmed that we were next, only to find out that they had us waiting in line as a party of 5... and that they were trying to find a table for us ""again"" after they realized our correct party size. What made it worse was that every time we checked in to see where we were in ""line"" they assured us they were finding us a table that would fit the kids and strollers. Don't go unless you do NOT value your personal time.  The cheesecake itself is good and so is the pleasant service, minus the ""line"" hosts."
Justin P.,"Mississauga, Canada",1,45,44,5.0,12/4/2017,"We were luckily able to get in within 2hrs (1.5 hrs wait to get a buzzer, then about 15 min to get seated). The food was amazing and big portions, the staff were super friendly, and the decor was nice. I don't recommend coming here if you're solely coming for cheesecake unless they have one that other places don't sell (most of the Coffee Culture cafes, sell the same Cheesecake Factory cakes for cheaper prices and no wait times). But where it stands out is the meals. I definitely recommend the porky belly sliders and orange chicken special. Yum! They will let you order your cheesecake for take out towards the middle of your meal so it's ready when you're done eating."
Jeremy B.,"Toronto, Canada",107,33,2,4.0,1/10/2018,"The burger was very good, and the cheesecake was great (although it was takeout), you can split main meals as they are fairly large. More expensive then the US version of the restaurant. This restaurant is also a lot smaller then the ones in the US, in my opinion this is a feeler store, and they will be opening up a few more restaurants soon in the GTHA."
Mei Lan M.,"Toronto, Canada",2,36,41,4.0,1/1/2018,"I finally got to check out the Cheesecake Factory last weekend. We got there at about 11 am and the wait wasn't too bad - 30 minutes. If it was any longer, I wouldn't have waited.  The actual restaurant is quite bright and big and very similar to what it looks like in the US locations.  I ordered off the brunch menu, which is only available on Saturdays and Sundays.  I ordered the fried chicken and waffles which turned out to be quite yummy. I enjoyed the combination of the sweet maple butter syrup and waffles and the savoury breaded fried chicken and poached eggs. Everything was cooked the way that it should be and was thoroughly enjoyed. I was worried that the Toronto location would not be the same as the US locations - but everything was comparable.  I was so full that I had to order a slice of vanilla bean cheesecake to go. That too was very yummy.  Overall, I had a positive experience at the Cheesecake Factory and I look forward to returning and trying other dishes."
Hazel T.,"Toronto, Canada",18,13,9,4.0,1/3/2018,"Got in with 40 min wait! Mind you, it was NYD, mall was closed and only 2 ppl. I always liked CF and go whenever I cross the border. Cnd loc is every bit as consistent to U.S.. Fried mac n cheese is rich but tasty,  dynamite shrimp was light and crunchy. Tried pork chop and wasn't disappointed. Thick but juicy and well balanced, nice salty sweet combination with apple sauce. Portions are big, did not need all that mash potato. For dessert, we had salted caramel cheesecake, very decadent. Simpler the better, but not too simple, white chocolate raspberry is best so far. Honestly, I go for the main meal and not for the cheesecake. CF is not cheap but worth the try. Not worth 3 hr wait unless you have serious shopping to do."
Sophie T.,"Toronto, Canada",0,17,14,3.0,12/31/2017,"With a table of 5, we managed to get a table over the holidays after a total of 4 hours wait time. We waited 30 minutes in line to get the buzzer and were informed the wait time would be 3-3 1/2 hrs at that point.  We ordered the Fried Calamari as an appetizer, which was great. For mains, the Steak Diane, Chargrilled Bone-In New York Steak and Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon. The portions were large, but nothing spectacular. I particularly did not enjoy the salmon entree, as the sauce had too much of a vinaigrette taste for my liking.   As for the dessert, we settled with four different cheesecakes and all were amazing. I highly recommend the Raspberry White Chocolate Cheesecake, although you can't go wrong with any of the options. In conclusion, I would give 4 stars based on the cheesecakes and good service. However, the wait time and mediocre entrees bring it down to a 3."
Jaravm M.,"Mississauga, Canada",6,1,,2.0,1/9/2018,The location was amazing and the restaurant looks great but the biggest problem that this place has is the wait time and the service by far. For me I was not impressed with the food as well. I had ordered a coffee and cheese cake slice and I only received the coffee. I will not be coming back at all. I was so disappointed with this restaurant/ bakery. Oh I should mention that I can receive my bill faster than I can receive my cheese cake.
Daniel P.,"North York, Toronto, Canada",1,45,21,2.0,12/29/2017,"Ok, so me and my friend went there on the weekend and we had to wait in line for 2 hours! Well, if the food was great it may be ok to a certain extent but we were terribly disappointed.  I have been to cheesecake factories in the States and have had a good experience but this place wasn't good at all.  The calamari tasted like it came out of a frozen package from Cosco and that for some $17.  Everything seemed overpriced considering the low quality.  Not great."
Emad I.,"Milton, Canada",0,9,2,1.0,1/7/2018,"Un considerate staff , wait times are a joke and not accurate , the line to get in is not that long to make the wait 3 hours . Owners probably trying to make a big thing out of the restaurant so making people wait for it .  Will never step foot there again ."
Fifi W.,"South End, Halifax, Canada",0,1,8,1.0,12/2/2017,"We were here around 12:00 pm and waiting for about 1 hr in line to get the pager. We got the number 27 and the server told us it takes about 60 mins to get the seat.    HOWEVER, the pager DO NOT have any response after almost 3 hrs. Therefore we decided go back to the reception to find the reason.    The receptionist extremely UNPROFESSIONAL and NO ANY APOLOGIES, even the guests before us already finished meal but definitely there is something wrong with the pager!    Even like this, they didn't give us any solutions and response, No apology and with cold face. We have to stand there about another 20 mins to get the seat!!!! Will NEVER EVER come back and do not want to pay the tips!"
Meythu G.,"York, Toronto, Canada",1,1,1,3.0,12/18/2017,"Basically: Appetizers = pretty standard, warm crab and artichoke dip was good Meals = not worth the hype, Cajun jambalaya flavours were bland even after adding Tabasco sauce and pasta was clumpy :( Cake = worth the hype , very satisfied :)(if you like very sweet cheesecakes)"
Kent M.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",0,3,6,3.0,12/27/2017,"Great food and friendly staff, the food was exceptionally good and are priced reasonably; Other than that, I personally find the cheesecakes a bit ""too common"" and is overhyped and the wait time is too long"
Linnie T.,"North York, Toronto, Canada",1,13,15,4.0,12/5/2017,"I haven't had the cheesecake factory in the states so i can't compare the quality but here is my experiences. The wait line of course is horrible for a Tuesday (1hr 20 mins) after 1pm so i do really recommend everyone to wait until the hype die down a bit before making a visit.  Appetizers we picked tuna tartare and crab cake bites. Both portion were actually smaller than we thought but it did fill up.  The tuna tartare has a balanced flavours of soy and ginger, the avocado chunk at the base separately from the fish make the dish presentable. The chips were a bit too oily.  The crab cake bites came with 6 pieces, mayo and lemon wedge on the side. I Expected it to be more crunchy.  theres a decent amount of crab in the little bites which is worth it.  Jambalaya pasta with shrimp and chicken came in huge portion with a mixed of regular pasta and spinach pasta. I like my pasta more al dente tho. Pasta wasn't rinse thoroughly so it was clumped a bit. Sauce was well seasoned, no complaints.  Almond crusted salmon salad served with kale, quinoa, dried cranberry and dressed in light sweetened balsamic. Salmon skin is crispy and the crusted is not too heavy which makes the dish overall not bad  Tiramisu cheesecake is amazing. The cheesecake part is not dense, more of a mouse texture which makes it light and not so rich to indulge the whole thing. Base is sponge(lady finger) cake soaked w coffee or kahlua just like a regular tiramisu, two of my fave desserts combine into one make so much sense, i do enjoy it !"
I Q.,"Markham, Canada",0,2,5,5.0,12/23/2017,"The Cheese cake Factory just opened up in Yordale Mall was just as good as the one I had tried in the States. The taste and portion is the same. The service was just as good. The manager was helpful. The server was cheerful, helpful .  There was always approximate an hour waiting time in the States. So I don't mind the 3 hours wait in Yordale Mall in Canada. Save the time driving and crossing the boarder. I went shopping when I wait. Sweet."
