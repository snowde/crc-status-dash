Mae F.,"Milton, Canada",56,150,229,3.0,12/2/2017,"This review is based on getting take out cheesecake from here since my husband and I were too full to dine in. We also didn't have time anyway to wait in the line up, though it was shorter (15 people) than the usual hundreds in line from what I've heard. We came here on a Monday (late afternoon) and it took only a few minutes to order the cheesecake slices that we wanted, which was great. It actually took us longer to decide what we wanted to get than the actual ordering process. We ordered the red velvet, coffee chocolate and Oreo dream cheesecake slices, which came out to about $30 in total. It was puzzling to be told that it would be a 40 minutes wait to get three slices of cheesecake though, considering that the cheesecake slices in the display were already sliced up. Anyway, we walked around Yorkdale in the meantime and came back to get the slices, which were waiting on the counter along with the other orders. We ate the cheesecake slices over the course of the week and all were delicious, though a bit smaller than what I remember from several visits to the U.S. locations in past years. I wish that the prices were a bit lower and the portions were larger but that being said, we'll still probably be back to brave the crowds to dine in at some point in the next few months."
J D.,"Vaughan, Canada",0,42,15,5.0,12/21/2017,"YES IT'S WORTH IT! Went to The Cheesecake Factory for my birthday and cannot speak on the wait time because I got lucky... Regardless IM SURE ITS WORTH THE WAIT! Got seated by the bar, which actually isn't so bad at this restaurant. Our server Sean was great and so was the other bar staff.  Ordered the following: 1. Cheeseburger Springrolls - 5/5 Amazing, must try! Although on the greasy side... tasted like a deep friend Big Mac 2. Spinach Dip - 2/5 A bit disappointing. The dip was flavourless, but maybe its because we ate the spring rolls first so our palette was expecting much more lol 3. Four cheese pasta with chicken - 4/5 Nice flavour, pasta cooked nicely al dente 4. Chicken parm 'pizza' pasta - 5/5 Looks amazing, I almost thought it was a pizza... crazy over the top. It was HUGE... also tasted really good except by this time I was super full and wanted space for cheesecake - they gave me a special big box to pack it home in 5. Chris Outrageous Cheesecake - 5/5 For all coconut lovers, this is your flavour! Overall, a wonderful first experience and would def come back. The manager was super nice and made my birthday a lot better. Bar staff were super friendly, down to earth and knowledgeable. They were honest about what they've tried and havent tried, the restaurant is fairly new after all. Cant wait to come back!"
Carmen C.,"Toronto, Canada",249,91,677,5.0,11/18/2017,"Just a warning portion is HUGE like our American neighbours :)   I went to the soft opening and they have tons of staffs.  Seems running quite smoothly and the food taste great.  Of course the highlight is the chessecake and just FYI they are not made in Canada but delivered directly from the warehouse in the states where they have the best quality control.  I ordered the calamari, pizza style chicken parmesan and the godiva cheesecake.  The calamari is big, I would say that's probably the size of two appetizers in a normal restaurant.  The chicken parmesan for $20.50 is prob the best deal you can get.  The chicken is shaped like a pizza on the bottle and the angel hair pasta lays on top.  The cheesecake, you know how good it is I dun even need to explain.  Must try for comfort food lover and be prepare to line up as they dont take reservation.  Feel free to shop in yorkdale during your wait, there's always tons of great retailers to see."
Rosita T.,"Markham, Canada",192,56,25,3.0,12/14/2017,"I wanted this to be a higher-star rating, I really did, but I still can't believe I waited 4.5 hours to spend my money. When I read the reviews and saw the 4+ hours wait, I didn't believe them and now the joke's on me. I went two Saturdays ago at 5 PM and only got seated at 9:30 PM, which was actually our quoted time, because my sister spoke with the manager regarding some issues we had. For example, when she went to get the buzzer, they actually gave ours away to someone else and claimed we picked it up when we didn't. Then, other people that were waiting for less time with the same amount of people in their party got seated before us just because they complained about the long wait. Not to mention, the line-ups are super confusing. I actually went to the second line-up where you get the buzzer by accident at first, and should've just stayed there... Do yourself a favour and drive to Buffalo to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. You'll probably be seated in less time. Or come back to this location months later when they start accepting reservations. The food and portions, however, are worth it. The pastas are amazing and even after waiting as long as I did, I could only finish half of the pasta and packed the rest home along with my cheesecake. They give quite a lot of protein when you opt to add chicken or if it already comes with it. The white chocolate macadamia cheesecake was sold out though, so that was quite disappointing. I tried a bite of the farfalle pasta my sister got and really recommend it; it was so delicious. I got the four cheese pasta with chicken and everyone around told me how good it looked. It tasted even better but I kinda expected more cheese (I LOVE cheese). Love the food, great value for quality and portions, but damn the wait... Maybe I'll come for brunch first thing in the morning and pray it will only be a 2 hour wait. I'll update my review when I do brunch."
Kourtney L.,"Lakeview, Mississauga, Canada",26,4,5,3.0,12/12/2017,"OMG the wait is fucking forever I can not deal with line ups, after line ups, after more line ups & more line ups!! My waitress is never there when I needed her. Thankfully my neighbour beside me spoke up and asked for the complimentary bread to be given to him. So I had to ask for it too. I ordered the Thai coconut-lime chicken. It was okay not the best food I've ate. Defiantly wished I ordered something else on the menu! At least my Dulce de leche Carmel cheesecake was amazing!"
Joe D.,"Mississauga, Canada",19,2,1,3.0,11/22/2017,"Came initially on opening day but there was a 3 hr wait to be seated, so the wife and I returned on day 2 (much earlier this time) and only waited 1 hr. The restaurant itself is almost identical to all other Cheesecake Factories we've seen from east coast to west coast in our travels throughout the states, which is definitely a plus.  On to the food: my wife ordered her regular angel hair shrimp pasta in marinara sauce, which they were able to sub in fettuccini no problem, and I had the factory burrito grande. I can't complain about the burrito, it tasted decent and the chicken was seasoned nicely. The shrimp pasta, on the other hand, was dry and very bland. Our waiter gladly took it back to the kitchen for us and had them remake it. Unfortunately, the kitchens idea of correcting a bland marinara pasta was to add a mountain of diced tomatoes, which only helped make the pasta more sour and much less palatable. Manager came out to see us afterwards to see if he could change out my wife's dish, but at that point we had spent the last 2.5 hrs at factory and I was more than halfway through my meal, so we just wanted to get to dessert already. We opted to order dessert to go as we were becoming anxious from sitting at our table so long. This wasn't an easy process either, however. Our waiter took our cheesecake orders (7 in total), but messed up on so many things I care not to elaborate here. Let's just say the cheesecake order took another hour itself. Got all of them in front of me now, but can't comment on taste until we get home, hopefully all is good.  On to the service: our waiter was quite personable and prompt, and I'm assuming under supervision still as another waiter continuously observed him in action. He was quite attentive to our concerns and prompt at addressing that which needed to be addressed. The manager also appeared rather concerned about out unsatisfying experience so far, and after implying it to him, he offered to ""take the pasta off the bill"", a gesture that normally would be offered without prompting.  Overall, I was somewhat underwhelmed by the opening. The experience was very different from what we've come to expect from Cheesecake Factory. In all fairness, I understand that this is the first restaurant to open in Canada, and these growing pains are to be expected. I would most definitely try returning again in the future, albeit not for at least a few months. Hopefully by then the Factory will be functioning like a well oiled machine. Recommendation: not worth a 3 hr wait, but definitely give it a shot if it's not so busy."
T. B.,"Toronto, Canada",0,5,,4.0,1/5/2018,"Caved to my kids' nagging and went to Cheesecake in Yorkdale. We were a party of 5 and sat in a booth meant for 6. If your party is larger than 6 you will likely have a much, much longer wait because I don't think they have many booths for larger parties, and you would be waiting till empty tables open up near each other.  I suspect this gets easier once winter break is over. The wait: Went on a Friday. We arrived to the line shortly after 2pm. By 2:30 we had our pager and meandered around the mall until 4pm, when we were instructed to return to the ""pager-operational"" zone. By 4:20 we were seated. I found the process to be fairly efficient.  They do not accept reservations. While we didn't have a stroller with us, we noticed a ""stroller parking"" zone, as bringing them to the table is not possible (limited space).  We had two servers during our meal: Leonard (who then went on break) and another gentleman (whose name I forgot).  Both were friendly.  We had been to many Cheesecakes in the US, so we knew what to expect of the menu and décor (and the fact that WiFi is not available in the restaurant). We did not feel rushed during our meal. Food: We ordered a platter of Factory Nachos (a few of us didn't love the cheese on it and I would have liked a bit more sour cream). What was nice was that the cheese was evenly melted, which isn't always the case at other restaurants. One of us ordered the steak tacos and loved them (and the rice). My mother had a classic hamburger (a basic patty), and really liked the fries and the bun. I ordered the spicy cashew chicken.  It had a good ""kick"" to it.  The sauce is a bit sticky (I actually liked it better when I re-heated at home the next day....lots of leftovers!). For the little kiddies: there is a good selection of junior meals. My daughter had initially asked for chicken samosas, but they didn't have anymore.  Overall, it was a positive experience: good food, huge selection with something for everyone, large portions and friendly servers."
Isabelle W.,"Toronto, Canada",2,26,38,5.0,11/16/2017,"I went with a group of 8 during their pre-opening. This was my first time going to the Cheesecake factory as I have never had the opportunity to go in the states. I literally thought they only sold cheesecakes but boy was I wrong. They apparently have over 200 items on the menu but that wasn't available to us during the pre-opening experience. The food portions are ginormous and very tasty. We tried 1 appetizer , 4 entrees and 2 slices of cheese cake. I must say the value is great, the atmosphere was very welcoming, friendly. I lovely how this is conveniently located in Yorkdale mall as I can see this being a huge hotspot.. I hope they will be taking reservations as I can see people from all over coming to experience it. Overall I am very satisfied with the service, the value, portions, options and atmosphere! Will definitely be returning here quite often and recommending it to everyone."
John L.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",1,13,34,2.0,12/1/2017,"I understand it's their first few weeks but I am disappointed. We waited 1 and 1/2 until we get our buzzer. Then only  15 min and we were seated. Not Bad. We waited another half an hour before we got our meal. Again, I am ok with the wait. However , the soup was lukewarm. We asked the waiter if he can nuke it. He brought it back and said ""this time , it's hot at 110°. It was still cold. The meatloaf was also warm, not hot. I think the meal was sitting under the heat lamp for a while. We ordered cheesecake after the meal and had to wait 45 min. Anyway, I will wait until the new year to try again. They have a lot of training to do. I expected more from a well established organization."
Chris And Kris S.,"Toronto, Canada",29,32,87,5.0,11/21/2017,"Hubby and wifey had the pleasure of sampling the menu prior to their actual opening, of course, sans the Porkiebun to make a date night out of it. Cheesecake Factory boasts a HUGE menu selection. Thankfully, for the soft opening, we were given only a limited menu. For appetizer, we had the egg roll platter (avocado, salmon, crispy Cuban and tex-mex). These rolls were exquisite, especially the avo rolls. Hubby then had the Chicken Reisling (chicken breast with Reisling wine sauce served with pasta). It was ok at most, nothing to celebrate about. Wifey had the Hibachi Steak, which was definitely a 10/10 for tenderness and flavour. Would absolutely go back for this steak. It was served with wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. Everything on that plate was just so delicious and complimented each other well. For dessert, hubby and wifey shared a slice of chocolate mousse cheesecake. The best thing we always loved about cheesecake factory cakes is that despite their richness, the sweetness is never overwhelming. Overall, hubby and wifey are positive they will be repeat customers, with the Porkiebun next time. Ambiance was as expected, if you've been to other locations in the States. Side note, wifey also got to try their red sangria. It was good but just a tad too sweet. Their iced tea was not the Canadian Nestea we are used to, it was the American sweetened  iced tea (which was good). With a bottle of Stella for the hubby, the bill (with tax) came out to about $110ish. Our whole meal was complimentary in exchange for filling out a survey that the staff will review prior to their Nov 21 official opening."
Faryal M.,"Mississauga, Canada",0,2,6,5.0,11/21/2017,"This was my first time trying the Cheesecake Factory! I went during their pre-opening and we ordered a bunch of things to try.  1) Fried Calamari - this was good, I'm not a fan of seafood, but my friends loved it!  2) Four cheese pasta - this was amazing!! The sauce was rich and creamy, but it wasn't overwhelmingly cheesy. I liked that the tomato sauce was sweet. Overall, this had great flavour. I would definitely recommend this, and I'd order it again.  3) Louisiana chicken Cajun pasta - didn't try this myself, but my friend loved it!  4) Shrimp platter - this was large enough to share with everyone as well!  5) Tempura fish tacos - you get four tacos, and it's a great entree to share  6) strawberry lemonade - this tasted soooo good and the glass was HUGE. FYI - it's on the sweet side  7) Hershey cheesecake - this was AMAZING. If you love chocolate, get this! It's really rich and creamy, and you have to share it because it's huge.  8) tuxedo cheesecake - this was really good too, and was lighter and tasted more like a mousse.  Keep in mind: the portion sizes for everything are HUGE. You can share the mains with 2-3 people, or just take your leftovers home. So for the price, you're definitely getting your moneys worth.  Overall: I'd recommend this place! There's so many options to try (over 250) and if you go with friends, you're all able to order whatever you like!"
J T.,"Toronto, Canada",0,3,9,4.0,12/10/2017,"Pros: - Food is delicious (in photos: seared ahi tuna, green salad, hibachi steak, peach smoothie, warm honey oat/wheat bread, and mango key lime cheesecake) - Ingredients are fresh and good quality - Price is only slightly higher than the pickle barrel next door, but the quality is better - Large selection of items - Accurate lineup estimate and logistics for so many people Cons: - Long wait. At around 5pm, 1 hour lineup to get a buzzer and then another hour to get a table - Customers must lineup in the middle of the mall corridor - Confused servers repeatedly get items wrong or do not check on the table. If they did not make so many mistakes I would have been able to finish my dinner at least 45 min earlier - Some portions are very small for the price and some are large (inconsistent) -  Takeout requires a wait time of 40 minutes - Cannot handle large parties or groups. Most of the tables are small. Good for couples."
Sadia R.,"Mississauga, Canada",2,46,57,3.0,11/24/2017,"Let's start so we went the first time to The Cheesecake Factory we heard a lot about it so the service was very nice the waitress was very friendly. We ordered two appetizers and to main dishes till then we didn't know that this will be a such big portion so after the food arrived ( fried calamari and eggroll sampler we started to eat the sampler and oh man taste was good but seriously the outside batter was soaked in oil... we didn't know if the food was cooked in oil or oil was cooked in the food  oh man we tried some calamari too and same issue toooooo much oil we couldn't finish it so then the main dishes arrived and oh man again same issue u could see the oil, flavor wise it was fine. I would say reduce the oil and u guys are perfect...we took just to bites of the main dishes and we were done ... we could feel after hours the food in our tummy end of story upset stomach!!  Just a advice reduce the oil but maybe they know it's oily that's why they have the skinny menu so maybe I should go with that for the next time"
Cherry L.,"Markham, Canada",96,30,42,4.0,12/3/2017,"Super excited we have Cheesecake Factory in Toronto! The line up was insane (1hr to get a buzzer, then another 3hr wait around the mall) but nonetheless my friends and I were excited when it was finally our turn! Quality of the food is just like when I had it in buffalo. Menu has lots of selection, portions are huge. The fried Mac and cheese is really good for appetizer. Most of us ordered pasta and while it tasted great, it is more on the salty side. The highlight was definitely the cheesecakes at the end of the meal. Our table ordered the red velvet, Godiva, banana pudding, anniversary and tiramisu cheesecakes. Of them all the red velvet was my favourite - it was really light and not too sweet! Tiramisu and Godiva were my second favourite. Will definitely go back but will skip the line and get the cheesecakes to go!"
Michael B.,"Toronto, Canada",36,2,5,5.0,12/5/2017,"Be prepared to wait as the lines are long for a new establishment. Once you're inside, you'll see a huge dining space and plenty of staff to serve you. The menu is gigantic, so ask your server for recommendations as they've tested them all during their training. They have favourites for sure. The deep fried Mac and cheese balls are definitely a must. I recommend the chicken bellagio for an entree. Large portions and decadent sauces to top off the meal. Once you're ready for dessert, you can't go wrong with any of their dozens of choices of cheesecake. Overall, a good experience with a long wait time. The staff are more than friendly to help out when needed."
Jasmine K.,"Toronto, Canada",166,120,96,3.0,12/21/2017,"I have always loved Cheesecake factory dining experiences in the U.S as it has become such a tradition whenever we are visiting. As such, super excited they finally opened up shop here at Yorkdale! Came on a Wednesday night around 5:30pm and honestly, lines are still crazy. We waiting in the mall line for 20 mins and then another 2 hours almost for the pager to ring. Knowing how busy the restaurant, I had expected a wait but I did not appreciate the front desk hostess poor customer service. She was not very helpful at all and displayed poor attitude towards customers. When we were finally sat down, we also ended up getting a spot really close to the emergency exit which was super chilly. Honestly, this was about to be a 2-star review easily but the food was good and our waitress was a gem. My boyfriend ordered his favourite combo plate (madera chicken and steak) and I ordered myself the shrimp scampi. Both dishes were delicious. My complaint about my dish was that there wasn't a lot of angel hair pasta but a fair amount of shrimps. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate hazelnut cheesecake and it was delicious!!! It essentially taste like a ferrero rocher."
Bernadette M.,"Toronto, Canada",0,22,,2.0,1/10/2018,"The wait for a table is ridiculous. We waited two hours on a Wednesday evening to be seated and our server told us it was more like a 4-6 hour wait on the weekend. After that kind of wait, you'd think the food and service would knock our socks off but both were merely okay. The service was rather slow actually. I would chalk that up to how busy it was but we had more than two servers covering our table and yet at one point we sat with empty glasses for 20 minutes and no one stopped by to ask if we'd like another drink or how we were doing. From the time we put our name on the list for a table to the time we paid our bill was 4 hours. Save your time and your money. It's not worth it."
Monique K.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",1,5,8,5.0,12/10/2017,"My experience here was great! I've heard many good things about this restaurant, so once I heard The Cheesecake Factory was opening a location in Yorkdale, I had to try it out.  I went on a Saturday morning around 10:30am, we were told the wait would be about an hour and were given a buzzer. By the time we walked around the mall the hour was already up. We made our way back to the front desk to ask how much longer and a staff member kindly checked for us. We were next to be buzzed & ended up getting seated 5 minutes later.  We were seated in a booth beside a window. Our server (forgot his name) was amazing, made good recommendations considering it was our first time, was very attentive, friendly, and checked up on us regularly.  Our food came out really fast, I'd say we waited no longer than 10 minutes. They give bread in the meantime which is nice. I ordered the Fish Tacos (roughly $19), it comes with 4 decent sized tacos as well as rice and beans on the side, I highly recommend this dish!! My boyfriend ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (roughly $20), he enjoyed his meal as well.  As for dessert, we had a hard time narrowing it down to only two cheesecakes out of the dozens of delicious ones they have, but we finally decided on the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake and the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake (both about $9 each). Soo good! Very smooth and creamy, we enjoyed both.  Overall the lineup wasn't too bad since we went early, the staff here are very friendly and the food is pretty good! Will definitely be coming back to try out more items on the menu."
Yingbin Z.,"Oakville, Canada",0,5,,5.0,12/24/2017,"Good: Cheesecakes!!!!! When u get there, u should order a lot of cheesecakes!!! Bad: need to wait so long time."
Michelle X.,"Toronto, Canada",0,6,,2.0,1/1/2018,"I really wanted to love their food considering the hype. But I was disappointed after waiting for an hour for takeout, not including waiting for a cashier to take my order.  I ordered the carbonara and two cheesecakes: tiramisu and the banana cream. The carbonara was nothing special. And it was 20 dollars, not worth it in my opinion. The cheesecakes were both light, not too sweet and it was smooth. But it didn't amaze me and they were 10 dollar for each.  Service: Not impressed. They told me to come back 30 minutes for the food which I did and the food was not ready. I waited a whole hour for it. And the pasta was cold. Also, when I show the guy my receipt to pick up my food, he just took it and then went on to help other customers without telling me what is going on. It was after 10 minutes of me trying to get his attention that he told me that the food wasn't ready yet. He should've told me that instead of ignoring me."
