KF C.,"Edmonton, Canada",0,4,11,4.0,12/24/2017,Salted caramel cheesecake : Right balance of salty and sweetness in every bite. The cake size is good as tea or dessert but too big right after a full meal course.
Shira P.,"Toronto, Canada",116,14,3,5.0,12/23/2017,"Yes the line-up is crazy, but as soon as we got in and seated the experience was great! We loved the food and I was happy that I could have some for lunch the next day it was so tasty. I had a chicken mushroom dish, and my friend the spicy orange chicken. Mmm so good! I splurged on my diet and ordered a carrot cheesecake and it was the best cheesecake and probably piece of cake I've ever had. I can't wait to go there again, just hopefully when it's not so busy."
A B.,"Toronto, Canada",0,12,,3.0,12/27/2017,"Came here on a Wednesday night during boxing week. Started waiting in line at 7:15 and did not get seated until 10:30 (45 minutes to get the pager and 2.5 hours waiting in line). Completely understandable as it is still fairly new and it's the day after boxing day. The people that were also waiting around us were getting very agitated and took their stress and anger out on the hostess/receptionist person that handled the customers waiting in line and the hosts / servers in the restaurant, which I found to be unfair and unreasonable as the reasons for the extended wait times is mostly out of their control. Also, the mall really helped as we were able to shop around during our wait time.  Food was great, especially the macaroni & cheese balls! One of the best macaroni & cheese dishes I've ever had. The chicken taquito's were very tasty but it could have had a bit more spice to it, but that's just personal taste. The only thing I didn't like about my experience here was overhearing some of the servers / hosts badmouthing and mocking some of the customers in the presence of other customers. But our server, Michael, was excellent and genuinely friendly; he checked up on us a lot to make sure we were okay. Also, the cheesecakes (Vanilla bean & salted caramel) did take a while to get served to us, but the taste makes up for it. Will come visit again during a not-so-busy time."
Chloe S.,"Willowdale, Toronto, Canada",21,1,,1.0,12/16/2017,"I normally don't leave comments but the the urge to get the worst experience out wins this time.  We(group of 3) waited in the line for 1 hour to get a buzzer during lunch time on a Saturday. By the time we finally got our name down and a buzzer in hand, the host told us it's 60-85mins wait. It's ok so we waited. After TWO and HALF HOURS (you do the math. 60 mins my ass), the buzzer was still as quite as it was drained. We went back to the restaurant to ask for updates, and saw ppl after us in the line were already got seated(also a table for 3-4). We asked for the reason why the buzzer was not working/why someone behind us were got seat before us, no explanation or apologies were received(so RUDE) only a statement like""you will be next"". Then we waited for another 20 mins to be""next"" seated.  Our server was nice and friendly, but SUPER SLOW just like the wait to get in. We WAITED to get the menu, WAITED to get the food, WAITED to get the bill. By the time we finish our ""lunch"", it was 5:30pm. The food and cheesecake were just average, nothing special or so good about it. Clearly it's overpriced. A slice of cheesecake for $10???? You can imagine the price of the other food. Carole's Cafe did a much better job on cheesecake and charged less.  The food/service were not worth my time and money. Just some tips on the management: I understand that you can't expand the place to shorten the line, but at least GET MORE SERVER! And pls train your host well to be more polite."
Mai N.,"Toronto, Canada",8,57,197,3.0,12/17/2017,"1 star for the wait and no reservation allowed. 3 stars for the food as not all of what we ordered was hot and that great. However, the tiramisu cheesecake made up for any shortcomings. Will definitely return for more cheesecake but probably as take out only or when the lines isn't so crazy."
XSkyMachinex ..,"Markham, Canada",0,6,10,3.0,1/6/2018,"Went here with a couple of friends on a Friday morning. The first 20 in line receive those beepers to notify that the table is ready. Everyone else lines up! The menu is huuuuge. Seriously, don't underestimate this. What is bothersome is that some of the titles of the food seem to overlap. A lot of the pastas dishes come in a ""lunch size"" option which is really just a smaller portion but they would have their own section in the menu and the regular portions would be listed under different sections. It would have made scanning the menu easier if the food item was described and then have a side note that there are two portion sizes available rather than flipping pages to read the same thing. The Caesar salad a friend ordered was no joke, the size of a pizza pan. I ordered the carbonara and it was okay, I wouldn't abandon it altogether but I've had better and because the menu is so big I would try other dishes first. The cheesecakes are somewhat typical? I ordered the banana cream cheesecake and it was way too sweet for my liking and had more whipping cream than necessary. I've had better cheesecakes from Costco to be quite honest. The service however makes this place a little bit more enjoyable. We were seated at a sort of hub where all the employees would gather and you could tell management was well done! Our server was really sweet as well.  I would definitely go again with a large group but maybe when the hype dies down a little bit and there are no ridiculous lineups. All I can say is it does come off as a stereotypical ""American"" restaurant; an overly ambitious menu with overly indulgent food BUT the atmosphere is nonetheless fun and relaxed. Realistically I would give it a 3.5 if I could."
Kisko K.,"Toronto, Canada",2,2,,1.0,12/30/2017,I lost a key and it was returned to an employee at Cheesecake Factory after asking the manager to locate the employee barely attempted to help me. I waited patiently for 2hrs in the 2hrs I asked him once more to check he said he made an announcement and that's all he could do. Another employee saw me there for so long and asked if I needed help. 2 mins later the same manager approaches me and tells me that he can't go around asking all his employees that match the description I gave him and at this point I was being a distraction. I explained it was my car key and I can't leave without it and he said there is nothing he can do. I went to the security office and they had to pull it up on camera walk me across the entire mall and tell another mangager that it was given to an employee on camera and voila the 2nd manager finds my key in under 2 minutes. The 1st manager clearly didn't have the time or patience to deal with my issue. He has a very impatient demeanour and an extreme lack of empathy for absolutely no reason. People like him should be in a position of authority. He was the most unpleasant manager I have ever had to deal with and I wouldn't spend 1$ in the establishment while someone like that is employed.
Amy M.,"Thornhill, Markham, Canada",0,12,,4.0,1/6/2018,"Have been to various Cheesecake Factories throughout the US so was waiting until the excitement of its opening and crowds wore down.  Well thats not happening so fast.  My daughter picked up a buzzer at 10:50 am, restaurant opens at 11:30 and we were told to come  closer to the restaurant around 11:40.  By then there was a long line up in the mall.  We were seated by 11:50 which was great.  It seems they have figured out the flow of seating better than what I read at their start.  We ordered lunch sized salads (my fave Santa Fe, a Cobb and a Chicken Avocado).  Happy to report the wheat bread and salads were exactly the same as we expected.  The major disappointment was the iced tea.  Was looking forward to unsweetened tropical yet they don't have it and the alternative was some strange flavour that tasted sweetened?   Please please bring north that tea.   We bought 5! slices of cheesecake to take home.  Very pricey and I recall the slices being bigger but still yum. Overall we enjoyed our lunch. Shout out to Amanda who was a terrific waitress.  Will I go back? Yes. But not until the wait times are reduced.  Welcome to Canada Cheesecake Factory."
Lori C.,"Toronto, Canada",0,2,,5.0,11/30/2017,"The arrival of The Cheesecake Factory at Yorkdale has come with much fanfare!   Having been to several US locations, I was familiar with the menu and looked forward to my visit with a gal pal.  We arrived mid-afternoon and checked in with the hostess to receive our pager.  Our wait-time was on point and we were seated within that wait-time as promised.   Our server, Krystin, was wonderful.  She checked off all of the boxes - professional, polite and personable.   We ordered a house salad to share and the ""skinny salmon"".  The salad was a generous portion to enjoy with their amazing brown bread.  The mains were flavourful, cooked to our requests and accompanied by seasonal vegetables.   To finish off our meal we indulged in our cheesecake favourites - a slice of Dulce de Leche cheesecake for me and a slice of Red Velvet cheesecake for my dining partner.  Unbeknownst to me, my friend had requested that my slice came with ""birthday wishes"".  I was serenaded by staff with a chorus of Happy Birthday complete with candles, candy confetti and extra whip creme.   It was an awesome visit to The Cheesecake Factory and we look forward to making a return visit soon!"
Anne H.,"Ajax, Canada",0,1,,3.0,12/7/2017,"Line started forming at 10 am -- and the restaurant opens at 11:30 am. Good thing we only had take-out. No line up there at noon. Service was good but had multiple issues with their interac connection.  Ordered the pork belly sliders, bellagio, and two cheesecakes. All were good but the portion size of the cheesecake is small! Surprising since we have been to a few locations in the U.S. and the sizes are much bigger. This is what this restaurant is famous or infamous for --their gigantic serving. For $10 a slice it would have been nice to have the large portion as we've come to expect. (And before others may comment on how that'll be healthier for me in the long run, I share this with others or I eat it over a couple of days :-)"
K R.,"Toronto, Canada",0,13,8,5.0,11/16/2017,I never thought I'd see the day where I don't have to cross the border to visit my favourite restaurant in the whole world. I visited today and I don't have any complaints. The service is spectacular and the food is just as good as I have known it to be in the US. The portion sizes are huge!
Raychelle W.,"Toronto, Canada",169,2,,3.0,12/20/2017,At the moment I understand that it's busy at the moment so I will not complain about that. It just sucks that the wait time for take out is standing in line to stand in line but I'm sure it would get better. I was a little surprised by the price of a slice of cheesecake but the slice was a pretty decent size. Pretty rich taste of cheesecake
Asmaa H.,"Oakville, Canada",5,97,20,2.0,11/29/2017,"Im a huge fan of this chain and was extremely excited to enjoy the offerings closer to home rather than trekking to Buffalo. We ordered three apps, two mains, and were planning on getting cheesecake to go.  I was beyond disappointed -- 2/3 apps were incorrect, 1/3 had contamination (blonde hair from maybe the server). I mentioned this to the server and, though she was nice, she did very little to fix the situation and we just asked for the mains instead of reordering the apps. When the mains arrived, my dish was great but my husbands was completely at room temp -- how does that even happen? We decided to cut out losses and not waste any more time (diabetic and insulin dependent..  couldn't wait any longer). We paid the bill, including the three apps that we didn't consume as well paid for his steak which also wasn't consumed.  I'm hoping this was a one off but spending nearly $200 on wine and food that we didn't even eat... kind of seems unreasonable."
Alex L.,"Vaughan, Canada",0,2,,5.0,11/23/2017,"Amazing services here. Food was amazing and delicious. The portions are huge so if you're a person who doesn't have a big appetite, share a dish with someone. Waiting took an hour and half long because it just opened couple days ago and it's the first location to open in Canada. However, they give you a buzzer and u can go shopping in the mall while waiting for your table. The staffs will explain more about how the waiting will work. Staffs are really nice and friendly. Definitely will go back again after 90 days of the opening date because then they will start accepting reservations."
Em Y.L. L.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",0,5,7,3.0,12/23/2017,"TL;DR at the end. Today is December 23, 2017.  I had my name and number of people in my group (ten) written down on the waiting list and received the buzzer.  I was also told that my entire group had to be present upon being seated at 10:00AM.  Since three out of ten of us were still on our way to the restaurant, they would not have been able to make it for 10:00AM.  We realized that and went back to see if we could change our seating time to 10:30AM.  No problem.  All was well at the time.   Pager beeped at 10:00AM and ran to the front desk with the buzzing buzzer in hand and handed the buzzer to the head hostess.  (We were later told by our server that her name was Anna, so we will call her Anna.)  Anna asked me if the rest of my group was with me.  I said yes, they are walking towards the restaurant and will be here shortly.  I asked the front desk if they were told about the time change (from 10:00AM to 10:30AM).  They were not informed about it.  I explained, ""We have seven out of ten people who are present.  The other three are running late due to traffic.  Is there any way that we can push our time to 10:30AM as the man at the front counter outside marked us down for 10:30AM."".  I was given a stern response by Anna saying-- this is not what she said exactly but it is along the lines of it--, ""We can't push other tables who are in front of you back because of your group's sluggishness.  Being stuck in traffic will take them about half an hour to get here. I'll have to cancel your table and bring in the next one"".  To her colleague Anna said ""Bring in the next one"".   Before I continue, I must explain that I'm clinically diagnosed with anxiety.  This means that I'm easily anxious under pressure.  I'm also not trying to get sympathy.  I know how busy they can be.  I understand the situation and that they couldn't help it.  I'd also like to mention that Anna's attitude was not pleasant from the get-go. When my group (same seven out of ten of us) finally got to the restaurant.  I wasn't able to properly relay the situation to one of them at the time.  Let's call her K.  K was told by either Anna or one of the hostesses what happened.  I was trying to calm myself down and K assured to me that everything will be alright, and that all I had to do was to relax and not worry.  Anna had an awkward look on her face.  I brushed it off.  K then told Anna that I have anxiety. She said this to clear the air of things.  Suddenly, Anna looked at me and said, ""Well we don't serve people with anxiety.  You better step back over there (near the exit) and chill."". WOW, ANNA.  Firstly, you don't serve people with anxiety?  You just showed yourself as a prejudiced and ignorant human being.  I don't care if you are like that as a person, you're AT WORK in the CUSTOMER SERVICE FIELD.  You said this to a CUSTOMER.  You're supposed to be professional in a workplace.  Where did you customer service manners go?  Anna somewhat lacks common sense it seems. The remaining people in the group were close by.  Anna immediately had a change of heart and said-- again, not exactly her words, ""So since they're close by I can seat you now."".  Anna, did you finally realized that you messed up and then you tried to sugarcoat the situation?  Needless behaviour from a HEAD HOSTESS, meaning that she was technically the leader of the host crew.   On the bright side, our server Shanon (I believe that this is her name) as well as another server (my apologies, I forgot her name!) made the dining experience memorable.  I should just forget about the Anna fiasco, but it must be addressed. TL;DR:  Head hostess displayed horrible customer service (prejudice and ignorance against those with anxiety/mental illness) due to lack of communication within their team.  Our table was almost canceled."
Elle Z.,"Vaughan, Canada",24,2,,5.0,12/13/2017,I just attended the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. We got in line at 11am and were told we would be seated by 12:30. Our table was ready by 12:10.  I had the California Guacamole salad and my friend had chicken teriyaki. The food was delicious and the portions too big to finish. We split the Chris's outrageous cheesecake. It was very decadent and filling - we could not finish the piece. Highly recommend if you like coconut.  I felt compelled to write this review mostly because of how nice the staff was. Everyone was so friendly and chatty - I really appreciated this!
Deborah H.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",70,10,1,3.0,12/2/2017,"Took about 3.5 hrs to get seated for dinner for 5 on a Saturday (got there around 3:50). Once we were seated it took another 30 mins just to get drinks at our table, they also ran out of Stella.. Our server had to keep coming back to tell us that the apps we ordered were sold out / some of our entrees were sold out as well. We ended up having to go for our 3rd / 4th choices for some items which was a huge disappointment... but surprisingly it was pretty good! Food was worth going there for. Service near the end was super slow, we wanted our cheesecakes and the bill, took another 30 mins.."
Norm W.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",0,12,,5.0,12/8/2017,"I'm pleasantly surprised. I've been to a bunch of CFs across the US and would generally rate them 3 - 4 stars. This one was significantly more vibrant, with friendlier staff, cleaner tables, and despite a huge lineup, short wait times for food. Perhaps that will all wear off as the place gets older, but for now, this one's a must. The only thing that sucks is their pricing. I guess that's the reality of the current USD/CAD situation."
Joanna L.,"Toronto, Canada",1,4,2,3.0,11/27/2017,"We decided to check out the Cheesecake this past Saturday. Began lining up at 1:10pm. Thought the line was moving fairly quick, but that was just the line to put your name down. Got my name down at 2pm. Had to come back after 30 minutes to get a pager. Lined up again for another 10 minutes and then finally got one. Gave us an estimate of more than hour and half. Got our table at 4pm.  I ordered the classic meatloaf. Same portion and flavours as when I get it from the states. We had to order our cheesecake while we waited for our main because the wait time was approx 1 hour. Our food took approx 20mins... the cheesecake took about 1 hour after it was entered. For a slice of cheesecake that's already pre-cut?? We decided to order cheesecake for take out while we were dining as well since the cheesecake take out line was out the front door/over 1 hour wait.  Our server did not offer to refill our waters or bread, but service wasn't terrible. They definitely need more people working at the cheesecake counter. Will wait until after the holidays to return."
