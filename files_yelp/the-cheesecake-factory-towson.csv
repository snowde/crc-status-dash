Michael P.,"Bel Air, MD",4,18,,4.0,10/8/2017,"Overall, it was very nice.  Pros: The staff was friendly and attentive.  The food was excellent. Call me Capitan Obvious, but the lemon cheesecake was outstanding.  Con: It's too dark in there. I couldn't read the menu without using the flashlight function on my phone."
BC W.,"Converse, TX",9,5,2,1.0,12/19/2017,"I ordered Shepard's pie as you can see in the picture. The worst Shepard's pie ever. Felt like I'm eating a pile of grease. Very disappointing as this is a staple for Cheesecake Factory. Do not order here again ever.  The quality has drastically gone down. I will never eat here again. No coronary for me On a lighter note. I spoke to the manager  about my food. He was very gracious and apologized for the food and allowed me to order something else. I ordered an spinach, bacon omelette with toast instead.... the omelette was very good and I was happy. I appreciate the professionalism and the prompt action by the manager. Because of him we stayed and our experience was remediated. Thank you Mr. Manager."
Whitley D.,"Churchville, MD",160,151,1757,3.0,10/18/2017,I love the Cheesecake Factory from the presentation of the restaurant to the wonderful food. Yes even though I love Cheesecake Factory this location has let me down twice. Since they don't offer reservations I have set up two parties at this location (meaning showed up 2 hours before the event) and they have always had an excuse when it's time for the area I waited for being available. So that's been a let down. The manager the second time comped some appetizers on the house but my guest were starving from the wait so many people were upset.  The food at this location is delicious! I have only experienced one issue before and it wasn't their fault. The service to get our food was average which was disappointing. The waitress we had wasn't the most personable person but we were all still nice with her. The appetizers came at a decent rate but our main entrees were all coming out at all different times. That was disappointing for the simple fact everyone was starving! Even though the food wasn't all on point one thing that truly was were the drinks! I ordered three and they were all pleasant!  Hopefully this location can get it together to get the 5 stars I know them to be!!
Curtis S.,"Goose Creek, SC",14,66,65,3.0,12/19/2017,Its probably called the cheese cake factory for a reason. I had pancakes chicken and waffles and scrambled eggs with hollandaise sauce. It was ok didn't really leave a big impression in the tastebuds but I do like to be fair and try this place a couple more times to really have a just opinion about it. This experience I had here this time was mediocre at best. They did take a while to bring the food out and the syrup made my mouths dry. Idk it could have been me very I'm thinking having brunch here isn't he best idea to go with.
Brittany V.,"Baltimore, MD",235,11,9,2.0,1/7/2018,"I always order my cheesecake curbside pickup; however, this evening after waiting on hold for ten minutes I was informed that pickup orders for cheesecake are not allowed. I work in the mall and only wanted to pick it up curbside. Oh AND ALL of the 15 minute curbside parking spaces were occupied by patrons who definitely were there longer than 15 minutes. A HUGE inconvenience for a restaurant whose main staple is CHEESECAKE!"
Jada C.,"Reisterstown, MD",156,304,2568,4.0,6/22/2017,"Fantastic visit, great customer service, slightly above average food. Visited this location w a large party after goddaughters graduation. We were given Abby & Kia to take our orders, etc.  They were extremely professional, nice and 100% accuracy w orders.  The appetizers came out at a good pace but the entrees dragged a little as far as reaching the table and there were major complaints about a few food items. Mainly the blandness of a few items and  $1 - $3 upcharge on other sides offered.  I must admit, I was a little shocked about the complaints ... Until I tasted my food. Collectively we ordered Nashville hot chicken nuggets, Lunch salmon fresh grilled salmon, Bacon bacon cheeseburger, Lunch fettuccini Alfredo w shrimp, Lunch soup, salad, and Chicken salad sandwich. Also, Calamari & Angel shrimp pasta. Everything came to the table plated well."
Sukhmani K.,"New York, NY",9,42,62,5.0,10/24/2017,"Great food! Located next to Sheraton where I am staying and has the nicest stores in the mall: LV, Burberry, Tiffany, Cartier etc. staff is very nice as well. Always love cheesecake decor"
Kendra R.,"Randallstown, MD",140,116,133,3.0,7/19/2017,"Bunch here is great. That's really all I eat from here other than the amazing cheesecake. This location is great and very popular, as it is always crowded. Sometimes, the wait can be pretty ridiculous. Service is pretty good. There have been a couple of times that I have had to send food back, which was disappointing. But, each time, the issue was corrected."
Tina J.,"Perry Hall, MD",3,94,206,4.0,7/2/2017,"Today's bartender, who shall remain nameless was sarcastic and looked at me like I was crazy when I made a reasonable special request on our most recent visit 07-02-17 at 10am. I requested that my eggs be cooked hard/well done, like I do EVERY time. We are regular customers, so I know exactly what I want and how I want it. He stated ""the consistency of eggs won't get hard.""  What eggs does he eat? Bill Nye the Egg Guy. Annoying! He poured a very weak Typhoon for $11.50 and failed to order my potatoes. They were not served with my entrée. We will return, but if he's bartending, we'll sit elsewhere. *Four stars for the food and not the last dining experience."
Maria V.,"Marriottsville, MD",249,710,50,5.0,4/25/2017,"I never have a bad experience here.  Despite the restaurant being corporate, they strive to train their employees to make each guest feel well taken care of like a regular customer. I recently went to the mall to exchange some make up at the Sephora.  I was starving and decided to sit at the bar for a quick bite to eat and a drink (or two). Joe C. took care of me and did a wonderful job.  He makes a mean margarita, and provided a nice, light, lunchtime banter with me as I sat and enjoyed my lunch. I ordered a glass of rose, a margarita, the Tex mex egg rolls, the Caesar salad, fried mac and cheese balls (to go), and fried chicken sliders (to go). Everyone from the food runners to the bussers were efficient, pleasant, and great.  I would go back next time I am at the Towson Town Center for sure."
Dan H.,"Shrewsbury, PA",5,25,27,1.0,10/4/2017,"I'm giving two stars becouse this place was just that bad. The menu is huge, don't know the exact number but around 14 pages long. I ended up choosing the chicken crusted Romano ($17). While waiting on my food, i also had to wait on my drink to be refilled, for at least 5 to 10 minutes as many a waitress and waiter passed by it sat empty. Finally I had to stop a waitress passing by in order to get my drink refilled. This was a Tuesday night, with no wait to be seated mind you, so no legit reason for anything to be taking so long.  When our food arrived, my noodles where under cooked and the chicken.... well for $17, when you order what is essentially chicken parmesan, you picture a real piece of chicken and fully cooked noodles. The chicken was more of a McDonald's nugget style. Not real chicken, more like mashed meat, formed and shaped into a flat piece of meat with a crust on it. Not at all what $17 Should have gotten me. The drink I ordered was a long island iced tea. Which is 90% alcohol. Not this drink, 10% alcohol max. It was so watered down it tasted more along the lines of a soda than an alcoholic beverage, and they cost over $11 to boot. The service was extremely slow. Literraly over 10 minutes just for the waitress to get the check and bring it back. Unreal. End of story, I will NOT be coming back to this place ever again, and with so many other options nearby, why would anyone want to come here?"
Anonymous S.,"York, PA",0,24,,4.0,12/30/2017,"The hostesses were extremely friendly. The wait was longer than we were told, about 40 mins when they told us 20, but that's okay. Our waiter was John. He was so nice and very helpful with our questions. The food was good, I got a salad and it was huge. John always made sure we weren't low on water which was nice because some restaurants take forever to refill. The Cheesecake was still frozen :( which kind of ruined the greatness of the rest of the experience. But I would return to cheese cake factory"
Charlie L.,"Baltimore, MD",156,98,176,3.0,12/19/2016,"This is your typical Cheesecake Factory and with it comes some pro's and cons. The pros: -Location (within the Towson center Mall) -Busy area of towson The Cons: -Parking can be a hassle -Service Personally, I think the Cheesecake Factory has one major flaw that's universal to all it's branches; The fact that they try to cater to everyone! Their menu is like a book.  There's so many pages and so many items that it takes you 15 minutes just to look through.  It's impractical and actually makes it frustrating as a customer.  I think from a marketing standpoint, it's ridiculous. The other downfall of this particular location is probably service.  service is highly dependent on your server and since you're so close to the Towson Area, most of your servers tend to be young ""adults""/college kids.  With that said, you'll NEVER get the same consistency of service twice.  Some visits may be outstanding, while other times, can be just so-so. I'll admit, this is your typical cheesecake factory, nothing more and nothing less.  It's not outstanding, but it's good for a meal if you're around and want something that's not super expensive.  And, of course, the meal portions can feed 10."
Candis M.,"Alexandria, VA",182,93,76,4.0,8/3/2017,"This Cheesecake location is solid. The wait staff is pleasant and the food is what you can expect from a Cheesecake Factory. The host staff's attitudes can be a little 50/50, but they do what they can with the hoards of people that eat here."
Matthew U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2085,1443,644,3.0,11/6/2016,"I have to preface this with the fact that I did not dine in here.  I really only wanted a piece of cheesecake.  With that being said, I was on a mission and right before I left here I thought I would stop in quickly and be on my way.  That turned out to be a fiasco. I walked in and walked right up to the cheesecake counter and looked at the cheesecake menu.  (Man, that's too many cheesecakes in one sentence) After looking at the menu I had to wait several minutes to be noticed standing there.  Once I was noticed, I was ignored.  Finally I was asked what I wanted and then told it would be several minutes to get it because of the orders from the people dining in.   When I did finally get my order I was happy to finally pay and get out of there.  If looks could have killed in here, I probably wouldn't have been walking out.  The person cutting and serving the cheesecake did not look like she was in a happy place.  In fact it looked as if she was in her own personal hell."
Brandon S.,"Essex, MD",26,157,153,3.0,10/13/2017,"Not many things could be said of Cheesecake Factory negatively. It's reputation of a upscale comfort food establishment is true. However, I must dissect this Towson location and even comment on a few issues controlled by corporate. The location is nice and most importantly clean. However, I don't understand the decor. It's quite confusing and kinda reminds me of an Indian restaurant. The food prices are not super pricey, but certainly not the most affordable. The food came hot 25 minutes after ordering but the portions seemed skimpy. I like most people love cheesecake so I obviously ordered a slice. To be honest, I expected to be in cheesecake heaven. I thought I'd have my life flash before my eyes after biting into what's supposed to be the best cheesecake on earth. But that wasn't the case. It's a middle of the road cheesecake that extremely overpriced. I guess that's why when you look around the restaurant you don't see many people actually ordering it. They have plenty of options in terms of flavors but how do you price a slice of cheesecake almost as much as a steak entree? While the food is decent and the atmosphere is confusing but decent, the most important factor of this restaurant is disappointing. But it's not bad..."
Trina T.,"Baltimore, MD",36,62,183,2.0,4/11/2017,We are regulars and the kitchen was off tonight my. Sauces were bland and threw off the taste of everything. Bread was stale and kitchen didn't seem to care quality was off. Hopefully this was a one night incident because we really enjoyed meals here preciously. Server Ace was ok. Only problem he was defending the poor sauces. Ended up taking food to go. The dining experience was not great. :(
Domo W.,"Elkridge, MD",143,5,2,1.0,3/31/2017,The service was okay but not exemplary. My food was less than okay and I am not a happy camper. How do you mess up an omelette I'm not really sure. As soon as it came out I knew it was going to be gross. Even the presentation wasn't good. Also did I mention how spongey my eggs were. Kind of reminded me off the carton eggs they give you at a complimentary breakfast. That's exactly why I sent these back. They needed to be complimentary.
Holly S.,"Baltimore, MD",391,421,885,4.0,11/4/2015,"I like the cheesecake factory, but I love the fact it was a first date location.   This visit I got a burger, because apparently all turkey in the place was not being served....no reason given, but I am guessing a recall.  The menu here, is expansive.....no....it is a BOOK.   There is something for EVERYONE.   The burger I had was medium rare, and it was perfectly cooked.    My love had a veggie burger, and she enjoyed it as well.   One thing was troublesome...    The first person who was our server was great.    Then there was shift change and no warning..... we had a new server.   The second server was ok, but it is good customer service to inform the customer , instead of doing the ""server switch"", lol."
Emilie J.,"Towson, MD",11,103,53,5.0,12/15/2016,"I am in love with the firecracker salmon appetizers. I sat at the bar having drinks, chatting people up, and talking to the bartenders for a smooth 3 hours.  The kitchen was a bit slow with getting meals out; however, it was exceptionally busy (there was a wait to be seating in the main dining area).  The drinks were delicious and well made and I especially enjoy the dirty martinis and sangria here.  I'll definitely be back to treat myself to a nice dinner and drinks again."
Terry B.,"Baltimore, MD",2,17,,1.0,1/29/2017,Lousy management. Lousy. I'm not a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory to begin with. But this place sets a new low in terms of organization and service. Told me wait was 20 minutes. Actual wait was 45. Then waited an hour before food arrived. Then my burger came with a giant chunk out of it. Like a big bite. Taken by someone who was not me. I don't actually think it was a bite but I'm still not sure how else a giant half moon chunk was missing from my burger. Or why.  You've been warned!
Shanay B.,"Owings Mills, MD",97,148,25,4.0,10/30/2016,Dined here many of times with family and friends.  Customer Service has been great all times. I enjoy the portion sizes lol because I always get to take some home and eat it another day. My waittress is always very pleasant.  My go to dish is the bang bang chicken and shrimp  And red velvet cupcake.  Anyone can find something on the menu. Go and enjoy
Kelly D.,"Nags Head, NC",0,4,,1.0,10/28/2017,"First off, the wait was a long line and we had to wait forever and there was not even that many people there. Second, when our pager when off we had to wait another 10 minutes to be seated. When we were seated the hostess took us to a table and it was not ready then she just disappeared and left us without a table in the middle of the restaurant. Fourth, she was very rude. Fifth, the service was terrible and the food was not what it used to be. Don't eat here. Go to another cheesecake factory that runs more efficiently."
Kevin M.,"Baltimore, MD",163,288,68,3.0,3/15/2016,"I don't really know how to review this location because I come here so much, and sometimes it's great while other times it is dreadful... So I'm gonna meet them half way with a 3 star review... First of all, I absolutely love their happy hour menu items! All apps are five dollars and selected drinks are five dollars as well! I love to go with my boyfriend have a couple margaritas and nachos and just relax.  The service is definitely hit or miss! You can tell they no longer really hold their staff to the high service qualities they once did! You once would get a nice greet from the server who would break down things for you. Now you get more of a what's up welcome to cheesecake what do you want to drink? That's really sad because their service is one thing about the company I always loved! I'm here about 3-4 times a month and 3-4 times a month I get different service....  The bartenders.... There is only one I have encountered named Aja who is amazing, bubbly and friendly! If I see her at the bar I most definitely will sit there. Aside from her the other bartenders I have had are a bit dry and non personable....so I don't sit there unless Aja is working. The servers- man have they changed... Bare minimum service, not as friendly and social and knowledgable as they once were... I came across one I really liked and I will request him from now on... The management.... Oh the management.... Very sad from the beginning days of when they opened.... These managers look underdressed, disheveled and not very personable. One lady dropped my food off, she clearly was a manager. She just dropped food off and left!!!! I mean what a perfect opportunity to indulge the guest when you drop food off to them! All you have to do is smile and say hello and ask how everything is? Ask what brought us in... I mean something.... We received non of that.... But hey if the owners are ok with the store managers operating like that, who am I to say anything... The drinks, I love my margarita I get there... Aside from that I only order wine from their bar. The bartenders are trained to count liquor and never over pour or hook a drink up.... So what you get is a 1.25 ounce pour in your mixed drink... For those of you who don't know ounces it's not even enough to really taste in a vodka and cranberry for example.... Their drinks are rediculously OVER priced for the little amount of alcohol they do pour! So I recommend beer and wine unless it's happy hour... Then I would order some of their mixed drinks just to try.... The dessert, I have nothing bad to say their desserts are on point!!!!!!! However the bakery where you order Togo cheesecake, those attendants are not friendly, polite, or moderately personable! They are some of the most cold shouldered employees I have ever met. Hence why I do not order from them very often. I normally just order through my server or bartender....  I do really enjoy their food and desserts and drinks. I just don't always enjoy my service... I wish they would go back to their old ways and teach these servers what being a waiter is all about...."
Aida M.,"Baltimore, MD",145,25,19,5.0,12/21/2016,"Came today with a fairly large party and the food service was stellar!!!  Awesome experience by the entire team.  The food, bread, apetizers..... Everything was great.  Kudos on a job well done."
Pamela K.,"York, PA",1,32,1,1.0,6/11/2017,"Normally love The Cheesecake Factory. Today not so much. Had the Cobb Salad, both of us. Bitter ice burg lettuce with 5 tiny morsels of bacon. $15.50 each. Not worth it. 4 pieces of chicken. Oven was broken, so no bread. Really disappointing.  Towson Cheesecake Factory needs to step up their game, compared to other Cheesecake Factory Restaurants."
Jane D.,"Etters, PA",48,6,,5.0,12/3/2016,"This was my first time being at The Cheesecake Factory. Our seating was excellent as we had a good view of the restaurant and staff is very friendly! Our waitress, Katie, was phenomenal and on top of things and answered any questions that we had. The appetizers, Crab balls and the fried Zucchini, were AWESOME! Our meals were more than enough to eat, taking leftovers home for the next day. The Lemon Raspberry cheesecake was delicious! Can't wait to go back again"
Emma V.,"York, PA",32,34,66,5.0,7/17/2016,"Love love love the Cheesecake Factory-especially Towson's! Whenever my friend is in town we make the drive down to Towson for some shopping and cheesecake.  We've never had a long wait and have always had excellent service and food!  This past trip our waitress was Carol (I hope I've spelled it right!)-officially one of my favorite people.  She was so sweet and absolutely hilarious.  We loved finding out that she's from York too!  She made sure our trip was worth it.  Carol, we love you and hope you're working next time we're in Towson! On a more ""Yelp review"" note, I have never had a poor experience at this location.  The food and drinks are always done well.  I highly recommend the Fried Macaroni and Cheese appetizer, the Hershey's cheesecake, Mango Key Lime cheesecake, or the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee cheesecake for dessert, and my new favorite, the Caribbean Cooler for a drink.  It is one of the tastiest blended drinks I've ever had.  At first I thought it was a virgin, but then again, the drink is better when you can't taste the alcohol right? ;) I always have luck parking in the garage right by the restaurant.  If you'r driving down Dulaney Valley from the I83 side, turn left right before the mall and you'll find a garage that also offers valet parking."
Patrice W.,"Baltimore, MD",44,74,187,5.0,11/29/2016,"I usually love everything I get here from the entrées to the appetizers and cocktails. Here are my favorites: Drinks- Mai tai, mojito, mango mojito, long island and rum punch. All are made strong, delicious and garnished beautifully.  Appetizers- Avocado eggrolls (FAVORITE), buffalo chicken crisps, firecracker salmon rolls, crab balls, dynamite shrimp...I could go on and on literally all the apps are amazing! Entrees- I never thought I'd say this but the Kale and quinoa salad is AMAZING!!! It's hands down my favorite thing to get now. It comes in a huge proportion with a delicious lemon vinaigrette dressing. The perfect balance of sweet and salty. Other entress that are good is the Louisiana chicken. The portions here are very big and filling so plan to take home a to go box. The cheesecake speaks for itself. There are dozens of flavors and they all taste delicious! My favorites are the lemonchello, peanut butter, red velvet, key lime, banana cream, oreo, strawberry and turtle. Fyi the happy hour is also really nice. They have $6 food and drink items. Enjoy!"
Lily R.,"Bethesda, MD",144,135,360,3.0,8/30/2014,"Good food, sloppy service. On my most recent visit, here is the order the food came out: 1) entrees 2) bread 3) soup 4) butter for the bread 5) appetizer The waiter kept apologizing, but never worked her way out of the fluster, and things kept going wrong. Way too many things on the table; didn't get to eat the appetizer until last because I couldn't maneuver over my huge entree salad.  Also, the bus boy who kept cleaning the adjacent tables had a massive quantity of cologne on, which severely decreased the already limited enjoyment I was getting from my awkward meal. The waiter also took our check away before we had even paid, which made things even more awk. The food was good as usual, but the service was a big mess. Also, there was a super annoying loud talker sitting next to me and reading every menu item and description out loud, but I guess that's not their fault."
Tia M.,"York, PA",11,6,,5.0,3/25/2017,"I had to give this place a total of five stars. The food was decadent and the service was impeccable. Our server was amazing, extremely friendly and personable. She made the experience relaxing and took very good care of us. My husband and I enjoyed the atmosphere and the experience. We both recommend this for a great date place."
Leslie T.,"Bel Air, MD",171,5,,2.0,4/3/2017,"I came here for my birthday lunch today. It's a Monday at 1pm, the place is not very full. Our waitress seemed kind of aloof honestly. She was very slow the entire time. Didn't catch her name, but she had curly light blonde hair. The food was good as always (thankfully). I wanted to order cheesecake to eat there, but I had somewhere to be! We ordered cheesecake to go instead. The next time she came to the table, she didn't have checks or the cheesecake. I have no clue why the service was so slow! Worst of all, after I was already home I realized she gave me the wrong cheesecake. I ordered Reese's, but got the Oreo one...and it wasn't amazing. I think I'll pick a different birthday place next year."
Erika H.,"Columbia, MD",77,39,45,4.0,10/23/2015,"Towson's Cheesecake Factory is just like any other. The wait can get very long but you always get the quality food that's a little over priced, but you know you're going to spend that much when you go to Cheesecake.  When I've ordered cheesecake from the bakery area, it's always been crowded and the wait for just one or two pieces of cheesecake can get a little long. The workers are usually pretty frantic and working as hard as they can so its not really their fault. But definitely think the management should figure out how to speed up the process."
David L.,"Nottingham, MD",11,211,1529,2.0,10/17/2014,"7:30 pm at night , busy time for the restaurant business on Friday night !  I would say the counter should have a cashier stand by any time ! We been waiting for a while for orders ! No body take the orders right the way ! Not really acceptable ! If it is too busy on weekend , please hire one more cashier !"
Dominique S.,"Baltimore, MD",3,4,,1.0,3/24/2016,"Absolute nightmare.  Never!  Ever!  Ever come here.  The worst service I've ever experienced.  They couldn't get anything right.  This is no joke.  We had to leave.  And then they tried to make us pay for our meal.  It NEVER came!!! Don't waste your time.  Server was an idiot.  Her manager was even worse.  This place needs to clean house and train staff.   Save your time and high blood pressure meds.  You'd be better off at McDonald's. Heck, Denny's even is higher brow.   If I could give negative stars - I would.  Cheesecake Factory Towson is a colossal failure !!!"
Sharon T.,"Baltimore, MD",0,8,,4.0,7/27/2017,"Nice place, never had a bad meal there.  Service has always been friendly and very good.  A little pricey but recommended."
Steve S.,"Parsippany, NJ",562,1173,285,3.0,4/9/2015,"So it's honestly been about 15 years since I've eaten in a Cheesecake Factory and I wasn't a huge fan back then. My recent visit to this location didn't do much to change my mind. I don't think it's anything I can really put my finger on, but I'm just not as impressed as others. We arrived on a a Sunday - early afternoon and we're told it would be 15-20 minutes...40 minutes later we were seated...another 10 before we were asked about drinks and another 10 before we got the drinks...so an HOUR after we walked in the door we got our drinks.  I get it, you're busy, but you are ALWAYS busy...have enough people working! So the food itself was pretty good.  My daughter really liked her fish and chips and Cesar salad not the best she had, but she liked it.  My sine thought his chicken parm sandwich on french garlic bread WAS one of the tastiest he's had...and he swears it was the garlic bread.   My wife wasn't that hungry so she just ordered a house salad and a white chicken chili. She enjoyed it and said it was very flavorful and savory and just the right amlint...though she would have preferred it a bit spicier.  I tried the fish tacos wanted to have two grilled and two fried, but apparently that's impossible so I got all four fried. They were very good, as were the black beans.  We finished the meal with a slice of a chocolate cheesecake, which was very good, but not as good as Mom's.  So the service wasn't great...but I don't blame my server-side was just too busy and wasn't getting help from the bar or kitchen.  I've always thought Cheesecake Factory just tries to be too much...menu is huge and I don't think you can have superior food when you are trying to do so many different meals."
A.j. R.,"Baltimore, MD",133,207,1433,3.0,1/23/2016,"I am not the biggest fan of the overrated cheese cake factory menu however I do occasionally make a trip out to this congested, no parking, busy Towson area to grab a slice of cheesecake. Honestly, how I feel about this chain restaurant is this: back in the day red lobster used to be the go to spot for the dope boys to impress a lady nowadays red lobster has fallen off the grid and is now replaced by the Cheesecake Factory. So it is just a fancier chain restaurant to go on a first date or take the family now."
Matthew H.,"Washington, DC",774,1035,605,2.0,12/7/2015,"It's your typical Cheesecake Factory. In a city dearth of quality restaurants, we are stuck with mediocrity."
Sandy C.,"Baltimore, MD",2,18,13,5.0,11/16/2015,"This was our first time at the Cheesecake factory. We came in and seated quickly. Our server's Name was Annie who was pleasant and very informative. We started off with Crispy Crab Wonton. Which was well received by my picky eaters. My oldest son ordered the Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon which he found tender and perfectly seasoned. My youngest had their pizza and he was pleased. I had the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. It had a bit of a kick, but that is what I expect with gumbo. It was so much food we had to take a majority home. Our first time there impression was great. Your pleasant staff (Annie) and the lady who brought the appetizer to the table who I did not catch a name were great! Thank you and we look forward to another trip back sometime in the future."
