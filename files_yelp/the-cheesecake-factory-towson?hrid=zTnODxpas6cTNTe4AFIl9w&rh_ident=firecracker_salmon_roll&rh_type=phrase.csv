Patrice W.,"Baltimore, United States",44,74,187,5.0,29/11/2016,"I usually love everything I get here from the entrées to the appetizers and cocktails. Here are my favorites: Drinks- Mai tai, mojito, mango mojito, long island and rum punch. All are made strong, delicious and garnished beautifully.  Appetizers- Avocado eggrolls (FAVORITE), buffalo chicken crisps,  , crab balls, dynamite shrimp...I could go on and on literally all the apps are amazing! Entrees- I never thought I'd say this but the Kale and quinoa salad is AMAZING!!! It's hands down my favorite thing to get now. It comes in a huge proportion with a delicious lemon vinaigrette dressing. The perfect balance of sweet and salty. Other entress that are good is the Louisiana chicken. The portions here are very big and filling so plan to take home a to go box. The cheesecake speaks for itself. There are dozens of flavors and they all taste delicious! My favorites are the lemonchello, peanut butter, red velvet, key lime, banana cream, oreo, strawberry and turtle. Fyi the happy hour is also really nice. They have $6 food and drink items. Enjoy!"
