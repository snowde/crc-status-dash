James C.,"Towson, MD",39,35,2,5.0,6/4/2014,"Yes, it's a chain; yes, it's very popular, noisy and crowded; but yes, it is always good! i have NEVER been disappointed with my food at this fun restaurant. The prices are very reasonable, the portions pretty large and the quality, always great. The service has been lacking on one occasion, but that was the exception and i won't let that ruin my opinion of this fine chain restaurant. I usually get one of the very imaginative chicken dishes or a steak combo platter. You can't go wrong with one of their BIG SALADS either. I don't know how they ever sell any cheesecake here as I'm always too full to do anything except order a slice to go. But on that subject, I just love the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake and the Dulce de Leche...absolutely delish!!!"
Erika F.,"Baltimore, MD",657,246,2024,5.0,8/25/2010,"There is everything to love when you step inside The Cheesecake Factory! Something might mentally be wrong if you feel otherwise. I would  suggest to not go on weekends unless you don't mind the wait like 30 mins plus. The decor is classy yet comfortable and casual. Everything on the menu is made fresh. The prices are a little high about $8-10 for an appetizer and an entree would range $20 or so. The portions equal what we pay, big portions. The hot wings are huge meaty and fabulous. Some of my friends go JUST for the wings!        I get the Jamaican shrimp with rice, beans, plantains and mango  salsa. That runs about $20 and is well worth it, spicy and sweet. My friend got the steak and fries. They enjoyed it, tender juicy and a big portion of great tasting fries. You can order a side of mac & cheese that'll cost about $4.95 but the portions of it you'll definately have some for a doggybag. I've only bought 2 of their cheesecakes but all the flavors I have tried are phenomenal.   Honestly, everyone that I introduce to The Cheesecake Factory loves it  and become lifetime fans."
Katie D.,"Austin, TX",69,282,5,4.0,6/4/2012,"I don't have a Cheesecake Factory where I live, so if I can get to one when I'm out of town, I will. I don't love the place, but they're not awful. The problem for me is their menu is so huge, I've yet to find anything I absolutely love. However, I think I finally found my meal there. First, the wait was surprisingly short. I'm used to having to wait at least half an hour. We had a wait but it wasn't too bad. The service was good too, as it always is. They must put a big emphasis on service there because I've never had a bad experience in regards to that. Then, the food. I got the meat loaf which was amazing. I was tossing up whether to get the sandwich or the meal. I got the meal, but I asked for a side of the tomato bacon jam because I thought it sounded interesting (it comes on the meat loaf sandwich). It was all so good, including the jam. The brown gravy on the meat loaf is good too but the jam is something different. You can get meat loaf with brown gravy anywhere. It comes with mashed potatoes and corn succotash, and boy was that succotash good. The portions are ginormous, so if you've never been to one, be very hungry when you go or be prepared to either split your meal with someone or take leftovers with you."
Todd L.,"Baltimore, MD",0,13,,1.0,3/8/2014,Sucks bigtime. What ever my husband odered they didn't have...what kind of resturant first have anything.... Real racists..took for ever to acknowledge us..then it took a while to take the order...took forever to come   say they dint have it....and it repeated 4times. My food was burnt !! Plenty of resturants in the area to go too...dint have to come here and be treated like this...
Tyler S.,"Parkville, MD",11,93,1,4.0,3/5/2012,"I don't want to write a lot on here because The Cheesecake Factory is the Cheesecake Factory.  How can you not love a place that has Cheesecake? The only thing with this though is I didn't like the aftertaste of our burger sliders (kind of tasted gross).  But their Avocado Egg Rolls were to die for.  And their drinks were delicious! If I were you (a guy taking a girl on a date), just get 1-2 appetizers with a drink, then of course get some cheesecake!  The portions here are just TOO BIG to get an entree AND cheesecake."
Kerry D.,"Lake Worth, FL",31,256,,3.0,11/24/2012,"I ate at this location many times over an unexpected trip to MD.  We always had great service and the food was predictably good. We had everything from salads (the kale, greek, farro and beet, chopped veggie) to apps (tex mex egg rolls, quesidillas, fried mozzarella, flat breads), club sandwiches, chicken marsala, and of course, cheesecake.  It's a busy location, so prepare to wait if you go during peak hours.  Go to the bar and try the Georgia Peach, it's delicious!"
Tim R.,"Indianapolis, IN",68,136,249,3.0,9/10/2012,"It is the same everywhere you go. Lots of choices, never had a bad meal. More stars for individuality, the cookie cutter familiarity brings a 4 star meal to a 3 star review so if you live on the moon and have never been to a Cheesecake ""Fattery"", don't hesitate to give it a try."
Steve Y.,"Ellicott City, MD",6,19,,3.0,8/25/2014,Standard Cheesecake Factory meal. Was pretty good as far as chain restaurants are concerned.  Wait staff was attentive.
Michaek S.,"Lutherville-Timonium, MD",76,288,87,4.0,8/20/2011,"We LOVE the Cheesecake Factory!!  Not what it does to our waistlines, but still..... This chain is the epitome of lard*ss American excess! You can get leftovers for 2 days off one meal, or eat yourself into a fat, salt, and just plain-too-much coma all in one sitting! And the food is surprising really good! The Kobe beef burger-- juicy beef, tastes really grilled in texture and flavor (maybe it is REALLY grilled, but I still have a chain prejudice where I can't quite believe it and suspect it's the best gourmet liquid smoke invented), beef tender and melty, rich brioche bun, just a smear of mayo and sweet, rich sauted onion....ohh, man, it's good.....big-*ss salads, HUGE pizza (bigger than my son's head, but he keeps ordering them-- and it's the KID's menu size, for like what, a baby elephant??? Yet the cheese is gooey and tangy, the sauce slightly spicy and sweet, the crust crisp yet chewy.....) And I can go on and on..... But- on an ironic note-- the CHEESECAKE SUCKS!!  I've tried a few times and gave up- do I just like odd flavors that don't sell?? It's tasted freezer-burned every time I've had it. Yuck! Not like I need the extra coronary bypass, but, please, it's called the Cheesecake Factory..... Service has always been quick and attentive, once you're seated. I like eating at the bar, too- much quicker to get in and served. I love this chain, and I'm not ashamed, because it IS HIGH QUALITY -- and the portions are so huge one noodle could feed an army!!  (speaking of high, and I could just imagine eating here high w/munchies--- you'd bust your gut right open!! Drugs kill!!!!!!)"
Laurie K.,"Essex, MD",74,54,117,1.0,7/10/2012,"I didn't even get a chance to try their food b/c they would not take my reservation!   I had a party of 11 plus 2 children and wanted to make a reservation for a Thursday night at 7pm.  I didn't think I would have a problem since I was calling a week ahead of time.   They said they only took reservations from 4-6pm, how ridiculous is that.   We didn't want to wait when we got there so that's why I was calling wayyyy ahead of time. This restaurant just lost the business of a whole family."
Lauren S.,"Baltimore, MD",263,628,89,4.0,8/12/2011,"I must say, when you know almost everyone who works here your dining experience is that much better. I got the alfredo for lunch, and it was a good portion. Very good, too. My strawberry cheesecake was fantastic. It was like having sex in my mouth. That's how amazing it was.  Pricey, but you get what you pay for."
Elaine T.,"Mt Airy, MD",9,104,,2.0,7/25/2011,"Large portions, decent if predictable food.   But the tables are so damn close together it's like you're eating family style at an Amish place.  Ridiculous.   You're better off for ""privacy"" at the bar. .... although if you're unlucky enough to get the bartender we had, she'll completely ignore you in favor of trying to impress the suits who (she assumes) will tip better.   Someone needs to explain to her about self-fulfilling behavior.  Idiot. Next trip to Towsontowne, I'll stick to the food court."
Michael F.,"Baltimore, MD",41,172,146,3.0,9/22/2011,"I was out on a date tonight at the cheesecake factory.  Not by first choice mind you, this was a geographic decision.But I have always enjoyed my CF visits. The decor at this Cheesecake factory is Egyptian themed and looks great, high ceilings marble,hard wood, very nice. The food and service were good as well. But just good. Not quite as nice as the face she puts forth. We started with fried calamari, it was fresh and tasty, a nice portion.  For dinner my date had the Fish n Chips and I did the Cajun Jambalaya pasta. 4 large battered pieces of hand battered fish. I tasted some, OK, not bad. Lots of batter though. My Jambalaya was decent, medium sized shrimp, chicken, onions peppers and tomatoes in a spicy sauce over a bed of linguine. Not incredible just reliable good food. For desert I had the strawberry shortcake with fresh strawberries,  this is where CF shines...good stuff.It was huge I couldn't finish it. My date had the peanut butter something cheesecake, she said it was good. I didn't taste it, I'm not a cheesecake fan. Our server was a friendly young man, kinda funny how he asked how something looked every time he placed a dish down, had me laughing. Check came to 73 bucks  for two minus tip..I guess someone's gotta pay for the marble and 30 foot ceilings.. All in all a good experience for a chain. Nice digs Cheesecake factory, but I wish you were as delicious as you look. One thumb up for the cheesecake factory."
Meghna A.,"Towson, MD",1,27,23,4.0,10/20/2012,"My husband and I had our date night here. Even though it was a weekday, the place was packed. After just a couple of minutes wait, we were seated.  I sincerely wish they didn't put the tables so close to each other. The adjacent  table was only a couple of inches away that it felt like we are practically one whole table. The size zero waitress didn't have any place to stand between the tables to take our order. And I could literally hear the the neighbours stomach growling!! lol.. Appetisers- 1. Sweet potato fries with the mustard dip was absolutely fantastic. Crispy,crunchy, sweet fries with a little bit of salt sprinkled on top !!!!!  2. Crispy  taquitos was ok-ok.. Nothing spectacular.. Entre- 1. My husband's order of Jambalaya pasta with chicken and shrimp was nice and full of flavour. You'll like it if you like spicy stuff.. They even put a good amount of shrimp and chicken it it. So that definitely is something we would definitely order again.  2. My Garlic noodle with shrimp was FLAVOURLESS, kind of SHRIMPLESS too.. The only thing good about the dish was the freshly grated cheese they put on top!! I asked the waitress about the dish having only a few shrimp, she told me that  they put only 4 per portion, which was exactly what i got.  We definitely would go again, but ask for a booth first!!"
Dani F.,"Cockeysville, MD",3,30,,4.0,7/21/2011,"I went here for the second time this past weekend. I had been telling my best friend about it ever since I had gone for my birthday and we finally decided to go. Upon arrival we were seated right away. It was a tiny both, but since it was just two of us, it was okay. Our waiter Paul was awesome. I swear he's a mind reader of some sorts since he knew exactly what my friend was going to order to drink and the type of cheesecake she was going to get later. Or he's just a really good guesser. But still, he was hilarious and was a fantastic waiter. The food was amazing! My only complaint is that I wish my salad had more chicken in it. You give someone a huge salad and just a few small bits of chicken? Doesn't add up. But still, I'm sure we'll be going back and I'm sure it will be just as good!"
Jonathan L.,"Baltimore, MD",85,84,21,2.0,1/7/2014,"Never trust a ""restaurant"" that can't execute a simple dish that can be made at home with the same half assed effort. I could have saved my $20 and had leftovers..."
Alyce D.,"Perry Hall, MD",183,60,1,4.0,8/24/2011,It's good . . . it's a chain . . . it's way too long of a wait on the weekends.   Went for lunch today and the smaller portions are great.  Navajo chicken sandwich was fabulous.  Good eats . . .but it's a chain.
Diana K.,"Bethesda, MD",123,96,8,2.0,4/3/2014,It's a chain. What can I possibly review about a chain? Portions are large but the prices aren't low. Cheesecake is good. Wait is too long and it's way too hyped up. Spend your money on a local restaurant and you will have a better night.
Ariel H.,"Towson, MD",5,71,,3.0,7/10/2012,"There's nothing to hate about the Cheesecake Factory, it's just overwhelming sometimes because the menu is sooo huge, and the place is even bigger. You can't make reservations for small groups (not sure of the number) so keep that in mind when you plan to go. I generally only go when I get a gift card.  That being said, they have this crab wonton appetizer that is awesome and highly recommended! Also, they have a frozen drink which is called the georgia peach I THINK and it's worth a try as well!"
Julie M.,"New York, NY",263,553,27,5.0,5/24/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory and this location did not disappoint.  We were seated right away in a nice corner booth--away from the noise.  Our waitress was very nice and accommodating.  Everything we ordered was from the Skinnylicious menu and although the dishes had less calories, they were not lacking in taste or size.  I particularly enjoyed the Skinnylicious lettuce wraps and the Asian Chicken Salad.  The low cal Sangria was also delicious.  Overall, I really enjoyed my meal here."
