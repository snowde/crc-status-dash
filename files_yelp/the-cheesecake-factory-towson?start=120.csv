Tricia N.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,10,,3.0,2/8/2012,"The food was pretty good.  I ordered the Steak Diane and the first medallion I bit into wasn't as warm as it could have been.  The other pieces were a bit warmer.  It was cooked correctly as ordered (med-rare).  Our waiter seemed to have other things that were more important, however I didn't notice where his other tables were.  His inattentiveness caused us to leave and return to our hotel for a few more drinks.  Had he been more attentive, we would have stayed for another drink.  And the kicker: he came by and picked up the check before we had left.  Major rule in waiting tables...never pick up the check while the customer is still there.  Glad I tipped him appropriately.  Perhaps I anticipated that? Bottom line: it was good for a semi-late dinner after being on the road and traveling, but I will try another restaurant next time I am in the area."
Carl W.,"Baltimore, MD",1,74,,4.0,5/13/2012,"going out of my way to avoid chains for years, I suppose I missed a potential gem. As most everyone knows virtually every restaraunt in Towson has closed, The only remaining is Cafe Troia. All that is left is nearly a dozen crappy sushi places and bars. Not wanting to head to Lutherville, we decided ""why not"" never been there. well, everything we ordered was either good to excellent.  Now this is not fine dining, but I can tell you the wines were serviceable, the food was fresh and well-made and of generous proportion. The servings, as one would expect in a chain, were huge and the service was prompt and courteous."
Dottie F.,"Abingdon, MD",2,15,,4.0,3/1/2014,"I have eaten at Cheesecake Factory probably 4 times and have never had a bad meal. The portions are huge. You will definitely have leftovers to bring home. So far, the menu item I liked best has been the Chicken Madeira. My husband had a teriyaki steak dish tonight and that tasted good, too. There are a lot of items to choose from. The cheesecake is delicious.     Most of the slices are big enough to share. My family usually orders two different kinds of slices and shares them. Be prepared to wait a long time to be seated. I have never had less than an hour wait here. Tonight the wait was 1 1/2 hours. You can roam the mall for a bit while waiting as long as you are back 1/2 hour before your estimated wait time given. They do not take reservations or do call ahead seating."
A. C.,"Orlando, FL",135,1162,8681,4.0,10/22/2011,"An acquaintance used to say the Cheesecake Factory's portions offended him.  They do serve you a huge amount of food, and from a very extensive menu; ranges from diner to comfort to Asian-accented.  Our usual go-tos are the Avocado Eggrolls (deep fried and stuffed full with avocado chunks, sundried tomato, red onion, cilantro, with a great spicy, sweet-tangy tamarind-cashew dipping sauce) and the Thai Lettuce Wraps (chicken, bean sprouts, variety of dipping sauces, veg garnishes; crisp and fresh).  One could make a meal of just an app.      Really, though, can't come to a place called the CHEESECAKE Factory and not have the cheesecake.   Fave fun flavors:  Banana, Oreo, Chocolate Mousse, Key Lime, Pumpkin, could go on and on.  Have found the fruit flavors to be like fruit (not artificial) and the chocolate ones very decadent. Haven't tried a bad one yet (but then again, it is cheesecake, can't really go wrong).    The Dulaney location sees its fair share of tired mall goers and packs of roving teenagers.  The wait can be a little long, hostesses a  little on the underage side and flaky, and the waitstaff just about the same.  Lighting is somewhat dim, and the space is tight."
Richard B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",5,37,,1.0,12/15/2010,"After calling ahead to reserve a table for a large group of co-workers for our holiday lunch - we were told on arrival that they could not find our booking and had filled all the large tables with walk-ins. They then disputed we had called at all. They offered to split us between booths and told us that it was our fault we had no confirmation number. Had I known they would provide one by phone or that I should have asked for one, things might have been different.  Service here was appalling and we gave up. Across the way is a better steakhouse where I would recommend diners considering eating here should rather go."
Stephanie M.,"Bellevue, WA",9,27,,2.0,9/21/2011,"Ugh. I am not strongly anti-chain, but this place really suffers from the bland mediocrity that anti-chain people complain about. ""Factory"" is right! Every time I've gone, there's been an enormous wait. The tables are uncomfortably close together; I don't know how the poor servers manage to get around. With all the people they cram in there, it gets really loud. I've been there 3-4 times and never had an appetizer or entree that was worth the price. Despite all the oil and salt the kitchen adds, the food lacks distinct flavor and character. Their mixed drinks are pretty good, though many are syrupy-sweet. The tall, fluffy pieces of cheesecake are decadent, but I don't like waiting through a sub-par meal to get to it. I prefer stopping here after I've been shopping at the mall and buying a to-go slice of cheesecake to bring home and eat in comfort."
Bonnie H.,"Woodstock, MD",0,2,,1.0,2/28/2015,"We waited for 30 minutes for a table. When we went to sit down, the server asked us to wait just a little longer while she cleaned the table. After another five minutes, we sat down. Then, the manager came by to say that there was a mistake, and we couldn't sit there. While we waited, we saw person after person get tired of waiting to pay the bill. Suggest you skip this place and go to one of the many other restaurants at the Dulaney Valley Mall."
Bowdoin S.,"Santa Clara, CA",17,137,83,4.0,1/26/2011,"I have been to many Cheesecake Factory restaurants across the U.S., but went to this one for the first time on New Year's Day.   It seems that the major knock on this location is the sub-par service.  I didn't encounter that issue when I was there, although the place may have been less popular due to the holiday. The food was good - I shared the everything pizza with my wife and we left feeling full and happy.  I find the portions generous and the prices reasonable.  There also is a great variety and the food is consistently good. If there were a Cheesecake Factory closer to my home, I would probably go more - that is how much I like the chain!"
Deborah G.,"Timonium, MD",20,156,54,4.0,6/25/2013,"Lunch at the Cheesecake Factory in the Towson location proved to be delightful. Usually chain restaurants are not my favorites but this one changed my mind so much I ordered a bunch of gift cards so i could return another time. The menu is extensive and requires a good pair of reading glasses for those who have problems viewing lots of type on a page. I was given a book with many pages of food selections as well as a brochure with a number of skinnyliscious selections. Nothing tastes better than a nice fresh cold salad on a hot June day so I ordered the French garden salad with grilled chicken (from the skinny menu) and a glass of cold iced tea. In about 15 minutes my food came out as I was finishing reading an article about how couples criticize each other. The server presented me with a huge beautiful salad with field greens, beets (there could have been a few more) candied pecans, goat cheese and perfectly grilled sliced chicken. This was  a salad masterpiece created by the staff in the Cheesecake Factory kitchen. I ate the whole thing with a very nice tangy sweet balsamic vinaigrette dressing that I drizzled on it. There was a bit too much purple cabbage but I pulled it out so i could taste the other greens. The chicken was perfectly  grilled without grease and was fork tender. I have no criticism of this lunch. The service was perfect, the iced tea was real and the salad was delish. The bill was not cheap for sure but somehow I did not mind paying for good food and such a nice experience. I can't wait to receive my gift cards so I can return in the near future. Bon appetit as Julia Childs would have said. I checked out the restroom and noted that the facility was clean and well stocked. Lastly, the place was busy for a Tuesday but the noise level was fine and there was no strange annoying music playing in the restaurant to disturb people who wanted to chat over lunch."
Stephanie B.,"Severna Park, MD",82,67,31,2.0,12/8/2012,"This location is ALWAYS busy. I have never come here and had a wait time of less than 40 minutes. Here are some suggestions if you plan to come here:  A.) Don't come when you're really hungry--You may be driven to cannibalism while you're waiting for a table.  B.) Don't come here without reading material/smart phone gaming/portable movie player/folding chair--Since their ""table pagers"" that they give you will not get a signal beyond 10 feet of their doors, going for a walk around the mall as you wait 3 hours for a table is out of the question. You need to stay entertained somehow. What's the folding chair for? Oh, that's for your you to rest your aching feet. There is ONE (1) long bench that is there in the lobby waiting area (inside) and a couple benches beyond the doors of the mall entrance, and as you can imagine, they fill up quickly. This means, you'll be left with standing for the entire length of time until you get a table assignment which typically takes between 40mins to 1 hr 30 mins for a party of 2-4 people. C.) DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU HAVE A PARTY LARGER THAN FOUR PEOPLE. We made the mistake of coming here with 6 of us one time, and we had a 2 hour wait. They wouldn't even give us a pager until the wait time was at the 1 hour mark, but after waiting 2 hours and 40 minutes, we decided to just hit up P.F. Changs right next door.  Trust me, the quality of service that you'll get isn't typically worth the stress of the long wait times. I've been here a handfull of times, and each time I am asking myself it it really is worth it. Answer: NO. You're better off ordering the food to-go, and enjoying the meal in the comfort of your home...where there is NO WAIT TIME."
Keejoo L.,"Alexandria, VA",168,532,130,4.0,10/1/2010,"SO bad for you, yet I think almost every time that I return to towson I go here at some point.  Of coarse I think the majority of the people know about the factories food, but I have to state my opinion anyways.  The menu is quite extensive, pages and pages of food that ranges from salads, to sandwiches to full on courses.   I always seem to opt for a sandwich , buffalo chicken~ Thats the way to go  :]  I used to get cheesecake when I went .. but that has become at thing of the past.. Its just eye candy for me now."
Karen M.,"Nottingham, MD",2,17,9,5.0,9/22/2013,This is awesome food and great service.  Go.  Plain and simple
Jackie H.,"Parkville, MD",64,56,5,4.0,6/4/2013,Ok so chain restaurants kind of give me a bad feeling. So many are poorly executed that I tend to streer clear of them. That being said I am almost always pleased with the cheesecake factory in Towson. I get the healthier side of the menu mostly Asian or Thai type dishes but I am always happy at the end of my meal. I got the pear martini which was both refreshing and just slightly sweet. I had a wonderful birthday dinner and our serve was spot on. So thank you cheesecake factory for finally being a chain that I will continue to go back too. The only bad thing I can think of is the menu is so large it takes me about 20 minutes to decide what I want. But since my family is almost always tardy for the party no biggie. My cocktail and some light browsing of the menu was nice this past Friday night.
Mimi W.,"Brecksville, OH",1,12,1,4.0,9/13/2013,"Great service tonight!  In town for business and wasn't really big on the Cheesecake Factory bc the menu is so large but - I was a team with the colleagues and actually- tonight's visit was quite pleasant! For a friday night- the wait was reasonable. The waiter was FAB! His name was Mike and he was stellar. Very accommodating and prompt. I got the Boston House Salad and added cranberry, avocado and grilled shrimp. Excellent. I must say. Everyone at the table had desert. The mango key lime cheese cake was great. I'd go back definitely!"
Taylor L.,"Columbia, MD",1,22,4,4.0,11/30/2013,"I think Cheesecake is a little overrated. The food is good, depending on what you get. But I've never had anything that completely blew me out of the water. It's good, a little pricey but big portions. But they just need a few new menu items that really blow other restaurants out of the water.  But the Oreo cheesecake is a gift from heaven."
Kenneth L.,"Manhattan, NY",18,86,,3.0,4/30/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to dine at. There Miso Salmon is almost next to none. But this location is previously said in other reviews is extremely crowded. Service lacks because of it, and last week when I came here they did not give us any bread. We had to wait a while to receive our check. A recommendation would be to have the waiters/waitresses take on fewer tables. Our waitress had over 6 tables on her own!"
Chelsea H.,"Baltimore, MD",2,32,6,4.0,11/18/2011,"I have been to every cheesecake factory location in Virginia, DC and Maryland. Like many others have said its very nice in there. I have been there for dates, family and girls night out trips. This place is pretty amazing. My favorites are the Buffalo Blasts, Fried Mac n Cheese, Chicken Bellagio, and the flatbreads.  I personally don't care for the avocado rolls and the samosas are okay. Beware of the nachos, very greasy and it gets very repetitive eating it. The biggest problem with this restaurant is if you got past 9pm on a weekend.Service is very rushed and the managers have little patience with complaining customers.  Since its connected to the mall, it gets really crowded. And the cheesecake is obviously amazing. My personal favorite is the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. Its a good place to go and the prices seem high but the portion are so big you'll probably have leftovers."
Eric C.,"Baltimore, MD",220,248,197,4.0,5/8/2010,"Damn right, I'm a fan of the Cheesecake Factory and the oversized portions.  I'm a fan of the amazing layout and dimly-lit atmosphere.  I'm a fan of the customer service provided by the hostess and the waiters/waitresses.  Finally, I'm a fan of those irresistible cheesecakes that I can't seem to eat at the restaurant once I eat my large dinner. What I am not a fan of is the long wait times.  Unfortunately, Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations, so it's a first come first serve type of deal.  You know what that means: you got to bum rush a couple of people to get in front of the line.  Oops...I meant to say get there early.  The wait is definitely worth it. I have gotten the Steak Diane, which is pretty good.  I have also gotten the Shrimp Scampi and Chicken Madeira combination.  It was my first time getting Chicken Madeira, and I'll say it was OK.  The Shrimp Scampi definitely hit the spot though. Note:  There is valet parking offered by the Cheesecake Factory for only $5.  However, it tends to fill up pretty quickly.  There is also Curbside dining, something similar to Applebee's and other restaurants that offer this service. I haven't been at the bar yet, but I will surely be making my way here very soon.  My optimal equation:   Bud Light (or any alcoholic beverage) + cheesecake = match made in heaven."
Craig L.,"Towson, MD",106,147,5,2.0,7/4/2012,"We dined here on Tuesday evening. We were greeted by the hostess and seated immediately. Our waitress acknowledged us immediately as well and took and delivered our drink order promptly. We started with the popcorn shrimp, which arrived piping hot. A rather thick battered shrimp, which hid the taste of the shrimp. Next we ordered the Ahi Tuna and a Cobb Salad. The cobb salad was their modern interpretation. Everything was chopped finely and mixed with their salad dressing and mounded on a large serving dish, all surrounded by a circle of cheese. If you like traditional cobb salads, order something different. The Tuna lacked any taste and perhaps could have been spiced up with a side of Wasabi. The most impressive part of the evening was the waitresses quick response to notice that we didn't care for the meals and the lightening speed that a manager was a the table to inquire how they could improve the dishes going forward. Other chains could take note of this practice."
Giovanno B.,"Baltimore, MD",2,35,,4.0,11/11/2013,"I'm less a fan of chain restaurants, but my times at this Cheesecake Factory location have been good and everyone's friendly, and not long a wait compared to hours at other locations. The restaurant's in a hidden place of the shopping center; park across the street."
