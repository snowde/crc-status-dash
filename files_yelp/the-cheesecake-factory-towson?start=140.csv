J H.,"Troy, MI",23,3,,1.0,11/8/2014,Worst service ever both inside and with curbside service. Staff has terrible attitude and hung up on me when calling to inform them that I'd arrived for curbside service and the food never came. Called to speak to a manager and the staff member hung up on me. Worst. Restaurant. Ever. And I'll make sure everyone I talk to knows not to go to this location.
Miriam B.,"Chicago, IL",152,507,605,5.0,1/30/2012,"What a great cheesecake factory!. It was my 1st time at this location so I wasn't sure what to expect but wow!. Great food, beautiful place and terrific service. It earns  5 stars with me. We came in for brunch on Sunday. I had the lunch portion of the Chinese chicken salad. That was so large!. Crispy lettuce, almonds, grilled chicken, rice noodles and mandarine oranges in a ginger dressing. Tasty. My husband had the bang bang chicken and shrimp( a yummy Thai pasta dish ). For dessert I chose to skip the cheesecake( not an easy thing to to). Instead I opted for a bowl of perfectly ripe strawberries. My husband had the Godiva cheesecake. I took one bite and it tasted like a dark chocolate bar. I will be back here next month :-)."
Ed B.,"Baltimore, MD",60,53,1,2.0,8/4/2012,Service was terrible. Apparently you are only permitted 1 glass of water during your meal. The waitress brought her kids with her and they were serving us bread. This has to be illegal some how. Food was so-so and the portions were large. Management needs to hire higher quality people!
Monique G.,"Parkville, MD",84,55,10,3.0,11/17/2012,"So this place has been labeled the most unhealthy of all the chain restaurants. So much so they refuse to post calorie count.. Yes I am a healthy eater. One can assume if you are coming here you know what you are getting.. HOWEVER they now have a great healthy options menu. Turkey burgers, proteins without all the sauces. If you are going here for your typical birthday celebrations. Don't be scared. You now have options. Or otherwise enjoy the great food they have work it off the next and don't forget a slice of cake... Because everyone MUST EAT CAKE! Especially cheesecake. Sssh don't tell my trainer. Lol"
Gwen M.,"Pikesville, MD",36,98,3,4.0,1/28/2013,"Went on a week night with friends. No wait! We asked about the soup of the day and our waitress even brought a sample that was a very generous portion. Soup was tasty. Asked for a cup of it. I ordered the chicken enchiladas which came with black beans and cilantro rice. The enchiladas and rice were fabulous and the beans I would rate good. My friends ordered a burger with fries and chicken tostadas. Both were satisfied with their meals.  We split the featured cheesecake of the month which had Oreos in it....very tasty and plenty for us all to have a portion.   Server was very nice and she gave recommendations and was attentive. The only thing she messed up was that after the sample of soup (Mexican Chicken) I said I would try a cup, but she never put in the order for it. I was so full anyway, I never mentioned it to her."
Jim H.,"Baltimore, MD",9,144,1,4.0,12/7/2010,"I went to this restaurant the other day with a group of co-workers for our holiday luncheon.  I have to say that it was a pretty positive experience, despite my general loathing of chain megaplex restaurants.  Three people in our party ordered appetizers to share with the rest of the table. One person ordered the BLT salad which to her shock and awe was a halved head of iceberg lettuce with mayonnaise, egg, bacon and tomato chunks spilling all over it like a volcano science fair project gone wrong.  We all sampled it and were unimpressed.  I thought it was a bad concept all around-messy and hard to eat.  The other appetizer was crab wontons.  Most people liked this, and while I thought it had a good initial ""crabby"" flavor, but didn't like the overly greasy after taste.  Another appetizer was the fried/stuffed artichoke hearts.  These were cheesy and delicious enough alone without the dipping sauce it came with.  For my lunch, I ordered the Cajun pasta which had shrimp, chicken and vegetables in a spicy sauce over tri-colored linguini. It was very delicious, assertively spicey, and of course an insane amount of food!   Many of the others in our party had the grilled salmon and found it very favorable.  Everyone brought home leftovers and desert.  I enjoyed the key-lime cheese cake, which was suitably tart but assuaged by the additional whipped cream.   Our waitress was pleasant, attentive and quick with our many requests for additional napkins, straws, boxes, etc.  She definitely deserved more than the 15% automatic gratuity for large parties.  All staff there at lunch were pleasant and polite.  I will happily revisit in the future."
Katie D.,"Baltimore, MD",3,17,,3.0,1/5/2013,"Located in the Towson Towne Center, this Cheesecake Factory does a very brisk business. I have been there twice in the last few months and had great service each time. They now have a healthier options menu and the dishes were better than I expected.  While the food is standard casual fare, the cheesecake is very good! The Cheesecake Factory is a good option for good food in a fun environment after a day of shopping!"
Janet E.,"Chicago, IL",1121,2033,899,4.0,9/19/2009,"We walked in around 8pm on a Thursday night and we immediately seated.  Our waiter attended to us quickly and was very helpful and friendly.  We ordered the shrimp bistro pasta and the double bbq bacon cheeseburger.  The food was so good we each cleared off our plate. The portions are huge! Unfortunately they dont serve smaller portions for dinner, only lunch before 5pm. One of the better experiences I've had at a cheesecake factory restaurant."
Eliot P.,"Baltimore, MD",50,33,2,3.0,7/24/2011,"The food is pretty good.  I not a big fan of having to wait to be seated 75% of the time I go there.  My family loves it so, I will definitely go again."
Devin A.,"Fontana, CA",157,24,,3.0,8/24/2013,"The food here is decent and very much expected for a typical chain. The people at this location are very customer service oriented from my experience. It's a shame they have to deal with the nut jobs and trash who tend to frequent this location. According to many, Towson used to be clean, safe and more upscale. I'd like to GPS the location of whatever Towson (mall) that was, because this one is red sticker away from being an outlet mall."
Jackie D.,"Catonsville, MD",27,42,73,2.0,9/4/2011,"Our group of 7 went here for a weekday lunch.  Despite the fact that there was plenty of seating available, we were kept waiting in the lobby until ""at least half"" of our party had arrived.  Why??  Were they afraid they weren't coming?!  We tried a variety of appetizers, potstickers (sauce was too tangy), lettuce wraps(PF Changs has them beat hands down), and calamari (fine, but nothing special).  I appreciate that you can substitute a salad for fries and they are very accomodating about putting sauces/dressings on the side.  Mostly we had sandwiches, which were, again, fine...nothing spectacular.  Their notoriously large portions left us with no room for dessert.  Service was good, seats are too close together, decor is nice.  Parking (even at lunchtime) is a nightmare."
Ryan B.,"York, PA",0,17,,2.0,5/16/2015,"We visited on a Saturday and were seated immediately because the restaurant was not busy at all - it seemed like about half the tables in the place were empty. However, it was a solid ten minutes before our waitress bothered to greet us and take our drink and appetizer orders. Our appetizers came out quickly and were delivered by a runner before our waitress even took our meal order. We also had to ask the waitress for a bread basket, which at every other visit has been placed on the table within minutes of being seated. She acted like it was a terrible bother to go get one for us, but it's one of the things we look forward to when dining here. Our meals came out quickly once we finally got to order and were again brought out by a runner. The food was average but nothing great, they have far too large a menu to do anything really well.  Our waitress never came back to see how things were or ask if we needed anything; she walked past at least half a dozen times but didn't stop to check on us at all until she wanted us to order dessert which we declined. The waitress was quick to bring the check, but then didn't come back to collect it for about ten minutes. This seems to be a general trend at all of the locations I've been to, so I shouldn't expect anything better but I always do and am usually disappointed."
Rob H.,"Baltimore, MD",93,8,6,3.0,3/6/2011,Always very busy here... Most of the time it takes a while to get a seat here but the only thing Cheesecake factory has going for it is just desert.  Most of the food is ok but they charge you a lot for quality that is lacking.
Reid C.,"Towson, MD",0,6,,2.0,4/10/2009,"It has been about ten years since I had been to the Cheesecake Factory downtown.  My recollection was that the cheesecake was superb, the portions were absurdly large and the non-dessert food was poor.  Today, my family decided to try the new Towson location for lunch. We arrived at 12:15 and were told that the wait would be about 20 minutes.  This proved to be accurate.  Once we were seated we ordered our beverages including specifying that we wanted lemon with the iced teas.  The drinks were delivered, but no lemons.  We asked for lemons two more times before they were delivered.  Among our orders, a caesar salad was requested with the dressing on the side.  It came drowned in dressing.  This was bad enough, but furthermore, the caesar dressing was terrible as these things go.  The herb-crusted salmon on another salad was cold, undercooked and smothered with wet herbs (i.e. not ""crusted"" in any way).  A Pizzete appetizer was good, the four cheese pasta was fine and some chicken tenders were OK too.  The fries had been salted so heavily that they were barely edible.    As I feared, we had more food left over than we had been able to consume.  Since the salads had been drowned in dressing, they were not salvageable.  This single location must throw out enough food in a month to feed a small country.  I am not a religious person, but I found myself thinking that the waste was positively sinful. We did order a slice of Oreo cheesecake to go.  I ate some of it tonight, and it was superb. To sum up, Cheesecake Factory has not changed at all in ten years.  My recommendation is to eat your meal next door at P.F. Chang's and then buy some Cheesecake to go and eat it when you get home for dessert."
Anthony F.,"Manchester, MD",0,2,68,5.0,4/15/2014,Incredible food selection to satisfy anyone. Their alcohol is awesome as well. Be warned: their portions are HUGE (you may wanna split an entree with someone). Their desserts are 2nd to none. The service is quick and knowledgeable. I go here maybe 2 or 3 times a year and have never had a negative experience.
Glenn S.,"Baltimore, MD",9,168,,4.0,12/27/2011,"I've been here quite a few times and I have to say I've never had a bad experience. The food is always amazing and given in big portions, too. And then there's the cheesecake....best cheesecake ever. expensive, but well worth it."
J C.,"Gladstone, NJ",0,59,2,1.0,12/17/2013,"We happened to be in the Towson area, so we cruised into the Cheesecake Factory.  We had last eaten in the King of Prussia, PA CKF, about 7 years ago.  Once every 7 years is too soon.  My poor wife ordered an Ahi Tuna roll as an appetizer.  It smelled fishy (fresh fish has no odor).  It was smothered in some kind of mayonnaise-based mystery sauce and clothed in a greasy deep fried wrap.  I too, made the mistake of trying a piece. Well, we both paid the gastrointestinal distressed price.  . . for 2 days.  When the waitress asked (in an half-hearted way) ""how was the meal"", we told her LOUSY!  Not fresh, fish stank, etc.  We got no response from the waitress or management.  We ate our piece of obligatory over-priced cheesecake (split 3 ways) and escaped.  Not good, not worth the money.  Place was packed, so I guess they think they do not have to care about the food quality or customer service. Stay away."
Amy A.,"Eaton Rapids, MI",78,53,3,4.0,8/22/2011,"I thought the food was excellent, the portions were large and the price was right. Be careful, it will be hard to save room for dessert.... which is half the reason to go! I really enjoyed their tamale corn cake appetizer, sweet, savory AND a little bit of spice! The place was a bit noisy and crowded, but that is what I expected for a Sunday, though I expect it to be busy most of the time."
Blue M.,"Hershey, PA",4,156,157,4.0,7/17/2011,Went on a Sunday around 2:30 pm and were seated right away. Of course all we had was dessert. I had the Banana Cream Cheese cake and was very surprised that it wasn't too heavy. I was able to finish it! It came with slices of fresh bananas and Bavarian cream. Wonderful! Our waiter was excellent. It took about 25 minutes from the time we sat down until we left. I can say that was the fastest service I have ever had at any CF. I guess that it's all about timing at this CF.
Yishin S.,"Baltimore, MD",6,44,10,5.0,6/24/2013,"One thing you can trust with Cheesecake Factory - the food is consistently good.  I have never had a bad meal there.  This is my weekend go-to place.  I love their skinnylicious menu, especially the asian style taco.  You can almost order any food on the menu and guarantee that it is going to be above expectation.  They are usually packed during the lunch hour at weekended.  We usually wait 10 minutes to be seated.   The food portion is huge, regardless whether you order the lunch portion or not, I always have the rest take home with me for another meal.  Their waiters and waitresses are all young people, with good and friendly attitude.  The service is relatively fast even when they have a full house.  You can see into the kitchen when they work on the food.  So you know it is clean.  However, most foods here are high in calories (and that is why I am so happy about their skinnylicious manu).  Their cheesecake is also creamy and the best I've ever had, but very fattening."
