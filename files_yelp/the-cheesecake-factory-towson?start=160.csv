Nettie W.,"Rosedale, MD",2,13,,4.0,10/1/2013,"Nachos were burnt and they were a bit stingy with the chicken and sour cream...My waitress was sweet, polite, and prompt. Their lunch chicken alfredo was very peppery!!! But it was still bearable and quite good. Soda was super delicious but water tasted a bit tapped. Best time to eat here is in the evening and on the weekend!"
Abbey M.,"Waxhaw, NC",16,59,6,4.0,10/24/2010,"Their menu has so much variety, if you aren't sure what you are hungry for, don't worry they have everything from Chinese to pasta on the menu. There is usually a wait here so I would definitely put in your name and then go shop at the mall while you wait."
c m.,"Baltimore, MD",0,2,,3.0,7/3/2011,"Good food, okay service. Weve been to this location twice, and the first time was a five star experience. The waiter was amazing and the food was excellent.  The second time we waited a long while for the server to even recognize us. ( and mind you it was slow).  BUT the food was still good (which to me is important)."
Allison L.,"Baltimore, MD",223,483,42,3.0,9/13/2009,"I'd have to echo the suggestion of eating dinner somewhere else and getting a slice of cheesecake to go.  I mean, you're just coming here for the cheesecake right?  The food is fine, and the portions are large, but it's really not GOOD food.  While the cheesecake is incredibly good, I'd have to recommend staying away from the cookie dough cheesecake unless you really like cookie dough and are ok eating half a pound of it with a few morsels of cheesecake thrown on."
Jason R.,"Dover, PA",0,20,,2.0,5/30/2013,food excelent but staff was clueless and ignorent....think twice before stopping here....manager is just as clueless!!!
Alan D.,"Parkton, MD",3,34,,4.0,1/18/2009,"Their newest location, opened a few months ago and its fairly typical of most of the other ones.  Had a birthday dinner here, on a Monday, they were fairly busy.  I loved the fact they had 1+1 booths, gives a private cozy feel to the place.  The food is average American fair, I ordered a pasta bolognese, it was ok, large portion.  I had to box mine up, do not order shelf liquor drinks, they are weak.  Stick to the drinks on the menu.  Wait time was reasonable for the food, I think they were understaffed for a Monday.  Otherwise a pleasant experience."
Junnell S.,"Towson, MD",3,30,,4.0,8/29/2010,"I came here with a date because I was craving the Dulce De Leche cheesecake. Yum! Yum! Yum!  I had great service, great food and a pleasant time. I love the cheesecake and it doesn't bother me that there are large portions of food. Whatever you don't eat, take it home."
miss b.,"Baltimore, MD",2,47,,4.0,5/11/2010,"I went to Cheesecake Factory on Monday night and was a fan of it. I had only been once and it was to the location downtown. I parked in the garage between Fridays and The Cheesecake Factory without a problem and was able to walk down the steps right to the Cheesecake Factory. My friends were already there and seated and said they only had to wait 5 minutes. Awesome...considering I thought it'd be atleast an hour wait because it was 6 o'clock and they take you on a first come, first serve basis.  When I walked in the place was already pretty hopping. For appetizers we ordered crab dip and calamari which was yummy. They also gave us lots of bread which we also used to dip into the crab dip since it had only tiny slivers of bread that came with it. There was a ton of calamari that came with garlic dip and cocktail sauce which was very yummy even though I'm not too fond of knowing that it was squid. For dinner I ordered a special that was breaded chicken in a light wine butter sauce with broccoli and mashed potatoes. I think that there could have been more sauce, but it did come with two huge chicken breasts. I did enjoy it and thought it was different even though it didn't knock my socks off. My other friend ordered the same thing as me, and my two other friends ordered the Shrimp Scampi and Cajun Jambalaya Pasta that had shrimp, chicken sauteed with onions, tomato, and peppers in a spicy cajun sauce on top of linguini.  Portions seemed huge and while some things on the menu can definitely be pricey, but there are also some pretty reasonable choices as well depending on what you get. For dessert my friend ordered a Banana Cream Cheesecake which I had a few bites of which was of course delicious, and my other friends ordered and shared a Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough cheesecake. I mean, you can't really go wrong with a huge slice of cheesecake. Our waitress was really sweet and really on the ball with refilling drinks (and bringing a bowl of lemons for the water!) which I liked and our appetizers came out pretty much right away. I really liked the decorations and the design of the place. It was huge inside. I was also in a good mood that there was no line, although I'm aware that sometimes this place can get pretty packed and waits can be aware from an hour to two hours and even longer. Also heard that valet parking is $5 bucks which could be worth it if parking is a bummer, which I know it can be. Sometimes the parking garages can fill up fast.  However, if you want to go here, I'd suggest NOT looking at the calorie content of your meal online OR of that cheesecake that you think you want to delight yourself with at the end..."
Mike b.,"New York, NY",0,29,,2.0,9/12/2010,"Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of the fact that the Cheesecake Factory has a huge menu so there is something for everyone. The food is always consistent across locations too, so that wasn't my problem. My problem was the 3 hour dining time. After a half hour wait I had what might be the worst waiter I've ever had at any restaurant in my life. This guy, Thomas I think his name was (looks like a combination of Jack Sparrow / Spencer from Criminal minds) was horrible. I could've lived with the fact that he was socially retarded, but the the fact that I couldn't live with is how shitty the service was. Not only did our glasses spend most of the time empty, but it seemed like he was trying to avoid coming to anybody's table and whenever he did it was to remind us that he forgot to do whatever he said he was going to do. It seemed like it took a half hour for everything, half hour to bring us drinks, half hour to take our orders, half hour to bring us refills, check, dessert menu, etc. It was just frustrating because I didn't intend to spend my whole night at a Cheesecake factory, dinner shouldn't exceed an hour. I thought maybe we were being impatient but I heard the table across from us asking another waiter about him too because they didn't seem to be a fan either. I've never really felt the need to Yelp a chain restaurant before but I'd love to hear if other Yelpers have had this guy too and I hope maybe they can move him off of tables so people don't go through what we did."
Paul S.,"Towson, MD",84,158,69,4.0,10/4/2010,"As much as I love Cheesecake Factory, it's actually not perfect. It has some major flaws. As great as the food is it's been less and less about customer service. Lines are out the door, you are lucky enough to get a table on an off night or before the dinner rush. Forget any other time. If you get a table you are waiting a very long time for food. The food portions are very large but so are the prices. An appetizer could feed a family so if you wanna go cheap order an app. Though at this place cheap is unheard of. The ambiance is nice, great for a date type setting. 99 percent of the time food comes out great though once I went here and a bone wasn't removed from the pulled pork and I hit my tooth on it and my friend's burger was way undercooked. That's what happens when they don't quality check the food. We did get our meals comped on the same night and I got a replacement meal so they do try to make up for short comings. The menu is vast for apps meals and cheesecake varieties. Everyone can find something. So if you are willing to overlook flaws and wait...and wait for what you love then you will enjoy it here."
Michael A.,"Washington, DC",0,77,,1.0,2/27/2010,"The food is insanely fatty.  Pizzas are loaded up with cheese.  I felt horrible the next day.  I think this place might kill you if you eat there too often ( ).  Other than that, it seems like a nice, family-oriented place."
