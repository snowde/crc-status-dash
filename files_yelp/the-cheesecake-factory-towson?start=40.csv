Stephanie B.,"Towson, MD",124,74,35,4.0,3/6/2016,"I was one of the first bartenders at this location. During the training program, I was able to taste everything on the menu (which has changed since then, but many items remain). Some of my favorites include the crispy chicken costalettas, the chicken bellagio, and the shrimp and bacon club. This location is within Towson Town Center mall. Parking can be a bit challenging, but they offer valet.  On Sundays, they offer brunch until 2pm.  Otherwise, the menu is the same as anywhere else. Consistently good food and creative drinks. The cheesecake is pricey but outstanding. I am particularly fond of the pumpkin cheesecake offered around the holidays."
Camille A.,"Baltimore, MD",66,250,14,2.0,1/29/2016,I have been to this Cheesecake Factory numerous of times but this last time was bad. The young lady named Amanda who helped me with my togo order was perfect. She was very nice and had a smile on her face. I ordered chicken scampi. That pasta was drowning in oil. Heart attack waiting to happen. I ordered tiramisus but instead another young lady gave me tiramisu cheesecake. Crazy but I am not a big fan of cheesecake.I called and told the manger how they gave me the wrong dessert. He asked if I had my receipt and I said no. I had made two separate orders and lost the receipt with the dessert. His response was to come in and get a new slice but I told him I could not leave work. I asked if I can come in tomorrow he told me no. To make a long story short he one did not even try and solve the issue and two he low key thought I was lying about being there in the first place.
Anna A.,"Windsor Mill, MD",0,3,,1.0,10/15/2016,"If there's a quarter star, I'll give it to them!! I was third to the last on queue standing for a good 20 mins total and all the orders and the people behind me who ordered were gone, the guy in the register (Alec B--on the receipt) noticed me and asked ""What fudge cake are you getting?? What cheesecake??""...what the hell?!? He needs to get customer service classes because he didnt even apologize!!"
Michele P.,"Manchester, MD",19,14,,1.0,7/2/2016,"Lunch started out great and we had a nice waitress. My Thai lettuce wraps looked great when it arrived at our table. All was well until I noticed a dead fly in my toppings. I put it aside on my plate and was completely grossed out and wondering if I had eaten any other insects that I could not see. The waitress did get a manager immediately, but he didn't seem surprised and offered to take the meal off the bill. That would have been expected at the minimum; however, no one else at the table would eat the food out of the kitchen. The manager told us that people were going in and out for the patio seating and ""it happens"". We were very disappointed by the response. I won't be back."
Karen F.,"Fort Dix, NJ",28,4,2,5.0,3/12/2016,Highly recommend. Came here 2x while staying for a soccer tournament. Food is yummy: fried catfish; mash potato; free beans and onions; also had the gumbo.. Oh and the Lemondrop Martini's to die for.... Tasty. Wait was long but it was the week end but service was ok
Megan C.,"Baltimore, MD",115,61,23,4.0,1/30/2015,"This place is always busy, but it is so worth the wait. You will find a ton of options on the menu here. I have never ordered the same entree twice and everything has always been delicious. On my last visit I ordered a chopped salad from the Skinnylicious menu which was excellent. It had a delicious dressing, grilled chicken, bacon, avocado, corn, tomatoes, etc. The portion size was perfect; about half the size of one ordered from the standard menu. Those salads are huge. I can never finish them and I think leftover salads are just gross, so i liked this better. If you order any entrees from the standard menu prepare to have leftovers. Of course the cheesecakes here are fantastic, too. My favorite is the Pineapple Upside Down cake. I have also had the Hershey's chocolate cheesecake and the Red Velvet.  The Cheesecake Factory is, in my opinion, the best option for eating at the Towson Town Center."
Jen W.,"Hanover, PA",113,85,92,3.0,1/30/2015,"I've been to the Cheesecake factory 3 times now. Once was with a friend at the Inner harbor and the other two times were with friends at the Towson location. The menu is very large and usually takes us a bit to decide on what to get. My favorite item is the Cobb salad. Its enough for two meals. Fresh crisp lettuce with chicken, avocado, egg, cheese and plenty more toppings. I have them toss it with blue cheese dressing since I'm not a fan of other dressings. I also enjoy the mojitos. They have the traditional flavor or you can mix it up with some fruit. I recommend the passion fruit. I'm not very adventurous when it comes to cheesecake flavors so the two slices I've had were good but nothing to brag about.  This place is always packed. So be prepared to wait. To kill time while waiting we decided to walk around the mall and see all the stores Towson town center had to offer. The prices of most things are average."
Cornell K.,"New York, NY",56,28,7,5.0,6/15/2016,"I always enjoy a dinner or brunch at Cheesecake! This location is conveniently connected to the Towson mall. So if you become hungry from shopping and want to have a nice sit-in dinner, this is the place to go. The time to be seated takes a little while but its worth it. The outdoor seating is also very nice. I would highly recommend having a dinner here!"
Nicki M.,"Baltimore, MD",787,81,269,2.0,9/7/2015,"I'm not really a fan of these chain restaurants, but this one is ok. No frills, just consistent Cheesecake Factory dishes. I will say the Mushroom Swiss burger I had was perfect!  They really should promote their burgers more. IJS that menu is so huge it's hard to pinpoint what else is on the menu outside of cheesecake."
Manda G.,"Baltimore, MD",101,37,1,2.0,1/29/2017,"Very disappointed. Came with a group and the food was bad all around. Cold, tasteless, not as described. Our waitress was great and the cheesecake was great so those are my 2 stars, otherwise I was extremely unhappy with this location. This was my first time at the Towson location but I've been to other locations many many times over the past 20 years."
Matthew T.,"Owings Mills, MD",0,6,,4.0,8/29/2016,"My wife and I went here with a gift card. We had eaten the cheesecake before but never ate dinner here. We were pleasantly surprised! Although most options are on the expensive side, it was hard for me to pick between all of the great offerings. I settled on the bang bang (thai style) chicken and shrimp. Very delicious... I saved room for a Kahlua cheesecake slice which was scrumptious. My wife had a very good French onion soup and Nutella cheesecake slice. I'd say we waited a bit long between waitress visits, and were seated a bit too close to other customers (there was a couple right next to us, cafeteria style)!. The free bread should just be eliminated as it was not wanted (we were destined to overeat either way) and frankly not too great. Regardless, I would highly recommend the restaurant for its great menu and classy (but not unwelcoming) atmosphere."
Mel L.,"Pikesville, MD",168,43,190,4.0,11/29/2015,"I have had a large variety from the Cheesecake Factory in Towson. Sliders, pasta carbonara, loaded potatoes, mac and cheese balls, edamame, etc, as well as dabbling in my fair share of cheesecakes. I love Cheesecake Factory and I talk about coming here whenever the opportunity presents itself. The food is rich and the portions are huge and worth the expense. You will go home not only satisfied once but satisfied twice as you will most likely have leftovers.  This is a nice location although if it's possible to go to the one at the inner harbor, it is worth going as it is beautiful, spacious, and has great service! The outdoor seating in Towson is noisy but still pretty. Both locations are great for dates, parties/gatherings, or just hanging out.  I will say that they definitely skimp out on cheesecake when it is for take out. I was given a sliver from Towson for the same price as dining in. Not cool. Would rather dine in, just order cheesecake, and take it home."
Peter M.,"Towson, MD",770,122,187,5.0,10/22/2015,What a great place.  Took Ms Angie out to celebrate her 28 birthday.   Love the food
Michael G.,"Baltimore, MD",79,107,88,4.0,4/18/2014,"At this point, if you haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory, you need to boost your social life! I've been to this location many times, so here is my all inclusive review: Things I Like: - Without question, the most robust menu in all of restaurantland. They have EVERYTHING, aaaaand they launched a ""skinny"" menu.  - Full bar with creative specialty drinks. - Ridiculous amount of fun choices for cheesecake/dessert. Can't go wrong with any of it. - Most importantly, they might have THE BEST WAITSTAFF SERVICE in the county. Management there has done a great job creating a culture that spoils it's guests. Things I Don't Like:  - Prices are taller than usual chain restaurant, and quantities match. While paying a little extra is sometimes necessary to have better food, I feel the overbearing quantities that go to waste are what I am actually paying for. But some fans of Cheesecake Factory really value this aspect. - MAKING YOUR CUSTOMERS WAIT. On a Friday or Saturday night you will arrive and wait for a table between 45 minutes to an hour. A whole blob of impatient and hungry people get blinking vibrators to taunt them as they wait I a ""holding pen"" type if area. This is awful. CF doesn't take reservations. This is kind of lame. I no longer go to this restaurant on hose nights, and I go less often overall. In conclusion, any other day of the week besides Friday/Saturday, this place is great. I have them 4 stars. To earn 5, they need to take better care of their guests and establish a reservation system that eliminates abusive waiting experiences."
Bree P.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",0,1,,2.0,1/23/2017,"The bread that they gave me before my meal was very hard, I couldn't even bite it. Then when my meal came my chicken was burnt. I will not be coming back to this location."
Jessica D.,"Atlanta, GA",270,215,187,3.0,5/15/2014,"I usually come for happy hour. The food and drinks are always up to standard. However the service tends to lack. Whether it be long greet time, not knowing about the menu, or not being attentive. Besides that everything else is pretty good and I can't complain. I would like to give 3.5 stars but since that's not an option 3 it is!"
ShaUn H.,"Sterling Heights, MI",1,11,,1.0,2/9/2015,"We ordered the curbside to go and it was a disaster. We figured that we'd call and place our order before the dinner rush. While the on the phone they told us that it would be 30 minutes. I arrived at the curb and in front of their white backdoor about 25 minutes after we placed our order. I called to let them know that I had arrived for our order that we called in. I watched as they walked out of the door and delivered to other drivers in their car. Each time another employee walked out, they walked right past my car. After sitting there for 30 minutes, I called again to let them know I was still there and again provided them with the color and make of my car and even told them that I was parked right in front of the door, where they were walking out. The girl said, ""Ok"". Another 20 minutes passed and I again called to tell them I was there to pick up an order and gave them the name of the order and again, the make and color of my car and my location. The guy on the phone didn't seem to care and had a slight arrogance to his voice, almost annoyed that I was calling. During the entire fiasco, there wasn't any employee who walked out with food and took it back. My wife called to find out what was going on and I told her. She too, called the restaurant where they proceeded to tell her that they'd look into. After sitting next to the curb, in front of the door that they walked out of, for an hour I finally left, angry. As a customer, we did everything that we were supposed to. Cheesecake Factory, as a provider of goods and services, failed miserably in their responsibilities. After I arrived home, my wife called to speak to the manager. To our surprise, he lied right to her, telling her that on three different occasions, they walked out and couldn't locate me. I can't believe a manager would do something like that. This particular location needs to start over with their staff, from the hostess all the way up to the manager. Every visit we have had horrible customer service and when we bring it up, no one seems to care."
Michael B.,"Owings Mills, MD",4,16,,3.0,5/15/2015,"Great Cheesecake! Smooth, plenty of toppings, and even a little extra side of cool whip Mmmmm Food isn't bad either. Salads are crazy BIG! Some of there sandwiches could use better fitting names though. The ""Pit Dip"" is far from pit beef. The ""Pulled Pork"" is now a Carolina style Pork Sandwich? That was what I mistakenly ordered. I sent it back too! There pulled pork sandwich used to be phenomenal! Had it many times over the years. Now it's a sloppy mess with an overload of unneeded fixings. What a shame!  Only thing I really don't like is the wait time. Friday-Sunday is so busy! Good luck getting a table in under an hour. Shame they don't offer call ahead seating or reservations. I'd go there more if they did.  I recommend this place for weekday/weeknights and early bird meals. If you go during the weekend, go shopping instead of standing in there for an hour."
Jude T.,"Parkville, MD",78,387,372,2.0,6/27/2014,"It is what it is. It's an expensive chain with slightly fancier food than others, and a price to make sure you know it. I wouldn't go here normally - just too much money for what it is, and it's always super crowded with obnoxious people. However, I won a gift card while playing BINGO at my daughter's school, so why not? The chicken sandwich was pretty nice, and the fries it came with were decent. My girlfriend got a pasta dish of some sort and that was also good. The cheesecake is really where the magic happens... It's a lot of money, though. And when you're done, you don't need to eat any more calories for the next three days! Service was just average."
Brian L.,"Rosebank, Baltimore, MD",0,1,,3.0,6/26/2016,"Great food. Good Gluten free menu. Management and wait staff should be retrained. Food took too long to get out. Messed up my daughters GF meal. The bread we were supposed to get at beginning came towards the end of our meal. The side dish of broccoli (very tasty) came soon after. Then it took 15 minutes for slice of cheesecake, which had some paper in it. We got it comped but still.  I watched the manager talk to bar staff rather than walk around and see if people needed anything or were ok. He sets the tone for the poor service."
