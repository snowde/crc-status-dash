Rachel S.,"Westminster, MD",0,5,1,2.0,12/17/2016,Food pretty good. Service at the bar is usually not good. Three bartenders and not one showed a bit of personality and cared that we were dining with them. They did not give or offer us bread but they offered the people around us. My wine glass was filthy and sticky. Servers and bartenders work for their tips and these bartenders clearly didn't care.
Surbhi S.,"Baltimore, MD",162,20,5,3.0,5/15/2016,"Food took hours to come and my pot stickers were disappointing at best. Had to live off the bread. The cheesecake tasted good tho (banana). I hated the decor because the booths made a me 4'8"" feel very claustrophobic and the small size of the seats meant my butt was halfway parked on the person I was sitting next to, who is a petite little self like me."
Pamela L.,"Towson, MD",1,1,1,4.0,5/22/2016,Love the Thai Lettuce Wraps!  Cheesecake a bit pricey but delicious. Great service. Will definitely come back. Disappointed the appetizer pretzel crusted chicken skewers have been discontinued.
Quin A.,"Silver Spring, MD",15,185,377,4.0,4/26/2015,"I had great lunch and great dinner here. Food was well made, the right amount of crunch, and the right amount of flavor. Portions were generous and I had lots of leftovers. Their sliders were amazing, in fact, I am craving them now. Service was friendly and efficient every time, though there was a long wait to be seated since they were so busy. Good place!"
Charlie M.,"Reisterstown, MD",28,34,,5.0,11/7/2016,"Best Cheesecake Factory in town. Clean, good service, and the food is prepared the way it is supposed to be."
Victoria D.,"Annapolis, MD",299,260,6,2.0,9/15/2014,"After walking the huge mall we decided to take a load off and eat here. It was an early time and although a Saturday I didn't think it would be too hard. The wait was about 5 minutes.  I asked for a GF menu, the hostess said that it is now a part of the regular menu - which is nice! I know how large their menu is but it's nice to see that some can be modified for my GF diet. We were placed in a 2-top near the bar.  When we sat down, I got up to use the restroom. Told my girlfriend to order me a water. Came out of the restroom, she hadn't arrived yet. 15 minutes later, still nothing. I told her I'd say something in 2 minutes but by then someone had popped over. We had picked what we wanted to order, so when she said ""let me get you rdrinks"" I said ""no, we can order."" I didn't want to lose her again! I ordered the chopped salad - gluten free. Dressing on the side.  We waited 35 minutes for our salads. I never saw the waitress again. When someone else brought me my salad, it looked great and I said... ""Actually I got dressing on the side, is there already dressing on it?"" She said ""No. But you got gluten free... and the only GF dressing we have is oil and vinegar.""  ...to which I replied... ""Then...can I have that?""  Ugh it was just a frustrating experience. There was a huge wait when we left. I'm a former server so I feel the pain of a busy Saturday lunch crowd but come on. It's Cheesecake Factory, you're always busy. Our waitress was nice, but neglectful. It wasn't a nice experience. The food was good, but that's all."
Arno S.,"Towson, MD",0,4,,1.0,9/25/2016,"Ate many Cheesecake Factory across the country and one in Towson Town Center is the first cheesecake that was an epic fail. From the moment waking in the hostess doesn't greet with a smile, but with the snootiest attitude! You come out to eat expecting a great experience but with this older lady in the front, don't expect it! Food was salty and bland the pasta was over cooked. Don't think I'll ever come back!"
Emily L.,"Washington, DC",78,36,23,2.0,11/13/2014,"More or less, the Cheesecake Factory gives you a ton of options so everyone is satisfied if they have a particular craving. On top of that, the cheesecake menu is enormous and the portions are huge (as are the portions of most meals here). However, don't expect anything special from the Cheesecake Factory. The basics are all good and what you would expect - pretty much anything that's not too crazy is good. However, orders that aren't so simple will be just ""okay."" I ordered the enchiladas and my friend got a chicken sandwich, both of which were very mediocre. Another huge downside is that seats are right on top of one another, so you're esentially in conversation with the people sitting next to you. Good spot for the family and to keep everyone happy. Not so much for 2 people looking for conversation and a good meal."
Abbas B.,"Rockville, MD",55,242,66,3.0,11/19/2014,Typical cheesecake factory restaurant.  It is in the Towson mall and it is usually pretty crowded in here.  I usually really like Cheesecake factory but the service over at this one is just ok.  The servers are not mean or rude but not overly helpful either.  For the most part you will get what you expect from this cheesecake factory.
Ton T.,"Norfolk, VA",13,12,26,4.0,2/7/2015,"On your next visit, make sure you give the Imperial Chicken and Shrimp some attention. In just a few words... Yum!"
Natia J.,"Timonium, MD",5,114,69,5.0,11/10/2014,"This place is always busy, but the food is delicious... so it's worth the wait. I always get the firecracker salmon rolls. They are sooo delicious. I can never visit  without getting a slice of cheesecake. The cheesecake slices are far from small   I love the following cheesecakes: Banana Cream w/ banana sliced Red Velvet  Caramel (there are two kinds and they are both good) Original Pineapple"
Qionah B.,"Owings Mills, MD",30,44,67,5.0,11/8/2014,"I never ever had a bad experience at any location. The food is always good, hot, and the service is fast and friendly. The menu is a bit overwhelming because there are so many delectable choices to choose from. I've been dining at with this restaurant for over 12 years. It's good for celebration, groups, family, and date night. The desserts are always fresh and memorable!!!"
Joannie B.,"Towson, MD",0,18,3,4.0,8/4/2014,"At a chain restaurant like this, for me, service and quality of food are the most important especially since I have had some bad experiences at a few chains, the cheesecake being one of them. At this location food and drinks are consistently good and I have been here more times than I can remember. The service is nice, friendly and attentive."
Justin I.,"Baltimore, MD",43,5,3,1.0,1/9/2016,Brought out my Burger and said fries will be right out 15mn later my burgers gone and they bring out my fries I told them to just keep them . Still got charged full price had 3 people with me 100 tab and no type of sorry or anything. I will never eat at this location again .
Peter C.,"Salisbury, MD",59,137,65,3.0,10/18/2014,"I know, I know people love this place. Frankly, I feel that it is very over done. Way too much food and not like it is a bargain, they sure charge you for it. Maybe this is a great business model, and it sure seems to be but I think this is the Golden Corral for the upper middles. They food was good, not great. The wine selection was a quaffer's delight (nothing noteworthy), service was adequate and the atmosphere could only be described as cacophonous. I could not hear myself think. I'll only go here if everyone else wants."
Robin G.,"Bethesda, MD",88,434,218,5.0,10/4/2014,"I don't usually have anything but good experiences here and I have been eating at Cheesecake Factory restaurants since 1986 when I lived in Los Angeles. For one thing, they give you LOADS of food! A total and complete contribution to the country's obesity problem. Lots of yummy food for the price and a gazillion calories!! The cheesecake and desserts are so good, I feel like I gain weight just looking at it. Save this place for special occasions or just go once every 2 months!"
Katy Q.,"Parkville, MD",41,16,1,2.0,11/3/2015,"The food here is very good.  That being said, it is overpriced, very dimly lit (felt like I was eating in a cave) and overcrowded.  The seating is horrible, you're basically touching elbows with whoever is seated at the table next to you.  In my opinion you'd have a much better time calling in your order and eating this good food at home."
Santana Ross W.,"Owings Mills, MD",122,136,50,3.0,4/1/2015,"I am dropping a star as the food and service just isn't impressive. Albeit, I still love the red velvet cheesecake."
Edward S.,"Parkville, MD",0,67,1,4.0,4/3/2014,"So.., my wife and I were watching an episode of The Big Bang Theory and I suddenly had a hankering for dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. I'm not sure I can add any new insights for a chain that's been around so long. Colleen and I stop in to eat there about once a year. The food is always good but they tend to pile it on. (My personal belief is that a restaurant's portions should not be any more that a normal human can eat). Every thing (including my martini) was very tasty. I had the red velvet cheesecake for desert.  Now here is where you must have a strategy to eating your dinner if you want cheesecake for desert. Don't eat the bread that comes as you sit down, order something small or simply don't eat all the food piled up in front of you and you would normally have saved room for a piece of cheesecake. (Normally is the key word here). The piece of RVCC that landed in front of me was so good and so HUGE, I made myself sick. (Its the next day in the morning as I write this and I'm still feeling it).  In this case (as with most), less is more."
K W.,"Baltimore, MD",0,1,,2.0,12/2/2016,"I love this place. Everyone knows that the food and atmosphere is good. However, I love the idea of the curbside pickup - when it works... the management should look at improving the customer service around curbside pickup. I keep trying to do curbside pickup - about once a week. It starts with the phone call. I typically call my order in when I'm about a half an hour away from the restaurant. However every time I call, I am put on hold. Most of the time, I'm on hold for an indefinite amount of time. Yesterday I waited for five minutes on hold until I hung up. I called back again and was put on hold for another 10 minutes. This is valuable time since I was driving to the restaurant and I needed that time for the food to be prepared, so the food would be ready when I got there. What needs to happen, is management needs to implement warm transfers. I was waiting to be transferred to the bakery so someone can at least place my order, but I couldn't even get my order placed because I was still on hold. So I called back and I talked to the lady who answered the phone and asked them to do a warm transfer over to the bakery. This means that someone would stay on the phone call and ensure that my transfer from one real human being to another real human being occurs. Instead the woman who answered the phone, Rachel, said that I just had to wait on hold and someone will answer when they get to me. It was a poor customer service experience for such a good restaurant.  Although I enjoy the restaurant, I probably won't do curbside anymore."
