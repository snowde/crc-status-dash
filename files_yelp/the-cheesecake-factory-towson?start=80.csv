Nathan W.,"Newmanstown, PA",0,13,,1.0,4/20/2016,"Waiter was bad, very slow. Took a good 20-30 minutes for the food to arrive. Gave her my card to pay, didn't come back for a good 5 minutes. Finished our food, waited about 10 minutes for her to actually get our bill. Wouldn't recommend."
Kanzas G.,"Baltimore, MD",51,18,3,3.0,6/10/2015,It was just ok. The food was ok. The wait staff was ok. My brother pick this place and since it was his day we had to oblige. The one at the Harbor is way better in my opinion.
Michael S.,"Owings Mills, MD",490,31,5,2.0,1/27/2015,Food was great but carry out service was terrible. Called to place and order and they tried to charge me extra for a dinner item when I specifically requested the lunch special (difference of 8$). Received the bag and all the lids immediately came loose spilling the sauce. Again the food was delicious but I would recommend going in to dine and staying away from the carry out service if possible.
Brian R.,"Baltimore, MD",924,177,181,5.0,3/8/2014,Cheesecake Factory has the BEST service in town. Everyone is always extremely nice. I and high quality servers. The food is amazing and reasonably priced for the portion size. I enjoy coming here to eat with friends and family all the time.
Kerri M.,"Baltimore, MD",42,160,13,2.0,3/28/2014,"I feel like this place is overrated. Its always SUPER busy, but I guess that happens when its attached to the mall. So be prepared for a long wait. The food is decent, but expensive. They do dish out large portions, though. They have a rather large menu, and have a little bit of something for everyone. The cheesecake is pretty good, I will admit. I don't really want to go just for cheesecake, even if they do have a take-out section for cheesecake."
Lindsay S.,"Odenton, MD",11,21,1,5.0,3/19/2015,"This review is strictly for the best waitress ever, Julie.  She is super cute and bubbly. Accommodates to your every need. I always ask if she's working every time I visit the Cheesecake Factory and you should too! :)"
Foodie S.,"Wheeling, IL",10,66,63,2.0,12/30/2014,"Usually I like CCF ! I love their chicken samosas and selection of wines.  But this location is not up to the standards of CCF.  I think the margherita pizza I tasted here is so far the worst margherita ! I mean, there is Olive Garden which competes but still, this location is pretty awful too.."
Leah A.,"Glen Burnie, MD",18,13,5,4.0,4/19/2015,"Was here yesterday. I was seated almost immediately, and it took a bit to get our bread, but that's okay. I ordered the Kobe Burger, and it was amazing. It took a while for the waiter to refill our drinks, but it was a pretty busy night. I got the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake to go for dessert. It was great."
Jalisa J.,"Owings Mills, MD",56,128,178,5.0,1/18/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory has a large menu, so anyone could find something that they like. They also have a lot of great drinks! However, it is always busy here, so making reservations would be a good idea"
Mary J.,"Cockeysville, MD",0,69,7,5.0,4/30/2013,"The menu is huge. I would recommend looking at it at home and make your mind in any way, otherwise you might be stuck with two menu brochures (light menu and the regular fares). Be prepared to get a monster of a meal, one plate can feed a person for two days...Their portions are huge. Drinks are delightful, service is efficient and quick. Save room for dessert! Their cheesecakes are a must (they offer a carry-out too, where you can buy their cheesecakes by the slice or the whole cake). What a variety!!! Their coffee is good... Date night-share two appetizers and drinks, can easily suffice as a meal...Parking is easy (mall garage or valet). Location is excellent. If you go on Friday-weekend nights, be prepared to wait...I don't think they take any reservations, but one can always order a drink at the bar and hang around, waiting, people-watching...Place is always hopping. I guess we've been there about ten times so far and never were disappointed. My favorites so far (besides the cheesecake) are their calamari appetizer, mojitos, and GLAMBURGERS!!!! Americana burger beats Five Guys, enough said...Try it! Their french fries are superb, even the day after, place them in the hot (400 degrees) oven for 5 minutes and they come out nice and crispy! Seriously...This is the place to go (if you don't mind the noise, noise is a minus, but oh well, the place is popular!)."
Brandi P.,"Baltimore, MD",567,601,115,4.0,1/18/2013,"I'm not a huge fan of the Towson area, as I find it to be overly crowded and expensive. Lately though, I find myself being introduced to the area in a new light... local boys will do that to ya. Cheesecake Factory: decent prices, very LARGE menu (probably 5 normal pages of menu items), inviting atmosphere, good food. The prices may seem expensive at first glance, but the portions you are given are about (2) servings of food and will last you for about two meals. And of course, the dessert: let's just say I've had pretty phenomenal cheesecake in New York but Cheesecake Factory is up to par and I'm no longer required to drive all the way to New York for a slice of heaven. Not to mention you can get any amazing flavor of cheesecake that you want; I personally lean more towards anything and everything with Peanut Butter.  For those who are tuned to my Nautilus Diner review and are awaiting the next chapter of my personal ""Rom-Com"".. date #3 was tasteful and supposedly I'm ""honest to a fault"", go figure :)"
David W.,"Catonsville, MD",37,55,8,4.0,1/17/2015,"Went there for the first time and I would definitely go back.  The food was a little bit more pricey than I expected, but it was worth it.  I had a S'mores Cheesecake, which was delicious, but really rich.  I wouldn't recommend any cheesecake with chocolate in it, because you probably won't be able to eat all of it.  Looking forward to my next trip there."
Ros W.,"Baltimore, MD",13,39,55,3.0,9/24/2014,Had lunch with friends and the food was ok but the booth was dirty.  The server was good but slow
Jim B.,"Nottingham, MD",0,16,,5.0,3/1/2016,"Never had a bad experience here, food is great and prices are reasonable. The waiting staff is always courteous and pleasant. Only down fall is I wish they would take reservations or at least do call a heads."
Becca H.,"Abingdon, MD",43,262,172,5.0,7/18/2013,"So I'm not usually into chain restaurants but the Cheesecake Factory is definitely an exception. I've been to cheesecake factories from Ohio to PA to different locations in MD, and I have yet to be disappointed. Their food is wonderful. Their menu is so huge that you can order something different every time. Like the roja beef, the gumbo, and the Jamaican black pepper shrimp the best. And let's not forget what they do best: cheesecake! So many choices, and none will disappoint."
Renee B.,"Baltimore, MD",78,567,653,4.0,5/6/2013,Stopped in here just last night just to pick up dessert. I had the peanut butter reese cheesecake. Let's just say if you like cheesecake and you like reese peanut butter I say this is truly a hit. It was not too busy so I was in and out.
Randy J.,"Baltimore, MD",29,263,118,3.0,6/10/2013,We find it very crowded and loud. Some of the seats are close together and dont seat where the wait staff heads for the kitchen. The food of course is good and staff are usually on par. We have been here many times and will again.
Emily R.,"Baltimore, MD",56,244,144,2.0,4/11/2011,"I've been to this CF the most, so I have more to base my star level on. I've said it before, if it was based just on cheesecake, it would be a 5. But the wait at this sucker is almost ALWAYS more than an hour. I'd say about 3 out of the around 10 I've been here the wait has been minimal. I do wish they had a call-ahead wait list, because people-watching in Towson Town Center is fun for about 4 minutes, then it gets gross. It is miserable waiting for this bitch. Moving on, a plus of this CF is it seems big... more booths. But I don't really think there are more booths, as I've been seated in those dumb long tables where you're nearly elbowing the people next to you several times.  My food has been generally okay, but a few times things have been lukewarm instead of hot, and that is not something I feel comfortable complaining about.  The service has always been fine here. Except the hostesses/hosts. They seem like they have a 'tude, when pa-lease, they should be the ones trying to win us back after we've waited 90 minutes to be seated.  Anyways, the cheesecake... oh, oh, the cheesecake. *dies*"
Cee L.,"Bel Air, MD",20,41,117,4.0,9/1/2013,"Fantastic place to eat, whether it be for casual lunch or dinner date.  The semi-casual, semi-formal ambiance allows you to chill out and enjoy some of the best cuisine in Towson, MD. I highly recommend this place."
Patty L.,"Baltimore, MD",0,9,,5.0,2/8/2015,My sister took me to lunch here last week. The service was outstanding! The decor is beautiful. The Sheppards pie tastes homemade and delish. I had apple crumb cheesecake I loved every bite. Can't. Wait to take my husband soon. Excellent lunch. For my first visit I was really impressed. Everything was amazing!
