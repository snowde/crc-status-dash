Kristin K.,"Trumbull, United States",0,19,,5.0,13/8/2015,Love the Cheesecake Factory. Almost always impressed with what I order. Fried macaroni and cheese is a favorite. My friend likes the appetizer that's fried zucchini and mushrooms. The   and other pasta dishes that I've tried are delicious. I've also had great steak off a friends plate from here. Oh and the bread that they bring out to the tables is great.
Chris C.,"Plymouth, United States",0,24,2,2.0,22/4/2016,"Seated and waited on promptly. The waitress was nice. We ordered 2 orders of the filet mignon both were supposed to be cooked med but we're well done with the burnt taste ruining them both but mashed potatoes were good. Also ordered the   with Steak Diane combo. The steak was good and cooked correct but the chicken was disgusting, it tasted exactly like a burnt omelette. The mashed potatoes were good. I would not return."
Ralphie F.,"Bridgeport, United States",1,150,608,3.0,24/9/2014,"MIXED FOOD EXPERIENCE.  We went here on a Tuesday and were very surprised how busy this restaurant was.  The inside is very warm and inviting.  If it weren't for the windows leading to the inside of the Trumbull Mall, you'd never know you were there.  We came to celebrate a birthday and were not disappointed in how the entire staff took the time to wish us a Happy Birthday.   The mixed experience had to do with overall taste.  It clearly has to do with the overwhelming menu choices.  I'll list what we had and rate them individually due to the flavor inconsistencies. 1.  Avocado Rolls, 3 stars.  Chewy 2.  Chicken and Mushroom lettuce wrap, 4 stars.  I would have given it 5 stars but I got one piece of lettuce that was just the right size and the rest were too small for the filling.  Great flavor 3.  Cuban Sandwich 1 star.  It tasted nothing like a Cuban and had a sauce that was similar to tarter sauce, which made each bite unpleasant. 4.  Spicy Chicken Chipolte Pasta ,1 star and it was sent back due to unsavory flavor and it came with just a few chunks of chicken. 5.  Stuffed Chicken Tortillas, 2 stars.  Lacked flavor, was forgettable. 6.   , 5 stars.  Chicken was soft and flavorful.  It has plate licking qualities. 7.    and Steak Diane, 5 stars.  I already described the mouth watering chicken.  The steak was cooked to perfection and was satisfying to the palate.   8.  Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, 5 stars.  Big enough for two to share. 9.  Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, 3 stars.  Big enough for two but too rich for my taste buds. I was a little surprised that, for the prices they charge, a soup or salad was not included with our main course meals, 2 stars.  If you are going to charge these prices, you should be providing more.  A basic bottle of The Cheesecake Beringer wine was $32. No one was overwhelmingly impressed with this dining experience.  I'm glad we tried it, but probably will not return.  Too many unsatisfied taste buds to justify a return visit."
Mary P T.,"Branford, United States",17,33,,3.0,20/12/2015,"We went last night- sat at bar area quickly. I ordered  -chicken was good, but it was very salty and with no Asparagus (no explanation given)! And the mashed potatoes had huge lumps. Not impressed with this restaurants' preparation. But, the apps- Eggroll Sampler and Chicken Samosas - were good. Tanisha, our server was very nice and brought us water/drinks immediately and cheesecake to-go (she got a 20% gratuity). We like Blue Back Square in W. Hartford's Cheesecake Factory much better."
Fairfield L.,"Fairfield, United States",0,22,,4.0,14/8/2015,"Most people who go into a Cheesecake Factory know what to expect. It's not fine dining, just reliable, occasionally excellent food. The cheesecakes are of course the main event, but if you stick to their signature dishes like the   or the Asian Chicken Salad, you'll come away satisfied. My wife once ordered filet mignon...I was like, why would you order a $30 steak at a Cheesecake Factory? But you know what? It was absolutely delicious, as good as Capital Grille. This outlet is always crazy busy so get there early and be prepared to wait 45 min to an hour for a table."
