Angela C.,"Trumbull, United States",2,8,9,5.0,26/6/2017,"I have been to The Cheesecake Factory of Trumbull many times, and each time is always a great experience. Generally, the service is good. The food portions are generous. The lunch specials are good price and you still get a generous amount of food! Every time I go for lunch I get fettuccini and my friend gets the four  , which are both very tasty and filling! They start you with two types of bread, and since me and my friend love the brown bread we always ask for more and they have no problem getting you more. I recommend the Godiva Cheesecake, although they all look good. My friend always get the Reese's or red velvet, which are also both good."
