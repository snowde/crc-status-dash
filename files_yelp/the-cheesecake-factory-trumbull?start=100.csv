Mary P.,"Beacon Falls, CT",3,6,,5.0,8/30/2016,My husband and I went to the Cheesecake Factory today.  Service was very good .  Our waiter very nice and quick.  Food was excellent.
Dorothy R.,"Ellenburg Depot, NY",0,7,,3.0,2/28/2016,I usually love the Cheesecake Factory. This experience was not up to par mostly due to service. It was busy but not overly crowded. The waiter did not know what light dressings were available so brought regular instead. The food was brought out sporadically. There were three of us and we each got our food at different times delivered by different people. When I finally did get the light dressing it was horrible. It was the light mustard but had no taste. The rest of the food was delicious but the crab bites were expensive for the price. The Asian chicken tacos were great. I don't usually write reviews but I really like that Cheesecake Factory has a light menu that tastes good. I hope the one here gets its act together.
Richard C.,"Stratford, CT",3,32,59,3.0,2/7/2015,So far I enjoy eating here. Very large menu to choose ftom. Here again with jack
Dominique S.,"Stamford, CT",3,29,5,1.0,8/16/2015,"Ugh where do I begin!? THE WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!Stopped by for a ""supposed to be quick lunch"" while me and my friend were shopping at the mall. Ended up being almost 2 HOURS from start to finish. Once inside we did notice they were a little busy, but decided to sit down anyways. Went over to the hostess stand and was seated immediately. Afterwards, no one acknowledged us for almost 15 minutes since we sat down.  While we were waiting for the waiter to come I was already getting frustrated with the fact that there were so many servers passing by and not 1 could say ""someone will be right with you"". We should have left right then and there. Anyways, once our server did come, which I don't even know his name because he never introduced himself, he asked what we wanted to drink. We placed our drink orders and an appetizer, since we were still deciding on the main course.  Long story short, we waited almost 15 minutes to get our drinks alone, and I had to ask for some bread for the table since we were starving. Once our server left the table he literally stood around and chatted with co workers instead of getting our drinks.  Then the appetizer arrived which was delivered by another server, and I had to ask that guy for my glass of water which OUR SERVER forgot. About 15 minutes later our  server came by to check on us and I told him we were ready to order our main course, but he took FOREVER to put the order in the computer. We saw him stand around and talk with co workers AGAIN instead of putting our food order in. SERIOUSLY!?  We literally waited another 20 minutes for our main dishes.  Once we were done eating, we wanted to bring a piece of cheesecake home and get the bill. Again the waiter was ignoring us or just simply forgot to check on us, and kept walking by. Once he did come back to our table we waited another 30 MINUTES to get the check and piece of cheesecake to go! That's ridiculous!!! I wanted to just get up and leave already but we were waiting for the change.  I understand it was busy but 2 other tables sat around us and they were helped immediately and received their drinks and checks before us! What kind of s*** is that!? I was getting really ticked off, to the point where I just wanted to get up and leave.  As far as the food, it was okay.. Nothing special. Definitely won't be returning unless they fix their service and staff. Hostess was rude and asked me with an attitude to move my dirty dishes from the table next to us so she can seat a party. UM HELLO LADY WE PUT OUR PLATES THERE BECAUSE NO ONE CAME AND REMOVED THEM FROM THE TABLE SO WE HAD NO ROOM TO EAT!  That was my experience at the Cheesecake Factory in the Trumbull Mall. Unless you have a couple of hours to waste on sitting down and eating here, I would suggest you skip it and go somewhere else!"
Chris A.,"Paterson, NJ",17,18,2,1.0,8/28/2014,"Wow. Where do I Start... I really enjoy my visits to The Cheesecake Factory but this one takes the cake (no pun intended). We haven't even left the restaurant yet and I felt compelled to leave this review.  We were a party of 8 and I get that we would have to wait for a bit. It turned out to be almost an hour and a half wait to get seated. It was my room mates niece's birthday. It all went downhill from there. First off they did not have the appetizers that we ordered. Second, besides the 1 1/2 we waited to get seated we had to wait almost another 45 minutes before the main course came out. We went in for lunch around 1 and did not start to eat till after 3pm. At this point we were starving. Here is the kicker. Despite our best efforts to tell the wait staff that we had a birthday person at the table, of everyone's main course, they bought her's out cold!! Needless to say we were not a happy bunch. The waitress did her best to apologize and the manager comp'd her meal but that was not the point. They ruined what was supposed to be a memorable occasion. Her 21st birthday.  Some of us lost our appetite because everyone mood changed. For the worse. Good thing I don't ever have to come back here..."
Tara P.,"Patchogue, NY",1038,229,316,3.0,8/27/2014,"I worked at the Lake Grove location for four years and realized the most important part of the job was to never let a guest see what mess goes on behind closed doors. This location has only been open for about a month so there are a bunch of kinks to work out, but I definitely could see the issues all around me. Empty drinks, m is - running of food, servers not visiting their tables enough to check in....Obviously I've worked at this restaurant before and put my service above everyone's....well it is. I'm too bias so I should probably stop reviewing."
Lori B.,"Rahway, NJ",4,16,13,2.0,9/26/2015,"After the 30 min wait for our table, we were finally seated. Unfortunately, we didn't have a waiter even stop by to give water or utensils for at least 20 mins after we sat down. I was with a party of 5 so the time passed as we looked over the menu. I finally got so agitated that I pulled a waiter over to explain that we were waiting for 20 mins without any service. She immediately helped and was very professional and sweet. However, our drinks were lack luster and food could use some more flavor. Waitress was the best part of our dinning experience."
Kat X.,"Fairfield, CT",14,38,24,1.0,7/12/2015,"Service was terrible. There were dozens of empty tables but there was a line to sit, so we grabbed an empty booth in the bar. They took our order and disappeared...for over 45 minutes. Didn't bring out the salad even before the meal. Finally they brought our meal minus the sides which didn't arrive until we were done eating. The food was ok, it was just like pulling teeth to get it. They just could not possibly have cared less. Never going back!"
Frank B.,"Fairfield, CT",48,2,,1.0,8/28/2016,Wish i can leave 0 stars. My girlfriend and I are currently at cheesecake factory in the mall. Service is absolutely terrible!!! Walked in asked for a table for 2 the host told us 15 minutes (no problem) 20 minutes goes by nothing.... 25 minutes later I have to go up and ask where our table is. The host brought us around the entire restaurant to find us the table and nothing. We ended up going back up to where the host office was waited for another 10 minutes before I had to grab the manager. The manager apologized and looked for a table for us finally after another 5 minutes we sat down. We ordered our drinks and food since we knew what we wanted already and asked for them to bring out the bread. We received our drinks then 12 minutes later our dinner but still no bread. Asked for the bread again didn't come for another 15 minutes by that time we were done with our meal. Didn't even bother ordering desert wanted to get out as soon as I can!!
Ray M.,"Waterbury, CT",9,36,24,4.0,6/4/2016,Pleasantly surprised. The food was very good for a chain. Only down side was they were out of a few items and it took a while to get our drinks and silverware. Very busy that night... But the waitress was very nice.
Assaf A.,"Milford, CT",12,45,99,5.0,1/28/2015,"Not bad ever, love cheese cake factory as it really lovely restaurant. Don not miss teriyaki chicken and cashew chicken."
Dolores A.,"Trumbull, CT",25,10,5,3.0,8/15/2014,"This place is brand new for our area, so we tried it. The decor and sound level reminded me of a Las Vegas casino! We were glad outdoor seating was available, where it was a little quieter, even if we were basically sitting in the mall parking lot. (Also, tubs of aromatic garbage rolled past every half hour or so, being taken from kitchen outlet to refuse receptacle.)  The staff is trained but very young and inexperienced and seemed overwhelmed -- the menu is vast and communication among bar, kitchen, servers, and all are still chaotic. Our waiter was very sweet and the slowness was clearly not his fault. Food was well prepared and tasty. We were too full to eat cheesecake but brought some home with us.  By 6pm there was a line out the door, so most people must know and appreciate the chain. It was too crazy for us old folks (51, 53, 56, and 61), and I doubt we will return even when they're running smoothly."
Alicia P.,"Trumbull, CT",28,29,10,5.0,12/20/2015,Everytime I go the food is great. Sometimes there are long lines but for the most part not much waiting. The molasses bread is my favorite. I love that there are so many choices on their menu so that whatever type I'm in the mood for they have
Christopher R.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,17,10,3.0,2/16/2016,"I'm a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory. I think I went too early, it was just open a few weeks, but there were some kinks. Overall, we ate (my wife, my 2 little girls and myself) and we agreed that we would go back and give it another shot. I love the ambiance and locality of it, right in the mall! Plus, where else can you get ""cheese cake this good?"", no where!"
Jane D.,"Easton, CT",0,9,,1.0,10/29/2016,"My husband and I came here after the lunch rush today and have never had a worse experience at a Cheesecake Factory location. After being seated, drinks took between 8-10 minutes. Then we were told they didn't have the appetizer we originally wanted so we chose another. The spinach dip was bland and the chips were greasy. My husband ordered the farfalle without peas and I had the pit beef dip sandwich. The food took way too long to arrive (about 25 minutes). When we did get the food, the sandwich was bland, tough, and dried out like it had been sitting under the salamander for too long. My husband's pasta had peas in it. Since our waitress never came by to check on us, we had to flag down someone else to get a new pasta. Our waitress let us know the manager was on top of it making it himself in the kitchen and it came out fairly quickly and tasted fine. At no point did our waitress ever check on us, or apologize for the duration of our visit. When the bill arrived, they charged us twice for the re-made pasta. We didn't even want to stay for dessert since what was supposed to be a quick lunch was an hour and 15 minutes of disappointment. Never again, Trumbull."
Sabrina C.,"Parker, CO",1,35,7,1.0,11/28/2016,"Went for dinner on a slow Monday night with family (7 total) and got horrible service!  Even after asking, two of us didn't get appetizer plates and we had to ask for silverware.  No drink refills, and a very rude waitress treated us like an inconvenience.  They didn't clear the appetizer plates or serving dishes off the table.  The worst part of all is that they made an error with one of entrees and did not bring it out till everyone else was done eating.  The waitress downplayed the error, didn't acknowledge or apologize or offer any reconciliation.  Even when slow and fully staffed we were surprised to see such slow and bad service.  After asking the waitress if we were charged for the entree that didn't arrive until the end, the waitress said the manager is working on comping that plate, but upon receiving the check, it was still charged.  Will not be returning and do not recommend to others."
KT T.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,27,9,1.0,7/4/2015,"I ordered take out here one night while I was in the area. It was by far the worst. Opened up my containers only to have reheated microwaved food. The burger bread was soggy, my rolls were not even crispy and burnt chicken. I immediately called the restaurant to express my dissatisfaction. I love eating from the Cheesecake Factory but that one occasion was a complete turnoff."
Sandra C.,"Easton, CT",0,8,,5.0,2/9/2016,We are all about the Cheescake! We love the variety and they are so many to choose from! Definitely for the cheesecake fan! :)
Christina C.,"Easton, CT",0,3,,1.0,5/17/2016,"I have tried this location three times now and each it has declined!  Wrong items, cold food, burned food, and the list goes on so have not been back!  Against my own judgement my family is having a reunion and asked to dine there - I called and was told no reservations for a party of 25+.  Asked to speak to a manager and was put on hold for 20 minutes by Kayla and left only to be disconnected!  Called again and was put on hold again and after 10 more minutes yet again to be disconnected.  Considering my past experiences and the challenge to speak to someone above the age of 16 who is not rude, crude and socially unacceptable, I have moved on and will dine elsewhere!  I have never nor will I ever bend over backwards to give my money to a location that feels above the rest!  Over time, this restaurant will fail as the reviews below only enforce each of MY experiences!"
Peg H.,"Seymour, CT",0,11,,1.0,11/14/2016,"Had my first and last visit to this place this past weekend. After a 50 minute wait to be seated, our drink orders were taken promptly but about ten minutes before we saw them, or the waiter again. I had ordered a glass of wine. When reaching for the glass when it finally arrived, it was sticky on the outside of the glass- so sticky that when I picked it up, the napkin which it sat upon was lifted too.  I told the waiter, he took it back, another ten minutes before I saw him again telling me that all the wine glasses were in the dishwasher. Finally got the wine, second glass not in much better shape. The food was ok- nothing to brag about but not bad either. Then dessert time. My husband ordered hazelnut crusted cheesecake. After again an unusually lengthy wait, we were told that the cheesecake he ordered was frozen- we could have it to go only. Also, a very noisy place. Overall fair food, service which could have been a lot better, questionable clean glasses, the noise.....will not go back."
