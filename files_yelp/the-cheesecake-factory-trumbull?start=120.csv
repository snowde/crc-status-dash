Jose C.,"West Haven, CT",0,83,6,3.0,11/28/2015,"The food dishes come out pretty big for the price you pay. Extremely long lines, also we had a waiter that was supposed to come refill my drink and returned 10 times to our table with no drink. I ate my entire meal waiting for our drinks and he didn't even offer us a different drink. For paying 300$ I think they would have some better waiters."
J R.,"Chicopee, MA",0,31,2,4.0,11/11/2015,"This place is my choice when heading home up the Merritt Parkway from New York City.  Once you get onto Route 15 you enter wilderness with no good restaurants until this one, in the big mall at Trumbull CT.  It's like most other Cheesecake Factories, solid, reliable, decent food.  Noisy but they all are"
Jen D.,"Norwalk, CT",3,98,304,4.0,11/11/2015,Go at an off hour to get seats right away. Love the four cheese pasta and strawberry shortcake.
Mike E.,"Trumbull, CT",34,57,281,4.0,9/5/2014,"First visit of the new Trumbull location. Kids are excited as we visit re factory when we visit Florida every year. Place was mobbed but they still brought out our good timely and everything was great especially the pear arugula and blue cheese flatbread yum!!!Only complaint was the roast chicken was overlooked and dry. It is a packed Friday night. They they brought the whole table desserts and sincerely apologized. That's great service and we will be back here many times in the near future.  Laura our server was really great. Very attentive, very nice and well informed. Hope we get her again!!"
Mary H.,"Monroe, CT",0,5,5,2.0,12/16/2014,"I have eaten there three times now.  My first mistake was going the day after their grand opening.  From the time we were seated thru the time we left...2-1/2 hours had passed and I was more than upset.  Nothing fancy was ordered either plus NO desert.  Food was great but I wouldn't wait that long gain. We waited about 6 weeks to try it again.  I actually ordered the same food.  I was surprised that the food was overly salted which took away from my eating experience. This time we were there just under 2 hours. Our third time there was disastrous l, I ordered a special, 1/2 sandwich with cup of soup.  The sandwich couldn't be held...it just fell apart... Our wait person was also servicing a table to our left.  Our tables were too close together...not for our waitress though!  She squeezed herself right in there but her butt was in my face and so was that napkin she had in her back pocket.  That thing moved items on our table plus kept hitting me every time she stood between the tables.  I was disappointed with every aspect of my meal....I couldn't wait to get out of this overly noisy environment where the music was was set too high to have any kind of conversation. I follow the 3-strike rule....I'm out of there now and for good.  The wait staff have learned bad habits from the get go and now have perfected them to a fault.  Too expensive for a mediocre experience."
Cherie L.,"Shelton, CT",0,165,201,5.0,8/8/2014,"I'd heard this place was coming & I counted down the days until opening day! As the date drew closer, my friends & I decided we should get a group together to support this great business, that's new to our locale! So we gathered & headed over to enjoy the famous cheesecakes!  OK I know, I know it's a chain restaurant & they usually have long wait times... & this location is no different in those things, but they also have some good food, servers who want to do their job, & oh FANTASTIC CHEESECAKE!!!! We got here w/our grp,  & we waited a while, but  I spoke w/Mike, & he tried to help us get our large grp in & so while he worked on that, we amused ourselves & other guests while we waited.  We had all phenomenally AWESOME GREAT time w/good friends & supreme cheesecake!!!! We didn't try any of their regular foods,  just deserts. ..all was very good, including service!! We look forward to our next visits individually & together.  Side Note to Corporation: ONE suggestion to The Cheesecake Factory Corp, while I know they don't currently take ANY reservations, at ANY OF THEIR LOCATIONS, they SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER accepting reservations for larger groups, at ALL locations. (Or at the very least do a ""trial period"" of this concept at select spots and see what sort of response they get from both customers, employees,  & sales). They could call, email, and/or text also, to confirm the details, so as to avoid no shows etc. I think this would encourage more business for them & happy customers overall. I had no issues for this visit, but just think that for the business, the community, & all in general, it'd be something they would be wise to consider. Just a thought!  :)"
Cara M.,"Shelton, CT",0,20,1,1.0,2/8/2015,"I always have an unpleasant time at this particular Cheesecake Factory. There seem to be many servers, adorned in white and bustling about, but for some reason the service is EXTREMELY slow. My glass of water doesn't seem get refilled until my waiter is around my table for me to flag him/her down.  As for the food, it always looks appealing on the menu and even on the warm plate itself... however, the taste is either completely bland or ordinary. For a place that charges the prices that they do for their dishes, I expect more flavor -- or at least something to write home about. But sadly, this is never the case.  Save your money and spend it elsewhere. You will be much happier if you take my word."
Shopaholic C.,"Kitimat, Canada",0,21,,1.0,5/15/2016,"I have been to a number of different Cheesecake Factory throughout the years. But my latest experience at Trumble was the worst one. The service was bad (waited for at least 15 minutes to get greeted by our waitress), dirty utensils, broken glass ( at the rim!!). Worst of all, unavailable dishes 15 minutes after we ordered!"
Sam M.,"Parlin, NJ",0,2,,2.0,6/27/2015,Food was okay and I got served cold pasta dish and the manager came and apologized with half his eyes closed and brought me another in a few mins - probably just took the old dish and microwaved it and the manager told me it was made all fresh
Julia A.,"Milford, CT",47,13,,3.0,11/13/2015,"I have had hit and miss experiences at Cheesecake Factory. I went in to meet a friend for lunch and got sat right away, which was nice. There was four of us in total. Our waiter constantly checked in to see if we were ready to order which was a little annoying. It felt a little like we were being rushed. We put our orders in the food literally came out one by one. Everyone ordered something that needed to be cooked, I ordered a salad and mine came out last and like ten minutes after everyone else's food came out. Thankfully everything tasted really good! I'd go back again but would really hope for some better service."
Emily B.,"Fairfield, CT",15,388,150,3.0,7/3/2015,"Since attending the opening last year, I have stopped in about a half dozen times. There's typically a long wait, which is pretty common for any Cheesecake Factory. The food here is good and consistent with other locations. So why the three stars? The food is a little bit pricey and I just feel like you could get homemade food at a small and charming restaurant one town over in Fairfield."
Haydee M.,"Huguenot, NY",1,4,,5.0,10/14/2015,"loved the food drinks and service. Firecracker salmon is my fav.... in middletown, NY I've tried others.... no match"
Laura D.,"Monroe, CT",7,9,,2.0,12/5/2014,"First time I was ever disappointed at Cheesecake Factory. Ordered salmon salad off the regular salad menu, not the appetizer salads. Salmon was served cold, salad was nothing notable. Ordered a glass of Pinot noir and it was gross, not good wine at all. Def a disappointing visit. Could just be the items I picked."
Sheesh S.,"New Haven, CT",10,139,28,2.0,12/30/2014,"My mom and I had lunch at Cheesecake Factory yesterday ( Monday ) afternoon. The place was packed but we were seating quickly and met our waiter shortly after seating. We ordered the lunch fish and chips and the lunch margarita pizza with Caesar salad. Food came out quickly but you could tell the fish was frozen and the pizza seemed like the lean cuisine ones you throw in the oven! Our waiter was M.I.A. for the most part of our luncheon, it took about 20 minutes just for us to get the bill. I will say the tiramisu cheesecake was perfect. Overall, I would not come back here."
Rinda D.,"Fairfield, CT",12,7,,5.0,5/26/2015,Never disappointed! Great menu! great drinks! And kid friendly. Awesome staff haven't had a bad experience yet!
Kristopher N.,"Trumbull, CT",34,8,,5.0,6/29/2015,"What can I say. We have been waiting forever for this place to open locally and it is finally here! And it delivers. Great food, good service and friendly waitstaff. Oh and the deserts were amazing."
Michael B.,"Shelton, CT",49,33,10,3.0,6/21/2015,Only reason 3 stars is there staff makes you wait so long for your cheesecake  and the entire menu is just too large.   Overall everything is good though
Jackie T.,"Stratford, CT",1,3,1,1.0,10/31/2014,"I've given this place plenty of tries and each experience is worst than the last. Wait staff, amazing at their  job. But they are always out of stuff. My most recent trip was last night. I wore a scarf and left it there by accident. Called this morning to make sure it was still there and it wasn't. But the fact that I had to sit on hold for 25 minutes to be told no, then click hung up on. Absolutely rude! I want my f**king scarf back."
Jackie G.,"Trumbull, CT",0,47,4,4.0,7/29/2015,Vast menu keeps it interesting to try new things.  Glad they opened in our town.  Very enjoyable to lunch there after shopping.
Kevin P.,"Trumbull, CT",0,26,1,1.0,9/30/2014,Decided to try this new restaurant for the first time. Settled on brunch. As we're walking in the front door we noticed a a really bad smell. Turns out the restaurant loads it garbage into the garbage truck next to the front door. There was spilled garbage and fluids across the parking lot where one would enter the restaurant. Food was ok service was. But couldn't seem to get that smell out of our heads. I did try to make contact with rest no response.
