Food L.,"Shelton, CT",26,224,1568,1.0,11/18/2014,"We arrived for dinner and had a small wait. When we received the text message that our table was ready, it was an additional 5 minutes, since they seemed flustered and behind. We didn't receive silverware when we sat down. The bread provided to our table was just the oatmeal bread and not white bread. No mention from our waitress that it was coming. No straws for our beverage still no white bread. Some nice busboy brought it to us after we waited five minutes longer. Our orders were in and we were all hungry. The children's mac and cheese was disgusting. The cheese was dried out and tasted sour. The noodles were also not soft as most kids enjoy. The icing on the cake was my meal. I ordered the bistro shrimp pasta. The shrimp are supposed to be crispy battered. Well, they were not anything as described. I've eaten at two other cheesecake factories and NEVER seen anything like what they served me in Trumbull. They were NOT battered AT ALL, and tiny, tiny, baby shrimp. They were so small, that it was a salad topper shrimp. I would never in a million years want to come back to this restaurant. I actually took out my phone and showed the manager and waitress photos of what the plate should look like, but she said the cooks and her did not agree. She knew it was wrong and the waitress told me that they always serve baby shrimp, not battered with the meal. This place is a nightmare and honestly, for $17.95, to serve baby, petite shrimp is unjustified. I would not ever recommend this place to anyone. By the way... the FLOOR IS DISGUSTING! Eventually they will have someone slip and get hurt because it was so greasy and messy. I can only imagine the kitchen! I would recommend the West Hartford location."
Stephanie G.,"Yonkers, NY",21,28,25,1.0,9/11/2014,"The worst cheese cake factory I've ever been to. We were seated quickly, saw our waitress once to take our order, appetizers were luke warm. After the appetizers we didn't see our waitress for the next 45 minutes or so.  My plate was served by a different person and that too was luke warm. We asked for a manager since we couldn't even get a refill in our drinks and he did nothing, he himself actually took too long to get us the check. Worst part of all is I got food poisoning once I got home a few hours later. Never coming here again."
Frank R.,"Trumbull, CT",15,1,,4.0,3/3/2015,"Food was good, prices were fair, seated us fast and drinks were good ... So was the cheesecake as expected"
Patrick P.,"Fairfield, CT",2,28,6,2.0,11/15/2014,I hate waiting 20-30 minutes for these chains and then the food is subpar.  Ordered the Americana Burger and it came 15 minutes after everyone else in my party and was burnt. Might as well go to McDonald's
Lauren W.,"Shelton, CT",0,9,2,2.0,10/23/2014,"Service is terrible- I've been there twice dinning in and once for take out- they messed up my take out order which was annoying, and dinning in- we waited forever for our food to arrive and the second time- they were ""out of stock"" for what I wanted to order- which was frustrating. But I still love their cheesecake..."
Stephen D.,"Fairfield, CT",4,4,1,1.0,9/27/2014,Meatloaf was good. Garlick noodles were terrible. Pasta was not done correctly. Returned the dish. Very very noisy. Not a good environment. It will be a very long time before I return here.
Arnold M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,14,7,1.0,11/24/2014,The worst service and slowest kitchen imaginable. Walked out after waiting interminably long to receive the meal and was glad I did so. Spoke to others who had the exact same experience.
Kayla M.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,45,2,5.0,1/31/2016,"Although I have never ate in I love the take out. The Oreo cheesecake is to die for! Vanilla bean with glazed strawberries is another fave. And the chocolate chip cookie dough. I love ordering their entire cheesecakes. I only wish they were pre-sliced. The menu is also pretty good they have orange chicken, pizza, all types of good eats."
Amanda M.,"Shelton, CT",0,8,,1.0,11/6/2014,Absolutely terrible!!!! I waited an hour to be seated in a crowded almost cafeteria style like seating area. Then they took our order (for two people) and we waited another hour and no food or updates. The people who got there after us got their food before us. I dont know how they expect to have a menu thats 15 pages long (thats an exaggeration but still) and stay in business. Also there were flies everywhere flying around!
Yoav B.,"Fairfield, CT",0,3,,1.0,8/24/2014,We had a very poor experience the last day of no tax Saturday. As you may imagine it was very crowded. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes and was actually 40 minutes. It took another 30 to 35 minutes to get our food. Altogether we were there for 2 hours. When the food came two of the three meals came together while the third took another 10 minutes. . Mediocre at best. The highlight of the meal was the fries which were very good. The Kobe burger was nothing special. Soup was too rich. Even the cheesecake was to dense and too sweet. They certainly could not handle a large crowd.
Juan H.,"Norwalk, CT",33,19,1,4.0,1/21/2015,Food is great. Servers are still pretty new. But not bad. I recommend that you order right away the kitchen it's still pretty slow. So if you are not in a hurry for good food this is definitely the place to go.
Mandy C.,"Flushing, NY",0,3,,4.0,3/16/2015,"it pretty new, just open last year in august. i went there for dinner with friends.  the price is kinda high but the foods was good. Service can be better, it was ok that day. the place look hugh and have a patio in trumbull mall. Not a bad place to eat if you can spend  money."
Kenya G.,"Hamden, CT",1,27,,3.0,12/29/2014,"Party of six. We left our name/number while we shopped as they don't take reservations. We shopped and 30 minutes later, our table was available. I received a text. Sooner than expected. The place was incredibly crowded! With more people pouring in. The hostess was visibly frazzled. Folks in this position should be unflappable, gregarious & all smiles! Mel B. Was our server. Very warm + friendly. She started off VERY strong but finished VERY weakly. Nice but forgot about us mid meal.  My dish, orange chicken, which I always get at TCF was tasty, the plate was HOT, my food was lukewarm. How does that happen? I'm not one to send food back.  Friend #1 ordered chicken wings off the app list. They were very salty. She has never been impressed with TCF & her mind was not changed by her meal last night. Oh yeah, she ordered a salad with her wings...it arrived well after her wings were consumed. Even though she reminded our server about it as she ate her 3rd wing. Friend #2 had skinnylicious enchilada. She thought they were fantastic. I took a forkful...I was not impressed @ all. Mushy and bland. Friend #3 had a side salad and Philly steak + cheese. She loved it.  Friend #4 had the chicken chopped salad. According to the menu, it was supposed to be romaine, guess what? It was iceberg! It was on the soggy side. The chicken was barely there. She didn't send it back...we all know why! Friend #6, a child, ordered the chicken sliders, with fruit salad. They were OK....she never received her cutlery, napkin. So we had to share with her. She went without a napkin, though we asked....SEVERAL TIMES!!  My takeaway? The menu is MASSIVE/ HUGE!!!!!! Jack of all trades, master of none comes to mind...except the orange chicken. Lol its never, ever bad. I've had it at 3 different TCFs throughout New England. Always the same. Tough to get refills on water. Another server was kind enough to fill in while Mel B. was MIA. She brought over water & salad dressing for friend #6s lettuce/tomato. The cheesecakes...pineapple upside down, key lime, banana, dulce de leche, strawberry all good. They could do a nicer job of presenting them. I've been to TCFs where the presentation was beautiful.  Will we return? YES! Will they always be busy? YES! This place will bring folks in who are not mall shoppers. We shopped after our meal and left after the mall closed. Folks were still lined up to get in!! The parking lot was jam packed."
Ali C.,"Trumbull, CT",0,12,,3.0,2/3/2016,"Not sure what to say about this place except for incredibly inconsistent. When it's a good night there, it's great! When it's not a good night, it's really bad. I've been here probably about 10 times and sometimes servers are great and other times they're terrible. Some of the food is really great! Other dishes are not. Bread is great when it comes out warm, but can be terrible when it comes out cold. I sometimes ask for special requests because of dietary restrictions or preferences and some times it's perfect, other times I have sent the meal BACK TWICE. I really want to love this place but unfortunately it's a bit difficult sometimes. I will say, however, that their apple crisp, Godiva cheesecake, and cookie dough cheesecake are great and have always enjoyed those!"
Mike C.,"Fairfield, CT",0,7,,4.0,2/22/2015,"Very good restaurant. I will start with the bad first. The two-party seating is very close together and the restaurant gets very busy.  There are no reservations and the wait time can be 2 to 2 1/2 hours on a busy weekend. The restaurant does however have a text message notification system that will alert you when your table is ready via text message; so you can walk around the mall while you're waiting.  I have never had to wait longer than an hour. I have been to Danbury, Palisades Mall and West Hartford.  This restaurant definitely puts out some of the better food.  The portions are plenty, the presentation is neat and the quality is there. The front of house staff is usually very good; personable and well-trained.  I have been there five times and only once had a waiter that was average, the rest were great. Best time to go is off hours on a weekday."
Ralphie F.,"Bridgeport, CT",1,150,608,3.0,9/24/2014,"MIXED FOOD EXPERIENCE.  We went here on a Tuesday and were very surprised how busy this restaurant was.  The inside is very warm and inviting.  If it weren't for the windows leading to the inside of the Trumbull Mall, you'd never know you were there.  We came to celebrate a birthday and were not disappointed in how the entire staff took the time to wish us a Happy Birthday.   The mixed experience had to do with overall taste.  It clearly has to do with the overwhelming menu choices.  I'll list what we had and rate them individually due to the flavor inconsistencies. 1.  Avocado Rolls, 3 stars.  Chewy 2.  Chicken and Mushroom lettuce wrap, 4 stars.  I would have given it 5 stars but I got one piece of lettuce that was just the right size and the rest were too small for the filling.  Great flavor 3.  Cuban Sandwich 1 star.  It tasted nothing like a Cuban and had a sauce that was similar to tarter sauce, which made each bite unpleasant. 4.  Spicy Chicken Chipolte Pasta ,1 star and it was sent back due to unsavory flavor and it came with just a few chunks of chicken. 5.  Stuffed Chicken Tortillas, 2 stars.  Lacked flavor, was forgettable. 6.  Chicken Madeira, 5 stars.  Chicken was soft and flavorful.  It has plate licking qualities. 7.  Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane, 5 stars.  I already described the mouth watering chicken.  The steak was cooked to perfection and was satisfying to the palate.   8.  Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, 5 stars.  Big enough for two to share. 9.  Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, 3 stars.  Big enough for two but too rich for my taste buds. I was a little surprised that, for the prices they charge, a soup or salad was not included with our main course meals, 2 stars.  If you are going to charge these prices, you should be providing more.  A basic bottle of The Cheesecake Beringer wine was $32. No one was overwhelmingly impressed with this dining experience.  I'm glad we tried it, but probably will not return.  Too many unsatisfied taste buds to justify a return visit."
Joseph L.,"Fairfield, CT",53,98,169,4.0,8/20/2014,"Keeping in mind that this location is brand new and just opened up for less than a month, they're still working out some kinks.  I've always been a big Cheesecake Factory fan, which is why I wasn't surprised that this place was completely packed Sunday night.  If you are going in with a party of 2 it shouldn't be too bad, my wife and I waited for about 30 minutes but I like the fact that they have text message system rather than the little vibrating sensors that let you know your table's ready.  It allows you to go further away from the restaurant and shop the mall while you wait and not miss the alert.  Bigger parties, you'll probably be waiting an hour or more depending on what time you go.   After reading the few reviews posted so far I was trying to keep my expectations in check and not being over hyped.  We had 2 waitresses attending our table which was great, probably 1 in training.  Joclyn was very professional and attentive.  We got our drinks and bread quickly and the bread was very fresh and still warm. We ordered the Fire Cracker Salmon Rolls for appetizer which came out at a reasonable pace.  For entrees we had 2 different pastas, both arrived at the same time and still very hot and fresh.  I was also surprised that they were seasoned very well and portion size was excellent as usual with Cheesecake Factory.   I couldn't say the same for the table next to us, they had some issues with their order (too much cheese on their pizza... wth?)  Anyway, we also got the banana cream cheese cake which was very smooth and delish.  Overall, we had an excellent experience this time and I hope it'll continue the next time we return.  I was happy with the service we received from Joclyn and no complaints about the food despite the other reviews and our neighboring table.   There can be room for improvement at the entrance as it gets pretty crazy crowded during times and confusion occurs as some people picking up take out or just buying cheese cake get all mingled with the other restaurant guests waiting for tables. The front end people seemed kind of stressed as they don't really smile or act alert when guests try to get their attention, but I assume their just really trying to focus on seating everyone."
Lamar W.,"Hamden, CT",74,4,4,5.0,12/10/2015,Excellent food and even better customer service! I've been here on multiple occasions and have never been disappointed!! I've had the same waitress Azzalee twice and I'm still impressed with the phenomenal customer service I receive! I will return soon!!!!
Robin B.,"Shelton, CT",2,25,,1.0,5/22/2015,"The portions are big yet the food is so-so at best.   My husband had a Mexican dish that he barely touched (he never leaves food on his plate), my son who eats us out of house and home left his eggplant parm on his plate, my gumbo was definitely not the kind you would find in any New Orleans restaurant, and the deep-fried macaroni and cheese landed in the stomach like a lead balloon.  The cheesecake doesn't make the rest of the meal any more worth eating.  No, this is no longer on our list of places to eat out."
Jess A.,"Trumbull, CT",16,96,11,4.0,9/8/2015,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory several times, the service is good, the quality of the food has always been good and I really can't complain. It's a chain, so I don't expect to be served a gourmet meal."
