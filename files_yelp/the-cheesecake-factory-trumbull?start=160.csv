Kristin K.,"Trumbull, CT",0,19,,5.0,8/13/2015,Love the Cheesecake Factory. Almost always impressed with what I order. Fried macaroni and cheese is a favorite. My friend likes the appetizer that's fried zucchini and mushrooms. The chicken Madeira and other pasta dishes that I've tried are delicious. I've also had great steak off a friends plate from here. Oh and the bread that they bring out to the tables is great.
L M.,"Fairfield, CT",0,2,,1.0,12/26/2015,"Christmas Eve, large original cheesecake....disappointed.  Four hours after pickup, frozen in middle, then got all melty.  $50.00 mess!"
Mary P T.,"Branford, CT",17,33,,3.0,12/20/2015,"We went last night- sat at bar area quickly. I ordered Chicken Madeira-chicken was good, but it was very salty and with no Asparagus (no explanation given)! And the mashed potatoes had huge lumps. Not impressed with this restaurants' preparation. But, the apps- Eggroll Sampler and Chicken Samosas - were good. Tanisha, our server was very nice and brought us water/drinks immediately and cheesecake to-go (she got a 20% gratuity). We like Blue Back Square in W. Hartford's Cheesecake Factory much better."
Fairfield L.,"Fairfield, CT",0,22,,4.0,8/14/2015,"Most people who go into a Cheesecake Factory know what to expect. It's not fine dining, just reliable, occasionally excellent food. The cheesecakes are of course the main event, but if you stick to their signature dishes like the Chicken Madeira or the Asian Chicken Salad, you'll come away satisfied. My wife once ordered filet mignon...I was like, why would you order a $30 steak at a Cheesecake Factory? But you know what? It was absolutely delicious, as good as Capital Grille. This outlet is always crazy busy so get there early and be prepared to wait 45 min to an hour for a table."
C. T.,"Bethany, CT",0,15,,4.0,11/7/2015,"I have been here 3 or 4 times, alm have been pleasant. One time there was a child next to me that broke a dish and was being disruptive, the waiter did wverything he could to make our experience as nice as possible. Every person we have had there is friendly and eager to please, the food is always tastey."
Kevin S.,"Middle River, MD",0,58,5,4.0,11/5/2015,"A small group of us went to grab a quick bite later in the evening. The wait for the dining area was 15-20, but a bar high top table was available so we took that. Quick service, decent food and drinks and an overall solid place to stop for something to eat later in the evening. Our waitress Mellisa was pleasant and worked quickly to get us what we needed."
Judith D.,"Shelton, CT",1,4,,3.0,10/6/2014,Always had good food and good service at this one. Until tonight when the food gave me food poisoning. It's really disappointing too because I did actually like this place and I probably won't go back for a really long because of this.
Patty W.,"Hamden, CT",0,13,,4.0,7/15/2015,"The bistro shrimp pasta dish was delicious, but the shrimp were overdone. This dish would've been even better if the shrimp were sautéed instead of deep fried in batter."
Zippy C.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,4,,4.0,8/22/2014,"I was SOOOOO excited for this chain to come near me so I could go, it had been almost 25 years since my friend married in California. I was WAY early as it was tax free week in Trumbull, CT and prime lunch time. They sat me 10 minutes after I got there even though my other two members weren't there yet. (MUCH appreciated) and I nursed an Iced Tea for 20 minutes.Two servers watched me the whole time and then again once they arrived and again, until we were ready.  (MUCH appreciated). A welcome gift, SOURDOUGH bread, and WARM! The menu is like a book, you really need 20 minutes to even look through the food, if you want a drink, there's another 10. They have something to please every craving, Chinese, Mexican, American, like HUNDREDS of options including diet/""Skinny"". We started with Fried Zucchini and Fire Cracker Shrimp.  Both were good. 4/5. Entrees were Skinny Shrimp Tacos, BBQ Ranch Chix Salad and 1/2 portion of Shrimp Scampi w/ tomato. We ended with the Coconut Choc Chip Cheesecake.  We were stuffed, but it was pricey, thus the non 5 star rating. The staff was very nice and well trained. I am sorry for those that went at the first opening and got bad service.   I will give this place a 5 star when I go and I don't spend $100 for 3 people for lunch. Even though this place isn't really overpriced that much."
Kelly A.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",0,5,,1.0,10/25/2014,Doesnt even deserve a star. Long wait. They said it would be 40 minutes and it was over 2 hours. Very disappointing
Dave K.,"Hamden, CT",0,28,2,1.0,9/29/2014,"Not impressed at all. The long wait for Cheesecake Factory to arrive and after one visit, im dont. Food was average at best, service was poor. Over priced for a below average experience and average food."
Vanessa P.,"Torrington, CT",1,10,2,4.0,8/19/2015,"Delicious food!!! Salads are amazing, drinks are amazing, and of course the cheesecake is out of this world!!"
Ralph B.,"Trumbull, CT",0,27,3,2.0,8/28/2014,"We have enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory in other locations, but were disappointed with our family's first visit to the new Trumbull site.  There was a minimal wait that evening to be seated, which was a pleasant departure from typical one hour waits at the company's restaurants.  Unfortunately, we were repeatedly reminded by our servers just how busy they were and left waiting for long periods to order our food and be served.  When a dinner arrived with the wrong side vegetable, the server dismissively insisted it was correct (it was not) and added that the desired vegetable would require an additional charge.  Another server arrived a moment later with our remaining order and immediately agreed it was the wrong side vegetable and promptly replaced it.  We subsequently ordered 3 deserts to go and after an interminable wait of more than twenty minutes opted to cancel that order rather than to continue to wait.  A manager came over to apologize and explain how incredibly busy the bakery was from many walk-in orders.  She described a perplexing process where despite our being a customer at the restaurant for the past hour, upon ordering our desert we were now at the mercy of a ticketing queue in the bakery.  She suggested there was nothing she could do about the wait and offered absolutely nothing else (e.g. free desert; some discount upon a return visit; etc.) for our inconvenience. This is unacceptable and much better service and response is expected given that dining for a family of four at the restaurant is not inexpensive."
Jen J.,"Stratford, CT",38,12,6,1.0,8/14/2014,I would have given 0 stars. My food was not cooked- raw hamburger.   Other food was cold.  Service was very very slow. So disappointing!
Anonymous S.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,12,2,1.0,2/23/2015,Ugh! The food was incredibly bland! I NEVER salt my food- but this was sooo disappointing... I normally loveeee the Cheesecake Factory for the flavor of their dishes more so then the infamous cheesecakes. I think I'll have to stick to the White Plains location-which sucks because this was pretty close to home.
Chrissy N.,"Wanskuck, Providence, RI",0,9,1,1.0,8/23/2014,"Awful. I was very excited for a Cheesecake factory to open near me and it was extremely disappointing and frustrating. Food took over 1hr and 15min to get to us after ordering, and we were there for 30 min prior to ordering."
Hannah W.,"Fairfield, CT",0,5,,5.0,4/23/2015,"My favorite place to eat when I'm in the mall. Louisiana chicken pasta & chicken di pans are the best. The food is a little pricey but I get what I pay for & more. The staff is very nice, always gets a warm hello from the hostesses & my servers so far have been great! I recommend asking for Lori, Stacy or Azzalee! We had an issue with our check but one of the managers came over & took care of everything. The only bad thing is that the floors can get quite dirty but I usually notice that when ok weekend nights only when it's crazy busy. & I don't recommend going there weekend nights with a big group, you'll be looking at a long wait. I've witnessed a lot of people get crazy because they're are 5 mins over there wait. It's not that serious lol that's why they say ABOUT xx mins."
Minna B.,"Ansonia, CT",41,1,,1.0,2/3/2015,"So, brought my son there for his 20th bday.   We ordered srinks and our seerver came back after ten mins thats its another 10 mins then when we got out drinks mine was soo strong and my friends was all juice and let. Me add, we ordered the same drink.  Then the food.  OMG really.  Chicken marsala. NOT. Had it taken off my bl. The food in 1 word SUCKED....  Never willi I ever eat at the Cheesecake Factory again.. it sucked from beginning to end.  Oh, let me say, been in this business over 30  yrs. Yuck gross food. And they wont take reservations, we waited over an hour for crap food. Our server was ok though. Tell them to introduce them selves..... night."
Bob F.,"Shelton, CT",0,4,,3.0,9/10/2014,"Our first visit to this new location and it was very chaotic. At first they tried to seat us at a table too small for us, then made us wait more for a bigger booth. After waiting 500 years for our food it was all messed up. Maybe they should turn down the music in there like other locations do! The guy didn't even speak english so getting him to understand what was wrong was already impossible let alone the loud music too. However Mary was very attentive, she said absolutely a lot but was kind. Three stars is being generous. If you want a quieter area ask to sit outside or in the mall seating."
