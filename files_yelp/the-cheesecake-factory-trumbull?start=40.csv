Missy S.,"Shelton, CT",0,86,39,5.0,2/4/2017,"Great location, great staff, amazing food. Beautiful decor. Can eat here on a date, with the family, or just for fun! The food is delicious and the cheesecake is to die for. Gets very busy but that's a good thing."
Bob R.,"Trumbull, CT",0,10,2,3.0,9/27/2016,"This chain restaurant is located in a busy mall. There is very ample and very comfortable seating inside as well as a small outdoor patio dining area which is nice. The décor and the overall ambiance gives this place an upscale feel and the entire staff is friendly and attentive. But while the place has an upscale look and vibe, it is really just your average chain restaurant with good PR. However, that good PR makes their prices a bit steeper than places like an Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday's. The appetizers here average around $10.50 and the main dishes around $19.00. For two people each ordering an appetizer, main dish, beverage and one dessert to split, you can easily drop $60-$75 per person before the tip. If you order alcohol, jack that price up much higher. As for the food itself. Let's start with the menu. It is 20 pages long! You have so much to choose from the decision is staggering. I have been there half a dozen times and tried something different each time. At that rate it may well take a few hundred visits to put even a dent in the menu. Whatever you're in the mood for, you can find something here. The quality of the food is good to very good. The preparation and presentation are excellent. The portions are a bit on the smallish side compared to other chains, especially when you consider the price, but they are still enough to enjoy adequately, though you will have room for dessert (that may be the point). Some negatives, if you go at peak days/times, you might have quite a wait, it could be an hour. I have only had a wait on one trip, it was 25 minutes. Another inconsistency is the prep time to get your meal. I have had a meal arrive anywhere from 15 minutes to over 35 minutes from the time of ordering, and it did not seem to matter if the place was busy or not with the longer waits. Now let's get to the part where this place simply shines; the desserts! As their name implies, this place has the most amazing and decadent selection of cheesecakes you can possibly imagine, and then some. A full three pages of the menu is dedicated to their cheesecakes, specialty desserts, specialty coffees, iced and frozen drinks ice cream creations and shakes. If you have a sweet tooth, you will think you have died and gone to sugar heaven! And the prices are very reasonable, much more so than their regular menu items, averaging $7.50 per item. You can also buy whole cheesecakes from their display cases. The dessert portions are generous too. One piece of cheesecake is more than enough for one person, and can be split between two and still give each of you enough to enjoy. I love cheesecake in general and this place makes them an art. I have had theirs on three of my trips, though I am not normally one for dessert. Bottom line is the food is on average, very good, the portions a bit smallish, but if you include dessert, you will not leave hungry. The service from the staff is excellent and the desserts exceptional. They are quite pricey on the food and beverages for a chain retaurant, but great on the desserts. The wait times to be seated or served are hit and miss. If it were up to me alone, I would only go here for the desserts and have my meal at another, less costly chain, but my girlfriend loves the place and she's worth the extra cost."
Mckalia W.,"Hollywood, FL",0,5,,1.0,10/30/2017,the place really bad the truth expected otherwise the meal was unpleasantly unpleasant we went to celebrate the birthday of a friend as a family and we really expected another quality of service and even attention food my mother spends all night after going out to eat from here and the truth we had another idea of ​​what could become Cheesecake Factory A Horrible Experience if you can avoid it do not go or come here.
Michael D.,"Cedar Rapids, IA",1062,92,270,2.0,6/27/2016,"I would like to start of with saying that their food is always amazing! It's always what you expect and if not, better. With that being said, the service is HORRIBLE! Idk if it's just the service on the patio or what. I always sit on the patio. We had appetizers, which were amazing. While we were eating our appetizers, our entrees came out. They should've timed it better. My veggie burger was supposed to come with a salad. You would think that my salad would come out first or at least at the same time as my burger. It came out about 5 minutes after my burger came out. It was irritating. And the waitress's phone kept ringing and she didn't even notice. And we had to keep asking for refills on our water. This might just be a patio thing, but I'm not sure. I love their food and vegan options, but get so irritated with the service. This happens every time."
Monique R.,"New Haven, CT",27,26,15,1.0,6/28/2017,"Last night our family decided to eat at the Cheesecake Factory in Trumbull.  This experience was very disappointing.  We did not mind the 50 minute wait to be seated.  Our server Erma was very attentive and polite.  What was disappointing was the long wait from the time we were seated to the time we received our food.  The quality of the food was horrible.  I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya and had to send it back because the pasta was under cook.  The waitress stated that the manager will come over and speak to us but she never came over.  My niece ordered the chicken Alfredo and was not happy with her choice.  We ordered desert and that was an additional 25 minute wait.  When we received our check, Erma stated that my meal and beverage was comp by the manager.  In actuality, we were charged for a extra Cajun Jambalaya.  We had to wait for the extra meal to be taken off our bill.  Best part of meal was the iced green tea."
Jon B.,"Shelton, CT",0,14,,2.0,2/20/2017,"This poor rating is reflective of the drink prices not being posted in the menu. Wow, what a shock when the bill came. Really disappointed that the restaurant would intentionally mislead it's customers just to make an extra buck. Too bad because the food and service was ok. They lost a customer today...."
Tiffany C.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,4,,2.0,2/19/2017,"This will my last time at this location the ladies at the register always have a attitude, one time they forgot to put my order thru and I was on lunch break I had to wait for them to put it through again. I went there again today it took them 45 mins to make pancakes smh never again."
Efrain E.,"Waterbury, CT",17,40,35,1.0,10/24/2016,The waitress said they didn't have the ingredients to make 2 different things I ordered. Are you kidding me?So I ordered something I didn't really want. The food was terrible. Rice wasn't cooked all the way. The staff are either to young or inexperienced to provide the quality of service I've had at other The Cheesecake Factory locations. The restroom toilet was broken with parts of it in the toilet bowl.  This is the ghettoest cheesecake factory I've ever been too. The waitress was nice. She tried so I left her a big tip but I'll never be back.
Pamela J.,"NoHo, Manhattan, NY",76,727,604,3.0,8/21/2014,"LO,FL over my photo.  Restaurant has only been open 2.5 weeks and silverware is bent.  Yes, there are totally kinks as other people have mentioned, but this is the Cheesecake Factory people.  What do you expect?  Consistent food, consistent service and a consistent atmosphere.  I know I'll get the same yummy dishes here as I will in Cali or in Florida.  Thank god they opened in Trumbull, CT, thank God! And, for the first time ever I tried their gluten free options.  Very, very pleasing."
Marie K.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,22,6,4.0,10/28/2016,"As usual,  food was good.  The fried calamari was VERY salty.  Our server was Mylene (spelling),  she was great!  She was Friendly,  polite,  and very competent.  Enjoyed my lunch and service."
Mushfiq M.,"Hamden, CT",124,4,1,4.0,1/1/2017,The relatively new outside seating arrangement in front of uniqlo is very nice.  Comfortable chairs.  The Jamaican black pepper shrimp on the menu is a perennial favorite. One bad change to that menu item is the replacement of the mango salsa with pineapple. That's a big noticeable change for the worse. Being the mango salsa back please
Damon R.,"Wallingford Center, CT",32,16,18,3.0,1/23/2016,"This was our 2nd time at the Trumbull location. Very short wait to get a table, our waiter was fantastic! We had Thai lettuce wraps that were very good but for a $13 appetizer they were cheap on the chicken and sauces.Bang Bang chicken and shrimp was very good. Chicken picotta was very good. We complained to the waiter on the large amount of ice in our marguerita's and the small little glass , we each drank 4  because they were so small. Godiva cheesecake was oh so good! Sorry Cheesecake Factory you only get 3 stars for being cheap with the chicken and excessive ice in your drinks."
Intellectual Reviews I.,"Bridgeport, CT",62,76,200,4.0,1/14/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a place for good food and dessert. Never a let down. Just by myself for one glass of wine and a chicken and mash potato dinner, the cost was 28 dollars and change. Was it worth the price to come back often? No, the prices are about 3-4 dollars extra for entrees and 2 dollars extra on glasses of wine. Otherwise I would be a regular here at the Cheesecake Factory. I have them 4 out of 5 stars because their food is great, but just a bit pricey for middle class standards."
Robert K.,"Milford, CT",206,367,22,1.0,1/12/2015,"Seemingly in an effort to maximize square footage and maximize every last cent of revenue, this Cheesecake Factory location installed an ""outdoor"" patio, complete with wicker dining furniture, umbrellas, and faux plant life. The catch? It's not outside. It's in the mall causeway.  Nothing like the smells and sounds of bustling suburban retail along with the bright antiseptic glow of fluorescent lighting to accompany a fine meal.  They've really redefined ""al fresco"". How progressive. We came to Cheesecake Factory to spend a gift card. My memories of Cheesecake Factory were mostly on the positive side. A large, mostly competent menu of items at a slightly higher quality level than Applebee's or Chili's, in a space slightly more adorned with high ceilings and a templatized attempted at ornate.  But that's just it. This is faux fine dining, just as the patio was faux outdoor dining. It's all a ruse until you eat the food. And I guess the average mall goer that stumbles in here leaves impressed, at least judging by the long waits. But maybe it's just the effect of marketing, decor, the illusion of ""fancy"". The sad thing is, for the prices you pay here you can eat at a much more competent, honest, locally owned restaurant. The food and service will likely be better, and you'll be supporting a local business. But while much better local restaurants struggle on a Sunday night, this place was booming.  When we asked to be moved from the stale air of the then-closed mall corridor, the staff seemed annoyed. But here's the thing: it's customary to ask if you have a preference between outdoor and indoor before being seated, even if the outdoor space is fake. Service was satisfactory, but did not match the formal attire that servers don.  The food was very disappointing all around. The allegedly spicy Louisiana Chicken Pasta was bland, with dry breaded chicken. The Chicken Enchiladas tasted nothing like Mexican food, almost as if they were topped with canned tomato sauce with a sickly sweet taste we couldn't place. Everything tasted clearly reheated, further proven by the too-hot-to-touch plate of the enchiladas. These taste like frozen microwave entrees, in huge portions, carefully plated. The menu tries to be everything for everyone with hundreds of items, serving the ""Factory"" moniker well, but one must wonder how much of it is successful.  The cheesecake with strawberries was the one positive, but our enthusiasm waned when we realized the center was frozen. And that dinner perfectly sums up the proposition of Cheesecake Factory. It's all presentation, and from a financial standpoint, it works.  You just have to wonder from the fake patio and frozen cheesecake whether they care that we can now see the strings."
Jessica L.,"Trumbull, CT",0,9,1,2.0,12/20/2016,I had an awful experience here and haven't been back since. The food was not appetizing at all and I had to wait half an hour just to return my dish because the waitress seemed to just disappear. What I can say is that the manager at the time was very helpful and apologized for our experience.
Sara B.,"Bridgeport, CT",188,170,652,2.0,2/21/2015,"This is my third time in a Cheesecake Factory, and my first time at this location. I have to say that I don't really care for it. We waited about an hour to get a table on a Friday night. The food was okay. I tried to order somewhat healthy and got the skinnylicious chicken tacos. They were just okay. The cheesecake is pretty good, but to me it's not at all worth the hype and long wait."
Janice S.,"West Haven, CT",0,7,,2.0,6/8/2017,"If you read this, CF, know I will not return and it's mainly because of the exorbitant price of your coffee!! Really, 3.25 for a small cup??? Did Juan deliver the beans?? And, while I'm at it, a glass of soda for the same price? I could buy a 6-pack!  Cheesecake slice, 7.95.  Nope, will not return.  There are many other choices out there."
Allison W.,"Stratford, CT",84,31,4,2.0,8/16/2016,"Is what it is...nothing too special here. Chain food, slow service and probably seated in the worst booth on the planet. Probably won't be back, 60$ lunch could have been at a 10x better place."
Lamar J.,"Bridgeport, CT",50,122,170,1.0,10/13/2014,"Service to say the least is horrible Waited almost 20 minutes for our buffalo blast which were cooked way to long..... Ask for water 10 minutes ago, still waiting. The floors are beyond slippery they must mop with old grease.  Are waiter was friendly(just super slow) I've been to this chain from whiteplains new York to Miami Florida and never had an issue, try it once 5 minutes away from home and it horrible. This review will be sent to there Corporate office asap, with more extensive details. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. Ruby Tuesday next door has much better service. Bad bad bad choice"
Dominique M.,"Hamden, CT",1,2,,2.0,10/18/2015,"45 minutes for 2 half-loaves of cold, hard bread!! Let's just start there. Now that I got that out, I have to say that I really tried my hardest to give our waiter all of the patience I could muster up while serving us, but he just couldn't cut it. Beside the bread (did I mention that it took 45 minutes!?), the COMPLETELY uncooked rice (rolling around on the plate), and complete disregard for my extravagant request to help me celebrate my sister's birthday (while exactly 9 other poorly executed ""happy birthday"" numbers rang out), I graciously allotted two stars to this place because they managed to get my Chicken Costoletta right.....for the most part."
