Isis G.,"Bridgeport, CT",30,17,26,4.0,4/29/2016,Delusions fast clean friendly staff how ever s little crowded due to it being in the mall.
Evan P.,"Trumbull, CT",0,5,1,1.0,9/5/2016,"Wouldn't take Samsung pay (credit card via phone) or wouldnt take my credit card numbers, had to be a physical card. Just lost a customer."
Chris C.,"Trumbull, CT",0,22,2,2.0,9/20/2015,"Long lines. I went there and enjoyed the beet and goat cheese salad which was pretty good. The cheese cake was good. Nothing great.  Second and third time I've gone, I got food poisoning.  I refuse to get anything other than drinks or cheesecake there now.  Nothing I had there was worth the price and the menu is the size of a novel. Nothing is fresh.  Not a fan."
Jon S.,"Bridgeport, CT",278,30,19,3.0,3/1/2016,"The desserts stand out more than their menu items. I usually order the red velvet cheesecake which is always perfect- slices of moist red velvet cake wedged between smooth cheesecake.  The last time I ordered a burger, the meat was dry and the Mac and cheese that comes with it was crumbly and mushed together. The vegetable tempura ""fries"" was delicious though. If anything stick to their pasta. The service at this location is just like any other Cheesecake Factory- long wait time and even longer service time."
Lorri F.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,12,15,1.0,4/7/2016,"The food is horrible, ordered well done hamburger with  mushrooms and it was raw.  Mushrooms were horrible  too."
Noel P.,"Trumbull, CT",56,65,51,2.0,5/13/2016,Overpriced and not that good. LOVE the cuban rolls thats it !!When it first opened it was slightly better but why i  give it two stars is because of the nasty nasty staff in place right now!!    When they first opened i had never had a bad experience until recent months. Hostesses and whoever answers phones for take outs should be fired! Wish i knew who spoke to me the way they did one time while i was placing a take out order... they left me on hold for over 10 minutes then I called back and when she asked me to hold again I told her I was waiting while and I needed to place my order.  she was extremely rude to me and  reprimanded me that she had other customers and placed me on hold again!!! I drove all the way to the mall and still on hold walked into the Cheesecake Factory with my phone on hold and they were all standing around talking doing nothing no other customers in sight !!! The worst part was there phone line was ringing and they were all ignoring it.
Sean T.,"Norwalk, CT",2,16,24,2.0,9/14/2015,"First let me say that I do love Cheesecake Factory but NOT this one!! Trumbull Mall has the worst one I ever been to. The Service was terrible but lets get to the food situation. I ordered the Shrimp scampi which was bland with barely any taste. My wife order the Jamaican black pepper shrimp which they forgot the plantains!! Then the waiter said sorry and went to put the order in, they NEVER came out, he came back to us 3 times asking if they came and each time was NO they didn't. Her dish was also bland and shrimp overcooked. Please avoid this particular Cheesecake Factory unless you want bland food and ok service!!"
Laura Z.,"Shelton, CT",1,167,196,2.0,2/27/2017,"The  so called ""skinnylicious"" menu is still very fattening and bad for you. There are no healthy choices here. The cheese cake slices are standard. The best would have to be the classic cheesecake with strawberries on top. Overall a average place. There's also always a really long line to get in and it's really crowded and noisy. The bread they give you tastes good though, better than most entrees dishes they have here"
Jodi J.,"Easton, CT",0,17,,2.0,12/4/2016,When they first opened the food was very good but it has since gone die hill. Service is slow and food subpar. I went to the one at the Trumbull mall and I would have had a better meal at the food court.
Craig S.,"Shelton, CT",2,31,1,1.0,6/21/2016,"Similar to Noel P, I just waited on hold to place takeout order for 5 minutes, hung up, called back saying that I was on hold for 5, without apology was told they'd get someone, before holding another 5 minutes and hanging up again.  The same thing happened a few months ago before getting lucky on the 3rd try.  Taking phone orders isn't that hard... this place desperately needs new management."
Melissa R.,"Ansonia, CT",0,12,15,3.0,5/30/2016,"No wait for two people which was great. Our waiter was friendly, though there was a language barrier. We ordered the artichoke and crab dip that was so salty we couldn't finish it--way to much old bay; the beet and goat cheese salad was tasty but literally had a single piece of beet on it; and the sweet corn tamale cakes were actually pretty good. We decided not to stay for an entree, left a nice tip and went home. We will not be going back."
Andreas S.,"Bridgeport, CT",46,22,18,5.0,2/6/2016,Near disaster coming in the door. However the professionalism shown by the manager Jonathan and great service by our server Tara saved the evening. As always food outstanding. Will continue to be a happy and repeat customer!
Jagmeet S.,"Trumbull, CT",332,36,,5.0,2/2/2016,"Always a fan of this place. It's smaller than other CCF's I have been to but none the less its the real deal. Staff is super nice, and its better than going to weschester to get some amazing cheese cake.  Fav Dish: Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp Fav Cheese Cake: Bananna."
Diane W.,"Shelton, CT",0,1,1,4.0,1/26/2017,The Food at The cheesecakefactory is sooo delicious. WE like it so much. And The staff is also very friendly. WE just moved Here from Germany and The Next Time WE will go there for Dinner very often :)))
Annemarie M.,"Trumbull, CT",0,18,,3.0,1/5/2017,"The organization of the restaurant has been spotty.  We have been ignored with the place half empty and not been assigned a waiter after sitting down.  We have sat in the bar and had 5 staff talking with no service because "" no one was assigned the table. "". The food is good in terms of quality but management seems to be poor."
Kimberly V.,"Trumbull, CT",25,4,,4.0,8/9/2016,"We have eaten at this restaurant numerous times (Trumbull and White Plains, NY).  Food is always fantastic, portions large, service impeccable.  My only complaint is they don't take reservations.  You can call on but there is still a line.  My favorites besides their cheesecakes and rhe fact that they always put warm fresh bread on the table....skinnylicious menu, their endive salad and Shepard Pie."
Rich A.,"Ansonia, CT",15,277,121,4.0,5/22/2016,"We finally decided to use gift certificates that we were given for Christmas several years ago. I wasn't expecting anything exciting, just basic.The place was very busy to begin with. We had to wait for 30 minutes so we walked around the mall. When I opened the menu I was overwhelmed by the extensive list of choices. I kept saying to myself with all of these choices how can the food be any good. It was a long time before we finally got glasses of water and then awhile more before our wine arrived. We wanted to start with the ricotta and meatballs appetizer but after placing the order Lauren came back and said they were out so we decided on the roasted pear and blue cheese flat bread. It arrived and the pears did not look roasted and were cut in large chunks(should have been much much smaller or thinly sliced) but overall it had good flavor. Bread never came to the table and we didn't think to ask until we were half way done with the meals. Oh and another thing it took forever to get utensils and napkins. We had to use the cocktail napkin with the appetizer. I ordered the Shepard's pie with apprehension but have not had it in ages and was curious. It was actually really good, I was very surprised for a chain restaurant to make it very tasty. My other half had the chicken marsala and he said it had good flavor but needed more sauce and wished the pasta had been cooked a bit more. I was hoping the lemon cake was on the dessert menu because I had it several years ago at the Fort Lauderdale location and thought it was good. They changed it a bit but it was still quite good. My other half had the dulce de leche cheesecake and enjoyed it very much. Overall not a bad experience but service was lacking and needs to be fixed. We were supposed to get refills on the water and that never happened. Someone is not doing their job."
Monye R.,"Bridgeport, CT",104,1,3,4.0,11/13/2015,The Cheesecake Factory was a beautiful experience. It was my first time at the one here in Trumbull. Service was courteous and timely .
Chris C.,"Plymouth, MA",0,24,2,2.0,4/22/2016,"Seated and waited on promptly. The waitress was nice. We ordered 2 orders of the filet mignon both were supposed to be cooked med but we're well done with the burnt taste ruining them both but mashed potatoes were good. Also ordered the Chicken Madeira with Steak Diane combo. The steak was good and cooked correct but the chicken was disgusting, it tasted exactly like a burnt omelette. The mashed potatoes were good. I would not return."
Brian C.,"North Haven, CT",36,11,7,5.0,12/2/2016,"We had a Great Family Dinner last night. The meal was fantastic and our waitress was Amazing. Her name is Carressa and I would recommend you ask for her when you arrive. She is friendly, kind and caring. We usually do not order dessert, but how can you pass up the Cheesecake. All 3 choices were Perfect!!"
