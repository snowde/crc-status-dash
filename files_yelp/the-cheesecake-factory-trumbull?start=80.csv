Jay M.,"Trumbull, CT",0,15,6,3.0,8/8/2014,"TCF is always good, albeit expensive.  Consistent with something for everyone as well as the cheesecakes and dessert.  This is a new, small location opened 8/5 and it's clear they are being careful with service (buddy training) and food taking longer than usual but service is attentive as you would and should expect at this price point. Oh and like most CAKE's I have been too long lines are guaranteed unless you go before 4:30 for dinner. I look forward to a more quieter Sunday brunch starting at 10am... A solid 3.5; if service faster 4...."
J B.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,14,,2.0,9/4/2016,"Save your time and money.  Very disorganized at the hostess station, waiter was attentive and tried best to do a good job.  Food is mediocre at best.  2 people in our party immediately had to use the bathroom after eating.   For the price paid go to a nice non corporate restaurant"
J T.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,7,1,1.0,2/20/2016,"Went there with my wife Feb 13, thought we would skip the Valentines day crowd. 117 minutes later we get a text. (Yeah 117 minutes after being told a 90 minute wait time) What a disappointment service was slow, food was subpar at best not to mention overpriced. Steak was ordered medium. We got the charred version. We just wanted to get out. My advice... Go somewhere else, avoid the headache."
Francesca L.,"Fairfield, CT",0,12,2,2.0,10/30/2016,"Ok, let's start here: the smell is disgusting. So gross. Over the summer, after a long day of shopping at the mall, me, my mom, my sister, my grandmother, my aunt and cousin decided to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. We walk in and it's PACKED. We say how many people we are and ask about the wait. They said about 45 mins to an hour. Ok. We have nothing else better to do anyway.  We wait and wait and wait. Then, I went with my sister into the bathroom, and lo and behold, there was VOMIT everywhere. Chunky vomit. And no one was cleaning it up. We high tail it outta there and wait some more. We finally get a table and order. I got enchiladas from the ""healthy"" menu. They tasted like armpits. Then it was time for the cheesecake, probably the best part of this whole dinner. Me and my sister got the peanut butter cheesecake and it was So. Good. That was the only thing saving that experience tbh. Not the best."
Kim H.,"Trumbull, CT",87,38,3,2.0,3/30/2016,The bartenders think that the bar is a dividing wall that customers cannot hear beyond. One asked me if I was waiting for takeout and then turned away (service bartender). Customers don't wish to be party to their banter while trying to enjoy my dinner and get some work done. The soup was over-seasoned and I sent it back. No apologies from the bartender Phylicia. Thumbs down.
Corinne C.,"Hamden, CT",7,17,16,2.0,12/1/2014,"The food was great and plentiful. Service was friendly, but sooooooo incredibly slow. 25 minutes after ordering before the first kid's drink arrive. 10 more minutes before the next 2 were delivered. (If you're a mom, you know this is not Ok...) We preordered the birthday cheesecake earlier in the day so it would be ready after dinner. We finished dinner, requested our cakes, and it took an additional 40 minutes before they brought the cakes out for us to sing happy birthday. It was unsliced, so they brought it back to the kitchen and 10 minutes later we were final having dessert.  This was on a Monday night. I can't fathom how bad it is on the weekend. I know lots of people enjoy The Cheescake Factory, but it's just not for me. Give yourself at least 2.5-3 hours if you plan to eat here."
Vivian M.,"West Haven, CT",0,25,378,3.0,7/21/2015,The cheese cakes are the best. Their food is just okay. Pasta is too greasy. We ordered two dishes for two of us but could not finish at all. The setting is quite new and modern but it smells a little.
Yanna S.,"Norwalk, CT",132,49,39,2.0,12/29/2015,I think they have way too much stuff going on w the menu- The food I ordered seemed like it was something frozen they threw in the microwave and then buried it in too much butter. It's overpriced in every way . Mixed drinks are weak and watered down for $12.00 each! Won't go back.
Rachel I.,"Seymour, CT",0,3,1,1.0,11/14/2016,"I had what was quite possibly the worst dining experience of my life at this restaurant a week ago. I wrote an email to their corporate office, expecting some sort of response before the week was through. Instead, I have heard nothing. Staff was rude. Food took over an hour and a half to come out. Order was wrong when it arrived. Waitress never returned to table. Manager tried to placate us with ice cream. To boot, I paid $60 for a mediocre dinner. I'll be taking my business elsewhere and I would suggest you do too!!"
Kelsey W.,"Trumbull, CT",48,9,,5.0,1/31/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a good option especially when you are craving sweets. Their food is very good, although sometimes a little pricey, but I always get their famous cheesecake which is worth every penny. Most of the times I have visited here I have just gone with friends and order cheesecake and drinks. I have never had a long wait either (but have only gone during non-busy times) and the staff is always friendly."
Luis R.,"Norwalk, CT",87,2,,5.0,3/26/2016,Went to The Cheesecake Factory weeks ago with my daughter and her mother on a busy Weekend night. Had a fun experience and our waitress Georgia was very nice and attentive. Great service overall and made us feel very welcome. The food was flavorful as always and the drinks were well made. I'm sure we'll be visiting again soon.
Kendra D.,"Stamford, CT",0,2,1,1.0,12/9/2014,"I've been to the cheesecake factory many times in different states.  I enjoy the food and desserts.  However for such a busy and well established company you would think this establishment would have the option to make reservations for large parties.  I came with a large party (13 plus)  after 6pm and had to wait 30 minutes to get seated.  This could have been avoided had the option to make reservations been available.  This is totally unacceptable and unprofessional, how can such a big chain no accept reservation at mall location where it's extremely business."
Shannon S.,"Hamden, CT",91,40,,4.0,3/6/2016,Cheesecake Factory as usual has giant portions of yummy food. The wait is always insane so go before you get hungry. The wait will help you power through your meal and have leftovers for later.
Meggan A.,"Branford, CT",249,243,88,4.0,9/15/2014,"Standard Cheesecake Factory location. I thought it was common knowledge that they're known for their long menus and long waits, are people really complaining about this? CF is packed regardless of where it's located, so I would expect to wait an hour or so for a table, longer if you're going during peak times. Why not peruse through their 18 page long menu while you're waiting an hour for a table? Kill two birds with one stone.  This location gets an extra half star for having a text messaging system to notify you when your table is ready, and another half star for being attached to the mall. This means I can shop while I wait, therefore it doesn't feel like a wait. If I don't want/need to shop, I just go to Target (also in the mall) because c'mon, you always need to grab something from Target. Again, use your noggin' here, y'all.  Food is well above average for a chain restaurant, service is always friendly (and the one time our food was taking a while to come out, we were proactively offered comped dessert due to the wait), and I've never been unhappy with a meal here. My personal favorite is their ahi carpaccio, which I'm guilty of ordering as my meal every time we go here. Give me all of the ahi tuna!"
Michael S.,"New Haven, CT",0,3,,1.0,11/17/2014,"This is the Cheesecake Factory, and they ran out of the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake... Also, my friend's plate was hotter than the food. Not impressed. Over priced food for a mass amount of mediocre food. This restaurant is located in a mall, stop trying to be more than that."
Ryan W.,"Trumbull, CT",0,12,,2.0,7/26/2016,"There are better options. Mediocre, overpriced food from a diner-sized menu. Their cheesecakes are good (if a bit decadent), but I wouldn't recommended going for a full meal."
Chris S.,"Miami Beach, FL",143,45,50,4.0,12/27/2015,"Pretty interesting first time experience at the Cheesecake Factory.  I felt like I was in Las Vegas at a buffet with the design of the resturant and the huge diversity of culture. The place was absolutely packed yet service was still very good, even from the trainee Leon, who may have been better than our actual waitress. But now writing this review, when it comes down to it, it was still just mass produced chain restaurant food. Huge menu, great service, just didn't have that homemade feel."
Anna L.,"Fairfield, CT",75,99,18,2.0,6/12/2016,"Horribly unhealthy, crazy portioned food. This is a classic example of typical  ""American"" cuisine. Huge portions. A mountain of sodium and sugar per serving. The plus side is: convenience. It's a chain so certain standards such as decor and music are standardized by corporate. I am not a fan of chain restaurants and this is why: you cannot maintain the same quality of food when you have hundreds of locations. Quality is reduced to increase revenue. Cheesecake Factory is no exception. Contributing to the obesity epidemic with monstrous portions and lack of fresh ingredients is not a restaurant I want to support. If your with a big group of people who want to eat and want to eat big, this is the place to do it. Happy Hour is also pretty decent with half priced appetizers and discounted drinks. Although the drinks are watered down. Come here for CONVENIENCE. Nothing more. If this is your favorite place and you can't live without it, venture out more."
K C.,"Shelton, CT",0,6,3,1.0,8/2/2016,"I went at ""happy hour"" with a friend, had to ask for ""happy hour"" menu and was told they don't offer any specials on drinks. Isn't that the point of a happy hour ? So I ordered a drink regardless (none of the drinks have prices next to them on the menu) and was appalled to see my bill at the end ... The drink was $12. I would have payed less at the casino !"
Bre'vard S.,"Bridgeport, CT",9,7,,1.0,9/3/2014,Ok tonight I was very dissapointed in the Ccf my fries was cold as well as my sliders luke warm I sent the fries back delt with the chicken. My dinner mate came out with no sause on her pasta then after she ate what she could and opt to take her food home the waiter throw it away. They comp the cheese cake but it wasn't the cheese cake that got thrown away  Very dissapointed tonight
