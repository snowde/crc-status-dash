Kirsten D.,"Tucson, AZ",188,368,846,5.0,12/19/2017,"I'm not normally a big fan of chain restaurants, but we had the BEST service the other night from William G!  Let's face it, if you go to a restaurant the wait staff can make or break the experience, regardless of how the food tastes. I was impressed from the start.  William was the perfect amount of kind, attentive (but not annoying), observant, and just plain great!!! The food was great as well. I opted for the skinnylicious vegetable salad (saving my calories for cheesecake, duh!). It was soooo tasty. The BF went for the fish tacos tempura style. Not sure why he'd order that at a place like this, but he loved them. The portions were humongous.  We had the s'mores cheesecake and the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake because we are both on diets and this fit right in. (See food diet of course)  All in all we had a great experience here!"
Keith M.,"Flowing Wells, Tucson, AZ",70,4,1,2.0,8/22/2017,I was not to impressed... Food was ok. A little pricey.  The cheesecake was good. our server was not as friendly maybe having a bad day???  we'll give it one more shot.
Jason G.,"Saint Cloud, FL",1,40,71,4.0,7/29/2017,Ate here about a month ago.  Excellent food and service this time.  New avocado bread app. Awesome.  New Thai chicken cashew dish. Absolutely my favorite new dish.  Fantastic waitress.  Feels great to give a good review this time.
Ahsan R.,"Spring, TX",126,187,343,5.0,1/8/2018,I don't frequent chain restaurants but this time was a great experience. Went for lunch and all the servers were great. The food we got ( fish entree with mashed potatoes and French toast) was delicious. No cheesecake this time since we were  full due to the large portions.
Andy M.,"Oro Valley, AZ",1,56,32,4.0,1/8/2018,"I wanna say I go to this place about three times a week. Their service, food quality, cleanliness and presentation is always on point. Consistent, all the time!  they're Caesar salad is cold, crispy and refreshing. I recommend you add grilled or crispy chicken to that. Their pastas are well worth the cash and their portions are way bigger than other ""pasta gardens"". I only wish their salad was complimentary but hey, I can't get everything I want lol. Their Cuban sandwhich is legit, their Cajun is pasta is  . Their salmon with mash and asparagus is fire! Their chicken costalleta is to die for. Lightly breaded chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus...Mmmm....and to top it off, banana cheesecake is the way to go.. ask for strawberries or caramel drizzle!"
Mina M.,"Tucson, AZ",0,10,7,1.0,11/6/2017,"Unfortunately one star because nothing was okay last night!! Service was very slow even tho they weren't busy! Drinks were way over priced ($14 for a regular margarita?!) our food came cold and nasty looking seems like there were just put in microwave n reheated, my over cooked pasta was so sticky and my 4 jumbo shrimp top of it were too cold and dry! I told the server the food is not ok when she asked me if I like the food but she never bring the supervisor to the table to take care of the situation any way we couldn't finish the food!  After we got home me and my husband felt bloated and sick ! Never go back n don't recommend to anyone to go there unless you don't mind to pay to get sick! Very disappointed bad service bad food!"
Nesha P.,"Tucson, AZ",21,123,37,4.0,11/21/2017,"The bread and butter is probably my favorite thing about this establishment. The bread is always warm and the butter is at the perfect temperature and melts in my mouth, yum! I enjoy coming here, however, I realized it is a little too expensive. The portions are huge and is probably best shared. I enjoy the food, and the service, and the ambiance. It is a very classy establishment, however, the food just doesn't seem to be worth the price I always end up paying. Although they give you big portions, some of the items on the menu are just not worth it. My favorite is the fried macaroni and cheese - delicious! I would recommend this place, but be weary of the price menu and maybe take a look at the menu before going in. There is a TON of stuff on the menu!"
Stephanie A.,"North Park, San Diego, CA",150,117,142,1.0,9/28/2017,"The last two times I went here the service and food were both awful. I tend to stay away from chain restaurants in general, but sometimes I am with a friend who insists that they love Cheesecake Factory, so I can be convinced to go here. Last time the Chinese chicken salad had gross, dark pieces of lettuce in it, and they ALWAYS leave at least one ingredient off the salad (that time it was the oranges). The time before that the service was so awful that we were probably in the restaurant for 2+ hours. And yet-there is usually a wait to eat here!!"
Beth B.,"Tucson, AZ",31,36,,5.0,12/23/2017,We had Cheesecake Factory delivered last night. The food was absolutely perfect and still very warm. The fries were crisp and tasted fresh. The cake and pie portions were huge with plenty of whipped cream. Will definatly order again! And the food was delivered very quickly too!
Tom K.,"Tucson, AZ",51,45,24,4.0,12/13/2017,A huge menu to satisfy your pallet. I chose the crispy Cuban rolls as a light afternoon snack. Service was quick and friendly! I look forward to my next meal at this location!
Sharon W.,"Tempe, AZ",11,32,4,5.0,10/12/2017,My compliments to LERA in corporate for her outstanding compassion & professionalism. I experienced what could have been a huge problem concerning a birthday celebration. The world needs more employees like LERA. I can't say enough great things about her .... the department is Customer Services .... they hired a gem in Lera!  If I could give 20 stars I would.
Tracy S.,"Tucson, AZ",17,111,188,4.0,4/5/2017,"Got steak julien or something..? Diane? I forget, but it was surprisingly good! I've always been iffy about getting steak at non-steak houses, but my husband said this is the one thing he really likes here (aside from jambalaya) and I was really craving some red meat so we came.  Meat was delicious! Seemed to be simply seasoned but I like that! The meat wasn't dry or tough, the asparagus and potatoes that it came with were good too. My only complaint, and this is just personal preference, is that the mushrooms/sauce they put on it was too sweet. I don't like my meat to be sweet...at least my red meat...so I didn't like that too much. If you're like me, maybe ask for the mushrooms/sauce on the side? Again, it's not that the food was bad, it's just I don't like my meat savory AND sweet, just savory. Otherwise, great experience, the bread was good too, service was a little slow, especially since it didn't seem too busy at the time...but in general, good!"
Shelby R.,"Tucson, AZ",16,7,5,5.0,11/13/2017,"I don't typically love chain restaurants but I must say my boyfriend and I love coming to this location for date night. Every time we come the service and the food are wonderful but this evening I must say our server was particularly outstanding. Eli J was our server and she was exceptionally attentive without being overbearing, she kept up her composure while dishes were breaking in the background and she was quite charming all around. My date and I really appreciated this evening and look forward to our next date night, hopefully we're in Eli's section again!"
April Y.,"Ferndale, WA",30,214,443,5.0,2/27/2017,"There is a nice open waiting area with goodies on display.  We were greeted and seated right away.  Alex was our server, he took our drink orders and brought them right out. The coffee was a little cold so he brought out a new freshly brewed cup righy away. I got a flatbread with tomato, basil and mozzarella. It was perfectly crispy and had the perfect amount of toppings.  I also had the portobello, avocado and zucchini fries with garlic dip and chipotle dip. The batter was nice, crunchy and just thick enough.  The old fashion burger was juicy with a great bun. The fish and chips tasted good and had a good batter, however the fries had a little too much salt. The strawberry shortcake is huge! And made with what looks like fresh biscuits.  The lemon meringue cheesecake had the perfect balance of sweet and tart.  Alex made the experience a 5 star, he never seemed irritated  (even when we kept forgetting things and he had to run back to the kitchen 5 times). He found time for conversation and made eye contact during it, our drinks never sat empty. He gave the appropriate time to order and paid attention to ques so he would know when we were ready. Keep up the excellent work Alex R. You are amazing!!"
Christine B.,"El Paso, TX",11,180,217,3.0,1/21/2017,"I have never been to a Cheesecake Factory, but I've heard people rave about it over and over so I was expecting greatness. Unfortunately, I wasn't shocked and awed as I was expecting; everything was just ""okay"" - except for the dessert..that was amazing.  We had 7 in our group, and our table was put together quite quickly. It took a little bit for our server to get to us. When he did arrive, Brandon did a great job and I have no complaints about him. He gave us fresh bread when requested and kept our water glasses filled. Unfortunately, it took a long time for us to get our meals. I know meals for 5 adults and 2 kids might take longer than most, but we waited a good half hour between ordering and receiving our food. The food wasn't anything spectacular and my meal could've used more salt and some spice. I shared the Snickers cheesecake for dessert that absolutely blew my mind. Brandon boxed up my leftovers (always appreciated because I always make a mess).  While we were there, he was given a group of about 25 girls from out of town, yet he did not neglect his duties to our table.  I'm sure I'll eat at TCF again, but I'll know not to get my hopes up as high. Perhaps each restaurant is franchised and I'll have a different experience at a different one."
Nasha W.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",45,453,281,4.0,2/25/2017,"I came here with my little guy for lunch and I was so please with how we were attended. Going on a weekday during lunch is the way to go because we were seated immediately.  Our waitress was so nice and even offered to bring some pieces of banana for my infant. The little details are what matter and she was very kind. My food was delicious (Thai Lettuce Wraps), a bit over priced for what it was but still delicious and fresh tasting. They have so many delicious cheesecakes that it's so hard to choose. I highly recommend their Nutella cheesecake!"
Betsy M.,"Vail, AZ",71,456,525,3.0,1/3/2017,"I simply can't go more than 3 stars.  It truly is A-Ok, nothing more nothing less.  We went for lunch recently after not visiting for a long time.  We were seated immediately, and let me start by saying we had really great service.  But the food is just 'meh'.  With a menu that can take you an hour to read, we had trouble deciding what we even wanted.   We ordered the fried mac & cheese which, I forgot was amazing.  Probably my favorite.  I ordered the club with fries, my Hubs ordered the cheesesteak sandwich.  The sandwich was absolutely bland.  I don't even think they put mayo on it and I was not impressed given I was paying a nice chunk of change for this.  We ordered 2 pieces of cheesecake to go -- pumpkin pecan and peppermint bark.  They tasted okay, nothing more nothing less. I just don't remember the food here being so blah, but for the price you are paying you would hope for a bit better."
John S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,125,1,5.0,11/11/2017,"2 adults, for dinner, 5:30, saturday. No wait, one order of stuffed mushrooms: 6, enough to share, terrific,  entrees were orange chicken w/ mashed potatoes and a lemon chicken w/ mashed potato and asparagus, huge servings, asparagus cooked perfectly.  Both dishes had a light breading, really tasty.  Service was friendly and competent.  And two different pieces of cheesecake to take home, too full to eat at the table. Overall an excellent dinner. And we took part of each entree home for lunch or dinner the next day. A quality meal, much better than the average fare."
John D.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",6,15,239,5.0,8/14/2017,"1st time visit, lunch special enough to share with a friend. Great way to save room for the delicious cheesecake. Very clean, the waitress, Anissa so friendly and upbeat. The promo birthday cheesecake made with cream cheese frosting wow. Also during promo 25c of cost of cake goes towards feed America. I must come back"
Kelly F.,"Tucson, AZ",0,51,88,5.0,4/8/2017,"Our meals were great! Tomato basil pasta and Gluten Free Angel hair pasta with shrimp. But the best part was dessert... The salted caramel cheesecake...phenomenal!!! The ""HUGE!!!"""" Strawberry Shortcake...divine!  From the East-coast to the Southwest, The Cheesecake Factory never disappoints!"
Madelynn F.,"Tucson, AZ",44,71,16,5.0,6/10/2017,"If you been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them all. This is the only location in tucson so I go often. Ive never had a bad experience with the food or the staff here. I LOVE their red velvet Cheesecake!! They do brunch on Sunday's, and compared to other breakfast places, I've never had to wait to be seated for brunch."
Miranda A.,"Tucson, AZ",0,9,,5.0,12/19/2017,"In the past I have had complications with my order. Now that Kate is the manager, she has solved all of them. She I the type of manager that really cares about customer service. This is really crucial in the restaurant industry. I will definitely be returning since the 5 star customer service that has been provided."
Mana M.,"Tucson, AZ",57,27,7,2.0,10/14/2017,Use to be pretty good but this past time I ordered chicken Alfredo that looked and tasted like soup and the chicken was rubbery tasting like it was boiled. They said they had some new cooks so I hope they clean up the cooking. The waiter and manager were great.
Lynne B.,"Pinetop, AZ",1,9,22,3.0,10/12/2017,"Food was delicious, although some of the meals came out hot and some cool (8 people). Server, Kim was amazing. Unfortunately, we were seated in the bar area, 4 in our party were young children, and Family Guy was on the TV. Even without sound it was really  inappropriate. We were there around 3:30pm, not a busy time of day."
Jordan H.,"Provo, UT",0,6,,1.0,12/17/2017,"Waited one hour for the wrong dishes to arrive. Manager was unapologetic. The cheesecake that I ordered was the wrong one, and they had to give me one that was frozen solid. I will never ever go back to this cheesecake factory and I advise that you do the same."
Idan R.,"Toronto, Canada",964,205,618,5.0,3/20/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is a purely successful recipe for a restaurant. The food is fantastic. The prices are amazing. The portions are huge. The space is large, clean and inviting. The service is always reliable. This chain is a well-oiled machine. It's my favorite large format restaurant BAR NONE. If only we had it in Canada!!! The menu at The Cheesecake Factory is huge. Here are some of my favorite dishes: Steak Diane --------------- Amazing, deep flavor. The mashed potatoes are out of this world Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp ---------------------------------------- Amazing flavors all around. Grilled Steak Tacos ------------------------- Simply good tacos. The cheesecakes are out of this world. Some of my favorites are: - Red Velvet - put it in an inter venous bag and hook it up to me! - Godiva Chocolate - Traditional Cherry Cheesecake"
Rachel S.,"Samos, Tucson, AZ",6,11,2,5.0,7/8/2017,"I believe my server's name was Dan or Danny- he had half-hooped earrings. He was an amazing and knowledgeable server. When we finished our meals, we asked for boxes and he requested that we let him box them; so we did. When we got home, my boyfriend opened up his box, and our server wrapped his fish tacos individually in aluminum and put his beans in it's own plastic containers so they didn't touch his beans. It was the best service we have ever had!"
Jolinda B.,"Tucson, AZ",21,105,32,3.0,9/3/2016,"The music is too loud; we can't hold a conversation, but the food is presented well and always tasty. You don't need me to tell you the Cheesecakes are absolutely amazing! Wait staff is always attentive and friendly. The wait in the front can sometimes be annoying. The hostesses seem to wander to help in other places.  I'll order to go or sit on the patio in the evenings."
Trevor R.,"Kent, WA",4,9,23,4.0,2/15/2017,"It's always a treat to come in and grab some cheesecake. I only come for the cheesecake, but every time it is a great desert experience. Was seated quick with little to no wait times. Service was prompt and got our cheesecake in a very timely manner. I have gotten the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake and it takes so much better than it sounds.  Looking forward to the next desert dining experience!"
Kris D.,"Tucson, AZ",141,13,,2.0,6/29/2017,"I've been to this location a few times & went tonight after not having been in about a year. The pricing is just too expensive for subpar food. I ordered a chicken dish that was supposed to be spicy and instead it was sickly sweet. I also ordered a mojito with my meal & I wish I wouldn't have. The cocktail menu has no pricing & there's no way I would've ordered a mojito if I would've known it was going to be almost $13, for ONE drink. I spent over $40 (including tip) on a meal for one that was not even remotely flavorful or true to the taste of what it should've been. Our waitress however was excellent but that was the only good thing about my meal."
Sara S.,"Tucson, AZ",17,68,641,3.0,8/13/2016,Cheesecake Factory has really good food!! The server last night was not that great tho.
Reyna P.,"Marana, AZ",4,15,10,4.0,3/18/2017,"We arrived around 3pm on a Saturday it was busy and the wait wasn't bad, it was around 10 minutes. I was pleased with my lunch. Service was fast and the food was delicious. I selected 2 items from the ""snacks"" menu. The price was reasonable and the portions were good. I would return again."
Mary G.,"Tucson, AZ",0,23,19,4.0,7/10/2016,"Came here for typical Cheesecake Factory chain restaurant food and that was what we got. Nothing awesome or awful. My waitresses however was really annoying in an attempt to be attentive. You can't keep hanging around and talk to us (or our kids) for 5 minute clips every 10 minutes. There is a difference in friendly and attentive wait staff and one that might as well pull up a chair. I would go again and hope it's not this lady. Also we order 3 different cheesecakes this time. I usually order plain with strawberry on top. But this time wanted to try different ones. We got Oreo, macadamia nut and tiramisu. Oreo was the best of 3. And I was really disappointed in the other two. Macadamia tasted rancid and were brown. Maybe toasted but they just tasted rotten. Tiramisu tasted like regular cheesecake with some chocolate powder. I did not enjoy this. What a waste of calories. And of course me being a fat ass and hate wasting food and money kept eating til most of it was gone."
Jim C.,"Fort Thomas, AZ",3,54,92,4.0,1/15/2017,"The service is good as well as the food. The burger was cooked exactly how I had asked and the pasta was very tasty. The restaurant is very clean, but the lighting was very dim which made it feel somewhat gloomy. It is a refreshing break from fast food."
Diana L.,"Tucson, AZ",3,39,85,5.0,3/4/2017,"I don't usually care for chains, but this restaurant has something for everyone. I love their salads. My favorite is the Chinese chicken with the Oriental dressing. Order the lunch size unless you are really starving because they are huge. Their flatbreads are pretty good if you want something light.  Save room for dessert, and if you don't like cheesecake, their hot fudge sundaes are to die for...just plan on blowing all your calories in one meal! Service is good. Complimentary bread is great."
Brittney G.,"Tucson, AZ",406,21,18,4.0,7/29/2017,I've been to this location a good handful of times throughout my time at the U of A and This cheesecake factory has only given me issues about two times. Those times I had really bad service with the server or the host at the front. Other than that the food is just as great as any other Cheesecake Factory. This is a safe place to have a guaranteed delicious dinner with plentiful choices of food and of course cheesecake!
Garrett R.,"The Woodlands, TX",57,16,8,4.0,3/7/2017,"Came here to celebrate, multiple family members birthdays.  We had a good time, our waiter was nice and did an ok job, but it was exactly what we expected!  The food was good not great but we enjoyed it, the atmosphere was just as if we had visited anywhere else in the country.  For visiting a chain restaurant such as this one we enjoyed it and will probably come back again, but not often maybe once or twice a year."
Adriana M.,"Tucson, AZ",0,1,,5.0,8/1/2017,"Here for dinner with my family, and the service is just as good if not better than the delicious food! Roberto offered the best service I've ever received!  He was prompt, polite and very good with our kids. Our 3 year old was a little fussy when we came in but he calmed her and was so patient it was awesome! I will ask for him every time we come to eat here! Thanks Roberto and the awesome cooks for a great experience"
Robert C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,8,,2.0,3/1/2017,"This was definitely not our first trip to Cheesecake Factory but may have been our last... my wife and I came in on a Saturday night, waited 35 mins to be seated which wasn't too bad. I got a beer and sat and talked with my wife. We took a look at some menus and decided to go with the chicken Alfredo and my wife got the chili with rice. We waited about 25 mins and my wife's dish came out first. A min or so later my dish came out and the first thing I noticed when she set it down on our table was a big black hair resting on top. She turned and left and I pulled the dish in for a closer look to confirm my sighting. It was in fact a hair and I called the waitress back immediately. She was quick to take it away to fix it (as the general rule with that situation is to get it off the floor asap) and a few moments later a manager came to speak with us. He simply apologized and said they do their best to minimize hairs and that they do wear hair nets. I wondered why dishes weren't checked or given a final once over before going to the customer.... They did bring me out a new dish in about 5 minutes but this time it was missing the parsley but I was starving and already had to send it back once so i kept it. At first the dish was great and I had taken maybe 7 bites but it quickly got bland as my hunger was suppressed. The chicken seemed to be unseasoned and the pasta was missing the garnish. Not to mention my wife's dish was also bland and lacking spices.    At the end our waiter offered asked us if we wanted a piece of cheesecake which we assumed would be gifted for the wait and hair in our dish but were surprised to find it and the full amount of our dinner on our bill.  Perhaps it was poor judgement on our part to assume MGMT would compensate us anything for the hair but the same thing happened at Oregano's a couple years ago and they comped the item.. either way Cheesecake Factory did not.  We tipped our server $7 and took home our leftovers which tasted even worse next meal.  ========================================= Update 2.24.17 Cheesecake Factory guest services called me yesterday and asked me about my experience and told me they would be contacting the location about it. Then today I got an email with a $50 gift card and an invitation to try them again. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised and will mos def be visiting them again in the future.  ========================================= Update 3.1.17 - My wife and I went back to the same location tonight for dinner. I ordered a beer, the Turkuy club with avocado, and the s'mores Cheesecake. My wife ordered the strawberry lemonade, shrimp scampi, and the lemon cheesecake. Everything was terrific and we let satisfied. Our water was pleasant and the evening was as well. Will be back again."
Melissa V.,"Tucson, AZ",0,12,2,2.0,9/7/2017,"I can honestly say I counted 7 tables in the entire restaurant with people and our waitress took forever to come greet us, ask our drinks, and 23 minutes after the drink order, came to ask if we were ready to order! Food here is always delicious that is not the issue. If there was another Cheesecake Factory here in town this location wouldn't have business simply because the customer service here is seriously non existent. You get better attention and care at Denny's!"
