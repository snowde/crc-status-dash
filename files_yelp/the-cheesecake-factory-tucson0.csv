Cheryl M.,"Huntingburg, IN",194,439,302,3.0,5/5/2011,"What Cory D. said. It's OK. Sorry, I'm just totally sold on local food with fresh flavor. I'm not saying it was bad, it just wasn't outstanding.  The food is always good but honestly do you need 1 plate of food that will feed enough for 4? I think I only ate maybe less than a quarter of my meatloaf, which was good...not spectacular. Yes, the service is always top shelf. However on this specific occasion we got the barbie doll with the plastered smile and rehearsed lines that continually kept checking on us which got quite annoying after a while. I'll go again I'm sure but it won't be by my choice! Sorry for the short review. Not much to say about this one."
Kimberly S.,"Tucson, AZ",33,36,,2.0,3/15/2011,"My partner and I make it a point to avoid big chain restaurants but, I had been given a gift card for this restaurant.  So, we decided to use it one day while shopping at the mall. I won't lie, I LOVE cheesecake so that aspect excited me.  We were seated promptly and the wait staff was polite so that is where the two stars come from. The food: way too overpriced for the prepackaged, pre-prepared food that we ate.  I have had MRE's(Meal Ready To Eat, served to military personnel when cooks or food is unavailable)  that tasted better and hurt my stomach less.  I liked the fried mac n' cheese, but it was frozen and sent in a box.  I could get it at COSTCO cheaper.   The Cheesecake... Really?  This place is supposed to be known for and is named after CHEESECAKE!  I should be blown away by what hits my palate...  But, no.  Once again I could have gone to COSTCO and bought a frozen whole cheesecake for the same price and had it taste ten times better!   Horrible, horrible food all around."
Brenda S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,15,1,3.0,10/10/2014,"We have been to cheesecake factories all over the US, but our experiences here have been just mediocre.  Normally when going to a Cheesecake Factory we get stellar service and food, but from the time we walked in, none of the four of us at our table felt special.  Very few smiles and very little welcoming.  We drove from SE Tucson, so from the start it was disappointing.  We sat in the bar and arrived on a weeknight for happy hour.  We all ordered drinks to start, but they took about 10 minutes to arrive.  There was only one bartender taking care of the entire restaurant.  Drinks were good.  I asked for ice water too, but never got it.  Thankfully hubby went to the bar to get me some.  Appetizers were great - avocado rolls, sliders, tamale cakes, and tuna tartare.  After the meal, we ordered a slice of cheesecake to go.  Got home and we were disappointed at the size of the slice.  They've gotten smaller over the years.  I'd eat here again but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to get there."
Walt C.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",10,196,57,4.0,11/10/2011,"Service was great!  5 stars for the wonderful team work the servers had.  Food was good, just not what I had in mind when I ordered the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp. Large portion though, and I ate it all.  Very enjoyable experience all around, will definitely be coming back again."
Roberta L.,"Tucson, AZ",14,72,,2.0,8/3/2010,"First time there. Menu is ridiculously extensive. I could have used 1/2 hour to really peruse it. Ordered one of the specials of the day: pecan crusted catfish with Pickapepper seasoning, succotash, smashed potatoes. Best was the succotash-very flavorful. The catfish was okay, nicely prepared but somewhat bland and the smashed potatoes were good enough. Portions were generous and I had no room for dessert (thank goodness). But the price was $17.00!!! I think that was way too much. The cheesecake sells for $7 or $8/piece. Best to share that a few ways if you are inclined to pay that much money. The cakes look great in the case, very tempting. I can understand why people succumb. Service was pleasant and efficient. Yes, noisy!!!"
Michael F.,"Atlanta, GA",79,120,25,2.0,7/8/2011,"So in my two return visits both with large racially diverse parties I have had service that would be out done by a IHOP. No seriously it has gotten that bad. Maybe a party of 15 with a mix of races is not appealing to the cheescake factory. Or they just are incapable of handling a large party but its dismal. I have had to have a manager come apologize for multiple mix ups, poor service, untimely delivery, and just outright bringing people the wrong food.  My last trip our server kept confusing the drink orders of people in our party. When she was told she was wrong she got defensive and said some fairly offensive comments to guest with me. I won't go back I don't care how good the food or the bread is. The cheesecake factory in Tucson has lost it's right to my business."
Laura M.,"Alexandria, VA",144,163,103,4.0,1/10/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is a chain, which to me is the only thing against it when it comes to rating it. However, regardless of it being a chain, I can consistently count on having good food (large portions) for a reasonable price when coming here. The service is some of the nicest around and you can't beat the different cheesecakes for dessert. I came here for lunch and ordered the Renee's special. Half a turkey sandwich, a huge salad and a bowl of Lentil soup all for around 9.95. A good place to stop at if you're at the mall and don't feel like Food Court food!"
Erica D.,"Tucson, AZ",21,3,1,5.0,1/10/2014,"My daughter turned six and choose this restaurant for her Birthday dinner, and the food and staff amazed us!  They were so nice and made my daughter laugh.  They even sang Happy Birthday to her.  The managers Kate and Scott stopped by our table a few times to greet and ensure everything was going great.   The Chicken Belagio & Salmon was delicious and my daughter loved her chicken strips with fries in a cute silver cup. The deserts are always a wonderful treat.  This is the best restaurant in Tucson!"
Paul N.,"Tucson, AZ",5,142,22,2.0,8/3/2013,"Huge menu, specializing in nothing.  Everything is average, but they try to make up for it with larger portions.  Had the white bean chicken chili...so salty!!!!"
Cassandra W.,"Benson, AZ",0,4,,5.0,1/17/2014,"At first i was not happy with my food, i ordered fettucine alfredo and it tasted like seafood. I sent it back and the manager couldnt have been more helpful. She was so nice and caring and understanding. I order something different and it was amazing. Our server was so nice and patient. Thanks."
Eric M.,"Tucson, AZ",43,111,19,4.0,6/5/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my earliest memories when I moved to SoCal in 1993.  I lived in a hotel for 3 weeks and there was a Cheesecake Factory right next door.  So, I have a sentimental fondness for this place.  They have ALWAYS had HUGE portions, more than you can ever eat at one sitting so keep that in mind when ordering.  Their dishes are captivating and their menu is enormous so you won't have any problem finding something that you will enjoy.  Unfortunately, I'm not a big dessert person, but obviously the cheesecake is at least one reason to go here, so I hear.  In the end, I'm a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but I'm not going to make it a regular stop because there are too many non-chain restaurants calling my name."
Yvett R.,"Portland, OR",267,473,170,3.0,3/18/2012,"First off, don't judge me for going to a chain. We were on that side of town, we'd never been to ANY Cheesecake Factory and figured it wouldn't hurt.  I don't know if the decor is the same at each location (like Olive Garden), so I have to admit that it's certainly pretty. I also really like a place that has their staff wear bright white. White = clean in my mind, so that's always a plus. We went on a busy Friday evening but it look less than 10 minutes to be seated. In that short while, we were offered a seat at the bar so that we wouldn't have to wait at all.  The service was fast and friendly. I have to admit that I was overwhelmed by their menu. Our go-to restaurants have a one page menu (food in the front, drinks in the back), so a 21 page menu can be a lot to process. I ordered a Cuban sandwich with sweet potato fries, my husband had a beet & goat cheese salad and a flatbread of some kind. The food was out pretty quickly and it was just ""eh"". It wasn't terrible, it wasn't fantastic, it was just adequate. Nothing memorable. Nothing I'm going to be craving. Nothing I'm going to tripping over to try again soon. Eh. My husband was disappointed that the beets weren't fresh. I only ate about a quarter of my sandwich and had the rest boxed up.  Of course we tried the cheesecake. We had a Hershey's one to share. Again, it was good but not the best cheesecake I've had in my life. I was a bit sad about that because I was somehow expecting a spectacular cheesecake. It was sweet and rich and chocolaty but again, not something I can't live without.  I'd give a glowing review for the staff and waiter and an ""eh"" review for the food. I'd go again if I was meeting someone there, but I don't think I'd suggest this as a place to go."
Karol B.,"Tucson, AZ",198,113,6,4.0,7/28/2013,Always great food! We went for a baby shower and it worked out great! Even when you order the lunch portion it is way too much so be aware of the amount of food you will be getting. The chocolate cheesecake is to die for ....actually I have never had a cheesecake there that wasn't wonderful.
Brian H.,"Tucson, AZ",0,8,,3.0,2/20/2013,"I love the place...and I love the food....but the wait staff seems to be over-whelmed all the time...whenever I go in! When I ask others about the place, they all, without hearing my take, specify the service is awful. I get it--the place is busy...and hip....and happening...But hell, how about happening to find my waiter for a refill!! Only one time did we receive great service, and it was on a busy night...so now I know exactly where to sit! That is my only gripe about the place, other than food being a bit over priced.  Although, one time when my order was screwed up, the manager came out and comped my dinner! I was really surprised by that...what with this being a big chain restaurant. So yeah, I'll just keep eating there....with a book to pass the time!"
Christopher B.,"Miami Beach, FL",294,571,606,4.0,10/8/2010,"My experience here was similar to my experience at a Cheesecake anywhere: friendly service and tasty food!  I got the Thai Chicken Pasta (as usual) and it was consistent.  The food also came out extremely fast (and was very hot), which was appreciated because the waitress knew I was hungry!"
William P.,"Tucson, AZ",3,29,,4.0,9/15/2010,"I like CF, it's a fun place to take someone for a birthday or celebration even in a small group. I have gluten, egg, and milk allergies so the few times I have been here I threw health to the wind just so I could enjoy myself. Also, this place is a chain, so you can only expect so much. I don't walk into Friday's, Red Robin, Chili's, or Applebee's expecting very much. For being a huge chain the Cheesecake Factory isn't bad at all, and the servers have always been attentive & helpful. You get a lot of food and it is somewhat pricey, but I always walk out with another meal's worth of food in to-go boxes. Plus, they do small plates or snack-sized portions so it's up to the customer to control how much they pay or eat. I wouldn't bother with mixed drinks, alcohol, or anything of the sort. They are fun to try but you will be getting marked up quite a bit, obviously, so you're better off sticking to the usual tea, lemonade, water, soda, domestic beers, etc. I had the Flying Gorilla one time, was good, and the sangria, not too shabby. Appetizer: So freakin' good. I ordered these as my meal the next time I went to the Factory! The dipping sauce is sweet but tangy, yum. Main dish: Chicken Piccata. Pretty good for what it was, I like more lemony & caper tastes with mine, but I can understand them toning it down a bit for the ""masses."" Dessert: The Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake is worth it. Next time I want to get myself sick I will be going to Cheesecake Factory for this and only this. Their cheesecake is frozen, big surprise, and the consistency does suffer a bit. But it's still edible and very delicious! Both visits so far were during off-peak times, so there was no wait for a table. I think one was really really late on a Sunday night (we were some of the last people to leave before close), and the other was a Wednesday night around 4pm (the restaurant filled up a bit after we ordered our food). Like other reviewers have said, this place is not for the light eater or the sensible eater. You pretty much have to throw caution to the wind here or take home most of your food in a doggy bag."
Marie B.,"Tucson, AZ",49,5,5,1.0,2/19/2014,Worst service ever!!!! We waited over 45 minutes for our food and our waiter didn't know much about anything. He never even checked on us once. Had to ask two other waiters for a drink refill. (Was ignored by one so had to ask another). Really wanted to try the cheesecake but couldn't stand being there any longer. Very disappointed and will not be going there again.
Duane S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,2,,1.0,10/10/2014,"2nd time to the cheese cake factory. Will not go back, I could have got better food from panda express and my wife's burger was burned black and sat under a heat lamp so the plate was hot but the fries were stale and gross, if your going to change premium price serve at least good food."
Jason H.,"Tucson, AZ",13,7,21,4.0,7/22/2012,"Great place for cheesecake, my number one spot. Also has great food though i have not eaten alot of it just a little piece of the menu. Also to inform you that i don""t really like cheesecake but i do like their cheesecake."
Ron R.,"Tucson, AZ",56,184,2,2.0,9/8/2010,All precooked ready to serve. It's ok if your into Applebee's and TGIFridays.  Way over priced. You will pay for ambiance.
