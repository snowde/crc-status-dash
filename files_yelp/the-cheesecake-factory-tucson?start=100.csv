Richard F.,"Tucson, AZ",1,5,,5.0,5/1/2016,"It's unanimous around our table, the food here is excellent. We had: Grilled Steak Tacos, Breaded Chicken, Meatloaf, and Fanfalle pasta w/Roasted Garlic chicken. Every dish was cooked perfectly, the service was quick and friendly. We will be back. It's Sunday evening in Tucson, Az.... Park Place Mall"
Mildred Kitty R.,"Tucson, AZ",4,76,33,1.0,9/14/2014,"Totally disappointing!!!! Spent 70.00 Dollars 81 including tip. Just my husband and I   Service was slow, had to ask for silverware, food was awful. I ordered the salmon and left all on the plate. Not worth the money or the trip."
Mirian P.,"Barcelona, Spain",9,34,36,4.0,5/10/2015,The tradition for Parcés celebrations. Love the chicken marsala. Last time had the salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Cheesecake is always yummy. The grandkids love it.
Krista T.,"Sahuarita, AZ",0,20,,3.0,5/23/2016,"I went here with a friend to celebrate a big accomplishment. Both of us have never tried it before so hey what the heck......let's do this! Anyway the food was so so not great but definitely not horrible either. We ordered teas, and two meals from the lunch menu and a cheesecake to share. Wow $60 for lunch! Smaller portions and let me remind you no appetizers or alcoholic beverages. Really high for so so food I would say. Probably won't be coming back unless for special occasions. Food wasn't warm and wasn't big portions."
Jerry G.,"Tucson, AZ",19,546,162,4.0,8/22/2013,"We really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory.  The food is always good and the portions are huge.  They have large menu selection for lunch and dinner.  Of course the reason to go is for the cheesecakes.  They always have a great selection of cheesecakes.  My wife like the Godiva and my daughter's like just about everything else.  I like the Strawberry Shortcake.  The cake is a biscuit (just like I like it) and it is a little sweet, add the strawberries and ice cream, the next think you know you are in HEAVEN!!!.  YUMMM.  The only ding I would give them is the service is spotty.  Some times you get  a wait person that is on top of things and other times you wonder where they went and why they are not filling your drink, order or seeing if you are ready for dessert."
Belina S.,"Tucson, AZ",21,5,,5.0,12/23/2015,The 5 stars are for our waiter Mohammed!! I come here a few times a year and I always have horrible service however today we were lucky to get seated in Mohammed's section. We had the best service we have ever had at The Cheesecake Factory. I will now start asking for Mohammed. Thank you for making our dining experience great!
Peggy B.,"Tucson, AZ",1,5,,5.0,9/27/2014,"This is a narrative for a to-go order I placed at The Cheesecake Factory on Sept. 26, 2014... I called the restaurant at 12:48 PM.  The phone was answered in four rings with ""Thank you for calling the Cheesecake Factory, this is Alyssa, how may I help you?""  I told her I would like to place a to-go order and she asked if she could put me on hold while she transferred me to the bakery to place my order.  I agreed and was placed on hold for about 40 seconds.  There was light pop music while on hold.  Anissa answered the phone in the bakery and I placed my order.  She asked if I would like some complimentary bread & butter and salad with my sandwich, and I accepted.  Anissa asked what kind of dressing I would like, and I said Italian.  She said they have a Balsamic Vinaigrette and asked if that would be okay.  I agreed and she asked for my name and phone number.  I gave them to her, and she told me my order would be ready in 15 - 20 minutes.  I thanked her and ended the call. I walked up to the door and noticed a few cigarette butts on the walkway outside the restaurant.  The front door was smudge free and the entryway was clean.  The temperature inside the restaurant was comfortable and the lighting and music levels were appropriate.  The hostess smiled and said ""Hi"".  I paused and said ""I'm here to pick up a to-go order.""  She said ""Oh, okay, you can pick it up at the bakery"" while gesturing to the bakery off to the left.  I thanked her and went to the bakery to pick up my order.  The bakery case was sparkling clean and full with appealing cakes.  Anissa greeted me enthusiastically; she smiled and made eye contact.  She said ""Hi, can I get you something?"".  I told her my name, and that I was there to pick up a to-go order.  She said ""Oh, yes, we just pulled that up for you"".  She proceeded to place three boxes in a Cheesecake Factory branded bag with utensils and napkins.  She asked if I wanted to add dessert to my order, and I declined.  Anissa rang up the order and I paid with cash. After I received my order, a gentleman I assume was a manager smiled and thanked me for my order while I was exiting the restaurant. I had ordered an Italian sandwich with complimentary salad and bread/butter.  The Italian sandwich was cool and served on crispy Ciabatta bread.  The fillings were plentiful and delicious.  A creamy white sauce was served on the side without a request.  The salad was crisp and fresh.  It was served with a Vinaigrette dressing on the side.  The sourdough bread was fresh and slightly warm, and served with several cool pats of butter. Amazing quality food and great experience!"
Kathy N.,"Tucson, AZ",235,375,643,4.0,2/4/2013,"Alcohol and cheesecake, the perfect remedy for a sucky day for four hard working executive assistants, right? My girls and I came here tonight to celebrate a birthday among us and to catch up on each other's lives.  I've been to this Cheesecake Factory three times now and it gets better with each visit. I arrived first tonight and waited in the roomy and open waiting area. The seating is pretty much blocked from the hostess area view and while it got a little busy with evening diners, it was comforting to know I wasn't forgotten sitting there by myself. Two different hostesses checked on me during the 10 minute wait before my friends showed. Cocktails were in order and once seated and bread and water (didn't even have to ask for water!) were put on the table, we placed our drink orders. I prefer tequila over any other spirit but hate that typical tequila drinks are either some version of a margarita or some sickeningly sweet concoction. The Firefly surprised me with its pleasant but not too sweet taste.  Silver tequila with passion fruit, blood orange and a little splash of Prosecco. A pretty little garnish of an orange peel curl topped my drink. Just a sip or two and I was in my happy place. Two girls ordered Little House Salads to go with their meals and they looked like average salads with a nice mixture of greens. The ""Little"" salads were very generously portioned. The Shrimp with Angel Hair was full of plump shrimp and substituting penne for the angel hair was no problem.  Dynamite Shrimp was a hit and devoured quickly. One friend ordered the Mexican Chicken Lettuce Wrapped Tacos and they were much larger than she thought they'd be. Pretty sure she enjoyed them. I went with the Chicken Madeira and it was delicious. Extremely tender chicken breast filets topped with gooey, melted mozzarella, asparagus and mushrooms along with a light Madeira sauce. Served with mashed potatoes made it a super comfort food to appease the craptastic day I'd had. We shared a slice of Dulce de Leche cheesecake and the caramel, fluffy tanginess was an explosion of flavor in my mouth. Our server brought out a little ice cream sundae after she heard us talking about a birthday and she readily obliged us by NOT gathering her fellow wait staff to sing to and embarrass my friend. Prices are a little high in my opinion but like I said, this is my third visit so I guess the price isn't out of my comfort zone. Super helpful and efficient staff makes the dining experience that much better. Happy birthday Michele!"
Carley G.,"Edmonton, Canada",93,147,51,3.0,10/27/2015,"It's a Cheesecake Factory. You're going to get the same food that you'll get at any of the Cheesecake Factories across the country. Big portions, high prices and the same everywhere. We stopped in for dinner and a drink and it cost about $50 each. Not worth it for what you got."
Laura Q.,"Oro Valley, Tucson, AZ",0,10,2,1.0,7/21/2015,"I used to go here a lot, and it's been a while and I won't be back, unless it's for cheesecake and maybe something simple to eat. Let's start with the 'Host'?  If you even want to call it that.  This guy is in his early twenties with dark brown hair, wears glasses (didn't catch the name)...anyhow, you enter the door and there's No Smile from him, no customer service skills whatsoever, and he decided to joke about how many kids I had by over counting the amount of ppl I had in my party.  If we had stayed instead of taking our order to go, I thought in the back of my mind of complaining to the manager.  (I'm not the type of person who likes to confront ppl about their employees, etc, but it was so bad)  I can't even believe the guy got hired here, I know it's a chain restaurant, but it makes the whole place look bad and even at McDonalds they have better customer service.  Plus I know it wasn't just me because upon leaving, I watched a couple come in to get ignored by this guy.  No greeting, because he was far to busy getting a plastic bag. The waitress was fine, nothing to complain about.  But the $12 or so dollar salad we ordered, the 'Chicken and Avocado' was a RIP OFF!  There was like 5 slivers of something that resembled chicken, and there were literally like 3 or 4 tiny pieces of avocado.  It was just a bunch of iceberg lettuce.  If we hadn't taken it to go we most definitely would have complained.   So the one star is for the cheesecake.  I don't think they can mess that up.  I don't think it's even made there."
Sasha T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,2,5.0,5/21/2015,The Cheesecake Factory in green valey ranch is one of my favorite spot to have a good meal . The service is excellent and every meal I had there was delicious .  I highly recomand the salmon genovese
Aubrey R.,"Tucson, AZ",67,2,,1.0,7/16/2015,"Decided to try and give the cheescake factory a 2nd chance and they failed miserably. Food was still cold. This time i got the crispy chicken costaletta, and it was   crispy. Very soggy, and dry, no taste, and our server, surprise surprise, was very rude. Rolled her eyes at us, kind of just threw our dishes onto the table, never got a refill on my drink. All in all, i will never go back. Once again i was sick from their food."
Patsy B.,"Tucson, AZ",0,2,,1.0,8/16/2015,"Poor service, my husband and I have been waiting about 15 minutes for our server to ask if we need refills!"
Sol Maritza C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,1,,1.0,7/11/2015,horrible experience it was our first time going there and we went to celebrate my birthday so my sister in law let them know about my birthday and the waiter acted like he didn't even care. couple of minutes later we heard them singing happy birthday to another table. The food was good i'm not gonna lie but we were very dissapointed that we were discriminated.
C C.,"El Cajon, CA",31,91,15,5.0,12/22/2014,"I've always gotten the same thing when I've come, but this time we got different meals. My son got the jambalaya over fettuccine and I got the chicken quesadilla.. Delicious! Saved a little room for cheesecake to share. Jeremy was our waiter and he was attentive and helpful. He knows his Cheesecake Factory menu and we will definitely eat here when in town again."
Salvador R.,"Tucson, AZ",0,6,1,3.0,10/16/2015,"It appears to me as if the portions are getting smaller.  The cheesecake is not as big as before, the prices keep getting higher."
Rebecca B.,"Tucson, AZ",114,82,1,4.0,7/16/2015,Second time went back at this place and I really like this Restaurant because inside very good painting and very nice designed by the owner  . The customer service some time nice some time not nice because they are very busy at weekend.  That is ok . Good food much better.  Going back
RT S.,"Chicago, IL",8,232,630,4.0,3/23/2013,"This is the only Cheesecake Factory in Tucson. It is located in the Tucson Mall.  The restaurant is similar to all the Cheesecake Factory restaurant. It's quite busy from 6pm on so to avoid the crowd, we arrive before 6pm. The shrimp bistro pasta is a favorite. The combination steak Diane and shrimp scampi is also delicious.  Strawberry lemonade goes well with the meal.  The mango cheesecake concludes the dinner.  Service is prompt and friendly."
Yeohoon Y.,"Tucson, AZ",1,6,,1.0,6/14/2015,"Terrible, my girlfriend recommended me to go. Worst service. But the cheese cake was alright."
Lauren T.,"Tucson, AZ",160,274,24,3.0,7/9/2014,This was my second trip to The Cheesecake Factory and first one here at this location. Standard place. Choices for everyone! Too many choices sometimes! The service is good at this location. Prompt and friendly after you pass the server stand...they seemed to want to ignore me. Easy place to go when you are at the mall.
