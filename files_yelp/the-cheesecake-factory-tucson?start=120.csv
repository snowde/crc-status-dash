John R.,"Tucson, AZ",21,154,,4.0,3/9/2014,"They did a huge about-face after I complained to corporate - read my previous review to see why I called corp.  Btw, corporate did send me an apology gift card which is what we used to revisit them. Now: - Hostesses are attentive and polite, and actually genuine - Menus were completely cleaned - Our server, Steven, introduced himself and told us the soup of the day (as there are no specials at lunch time) - Steven was also perfect with his timing - food came out fast, accurate, and refills were stupendous.  He also made a couple of great jokes and was overall great. - We got both kinds of bread (yum) - When the food was delivered, the wait staff was very careful in how they handled our plates as to not touch the food - I had a very minor complaint about one of the shrimp not being de-veined and the server told the manager, who promptly came over to apologize (very nice touch) - The Hershey's cheesecake was divine as I remembered it before our previous visit.  Moist, tasty and fresh. The only thing they need to improve, and this will obviously take a while, is the service staff needs to stop standing in front of their guests while chatting about their personal bar experience last night.  Steven did not do this, but several female staff members did and I think it's tacky.  But I understand why they do it - their server stations are not partitioned off, like other restaurants they probably previously worked at, so it's an adjustment.  But not the end of the world. Great job Cheesecake Factory - way to turn it around.  I'm a fan."
Lenny M.,"Marana, AZ",1,24,1,3.0,7/16/2016,Service was a bit slow but it was a busy Saturday night. Had the Mac and cheese burger which was really good. A little disappointed in the fries. They seemed like frozen fries from a fast food joint. Expected some better home made style fries. And it is the Cheesecake Factory so all the cheesecake is delicious and one slice is enough for an army.
Venessa G.,"Tucson, AZ",0,6,1,1.0,4/12/2016,This place smells bad. The food is Mediocre and the service is always horrible. I have given this place multiple chances and each time I am disappointed. On another note don't come here for a birthday expecting cheesecake. You will be charged without warning.
Cheyenne A.,"Tucson, AZ",4,5,,1.0,7/25/2014,Just had worst experience ever. Usually I enjoy this place but today was such a let down.  From getting my order wrong to the quality of the food. I was very disappointed.   I don't feel it's unreasonable to enjoy my experience when dining out and this was such a let down
Jia-Ying X.,"Chino Hills, CA",1,70,140,4.0,10/2/2013,"I've been here for many times. So far I feel the food here overall are really good. Both the potion and quality of the food would make me satisfied. By the way, I love the bread they offer! Every time I told myself ""hey, you already order a main dish! Stop eating these bread, which would make you so full!"" But I just can't control myself and even ask the waiter to give me one more basket of bread after I finish all these bread. However, though the food is good, I would say the waiter here is not really friendly. When I ask her what would she recommend, she looks like she doesn't really want to introduce anything to us but just want to get our order and get rid of us. Maybe it's because they have too many customers and they are very busy. Anyway, I would recommend people come here if they don't really care about the attitude of service."
Jon H.,"Tucson, AZ",0,15,,2.0,3/8/2015,"We have had some good, mediocre, and bad experiences at this particular cheesecake factory.  We went there for dinner on Saturday, March 7th.  Our server was Ben. I am not sure if he had too many tables, or what, but he is not an attentive server.  The first thing he did after approaching our table was tell us that the bread was still in the oven.  Seemed reasonable. However, about 10 - 15 minutes later, we noticed that other tables were getting bread.  I had to stop the server to ask him about the bread.  From then on, I took note of how often the other servers were checking on the tables around us compared to our server.   It was clearly an issue of the other servers would check on their tables three to four times more than our server checked on us.  He was very inattentive and pretty much made for a poor dining experience."
Elizabeth M.,"Oro Valley, AZ",3,5,,1.0,4/16/2015,Went there yesterday for lunch and I order the Renee's special soup turkey sandwich and salad the turkey sandwich bread was so hard that hurt my tooth so bad so I didn't eat it I can't believe that they would served bread that hard.. service was just as bad
Sergio P.,"Tucson, AZ",0,1,,2.0,4/15/2015,"This is the first time I've been to this place, heard good things about it and decided to try it out. Service was good overall, seated promptly and server was nice and charming, ordered an appetizer (buffalo chicken with chz inside a wonton) it was one of the worst things made with buffalo I've tried. I had to send it back because it was just awful, then ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp, it was horrible!  Overwhelmed with coconut and just too sweet! The only thing good was the bread and beer that I ordered. My wife had the jambalaya pasta, too plain and no flavor at all, the manager did went by and took care of the meals we didn't eat but my expectations were higher than what I received, maybe next time I'll have to go try a new restaurant."
Brian P.,"Tucson, AZ",31,1,,3.0,12/31/2015,"My wife, two young daughters and I stopped in with the intention of having dinner and cheesecake. Seeing the prices, we opted only for one appetizer to share and a piece of cheesecake each. Service was very good, but, come on now. Four drinks(soda), one appetizer, and four pieces of cheesecake cost with tip right around seventy bucks!!! Everything was tasty, but obviously we won't be going there with any frequency. I can recommend the place but make sure you have PLENTY of disposable funds with you."
Shanan M.,"Vail, AZ",0,6,,1.0,4/16/2016,Horrible food save yourself the time and money!! This place is very overrated!! Food was very cold and tasteless.I have to say the wait staff was very nice but the quality of food has gone downhill maybe they have a new head chef??
Ingrid T.,"Tucson, AZ",121,196,7,5.0,8/11/2014,"Here's the truth for a chain I LOVE this place.  It's beautiful on top of it why do I love that bread so much? Here's what I recommend the avocado rolls, evelyn's favorite pasta and a piece of cheesecake you cannot go wrong. Yes it is a chain and yes it is expensive.  And yes it is soooo yummy if you love cheesecake"
James H.,"Tucson, AZ",0,5,,4.0,6/12/2014,"Tonight, I went to the Cheesecake Factory in order to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. Upon arrival, we were promptly seated by one of the hostesses who quickly provided menus. The first thing I noticed as soon as I sat down was that the table was sticky and had crumbs scattered about. After getting up and locating a manager, I informed him of the situation and he was incredibly polite and efficient, sending a busboy to wipe down the table and apologizing the whole way. Next, we  got our food. My girlfriend ordered the Four Cheese Pasta with chicken and  I ordered the Southern Fried Catfish with mashed potatoes, corn, and asparagus (substituted for the green beans) upon the server's recommendation. Our server, Mark V. was incredibly polite and quick with everything, always refilling our drinks without being asked.  Now, the pasta was fine with the exception of the chicken which was painfully dry,  both myself and my girlfriend needed to take heavy swigs of our drinks in order to wash the chicken down entirely.  The catfish was horrible, with an incredibly heavy and overdone breading which required me to chisel it out with a blunt end of a fork., I literally proceeded to remove the breading to eat the fish, which was flavorless and limp. I literally stopped eating due to the amount of work and the sheer lack of flavor, leaving most of the food untouched.  We brought this up to the manager, who was incredibly polite and removed the catfish from the final check on the spot, offering to either make another order or allow me to try something different from the menu. Due to the time of night (about 2130) and not wanting to subject the kitchen staff to extra prep work and cooking, I decided to just have the item removed and proceeded to order a slice of the Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake to go.  Overall, I'd like to say that the experience was pleasant, catfish notwithstanding. The server and manager were polite and observant, answering our questions and addressing all concerns."
Ayla R.,"Seattle, WA",172,289,129,5.0,2/8/2015,"Cheesecake is a good ole standby! It is by far the most grand looking building within a mile of the Tucson mall and the interior is pretty captivating. You know most of it is great paint and partical board, but it doesn't make it less beautiful. C and I enjoy this place for lightly late night food and man oh man, do they have food! This business boasts a menu that is thicker than any children's book and has over 250 dishes. This ranges from pizza to asian lettuce wraps, burgers and pasta. The fascinating thing, they hit the nail on the head dish after dish. How one kitchen can have so many cuisines so well represented and produced is a wonder! Their wine list is comprehensive and they probaby have killer desserts. I behave and have never touched one.  They have a fair amount of items that with very minor modifications can be made vegan. Their Kale and Quinoa Salad can be made vegan and is my personal favorite It is a massive portion of hearty kale and quinoa with grapes and other suprising flavors. Their thai lettuce wraps are traditionally with chicken, but if you sub that with avocado you have a gorgeous display of an array of fillings for some flavorful wraps! The majority of their pastas are vegan and they have few sauces as well. The marinara, roasted tomato, thai pasta sauce and thai peanut sauce are all vegna friendly! Matt is by far the best server. He greets you with a genuine smile and always gives prompt, efficient service. He knows the ins and outs of the menu like he wrote it and you always feel like a genuine guest in his home. I always ask if Matt is there and if he is, his service is worth any wait! I highly suggest asking for their superstar server, Matt!"
Sue B.,"Tucson, AZ",14,7,,5.0,10/5/2014,"Love the cheesecake factory The big burrito is my favorite with chicken, rice, peppers and onions and more with the guacamole and sour cream.  Love the cheesecake too (it's a little oricey) but chocolate mousse is delicious! I have to go at least once a month to satisfy my taste buds!"
Amy L.,"Tampa, FL",53,163,15,5.0,12/21/2014,"Took our sons there on our third day in Tucson. My husband got a steak dish, I got pasta carbonara, the boys got a kids spaghetti and a Mac and cheese burger. We made the mistake of separate desserts, and our bill was like $150 for the four of us. I'm not cheap at all, but just moving from out of state, we probably shouldn't have. That being said, the Cheesecake Factory has been great every state I've been to one in. I've never received poor service, and this one was no different. Our server was there immediately when I ran out of my mixed drink to bring me another. I have kids. I was at the mall. I absolutely needed another drink, or four. (Disclaimer: my husband was driving. Make that six more.) She was a doll. Our food was incredible, and all in all, great experience!"
John L.,"Binford, ND",1,27,1,5.0,1/3/2015,"Went here about two days before Christmas. The place is grandiose in its décor. We were seated very quickly even though they looked fairly busy. The waiter was very outgoing and helped with our ordering as this was our first visit. I had the Beet and goat cheese salad and my wife had Garlic noodles and we shared a slice of Anniversary Cheesecake. Everything was delicious. As we left the restaurant Everyone said ""Merry Christmas"""
Mark A.,"Tucson, AZ",263,324,1090,1.0,8/16/2013,"So here we go, so I got this card from a semi reliable source for $25 for the Cheesecake Factory, I hadn't been in years because it was overpriced and the food is okay but not great.  So I thought for free I would check it out again and see if my first 3 or 4 times were right.  The air conditioning worked well that is where any approach togreatness stopped,  When in that space I feel like I am in a cafeteria in Disneyland (Not in a good way), the decor is kind of weird mix Egyptian and the home of Nora Desmond (Sunset Boulevard. the one with Gloria Swanson), and it is noisy.  I also don't dig one person handing the menu, another one taking my order, another one bring my food out, and yet another one bring out the condiments, there is so much room for error.  Error was the theme for the evening, the menu is way too long, I was asked numerous times ""are you the one that ordered ________"".  The person who literally dropped the food and ran, left us with no condiments, I tried to flag someone down to no avail, then I got up and found someone to ask.  the guy I tracked down got yet someone else to bring the condiments. To top it off all off there was no money on the gift card, I should of checked.  My burger was fine but made my stomach feel weird all night, and whoever took out order told me the french fries were fresh not frozen (they either lied or they just don't know what a fresh french fry looks like).  So the morale of this story there is no such thing as a free lunch!"
Victoria T.,"Los Angeles, CA",115,100,37,5.0,12/11/2013,"I always enjoy my time when I eat at the Cheesecake Factory in Tucson :)  The menu is a novel, with so many options varying from so many different types of cuisines and cultures that it could easily take you all night to decide on what to order. Rest assured, you'll have some warm and delicious bread to munch on while you ponder and some beautiful meals to watch floating around to the patrons sitting near you.  I have never ordered anything that didn't taste great. I ADORE their veggie burger, beautiful presentation and patty. The ambience is always lovely and warm.  Definitely recommend for a date night or even a casual lunch."
Willanne W.,"Vail, AZ",40,144,123,2.0,8/18/2011,"Lunched here last week to celebrate my birthday with some girlfriends.  I selected it as I really, really wanted cheesecake for my birthday! After checking out the menu from the library.. well, it just seems like a book, it is so extensive, we finally made up our minds.   Both of my friends ordered the chicken salad sandwich with sweet potato fries.  The sandwiches were huge.  They found them tasty and I sampled the sweet potato fries -- very nice.  Trying to save room and justify dessert, I had the lunch portion of Cobb Salad.  The lettuce  was really ""chopped"" up which I don't care for and a number of the ingredients were tossed with it along with the dressing.  It was very bland and unattractive!  How can you mess up a Cobb Salad?  Only the bleu cheese had any flavor.  Wah, Wah, Wah! Fine, I thought, at least I'll have cheesecake.  Having not eaten at a Cheesecake Factory in probably 20+ years, it took a while to figure out which cheesecake to settle upon.  I opted for the Dulce De Leche, one friend had the Red Velvet and the other had the Snickers Bar.  They were all tasty but that true creaminess of genuine cheesecake just wasn't there!  Where did it go and what was in its place?  Frankly, the taste left on the palate was one of inferior ingredients and an oiliness I associate with ""Cool Whip"" or some other super hydrogenated oil based pseudo food product.  Wah Wah Wah.  But, I still licked my plate! If you want real cheesecake, I'd recommend a slice of Cheesecake heaven at Modern Bakery in Boston, MA (see my review!). The service was fine, the menu was frankly too long and involved, the salad mediocre and the cheesecake disappointing although very attractive!  I doubt I'll go back."
Jess E.,"Paradise Valley, AZ",1,14,,3.0,2/18/2015,"It's pretty decent food, consistent so once you find something you like, you can count on it being the same again. That said, this location is terrible with takeout orders."
