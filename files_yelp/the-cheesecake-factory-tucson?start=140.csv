Tiffany S.,"Baltimore, MD",91,305,159,4.0,5/12/2013,"I think that this is one of the ver few sit-down national chain that I actually like going back to. Which is funny because I distinctly remember in SF not being a fan of the non-desert food options. When did they manage to convert me???? Well at any rate, there are a few favorites. The top of the list is the Navajo. I love Native American fry bread (who doesn't love fried bread?), however, it's harder to find. Here they turn it into a sandwich with moist chicken and some yummy sauce. The fried bread makes it decadent heaviness, the only problem is that it's difficult to justify a cheesecake purchase after eating.  My other favorite is on the lighter side menu, the farro and beet salad very flavorful and well balanced. Needless to say the cheesecake is great with lots of flavors to select from"
Bret S.,"Tucson, AZ",40,27,1,3.0,1/8/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory claims to take reservations for large groups, but their promise is about as worthless as a politician's.  Came with a large group for my wife's Birthday and had to wait about an hour and a half after our reservation to actually get seated. We made the reservation three weeks prior and then called again the day of.   Not the best start, especially when you have children with your group.  Once seated, the service was great and the food was excellent. Would suggest not going in large group to have the best experience."
Amy G.,"Pima, AZ",0,27,3,1.0,1/7/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of our favorite restaurants. We've been to the locations in Phoenix, Scottsdale, Seattle, San Diego  (one of the best dining experiences we've ever had) & last Saturday (1/2/16) in Tucson. We were really disappointed. Terrible service & the food was just awful. We will never go back to this location again."
Anjelia L.,"White Water, CA",25,2,,1.0,1/13/2015,"The cheesecake is always delicious but every time we go, which is quite often, there are several dishes that are dirty and still have food particles left on them, disgusting. I recommend to always check your silverware before eating."
Giselle E.,"Tucson, AZ",1,6,,5.0,6/14/2015,Delicious and a huge variety of food selections! Obsessed!!! The cheesecake was also very good
Elyse P.,"Tucson, AZ",50,168,46,3.0,3/2/2014,"We needed a restaurant at the Tucson Mall that everyone would like and Cheesecake Factory (CF) fit the bill. We arrived a little early and put our name in - they don't take reservations. The wait was reasonable for CF on a Friday night at 7:30pm.  I had been craving a Cuban sandwich and they had one on their (giant) menu. I excitedly ordered it. The waitress was sorry, but they were out of pork. Bummer! I ordered the fish tacos instead.  Fish tacos came out, but no beans. What's rice with no beans? The waitress went to get me beans, comes back, and they're out of them as well. Okay ... cheesecake time. Waitress recommends the dulce de leche. I order it. She comes back - they're out of that too! Literally, they were out of everything I ordered. The food I (and others) did get - crab and artichoke dip, salad - was mediocre. I wouldn't get the fish tacos again. I am giving a three star rating based on my experiences at CF as a whole and not this specific occasion, because I hope it was an unusual one."
Lea M.,"Tucson, AZ",84,12,,4.0,5/12/2014,"I always sit at the bar so my review is only pertinent to bar service. Service at the bar is fantastic. I never have to ask for refills and I'm checked on unobtrusively. The food service at the bar is great too. As far as the food goes, I've found the things that I like and don't like, and tend to be a creature of habit; so, in terms of that- the burgers, fries, and pastas are pretty good. I'm not a fan of the house dressing (it actually overwhelms the flavor of the salad itself) and as far as steak goes- a bit too salty for me, although I'm not one to typically add salt to my food. Overall, the food is pretty consistent. The drinks are prepared well if you're into that and I'm a fan of their house margarita. And the cheesecake- always delicious."
Stella T.,"Carmel, CA",0,22,1,1.0,12/2/2014,"Disappointing lunch today!! The restaurant was not busy today. Which I thought was great. I took mom out to her favorite place. The service was good. Nice young lady with long beautiful dreadlocks. But here is where it was a very disappointing meal. First my order was wrong. I ordered a Chinese Chicken salad with NO ONIONS! And they brought me lettuce wraps. Mom ordered a omelet, by the time they brought my salad mom was almost done. My salad with NO ONIONs finally arrived. The young lady said ""here is your salad with NO ONIONs"". Wrong!!!! It has ONIONs!!!! She offered to make me another salad and I said it would take to long since mom was done with her lunch. So I figured I would take it home for Mom to have for her dinner. The server came by and picked up my plate before I could tell her I wanted to take the salad to go she then put dirty plates on top of my salad!!! Yuck! Oh and moms omelet was raw inside!!!! Where is the customer service!!!  Will no longer eat here!!!!!"
Megan D.,"Tucson, AZ",8,67,13,3.0,8/14/2013,"The cheesecake factory - why o' why do you have such a large menu?  A large menu with tons of options is probably why this place is so popular - but for a non-commital like myself, it takes me 30 minutes just to decide what I want to eat.  I had a pasta dish with breaded shrimp this last time there.  It was good - large enough that I split it with the beau and still had 2 meals left over.   We celebrated a birthday for a friend - they brought cheesecake and sang.  Fun time, but a bit overpriced for a gal like me."
Rachel D.,"Elgin, IL",10,108,29,4.0,2/18/2014,"Still in Tucson, AZ staying with my mom to escape the cold & snow back home in IL., mom & I were looking for desert and we drove to the Gluten Girls Bakery which is Tucson's only All Gluten Free dedicated Cafe & Bakery, we did not remember that they are closed on Mondays, which is no big deal for my mom but it is an inconvenience for me. So I said, let's go to The Cheesecake Factory for Desert! I ordered the Godiva Flourless Chocolate Cheesecake, while the cake is huge, very expensive and tastes great, it does not help me out much because I am allergic to milk and I think that Cheesecake & Mousse are always made with Dairy and I doubt that Godiva Chocolate has come out with a Dairy Free Chocolate. I did take allergy meds in the morning so I did not have any serious reactions fortunately.  I really wish that they had more Gluten Free options for desert and would offer one without dairy as well. While they do offer a bowl of strawberries, I am not going out to restaurant to order fruit for desert that I have at home all the time"
Daniel G.,"Olympia, WA",63,11,1,4.0,3/16/2015,"Food is good, and if course the cheesecake is amazing. Prices are a little much though, and the menu us a bit too long to really offer great dishes."
Gregg B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",20,22,15,2.0,10/10/2014,"Very disappointed with my visit today. I've been to Cheesecake Factories all over the US and have never been disappointed until today.  I usually order the same thing, Spicey Cashew Chicken which is what I ordered today. The chicken had no flavor at all. They took it back and the manager Jeff came over to apologize and took it off my bill. My wife's pasta was also salty so they took that off the bill as well. Service was very slow and the waitress seemed to have an attitude which improved slightly after I had complained to Jeff about the service."
Melanie S.,"Tucson, AZ",10,8,,1.0,10/12/2014,I got cheese cake slices to go from the CCF and when I opened the bag to get them out I saw how tiny they were! They were 2 inches wide at their thickest and I think even that is exaggerating. Their precut slices on their display are larger than that and for $8+ a slice I think I deserve a little more bang for my buck!!
Eric R.,"Surprise, AZ",1,57,17,4.0,5/10/2015,"I enjoy the Cheesecake Factory anyway, but this my first one since I've been in Arizona. Everything was great just like the rest but I took off a star for the long wait. Yea I know it was Mother's Day but still. First, I ask how long the wait? She said, ""30 mins"". More than an hour went by before our pager went off. Next time I'll come when it's less crowded."
Jessie B.,"Henderson, NV",74,774,122,4.0,9/19/2012,"I met a girlfriend and her daughter at The Cheesecake Factory for lunch. We were celebrating the friend's birthday... Our waiter was really friendly, and reminded us of Ross from Friends both in terms of personality and apperance. My friend's daughter had a lot of questions about the menu and he was very patient with her. Ended up customizing a meal for her based on what she wanted, and brought out special sauces for her to try until she remembered which she liked best. We started out with some delicious drinks, and decided to split a couple appetizers from the super cool skinnylicious menu. For those that are unfamiliar with how The Cheesecake Factory rolls, the typical portions are HUGE and very high calorie. I learned a while ago that I can noteat one of the normal entrees if I have any desire to get a piece of cheesecake (and really, why would you go to the CHEESECAKE Factory and NOT get a piece?!) The three apps we shared were: Avocado Eggrolls - Not a Skinnylicious item but honestly...  I can't remember the last time I went to The Cheesecake Factory and didn't order these. My tried and true favorite, love the creamy and crunchy texture.  Crispy Crab Bites - Skinnylicious! Perfectly cooked, perfectly sized. Would order again. Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos - Also Skinnylicious, and they have three types.. We had the Mediterranean style which came with feta cheese, kalamata olives and tzatziki sauce. My least favorite of the apps we ordered but they were still good.  Sadly, I ended up eating too much to get cheesecake, despite my efforts not to. BOO! Since we were celebrating a birthday, 'Ross' our waiter brought out a minmi desert for the birthday lady, on the house, and he also got his coworkers to sing and embarass my friend. Thanks, 'Ross'!!"
Juan M.,"Sahuarita, AZ",78,25,424,5.0,11/22/2013,Come here mainly for the cheesecake. There are so many varieties and theyre all really good. The food here is good and the portions are large. I usually drop in and grab a slice to-go whenever i am in the area. The service has always been great and very friendly.
Kelly W.,"Tucson, AZ",11,81,130,4.0,12/7/2012,"We walked in on a Sunday evening and waited about 10 minutes for a table. Zacariah, our server, was excellent: polite, friendly and efficient. My friend had the Four Cheese Pasta with chicken and I had the Veggie Burger. All food was fresh and brought promptly. Both dishes were delicious.  I was concerned that the Veggie Burger had beets mixed into it as I don't like beets but I couldn't taste them at all. Veggie burgers are always a bit of a gamble as sometimes the taste or texture can be poor, but this one was delicious, a tad bit on the sweet side. Kind of a mushy texture but not bad. For dessert we shared a slice of Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake. It was out of this world. This is cheesecake at its supreme best. It couldn't be any better. Lighting and ambiance were very nice, conducive to a leisurely, enjoyable dinner.  Even though business in the restaurant was brisk we did not feel rushed. My only complaint is that the glasses our drinks came in were a little sticky around the rim as if they hadn't been washed well."
Nali M.,"Kauai, HI",683,560,950,3.0,3/8/2011,"my second time to the cheesecake factory on just an ordinary monday evening. we were seated right away. my daughter was kind of fussy tonight, so it's good that they sat us away from where a lot of people were at. the server was nice and brought out a 'baby plate' that had four slices of bread and four slices of banana. it was really nice because it kept our daughter occupied....for a little bit! the food was 'meh'. got the crab cake snack plate. my husband wanted to try them. i think that they'd be better if they did something a little more special with the sauce. it's a tartar sauce mixed with something, but you can't really tell what. if they did a sweet chili aioli or wasabi aioli, they would have been soooo bomb. the husband ordered the hitachi steak with tempura asparagus. i got the four cheese penne pasta. he didn't mention if it was good, or not. my pasta was something i could have made at home.  the problem with the menu is is that it's too long. too many choices!! how can i complain about too many choices?! try looking through a menu that's 16 pages long and deciding on what to eat. on a day where you're indecisive.  i guess i expected better since the last experience i had was pretty good. i will be back, just don't know how soon."
Ronald Lee I.,"Marana, AZ",46,9,6,2.0,5/22/2014,"First time dining here and sadly I orderd what was literally the worst Alfredo I have ever tried, beyond comparison. I can not even define the flavor that ruined the dish. But it was one I have yet to rinse out of my mouth. The manager said they put nutmeg into dish and when overdone it can give the sauce a fishy or seafood flavor. However, I wouldn't say I recognize the vile taste as a seafoodesc flavor.  The manager took the dish back and removed its cost from our check and offered his apologies. The ambience is really nice and the staff was friendly and attentive."
Sydney K.,"West University, Tucson, AZ",17,21,3,3.0,7/19/2015,"Well this review is a mixed bag. My husband and I came here for lunch and he ordered a Cuban with a side salad and I ordered a turkey burger with side salad from their Skinnylicious menu. Nothing complicated. My meal came first and I really hate that. I like to eat WITH my husband. About seven minutes later his sandwich finally came, but not his salad. And his sandwich needed mustard. We waited and waited and finally the server came back and said the salad was coming and he was sorry, which allowed my husband the opportunity to ask for mustard. We still waited. By now, I'm done with my meal. And it was the best turkey burger I've ever had, but I'm mad because my husband is still waiting. He went to get the manager and she made it right by taking the sandwiches off our bill, which was all she could do at that point; I appreciate that very much. The food was so good that's it's a shame the kitchen was screwed up and so far behind. We were Only be table of two on a not incredibly busy day at this establishment."
