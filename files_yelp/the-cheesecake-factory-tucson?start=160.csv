Nakata H.,"Duluth, GA",8,64,50,1.0,8/23/2014,"I normally don't do chain restaurants, but I do like Cheesecake Factory. I've been here before and I enjoyed one of their skinny salads so I ordered the same dish tonight. Maybe because it was Saturday night, the service was slow and the server was not attentive. But what really ruined my night was finding a hair in my salad (7 inch blond hair!!!!). I already had a bite of my meal so it really grossed me out and lost my appetite. I cancelled my order and the server had a nerve to say he took the order off the check. Really?? My drink was good after waiting for 15 minutes. I may try Cheesecake Factory  again but NOT at this LOCATION."
Ashley J.,"Tucson, AZ",67,310,214,3.0,9/22/2012,"I'm not a huge fan of chain-restaurants, but this place is pretty good. They've got HUGE portions (a half-size salad is still a towering pile of greens), but you can easily have an appetizer for a meal, which helps with price. I love the chicken lettuce wraps (an appetizer). They're also great for Happy Hour! $2 beers - even the ""imports"" is an excellent price! Plus they have a number of full-size appetizers for $5. Again - they're big enough for an entire meal so you can eat dinner for $5, have a couple $2 drinks and STILL have the total bill under 10 bucks! Can't beat that!"
Favery S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,14,,2.0,8/13/2014,Went here for Sunday brunch with my significant other. We tried the brioche french toast and the napoleon french toast. First off the brioche french toast was supposed to come with four slices but came to our table with ONE slice. Their excuse was that they ran out of bread... Both dishes were so dense and we couldn't finish more than a slice and a half. The service was subpar. It would have been one star but they comped us the failure of a meal so two stars.
Edward B.,"Tucson, AZ",0,19,,4.0,8/26/2015,"I like the cheesecake factory. Waitress Service is very good and the food is outstanding, BUT, sometimes getting the Hostess attention can be a turn off.  Someone should inform the Hostess that customer's are there to be seated ASAP. Not ignored. Or walk away from."
Jerry M.,"Tucson, AZ",46,127,390,5.0,8/12/2013,"I LOVE Cheescake and I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory and I don't understand how anyone could disagree!  My only complaint would have to be the price, in their defense the portions are big enough for 2.  They do have a lengthy menu and with all the variety of foods there is something for everyone.  I have yet to find a better cheesecake and the variety of flavors are endless! I  I usually try to rate chain restaurants based more on food than service because overall the service is pretty consistent and although they may have an off day, I'm gonna return because of the food."
Brenda S.,"Dover, DE",4,55,35,4.0,9/26/2013,"Have had a variety of meals here. Always great food for the amount of money you spend. The only thing is I hate the lighting during dinner. I can barely see so it's pretty annoying. Great experiences with dessert. I love their cheesecakes and red velvet. Mmmmm.  The service is great. Once I ordered the Steak Diane and ordered it medium rare like I always do. It took a long time to receive the order. The steak came out wayyyyyy well done. So just to make sure I cut open all the pieces of steak just to confirm. The waitress was very professional. She took the hot mess off the table and brought a new plate out which was cooked perfectly. I just wish they had gotten it right the first time as I had never waited that long for a meal at this restaurant.  Majority of the time this restaurant has great severs, warm starter bread, cleanliness, and a huge selection of meals. And now they even have a skinny menu for the calorie conscious folks. All around great food!"
Aric G.,"Sahuarita, AZ",0,2,,1.0,9/1/2015,"I visited the Cheesecake Factory (Tucson, AZ) on August 30, 2015, at approximately 3:00 P.M. It was our thirteenth wedding anniversary.  I contacted the manager there, because one of our orders did not have cheese on it. The person who brought us the dish, who was not our waitress, was very rude and unpleasant. We asked her if we could have cheese on the dish. Later, she brought the dish, but the cheese had been tossed on top without being melted. We asked for the manager. Later, he came.  I was surprised when he came, because he was unconcerned and he did not seem to care.  He leaned on my chair in a very condescending way.  I felt like he was talking down to me.  He did not do anything helpful besides patronize us. My wife and I left the restaurant very unhappy.  Sadly, this is our favorite restaurant. We have been going there for years, and we always spend over a hundred dollars there. This was our worst experience at the Cheesecake Factory . I do not know how a person like him can be a manager there. He ruined our thirteenth wedding anniversary meal!"
Christina C.,"Tucson, AZ",27,123,38,4.0,7/27/2012,"For a cheesecake lover like myself, the original cheesecake is soothing to the taste. To you, that means it's great! With strawberry drizzle and real strawberries it is mouthwatering. The other slices of cake they offer are HUGE and good too (I hear).  My burger, pizza, salad, and shrimp have always been cooked very well and do not disappoint. My only dish that I have to say I didn't think much of was the broccoli cheddar soup. :( I was very sad as that is one of my favorite's soups. Everything else is great though. All servers I have come across are very polite and attentive. This place is one of my favorites. P.S. Menu is a little pricy."
Luke S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,7,,1.0,8/28/2014,Overcooked central!! Shrimp Alfredo was absolutely terrible. Calamari was chewy. Service was spotty and found dirty silverware. I will NEVER come back.
Mark S.,"Tucson, AZ",180,502,33,4.0,7/5/2010,"We had been hesitant to venture over to the Cheesecake Factory because it just opened and we had been hearing about long waits. My wife suggested we go on the 4th of July for lunch. She is a genius! I always knew she was the brains in this outfit. The place was less than half full and we did not have to wait at all. We are seated at our table and given the 64 (OK, maybe more like 16) page menu. If you have never been to Cheesecake Factory, the menu is massive with lots of choices and I am not just talking about cheesecake. While we are reading the menu the server delivered a small basket of bread and butter. I always think this is a nice touch. We munch on the bread while we decide. After much perusal (I changed my mind three times because every time I turned the page I went ""Ooh, I want that"") and the return of the waitress, we order. We sit, chat, munch on bread and I applaud my wife for her genius decision to come for lunch on a holiday. The waitress returns and places the Grilled Chicken Club in front of my wife and the Cuban in front of me. Holy Cow! My wife's sandwich is about six inches high! My Cuban is nowhere near as large but still sizable. We dig into our food. My sandwich is very good with tender roasted pork, ham, pickles, mayo, mustard and Swiss cheese. It's a very good combination and I enjoy it. My wife struggles with her sandwich and finally decides to knife and fork it. She says it's very good but only finishes half. We did not try any of the cheesecakes. Service was very good. My wife dropped her napkin and just like that another one showed up without having to ask. Little things like that go along way when it comes to service. We will be back to the Cheesecake factory. It may even be worth waiting in line for."
Amanda R.,"Tucson, AZ",0,1,,1.0,3/28/2015,"If I could have not chosen any amount of stars I would have. First off I love the cheesecake factory, it seems to be the place my large Hispanic family chooses to meet for birthdays,anniversaries, and celebrations. Tonight march 27th 2015 my dear nieces sweet 16th birthday my family came together to celebrate and hope to have a great meal, good company and relaxing environment. Cheesecake factory Tucson was far from that. First off, they would not seat us until 80% of our party was there actually we were just missing 5 people of our 20 (don't know how they figured their math). So we waited good company in tow guys outside ladies inside. As we watched groups being seated who walked in within 5 minutes we began to get restless. Finally our entire group showed up and then we received our buzzer wait for it.. One hour and a half wait. We arrived at 7 we were not seated until almost 9 o'clock. Finally the buzzer sounds and relief we are being seated.. So we thought we began to take our seats only to find out we are 5 seats short. Hot and tired of waiting we notice a extra booth available. Asking for this booth was like asking for there first born. Ok , we are sat water poured kids happy, things are OK now so we thought. I sat in the booth with my husband two boys and my mom so we ordered. My Dad sat at the main table and the waitress waited to put my mothers order in until all 20 orders were taken. Meanwhile my little family of four received our food. My husband and mother ordered the same dish being the man I love and adore my husband received his food and gave it over to my mother so she could eat. The waitress proceeded to point out to my mother I'm sorry ma'am that's his order!? Really um really he's a respectable man who handed it over to her SK she could eat first and our waitress tried to make my mom feel bad about that, tactless. An hour later good company not so good service we are finishing up same tactless waitress comes over to my 5'2 100lb mom and says how was your food? My mom proceeds to acknowledge the waitress by saying good thank you but before she could this inexperienced waitress says ""oh I can tell!"" Excuse me so rude where is your tact go back to etiquette school. Done so done reacpect is earned not given so done with cheesecake factory we spent well over $600 as a group and we were treated like it was our problem they cannot cater to a large group of people. Excuse me for having a large Hispanic family who wants to all enjoy dinner for a special occasion. I'll remember to be a couple of two to go to cheesecake factory to be catered to. That is all."
Gus L.,"Tucson, AZ",2,3,,1.0,7/14/2014,"Cheesecake Factory on Wetmore Rd by the Tucson Mall. I ordered the cubano sandwich and hours later was deathly sick for 3 days. When i brought this matter to the attention of the Mgr there he was not sympathetic to my suffering. I've ate there several times but that would be the last time I ever eat there for the poor handling of someone getting sick at there establishment and the way they treated me over the phone. If I could give it 0 stars I would, way overrated and not worth your or my money."
Diann S.,"Torrance, CA",72,62,18,2.0,2/2/2012,"RUDE! we had reservations but whats up with getting there on time and they not even be ready? And black people are usually really late, but we were on time. they finally get us seated after 45 mins. The lemonade i had was very sugary it must have been 3/4ths sugar :/ I ordered the Steak Diane (because of the name hehe) it was good i enjoyed that. But we were  there celebrating a birthday party and they separated the tables between two servers, our table got the worst one. We had to ask multiple times for bread and she took forever. Then when the party planner said it was a birthday and asked if they had anything special the waitress brought out cheesecake but she forgot to tell us that wed be charged for it. She had no problem telling us the lemonade didn't have free refills but forgot to tell us the cheesecake was going to cost. which she then told us that if everyone with a birthday got a free slice of cake then they wouldn't have any -__- okay we had no problem with paying but you should have told us. So the girl talked to the manager about it. then the waitress who so idiotically decided to throw snarky remarks our way in earshot to a coworker. Grow up its your job and you're going to get called out on it if you mess up, not only mess up but have an attitude about it.  All in all i wouldn't come back, because of the service. tragic"
Olivia B.,"Tucson, AZ",4,66,8,4.0,8/14/2014,"Salads are so good here and a good value. I had the Asian chicken salad and my husband the luau salad. Bread is always good too, white and pumpernickel. The atmosphere is always fun too. We passed on the cheesecake but, have had it before and was nothing short of amazing!!"
Chris F.,"Tucson, AZ",20,9,,3.0,1/26/2012,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time last night, and the same thought keeps running through my head, ""So this is what I could have been experiencing since 1996?"". I can't say I was disappointed, but I think I was underwhelmed by my meal. Upon arrival, we were seated right away, which was a big plus with a baby in tow. The waitress, Josie, was cheerful and attentive throughout the evening, and my Diet Coke was constantly full. No complaints there. The place was dimly lit and fairly loud. Again, not a real problem with a tired (screaming at times) baby. I could see it being a nice place for high school student on their way to homecoming. The menu...oh, the menu, where to begin? It's large. So, if you're looking for a place to feed people with differing tastes, you'll surely be able to please everyone. My problem was indecision. So, I end up reading the whole menu, and circling back to something I consider safe: burger and fries. The fries were, I must admit, standard yet tasty. Just the right amount of salt. The burger did not live up to the potential that bacon, cheddar, BBQ sauce, and onion rings could deliver. Everything felt close to nice fast food than something costing more than twice as much. Don't get me wrong, this food wasn't about to make me sick, but it did make me long for the Vietnamese tacos sitting across the table from me. (and the crab cake sandwich I foolishly passed up) Still, I forged on. This was, after all, the factory of cake and cheese!! Dessert was not to be passed up. We went with the Key Lime Cheesecake. It came out looking wonderful. Soft whipped cream topped the plate in just the right proportion. But, when my fork hit the cake and it wobbled like rubber, I was shocked. The consistency of the cheesecake left a lot to be desired. The taste, however, was delightfully tangy and satisfying. In the end, I left full (stuffed even), but left confident that other options would not cause me to object to a return visit. However, I knew that I would not return for any of the things I'd just eaten."
Daria J.,"Tucson, AZ",0,28,48,4.0,9/4/2014,"You can have a paleo lunch here! My fav is the herb crusted salmon with asparagus, and I get broccoli in place of the potatoes, yum!"
Corey D.,"Madison, WI",1785,874,654,4.0,8/20/2011,"So here's a funny story, sometimes I'll be at a restaurant and I think something to myself about the review that I'm already planning, then I'll get home and read that I've already written a review and planned to mention the same exact thing. So here's the deal. I had a slice of turtle cheesecake today at lunch (give me a break, I'm not drinking, I need another vice) and the entire time I was eating it, I kept thinking, this is SO different than I remember. It used to be a dark chocolate crumb crust with vanilla cheesecake swirled with caramel, topped with a hard chocolate ganache, sprinkled with pecans and drizzled with a caramel sauce. Good right? Well it's not the same. And apparently I already knew that because I wrote about in my first review. I have the worst memory.  So why am I giving them another star? For the same reason that we all hate chains, it's consistent. Today I had the usual- that darn luau salad that gets me every time! As I was eating it felt comforting, I felt like I was eating something I knew (I mean I've eaten the thing 87 times, I can probably make it at home). The service at the bar was spot on, the speed and efficiency was superb, it was a great afternoon! I'm pissed that I ordered a cheesecake that apparently I didn't like in December, but such is life.  Know Before You Go: Bar seating is a great alternative when the wait is long."
Michele T.,"Tucson, AZ",0,32,11,4.0,9/6/2014,"The servings were generous, the staff efficient and the drinks delicious! Definitely will come back again!"
Daniel W.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,60,6,3.0,7/12/2014,"Our avocado egg roll appetizers went to the wrong table and sat there for 10-15 minutes before the waitress took it off of their table and directly onto ours.  The food was partially eaten! Of course, the replaced the partially eaten, cold appetizer.  We then had to return a pasta dish back to the kitchen because the pasta wasn't cooked enough.  The food ended up being decent the second time. The manager gave us 2 free cheesecake slices as an apology, but we probably won't be back anytime soon."
Vanessa Y.,"Orlando, FL",28,9,2,4.0,7/10/2014,"I've really got to give it to the Cheesecake Factory. The name says it all! Their cheesecake variety is unbelievable and I can honestly say I can't believe I waited till my third visit to finally try their cheesecakes. DELICIOUS. I do have to say their menu is a little by overwhelming as the options are endless when it comes to meal choices. It is hard to decide what to eat when there's so many choices. Their bread is delicious though, they give you different kinds of breads for all your likings. The food itself (last time I had a chicken club sandwich) is I would say average. I think my sandwich needed a little but more bacon because it was a bit bland. I am just so in love with their cheesecakes they really do walk the walk!"
