C C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,4,,1.0,7/19/2013,If you are black you will most likely be seated near the bathroom or kitchen.   I am white and my wife is black.   I usually do not like pulling the race card but we went three times and were always sat next to the bathroom.   We also noticed all the black people and some Hispanic were all in these sections.  I do not patron businesses that support bigotry.
Mark S.,"Tucson, AZ",189,81,117,4.0,6/15/2014,I have always had excellent service at Cheesecake Factory.  Very friendly outgoing service compared to other chain restaurants. Music isn't loud enough that overwhelms your conversation.  Always clean and there cheesecakes are awesome. They also have some very handsome men that work there as well.
Madeline G.,"Fullerton, CA",84,646,,4.0,12/9/2013,"I've been here quite a few times for lunch. Service is always excellent. Food is always good and the quality you expect from CF. This is my grandma's favorite place, so if she's happy, I'm happy. I still have never had the cheesecake though..."
Dana P.,"Tucson, AZ",6,9,7,4.0,6/20/2014,Food is always good.  They have a little bit of everything so no one is unsatisfied.  My husband always gets the Kobe burger and the vanilla cheesecake but I like to mix it up.  The only downside is that with such a big menu it may be difficult to choose.
Saba B.,"Tucson, AZ",371,431,79,3.0,12/2/2013,"I have to admit that I pulled my hat brim low over my eyes as I entered the Factory to pick up a white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake as my contribution to Thanksgiving this year. A Thanksgiving with no dishes, sleeping late, and satisfaction from the ""wow"" factor all played into my decision. I ordered the night before, but still waited about 15 minutes for the cake which was, by the way, delicious. Be prepared for sticker shock, though. A 10"" will set you back $50. The cheesecakes are shipped frozen, and oddly pre-sliced with wax paper between each slice. Not that I would have tried to pass off the cake as homemade, but the stiff paper garnish sticking up not only threatens a paper cut, but also screams ""I am glopped out from a big metal robot machine in an uncaring, impersonal mass production facility."" Who am I to sling a hammer at Big Brother, when everyone at dinner sang its processed praises?"
kevin m.,"Ewa Beach, HI",1,46,18,5.0,6/15/2015,be prepared to wait but its all worth it in the end huge menu from app to main to light lunch to huge desert will be back soon !!!!
Luan T.,"Tucson, AZ",0,7,1,1.0,6/21/2014,"I been to cheese cake factory once, order the seafood alfredo OMG it was the saltiest seafood alfredo I have ever eaten, the alfedo pasta was not even cook right chewy and tough. I told them it didn't taste right they ask me to order something thing else..not happy with the food or service it was over price food, for crappy food."
Shanali Z.,"Tucson, AZ",75,22,3,2.0,11/16/2011,"We were there about a month ago... Just Horrible!  We were a table of 11.  Took over 20 mins to just get water.  Bread, showed up 20min after drinks.  Food, don't even get me started!  It was almost 45 mins, before she took our order.  When we sat, we immediately ordered our normal apps.   They showed up, 5 mins before the food! She messed up our orders, missed one order completely, and then when something was said to her, she went off crying, and NEVER returned to our table! It took us another 45mins to hunt SOMEONE down to get boxes, and our check.   Not heading back for a long while; and it's sad to say, because I miss my mint sweet tea and favorite apps."
Andrew B.,"Wichita Falls, TX",138,156,36,3.0,1/4/2011,"I used to be a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory when I was in high school.  It was one of those places that you just had to go to -- kinda like Vegas when you're in college.  You feel almost empowered going, because it's cool and hip and everyone else does it.  Cramming a crowd of friends into a booth (or a two bedroom room in Vegas) is awesome when you're living it up under the artifice of luxury!  After having lunch there a couple days ago, though, I realized -- now?  Not so much. The food tastes fine, the menu covers just about everything, and I've had nothing but pleasant service, but everything from the pasta to the plaster on the walls is merely facsimile of what actually makes a restaurant great.  Massive plates of food, sky-high painted ceilings -- the vibe truly is Las Vegas lite.  The difference is, unlike Las Vegas where the facade of fanciness can be eschewed for actual quality and luxury, you're always stuck with something that is less than the genuine article at The Cheesecake Factory.  Eating here is like wearing a Faux-lex watch with pride. Still, it's a very pretty Faux-lex, and the people selling you the Faux-lex are very good at what they do, and I cannot fault anyone for being good at his or her job.  That said, if you've got more discerning tastes, there are definitely better places to spend your money.   Also, I make better cheesecake than they do :P"
Gilbert T.,"Tucson, AZ",7,250,62,4.0,3/4/2015,"I am tempted to give this place five stars, however there are some things that I do not like.  First, it is crazy overpriced!  The food is pretty good, but you will pay a lot if you eat here, especially if you get alcohol.  Second, the service can be slow,.  Not unbearable, but again not worth the five star rating.  Last, I do not like some of the seating.  They have these weird seats that are part booth, part table, and you are literally eating your meal right next to a stranger.  I do not like this, and have often had to ask the waiter to switch my wife and I tables.  Other than that the chicken romano is fantastic.  They also give you enough food to feed two people, which is good because I hate shelling out a ton of money and not getting enough food.  The cheesecake is also great.  We get the Adam's one, and it is really yummy.  Check this place out, but be prepared to drop some money though."
Kyle H.,"Tucson, AZ",1,5,,2.0,1/29/2012,"What an interesting place.... The menu is HUGE as is the footprint of the establishment. Honestly I feel like most people are in awe of the faux grandeur of the decor. Anyway on a very nice Saturday evening my girlfriend and I were sat within a minute of arriving. This always seems to be the case w/ TCF, which is a positive because at least you have your own space to wait long periods of time before you actually interact with someone that will take your drink order (then 10 minutes later your food order). The service just seemed to be slow and uncoordinated. Food wise: The size of the menu basically says 'we don't do anything really well but we'll make anything you want and do it adequately'. As always being the adventurous  one I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich w/ fries. The girlfriend ordered Mexican inspired fish tacos. Lets get down and dirty: the fries were pretty damn good, the sandwich was fair (for the price I expected it to be better than Chick-a-Fil, but it wasn't) and my soda was mixed very well. During the course of eating I asked my lady how she liked her tacos and asked her if they were better than Rubio's (the fast food joint) and surprisingly she said no.  Now I know I'm comparing fast food to a supposedly luxurious sit down establishment but my point is that when you don't specialize you fail. It's hard to do one thing beautifully let alone 60+ dishes. My take: this place is great for larger groups because the menu is large enough that anyone can find something they like on it. But if you're going with just one other individual be wise in your decision and be ready for an average meal at an extraordinary price.  Disclaimer: I've had the cheesecake during previous visits and it's been great but the dessert doesn't make the meal or the experience."
Priscila B.,"Boise, ID",108,188,165,4.0,2/11/2012,"Great place for casual dinning and of course, their cheesecake is just too good to pass on. The quantity is very large so watch out on your food intake so you can have dessert"
Jerry L.,"Tucson, AZ",0,15,2,4.0,4/15/2015,Update: just had a wonderful dinner at the cheesecake factory - new management maybe? Excellent service! Had a delicious chipotle pasta dish with chicken.  We will return...
Joseph L.,"Tucson, AZ",254,202,109,3.0,11/28/2010,"Used go to the one in Chicago  a lot... most of the time just go for dessert and coffee..had dinner there once I think. wasn't anything special as far as I remember but this time really made an impression...I mean a BIG ONE...here is the story...I got invited to my friend's mom's house for Thanksgiving dinner so I offered bring dessert...good idea? I think so...then I was tried to think  where should I go to get some nice desserts that everyone will like....""DING!!!"" Cheesescake factory!!! brilliant!!!! I was kind of proud of myself for a sec here...but not so fast... Wednesday night I went to pick up the cake...after 10min I had made up my mind what to get...then I was think...why dont I just have dinner here since I got nothing else to do?...another...""brilliant!!!"" so I sat down ordered some pasta that was just ok (olive garden standard) ...but my server was really helpful getting my cakes and amount other things. Everything was good.. Right? now its time to go home...Check please...here is your check have a great night sir!!   I looked! looked again...$95.63.. I though it was pretty funny!!"
Franco L.,"Tucson, AZ",1,3,3,5.0,1/7/2014,"The food tasted great, there was plenty of it, and the service was excellent. We waited only around 15 minutes to get our order. Definitely will be going there again soon."
June W.,"Pleasanton, CA",26,180,96,4.0,2/17/2014,"I know what Cheesecake Factory food is like, so this review is about the service - fantastic! Nothing like getting good service, and reasonably good food very late on a Sunday night when everyone else is already closed. Chelsea was a great waitress, very patient with us. Thanks!"
Ike D.,"Phoenix, AZ",16,38,21,4.0,12/3/2011,"Hey, The Fiancee and I ate lunch here today. and a nice tip for those of you 21+ couples is to just go straight to the high tops in the bar if their are any available. It's full service and there is no wait. Even at dinner hour when there is a 45min + wait watch those tables like a hawk and you might just luck out.  It's fairly expensive, but I've never had a bad experience the past half a dozen times I've been there.  Service is always polite, bread is always warm and soft. I'll always order something new off their menu all good, and my partner sticks to their shrimp scampi pasta or the tomato basil pasta. The red velvet cheesecake is our favorite and definitely deserves a recommendation. -Ike"
Pat L.,"Tucson, AZ",22,72,1,4.0,7/5/2013,"Just had lunch here for the first time and I was very happy.  While the portion size is a little over the top and the prices a little high - it was well worth it today.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive even though he cut off the tip of his finger while prepping bread for our table!!!!   As a vegetarian it is hard to find something worth eating that isn't smothered in CHEESE!!!!!  He told me that I could order any salad without meat, so selected the Asian Salad which was HUGE!!!  The flavors were wonderful!  Slightly sweet and chock full of bean sprouts, shredded lettuce, chopped peanuts, cilantro, red cabbage, rice noodles, wontons and other goodies!  If I had one thing to complain about it was the amount of chopped green onions....they need to tone these down.  The dressing was light and nicely done, not saturating the salad.  I loved it! My husband had the Blue Cheese Bacon burger - he really liked it but found that half way through the first half he had to use a fork/knife as it became too gooey.  This did not stop him or ruin his experience.  Nice fries were served with the burger in addition to the thick crispy bacon on the burger, toasted bun, thick tomato and about a 1/2 pound of meat!!!!  He cleaned the plate, so I guess he liked it. Just prior to the meal we were served a basket of a slightly sweet dark wheat bread and French bread which helped to keep us happy until our meals arrived.  The wait time was very minimal.   Overall - we really enjoyed the place and will go back!"
Kenye N.,"Tucson, AZ",19,15,,2.0,9/15/2010,"Shame on you Tucson!  Shame on you for making this place the huge success it is.  You go to a restaurant that is named after the frozen, not made-in-house cheesecake they serve and their Chili's caliber of food!  All of this while places like Candela (now closed) and Chef Alishah's barely get any customers.   Now, I probably wouldn't have even bothered reviewing this place if I hadn't read the rather humorous five star review from a server there.  While I can sympathize with some of the things she's said (as I've worked in the restaurant industry) I think most of her complaints are totally unprovoked.  Reading through reviews I only found a couple of people who mentioned any problems with the staff.  The two or three times I've eaten there I've had quite lovely service.  And while she complains, even if she has most tables tip her 10% she still makes a killing.  By the way I'm not a skimpy tipper.  Not sure why I throw that in there, but I feel it's important. Now you're probably thinking I'm a big hypocrite for eating here three times, but I'll just say it was against my will.  See my Dad is one of those people that believes this along with P.F. Chang's are the best Tucson has to offer.  So when I get offered a free meal, I'm not going to turn it down. Now I'll admit it, of the three meals I've had there one was quite good, one was good, and only one was disappointing.  The Cajun Chicken ""Fritters"" (I think that's what they  were called) were quite good.  The burger I had there however was uber disappointing.  It didn't live up to their standards of ""huge portions"" and looked wimpy compared to other meals.  I was sad.  They don't do bad food, but in my opinion it's not even up to snuff with other chains like Olive Garden or Claimjumpers. The thing I find really silly is how people believe their cheesecake is the best on the planet.  Cheesecake is by far my favorite dessert, and I've had some phenomenal cheesecakes, but this isn't one of them.  I am also a cheesecake purist, meaning I think anything except plain cheesecake is sacrilege.  The fact they aren't made in house is the final nail in their coffin.  That being said, again they aren't terrible, but they don't deserve to have a restaurant named after them. A Yelp review isn't really necessary for this, as most of you aren't people who would frequent chain places, but I guess this will show up on Google too.  If you're a Tucsonian that has to support big business look into supporting Fox Concept restaurants.  You actually get great food there and you spend about the same amount!  I really wish more people would go out and support local businesses, that is where Tucson's real individuality shines.  Read through reviews here on Yelp, and you'll find more than a few gems! Support local business Tucson!  Support local business!!!"
Ricky V.,"Tucson, AZ",349,221,18,4.0,1/6/2012,"The large part of my experiences with TCF is with larger groups and time and again I am impressed. When you got 10-18 people looking for a place to eat its amazing that this place is adaptable to accommodation. This time I had a great pasta that was properly oiled and graced with proportionate amounts of tomatoes, herbs, and feta cheese that was just a great meal.  We also had those fried zucchini sticks with the mozzarella atop. but it was obviously from a prepared and refrigerated mix, since it melted far to slow. Hand grinding is usually thinner imparts some warmth and melts faster. That's how i know. The drinks came out in good time, or waters were always filled, and the waitress was very nice even though we continue to invite our difficult friend. He makes for laughs and assures me that our hosts ""earn"" their keep. He's not mean, he is challenging.  Anyways while the huge menu, and service are very good there are things that keep the restaurant from reaching the top echelon. Perhaps a higher end selection or more paired items. I think a menu revamp should be in order. Surprisingly this has a lot of  sub conscious behavioral affects on people."
