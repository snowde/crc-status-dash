Marc S.,"Tucson, AZ",59,21,1,5.0,7/26/2013,"First I will start with, I'm picky. I've even taught customer service seminars. My first visit to the talked about Cheesecake Factory was outstanding. I met my daughter there for her birthday. The place looked busy so I thought the customer service my lax a little...nope. We were greeted promptly by not one but two servers. (one was in training, however you would never know it.) Our drinks were ordered and quickly came. Plus a often overlooked aspect, they asked if we wanted water with our drinks. (so many places miss this small gesture.) I ordered the Chicken Madeira. Our food came out quite quickly for as busy as it was. (OMG! It was awesome!) I tried each of my families foods. (Chicken Alfredo, Mini-Corn Dogs, Won tons, etc.) All were flawless. Finally came dessert. (You can't be at the Cheesecake factory and not get a cheesecake.) I ordered the Cherry Cheesecake and my daughter ordered the original. I was not disappointed. Tasted just like my moms home made cherry Cheesecake...yum! We got the bill and to my surprise it was reasonable. For the atmosphere, service and food quality this place is on my list as one of the tops!"
Emily O.,"Kihei, HI",258,149,70,4.0,7/27/2010,"I can't help but express confusion whilst dining at the Cheesecake Factory.  There's a million items on the menu, making it extremely difficult to narrow your options.  And what the heck is with the decor?!  It's like Candyland, meets Egyptian goddess, meets Italian styled ceiling art?  However, I have been twice and have left pleasantly plump and happy both times. If you are a dieter...forget it.  Nothing on the menu is calorie friendly.  Even the ""Weight Management Salads"" are packed with 590 calories!  The Cheesecake Factory is meant for everyone to forget about the fat/calorie intake, and splurge a little.  I have indulged in the Asian Chicken Salad, which was fantastic.  I've tried the herb crusted salmon as well, which was also fabulous.  However, I do have to say the Red Velvet Cheesecake is worth writing home about times 10!!  YUM YUM YUM."
Breelyn S.,"Sun City, AZ",2,11,6,1.0,9/24/2013,"Based on my expirence I will not be coming back... This place is ridicoulous. I was there last sunday about 3ish They forgot to bring out the birthday cake I had brought for my friend. -I came in before i picked up my friend flr lunch to drop her cake off. I asked the hostess to put it in the freezer. I EVEN ASKED HER TO REMEBER ME. I told her i would be back in 40 minutes with the bday girl. I want her check and the cake to be brought out for a suprise dessert. When we finished our meal our server comes over and hands us a dessert menu! I was freaking out because at that moment i realized the server didnt know about the cake! I walked over to the hostess that i spoke with earlier. I told her i dont think the waiter knows about the cake. And she goes ""what cake"" ARE YOU KDDING ME TO FORGET SOMETHING IS ONE THING BUT FOR ME TO COME UP AND REMIND YOU AND YOU STILL CANT REMEBER THAT IS JUST FLAT OUT CARELESSNESS. At that point my friend got suspicous of what was going on. When i sat back down i watched the hostess to make sure she would tell my server. AN SHE STILL DIDNT!!! After 3 minutes of watching her stand at the hostess stand i went and told the server myself. He was also unaware that i wanted to pay for the bday girls bill. My server was way to busy and overwhelemed - our server was nice however we waited for 12 minutes without getting greeted. When he finally did come by he said ""hi ladies it will be just one more minute."" IVE ALREADY BEEN WAITING FOR 12. He came back 5 minutes later and it took him a intial 4 minutes to get the drinks out. THAN when he dropped off the drinks i told him im ready to order an he said oh i will be back in a just a moment! REALLLY ?! I was already there for almost 30 minutes. He took about 5 minutes to come back and take our order. Even though he was the one that provided us service i blame management. When i looked around he was serving ALOT OF TABLES. Management should know how much each server can handle. I felt bad for our server even though he was Wpissing me off. I would provide the same sucky service if i had as many tables as him too!  The only thing good was the food but it was pricey."
Kyann M.,"Goodyear, AZ",4,98,,4.0,7/11/2012,"My daughter and I went here for dinner....okay, dessert.....on Monday evening. We each just ordered a light meal and then split a piece of chocolate tuxedo cheesecake. I had the lettuce wraps and she had a salad, both of which were quite good. As for the cheesecake, of course, it was delicious. We arrived at about 5:00 and were seated promptly. The restaurant was about 1/2 full at the time. Our server did a great job and was very attentive. Overall a good experience."
Aaron S.,"Tucson, AZ",12,99,9,4.0,6/3/2012,"Great appetizers, great food (especially the grilled shrimp BLT), nice atmosphere, good service."
Josh G.,"Tucson, AZ",1,8,,1.0,5/23/2014,I'm never one to complain about a restaurant but the bistro shrimp pasta literally made me ill. The shrimp was fried in what tasted like used motor oil. The pasta was so al dente it might as well have still been in the box. Sent back and ordered a good burger. The final straw was when they tried to charge for the most disgusting pasta I'd ever tasted. Never again.
Cody T.,"Tucson, AZ",0,19,,4.0,6/15/2012,"Always way above average, especially for a national chain.  Lots to choose from, too!  Portions are way bigger than they need to be, so come hungry and prepare to take half home.  Try the red velvet cheesecake - my personal favorite!"
Michael C.,"El Paso, TX",8,36,11,3.0,11/23/2011,"Food is good as expected. My concern is the 1st time I came by was before the dinner rush and service was great. The 2nd time was during the rush and noticed a big drop in the quality of service. Also, both times we were there other people near us had problems with their orders."
CJ F.,"Tucson, AZ",10,35,11,3.0,12/5/2011,"I had high hopes for this place. They didn't really live up to them. The food is good. I have eaten there a few times, and I enjoyed my burger with sweet potato fries the most... I think I would have given a 4 star, but it's called the cheesecake factory, and the cheesecake tastes more like a traditional cake with cream cheese frosting. :/ I was giddy when looking into the dessert case while waiting to be seated. I couldn't finish my meal (already full), so I got a piece to go. An hour later, I dived in, and discovered the cheesecake wasn't very cheesecakey. It was still good though... Okay 3 1/2 stars. Good burgers are not hard to find, and I can get actual cheesecake at other places, but this place wasn't a bad place to eat."
Lavender G.,"Tucson, AZ",0,19,,3.0,8/8/2011,"I have gone here several times and was pleased with it.  However, My husband and I went Saturday night for an early dinner (which means it was not crowded yet and there were plenty of empty tables).  We sat on the patio, which is nice even in the Tucson heat, and the misters were going full force.  It was unfortunate that they sat us in the middle of the patio where we were basically soaked by the misters.  Well, our bodies weren't soaked, but our table and everything on it kept getting very wet, and we had to continually wipe things off!  I know the value of having misters in the summer heat here in the desert, but this was ridiculous.  Since the service seemed to be very slow for some reason (did I say it was not crowded?) we decided to relocate to a table that was a little more sheltered.  They really should have removed the tables that were closest to the misting and only used those on the peripheral, even if it meant that later on a few parties may have to wait a little longer to be seated.  Our server was very friendly, perhaps a bit too much so.  He was a ""cool"" dude who had all the right comments and facial expressions as well as proper hand gestures that would put him into the ""cool"" category.  I dunno...I have become more annoyed recently with people in jobs that service the public.  They seem to think they need to become my new best friend, and it's cute at first but after a few minutes of it I do become quite annoyed and just wish they would do their job.  I like friendly and pleasant, but let's draw a line.  Anyway, the food was good...we split a burger plate and side salad, and it was great that we did otherwise we never would have been able to eat a full one each.  The waiter tried his best to talk us into a piece of cheesecake for dessert, but we really were too full and prefer to not take one ""to go"".  I promised the waiter I would return very soon and enjoy a piece of cheesecake and cup of coffee and he was happy with that.  LOL Could have been a better experience, but the food here is usually very good and their menu has so many choices it is often hard to make a decision.  My recommendation?  Go there for lunch and just have piece of cheesecake and some coffee...you'll be glad you did!  :)"
Jennifer P.,"La Grange, IL",0,3,,1.0,8/11/2012,I am writing about the horrific experience I just had at the Tucson cheesecake factory.  To start the evening we were informed there were no ribeye steaks after we had ordered.  That was the least disturbing part of the evening.  Our appetizers arrives and the wrong dressing was mixed on our salad-still tolerable.  While waiting for our entrees the bar area where we were seated slowly became the place to hang out for all the under age college kids-most of which were beyond intoxicated and clearly not of age.  There was a steady parade people to and from the outside seating area which unfortunately the door Was located next to our table.  Several girls were allowed to parade in and out without shoes...BAREFOOT!! They were allowed to sit at the bar tables BAREFOOT!!  I have always thought of the cheesecake factory as a higher class restaurant than what I witnessed tonight.  As a young physician just the health code violations were astonishing to me.  The Service was subpar and the intoxicated underage college students inappropriately dressed for even the lowest quality establishment was unacceptable.
Jen W.,"Tucson, AZ",70,498,27,3.0,12/11/2010,"Great for take-out cheesecake slice orders for when you are hosting a party and don't want people to suffer through your baking attempt (that took you ten hours but you pretend only took you one hour).  A couple of my friends have eaten the pasta and mashed potatoes here; they love them.  I ate a pizza here one time and had the mini chicken sandwiches which reminded me of Chick-Fil-A!  I like the chopped salads!  If you love chocolate, they have tons of triple chocolate cakes. Now for the cheesecake, I remember it being around $6 for a slice.  My guests liked the banana cream the best.  A couple of the servers said that they liked the dulce de leche and the white chocolate raspberry.  I think the cheesecake is good, especially for a special treat for a house party because it's not something my friends would normally buy themselves.  As far as the food, I just prefer supporting some of our creative local restaurants when you want someplace nice. :)"
Steven L.,"Tucson, AZ",2,39,,4.0,7/20/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory to me, is a more ""upscale"" sit down family style fast food restaurant (think Applebee's, Friday's, et al.). If you ""must"" go to one of those chain places, choose the Cheesecake Factory.  Nicer atmosphere, better and fresher food, and usually better service. I am actually surprised at some of the negative reviews for this place. I have never had a negative experience in the many locations across the country that I've gone to. The Tucson and Chandler, AZ locations were no different. The portions are huge. I consider myself an eater and I have yet to finish my appetizers and my main course. As such, I didn't order any of their cheesecake! Oh well, good entrees make good leftovers. Perhaps I wasn't on my A game those nights.  If you can't decide on any local places, the Cheesecake Factory is quick, easy, and good."
Betty T.,"Tucson, AZ",3,18,,2.0,9/28/2011,"The waiter was very polite and responsive to our needs. I found the atmosphere to be quiet and relaxing. So why the 2 stars? The restuarent was a third full, and we waited almost an hour for our food to arrive. Four people at our table ordered salmon, and the waiter came back out after 10 minutes and said they were out of salmon. The food was ok, but nothing special at all. Definetely not worth the cost. This place is definetely overrated!"
Jack T.,"Tucson, AZ",92,62,10,3.0,2/7/2010,"I'm eating leftover fried mac and cheese balls as I'm typing this.  It was reheated in the microwave.  It's still divine.  It's a chain restaurant so I won't bother going in-depth.  Visit their website if you want visuals, they all look pretty much the same.  Here's the run-down on service and food if you've never been here. There was a 30-minute wait at about 9:30pm Saturday.  The main hostess was extremely friendly and smiley.  I asked the hostess that was walking me to the table, ""How are you?"" and she decided to tell me how busy the place and how much she loved it, then forced a smile.  She was either overenthusiastic about her job or the restaurant implanted a chip in her brain to make sure she would be shocked whenever she frowned. The server was nice and knowledgeable.  She was about average when it comes to attentiveness, but the bussers paid excellent attention to refills and bread.   The bread comes out warm.  It comes in both French and rye with little packaged pads of butter.  Here's what I ordered: 1-Patrón ""El Diablo"" which had Patrón Silver, Cointreau, Grapefruit, Pomegranate.  It was strong and tasty but tasted hardly like grapefruit or pomegranate. My companion ordered a sangria, which was unimpressive and more tannic than refreshing. 2-Crispy Artichoke Hearts, Lemon Garlic Dip The dip is heavy but the artichokes were irresistable. 3-Ahi Tuna Tartare, Avocado, Soy-Ginger Sesame Sauce  The four chips were too greasy but the rest of the appetizer melted in my mouth delightfully. 4-Beets, Goat Cheese, Apples, Baby Arugula, Pecans Simple combination of good ingredients.  There weren't enough beets for me to consider it a beet dish though. 5-Fried Mac and Cheese Balls, Creamy Marinara The ideal blend of gooey and creamy.  The accompanying creamy marinara sauce was way too sweet and wasn't necessary at all to enjoy the dish. 6- Crispy Crab Wontons, Green Onion, Water Chestnuts, Sweet Chili. Worse part of the meal.  The sweet chili sauce was way too vinegary and made the whole thing taste like pickles.  Literally.  The water chestnuts don't go well with the crispy wonton wrapper. I ate too much to have room for cheesecake.  Blasphemy, I know.  I'll try it next time. Aside from the creepy Stepford attitude of the staff, my experience was very enjoyable."
Mindy S.,"Tucson, AZ",25,170,29,2.0,10/5/2010,"I guess I should have known that a place called The Cheesecake Factory would serve cheesecake that tasted like it came from a factory. My bad. But if your ""thing"" is cheesecake, you should probably not be serving crap out of a box for $8 a slice. Just sayin'."
Harlequin L.,"Chicago, IL",22,44,5,3.0,11/11/2011,"When it first opened in 2010, it was the boom.  I took three different people to this location.  They had the best java mocha too.  I didnt like the conceited ness of the host females; thats why i took a star off.  I think this place was cozy to sit down, and the fact that it was new and in boring tucson amazed me"
Alma B.,"Gilbert, AZ",79,146,56,4.0,3/1/2010,"My family and I visited this place on a recent tuesday evening, we got there before 6pm, checken in with the Hostess who gave us a pager and  a 15 minute wait time estimate.  As it normally happens, the pager was vibrating when it was handed to me, and the hostess told me it would do the same when ready, so I walk aside to wait, pager in hand and everything seems fine just one little thing is odd, pager NEVER STOPPED vibrating! Now having worked as a hosstes before, the last thing I wanted to say was ""It's vibrating already"" because seriously people that joke gets annoying. Fast. Thinking that maybe the pager was  broken I walked up to the hosstes and informed her that my pager had not stopped vibrating since she had handed it to me, to which she responded: Oh that's because your table is ready. Really. Then why was I handed a pager in the first place? I hand her my pager and she tells me to stand to the side and we would be taken to our table, and so we did, we stood and stood and stood, and hosts came and went asking us if we were, X,Y,Z, party of 1,2,3, but never Alma party of 4. After 10 min of standing I went and asked the hosstes if we would be seated shortly, she asked me if we had checked in, so I explained to her, bla,bla,bla someone finally came and took us to our table.  Finally settled at a table we begun to peruse the menu. Ordered some avocado eggrolls as an appetizer, which turned out to be very yummy, not the best I have tried but they satisfied. Entrees included the Chicken and Biscuits, Wasabi Crusted Tuna and a BBQ Salmon dish. These were all very large portions, and surprisingly on the Tuna side very delicious too. The menu is huge and I felt like I needed a Cheesecake Factory menu for dummies just to get through it all. Service was good, but needs a little more polishing, and since it hasn't been open for that long the deal with the hostess forgetting us is understandable.  It was pricy but I was expecting it."
Patricia O.,"New Orleans, LA",9,54,15,2.0,3/24/2011,"I used to go to the cheesecake factory a lot in Seattle. I've been to all three in Seattle and they all shared the same consistency in service and food quality. I expected this location to be the same way. I was wrong. I order my usual, the Hibachi Steak & JW's Pink Lemonade. The food was served to me about 10 minutes after ordering so I assumed it was be very hot and fresh. My steak was lukewarm and the wasabi mashed potatoes were cold. The only thing hot on the plate was the tempura asparagus, which was the best part of it. Will I return? Most likely, since it's one of my favorite restaurants, but I'll make sure my food is hot or the chef will be getting the plate returned to him."
Stephen G.,"Tucson, AZ",17,246,28,1.0,8/28/2010,"Noisy, overpriced, and uninspired mediocre food, Not even the cheescake is as good as many other places. Service was only so so. Took forever for our meeet and greet and the pace didn not get better from there. Nice decor, but did I say it was NOISY."
