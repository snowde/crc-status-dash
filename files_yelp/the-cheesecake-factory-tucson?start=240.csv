Phil K.,"Tucson, AZ",3,45,,3.0,6/8/2011,"Visited with a large group.  The wait staff was very attentive and helpful.  I am giving three stars since the food was pretty good, but not amazing.  A little pricey, but I guess that is to be expected."
Justin R.,"San Francisco, CA",4,34,,4.0,3/1/2010,"This place just opened so expect a wait line if you go at any busy dinner time throughout the week.  The first time I came they told me it would be a 80 minute, tonight it was just 10 minutes or so.  Ask for bread at the beginning, the dark bread is just like outbacks (very dank).  They have everything from seafood, burgers, pizza, thai, to pasta and it all looked very good.  The biggest problem I had was with the prices, everything was marked up (my lemonade was 5 dollars, stay away from that).  Very good for a date, too pricy for a casual night out."
Johannan S.,"Tucson, AZ",16,8,,5.0,10/19/2010,"Excellent place, Portions are great, staff is  nice and knowledgeable of their items if you are a first timer waiters give you good suggestion, I am coming back!"
Lindsay H.,"Tucson, AZ",5,10,,2.0,10/11/2010,One star for atmosphere and one for food and portion size. Negatives: no reservations...why! We waited 2hrs to get seated and then didn't eat for another 40mins. Oh yeah and u don't get a bday cheesecake slice for free...the only thing free is the lame song they sing you. Don't go on a Saturday with a group of more than 2.
Anna W.,"Tucson, AZ",39,117,88,4.0,12/1/2010,Love it!  Portions are always so big.  I love their ahi tuna salad and all their yummy chessecakes.
Liz D.,"Saint Johns, FL",11,486,,3.0,5/5/2010,"I met up with some friends two days ago after I'd already eaten dinner a couple of hours beforehand. I wasn't hungry, but that doesn't mean that the smells of the food being eaten near me and the size of their menu didn't make me wonder if I couldn't just squeeze in a few more calories. So, we did. My boyfriend and I shared a nachos appetizer because I let him pick and he's not adventurous. So, nachos it was. Our friend's had already started with drinks before we got there and raved about the place to us (we'd never been there). They ordered a chicken pasta and turkey sandwich which came with fries. This was an adventure of itself as the last time they were there, my friend's dad was there and ordered this specific sandwich. Out of laziness or really believing this was a rare delicacy only thought up and asked for by his father, my friend called his dad on behalf of his girlfriend (my friend) to find out what was on that sandwich. Turns out it was just a club.  Anyways, the food took awhile (they were busy as it was 7pm on a Saturday), but the drinks stayed full by our waitress who kept stopping by to check on us. The food came and their's looked really good, the few fries I was forced to eat by my friend who couldn't help but share were really good. Our nachos? Eh. I've had better at an Applebees or even Taco Bell, but it did look fancy. I picked everything off of the few that I ate and just nibbled the overly salted chips. For nearly $10, I would have expected better. And with a menu as long as their's I'm sure that won't be a problem next time.  When we were all done, the waitress stopped by and shoved what looked like a dessert menu in my hand. No one else, just me. I thought was not only strange, but rude as I was in the middle of telling a story when she stopped by and hadn't even realized what happened until I looked down and had to tell her No Thanks. Just a little creepy. The person who said this place is loud was dead on. Our friend kept yelling everything he was saying which would have seemed a little rude, but this place is pretty noisy.  Three stars."
Natalie M.,"Tucson, AZ",76,2,,2.0,3/14/2011,"First of all the hostess completely ignored me while I stood there to get a table while accommodating others who walked up after me. The wait wasn't bad but we had arrived early because my Dad, a type I diabetic needs to eat on time. The seating there felt a bit like we were cattle being corralled into little stalls. The waitress acted a bit like she was in a forced labor camp. When my Dad ordered a BLT she assured us that item was NOT on the menu, which did have a BLT salad and a BLT with shrimp which he agreed was fine. Every request from there on was clearly a burden for her to fulfill. The food was actually pretty good, hence the two stars, but was not worth the hassle. I'll go next time I have relatives in town who insist on it, but prefer decent customer service for my $$"
rubylee r.,"Tucson, AZ",1,61,,1.0,5/9/2010,"You are kidding me! An hour wait, no opportunity to make a reservation for later in the day. AND no seating to wait.   So what? You wait for an hour for the table, you wait for the wait staff to come to your table, you wait for your food, you wait for them to remember that you are at your table to bring you your check.. This is supposed to be a service industry, not a cattle herding industry."
Tom K.,"Vail, AZ",1,4,,1.0,6/26/2012,Don't eat here if you're at all health conscious. Their ready made frozen entrees are some of the highest fat and sodium offerings of any chain restaurant in the country. And don't get me started on the cheesecake. I'm a native New Yorker and I don't think these mediocre offerings are going to put the Carnegie Deli out of business any time soon. Tucson is pretty weak in the restaurant offerings but you can do so much better than this place. Try freshly prepared food people!
Joe K.,"Tucson, AZ",0,5,5,5.0,12/28/2012,"Wow!  Tonight the food was really exceptional!  I have been here several times over the past few years and most of the time it is a 3.5 to 4, not bad, but not over the top either. But I am really happy to say tonight they really did a fantastic job not only on my meal, but my wife, mother and kids meals. I had to first off assess if it was perception because I was hungry or was it the food and service that were really good, I wasn't starving or anything, but was looking forward to a good meal with the family. First off, I think this is the first time I have tried the Clam Chowder they serve on Friday's.  I consider myself pretty much a snob in the area of New England Clam chowder and have had some of the best over on the coast in New England's land of seafood.  This was really outstanding.  It had the right balance of potatoes, cream, butter and very good tasting clams.  I tend to really rate a chowder by it having a lot of clams, and this has a lot.  It was just wonderful. I did ask if it was made there and was told they do make it fresh. The only item for improvement was I like a few crackers, either oyster or even some regular square, but they don't have any, and even the waiter said he didn't understand it either, but he brought some more bread and all was well.  Still invest in a few crackers, sounded like others are asking for them as well. Next was the Classic Burger I ordered.  I am very picky about getting medium or medium rare with my beef, and this was perfect.  Warm pink center, and light and crispy on the outside, and very juicy inside, but not elbow drenching over the top juiciness. It was solid, beefy and the bread was toasted and the red onion patty was grilled just right.  Whoever was working the grill did an outstanding job.  They call it a chophouse burger, so I assume this means a chopped steak like sirloin or something. The secret to a juicy burger is using fatty burger or ground steak, and this was it.  It was really great, and it came along with a herb mayonnaise sauce that was really tasty. Everyone at the table had a small wedge of it and all said superb. It was arguably the best burger I have had in a long time. I think the one that comes close to it is Zinburger over on East River Road, great burger there too. Only improvement is choice of potatoes, it would be a nice menu add if they do a nice crispy baked potato, but they only offer mashed and fries, but that isn't why I ordered the burger.  The burger stood on its own very well. Lastly, we ordered cheese cake, and this is the first time I have ordered the Fresh Banana Cheesecake, it was simply wonderful.  I have an affection for cream and bananas, so I am biased in this area, but this was well balanced, well chilled cheesecake and the bananas were clearly fresh.  All blended and tasted smooth and complementary. Lastly was the service, we had several people bring food and asking if we needed things, and they followed up correctly.  The main waitress was Alina.  She was engaging, helpful, full of energy and made sure our drinks were kept full and knowledgeable when I asked questions about the food.  Great service.  I also liked the fact that they brought the various courses are the right times and we weren't rushed with the main course coming when we were only half way through the first soups and salads.   Definitely going back.  BTW, this was a Friday evening, so I am wondering if they don't staff all areas with the more veteran and seasoned staff, but I know I haven't always been there on a busy Friday evening.   My families meals of spaghetti, and broccolini pasta and sausage meals were really great too, everyone was very happy when we left with out meals and doggy bags! Final thing, it would be nice if you had wifi, there was conversation going on and we all wanted to check something online to add to our conversation, but nothing.  or get a cell booster installed, because you can't get a cell signal in there at all."
mike h.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,16,,3.0,2/2/2011,"Went there for dinner last night with a party of 5, not a long wait, maybe 15 minutes, this cheesecake factory is pretty big so the waits probably not going to be bad.  The waiter was friendly, we had a slight mishap when the salmon my mom order came out literally frozen on the inside.  They did fix that and the rest of the food is decent.  Sometimes chain restaurants are the safest way to go when your in a small town like Tucson.  Cheescakes food is never the very best but its just a touch over decent."
Greg L.,"Tucson, AZ",2,23,,3.0,8/11/2010,Reliable food and extensive menu.  Good place to go if you need an extensive menu to keep everyone happy.
Girl G.,"Tucson, AZ",1,34,6,4.0,5/25/2010,Huge portions. Good comfort food. Fabulous cheesecake.  Wait staff is extremly friendly and knowledgable. The only thing keeping it from being a 5-star experience is the price. Good for a splurge now and then but I definitely can't afford to be a regular.
Ana C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,58,3,3.0,1/27/2012,definitely not for dieters...can get packed...huge menu selection albeit a bit overpriced...try the chicken bellagio! yum
Caron M.,"Tucson, AZ",13,34,28,1.0,6/28/2010,"After a long day shopping, a friend and I ventured into the newly opened location at Tucson Mall for an early dinner. I'd heard the restaurant served one variety of gluten-free cheesecake, so although no gluten-free menu was posted on their website we ventured in. We didn't have to wait long for a table, and once we can down, I explained that I have Celiac and therefore couldn't eat anything with gluten. The waitress was very nice and said they while they have no printed gluten-free menu, she would check with the chef about safe choices for me. She came back a few minutes later and said I couldn't eat anything on the regular menu (one item on the specials would be ok with a few changes) but they could cook me a piece of chicken breast and some steamed vegetables. Not quite what I have in mind when I go out to eat, so we skipped straight to dessert. I asked about the gluten-free cheesecake and she said it was the Godiva chocolate one. The cheesecake isn't made at the restaurant (its made daily in a factory and trucked in) so I didn't need to worry about cross contamination in their kitchen. The plates of cheesecake arrived quickly and we dug in. It was ok - very rich and heavy, but extremely one-note (to me, good cheesecake in New York style - a complex slightly sour flavor). But about ten minutes later, my stomach was in pain - definitely a reaction to gluten that lasted the rest of the weekend. I don't know if they used a knife to cut my slice that was contaminated from cutting another type of cheesecake, or if the factory was the source of the contamination, or if the cheesecake, while flourless, wasn't actually gluten free, but I sure won't be doing that again."
