Roland W.,"Tucson, AZ",17,132,541,4.0,6/4/2016,"I like the variety to choose from here. My family tried several items from their appetizer and ""Small Plates & Snacks"" section. Service was superb and the cheesecake here is consistently good."
Courtney P.,"Tucson, AZ",1,12,,2.0,12/11/2017,ate here twice and both times I find the service slow and a little too casual for what they charge.
Lana T.,"Tucson, AZ",2,88,27,4.0,7/3/2017,Yummy food and yummy pastas.   I haven't been there a while since there is nothing pulling me to go. But its a good hangout spot for a girls dinner with cheesecake guilty pleasure experience.
Ruben G.,"Tucson, AZ",0,62,206,1.0,8/9/2016,"I've been meaning to post this for a while...      Came here 4:00pm July 2nd on a Saturday and the place wasn't busy at all.  From the moment we walked in we were never greeted by the hostess. We stood in front of the counter and she never acknowledged us. After a while I finally asked ""Hi can I get a table for two?"".  It took 10 minutes for our waitress to finally come take our drink order. The atmosphere around us in the beginning was a ruckus due to a large family sitting directly across from us. After a while the family left and left a mess on the table, the seats even under the table. A while later the bus boy cleaned the table and didn't bother with the floor. A long while later our waitress arrives and introduces us to Caesar our waiter for the remainder of the evening due to a shift rotation, ok not a problem (but odd).    Finally a while longer and three bread trays later our food arrives. Our meals looked appetizing, they were nice and hot, so far so good, I ordered Spicy Cashew Chicken. I stir part of my food to incorporate the sauce into the rice, I'm in my third bite, I'm chewing and there's something stringy in my mouth I pull the string to discover a 4 inch piece of hair. Gross, I know. I stopped eating. Caesar arrives we told him about the hair, he  apologized said he'd bring a fresh plate. I asked him to take hubbys  plate as well and keep it warm. A few minutes later a manager (whose name I didn't get cause he wasn't wearing a name badge) came to our table to apologize for the hair in my food and the kitchen was preparing me a fresh plate. The manager noticed the table behind him (where the large family was) he squatted and saw the mess that was under the table then he left (I thought he was gonna have somebody come clean up that mess). A while later Caesar arrives with our food. They brought Hubby a freshly made meal as well, I thought that was really nice. On the surface mine looked just as good as the first until I stirred the food. They put so much sauce on my plate and very little rice, my rice was oozing with sauce and that sauce isn't spicy it is very very sweet, I couldn't eat it, it was discussing. We got the attention of a waiter that was by our table and asked him for more rice. He said he would and get out waiter over. Caesar arrived, we told him about the dish being too sweet, at that time the other waiter arrived with a bowl of rice. Caesar asked if everything was fine now that we had the bowl of rice or would I rather a fresh plate with new white rice and just have the chicken taken off the bad plate and placed on the new plate, I said ""Yes that'll be fine just don't put too much sauce over the chicken"". Caesar arrived for the third time with my plate and what a joke it was. What the kitchen staff did was they got a plate, took the extra rice that was in the bowl that the other waiter brought me and literally dumped the entire super sweet discussing chicken with rice and sauce over the white rice (no garnish, no effort). It looked like crap and that's putting it lightly. That was the last straw. I got upset told Caesar I was paying for any of this. We got up, walked towards the exit. As we got up to leave another family was being seated at the table with trash underneath (the manager never had somebody clean under the table).  As we walked towards the exit we saw the manager and told him what just took place and even brought it to his attention that he did nothing about the dirty table after he had noticed it. We straight up walked out of there after spending an entire hour there (still hungry). We will never go the Tucson Cheesecake Factory again and I don't recommend you do either."
Jon H.,"Las Cruces, NM",1,19,12,3.0,6/20/2016,"This would be 5 stars... except for our server. The Cheese Cake Factory is always a great place... but with being such a nice place, you expect to get GREAT service... not so with this visit... our waiter is obviously wishing he was somewhere besides serving our party... Anyway..  try the Sheppard's pie.. you won't be disappointed.."
Brad H.,"Tucson, AZ",146,357,269,4.0,12/10/2015,"First time I've eaten here. I've eaten at the Fresno, CA one before and enjoyed it thoroughly. I had the chicken piccata, $12.95. Two marinated flattened, tender chicken breasts. Covered, covered in mushrooms and this lemon sauce. Served with a medium mound of Angel hair pasta. Really yummy! A lot of food. My wife had the Renee's Special, $11.50, described as one-half Chicken salad (or turkey) sandwich, a cup of soup, and a small green salad (or Caesar salad). These were the ""Lunch Specials."" It was a lot of food. As a matter of fact, what my wife received on her plate was a whole sandwich (two slices of bread with a generous amount of chicken salad), a *bowl* of soup (not a ""cup""), and a generous portion of salad. Before she took a bite, she called the waitress back to ask her if this was the lunch special because she did not want to pay for a full, regular meal. The waitress confirmed that it was a Renee's Lunch Special and that ""we like to stuff you here."" Uhm, yeah. The service was excellent. Checking on our progress and satisfaction without being intrusive or bothersome. I'm really impressed at how expensive the interior is from the marble tiling throughout to the heavy (but easily opened) doors and the massive hardware on them, to the decorations tastefully done on the walls and ceilings. Even the bathrooms were high class. Lends a nice atmosphere. We really both enjoyed our meal. We shared a cheesecake and while it was good, the food really took the cake for us."
Cathy H.,"Ebensburg, PA",0,16,12,1.0,3/11/2017,"My husband and I stopped for a piece of cheesecake and a beverage. I ordered hot tea. When it came it had a pot of hot water and a cup. The waiter brought a box of assorted teas and I selected one and when I went to take a 2nd one since one tea bag would have made a weak brew for the size of the pot of water, he told me I couldn't have a second, that management or perhaps corporate, didnt allow it. $3.25 and only one tea bag but soda drinkers can have refills!  Explain that to me. The waiter said they are also not allowed to give straws for water. I'd like my money back!  And you need to correct this."
Sam H.,"Tucson, AZ",0,17,,2.0,3/25/2017,"First time I've been here with a large party and WOW. Our waiter took forever to get drinks out, to take the order, to come back with bread, refill drinks.. etc. I used to be a waitress, and lemme tell ya, think twice about coming here for good service, because you wont find it. The only thing Cheesecake Factory has going for itself is the food. Sorry guys but thumbs down for me.."
Jenny D.,"Tucson, AZ",9,71,45,3.0,8/25/2016,"Hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in years, and decided to go for lunch with some friends.  Goodness, I forgot how expensive this place was.  It seems innocent to start, until you get your bill and realize you spent nearly $50 for lunch.  Partly, this was my fault.  When ordering mojitos (if there isn't a price listed on the menu, and you don't ask when ordering, it's ones own fault for ordering an $11.25 drink), and cheesecake for take away, it will be more expensive than a regular lunch.   Hours listed on the door had 11a, they opened the doors at 11:05a.  Not a biggie.  Seated right away.  One person in our group was running late, informed the server as such.  After getting a drink order from her, it was difficult to catch her attention again to order when our buddy was going to be really late, and told us to go ahead and eat.  Turkey and avocado sandwich was decent, nothing extraordinary.  Sweet potato fries were good and way too much for several folks to eat.   The slice of caramel pecan turtle cheesecake was excellent, highlight of the meal.  Just not enough to justify the price of everything.  Maybe I'm getting stingy in my old age, but that was a lot of money for a decent lunch.  If I was getting a steak dinner with wine, this price point would be more appropriate.  (In my ""you kids get off my lawn"" and ""where's my damn discount"" sort of way)"
Tiffany S.,"Tucson, AZ",641,277,665,3.0,12/2/2014,"Cheesecake factory what can I say they have the absolute best cheesecake ever from the snickers to just their original and I really loved my red velvet cheesecake. .  As far as my meal went I had the Jamaican pepper sauce chicken and shrimp which consisted of the chicken and shrimp fried plantains, it  included some white rice with cilantro, black beans which were absolutely amazing and some very tasty mango salsa. I must say I was pleasantly surprised as many places try to make Jamaican food but they can't quite get it right this food was full of flavor it wasn't as spicy as I like but it still had a nice little kick to it. Now I would've given more stars such as four  maybe even five stars if our server would have been as good as the food, first off he was a little slow, I also had a mishap with my utensils being dirty there was something on it which I kindly asked if he could replace it and it took him a minute to do that also and we waited for several minutes just to get a refill on water and soda and when it came time to order dessert we told him right away we knew what we wanted but yet he still walked away then came back to place our order. Overall it wasn't a bad time I enjoyed my meal so that kind of made up a little for the lack in service so yes I would return again"
Roger T.,"Tucson, AZ",407,250,614,4.0,1/15/2016,"After a long day of work and being one of the few places open after I get off (21:00), this place is a pretty nice spot to come to. It's not too crowded or loud and I'm able to have a nice conversation with the staff and bartender without raising my voice.  I was served at the bar which I planned to go to have my drink and meal. The bartender made my usual, slightly dirty vodka martini, (much needed for a stressful day). The martini was perfect, not too dirty and not too overly strong. As for these entree I gave the Thai Glazed salmon a try. To my surprise is was pretty tasty. It was glazed with coconut and had a little spice added to it. Wish it could have been more spicy though like real Thai spices! But overall it wasn't too bad. For dessert I had the tiramisu. Which was perfect! Soft and sweet just the way I like it!  Due to it being conveniently close to me and friendly staff whom I was able to socialize with. It was a nice night to unwind. I'd definitely return!"
Emilie D.,"Tucson, AZ",83,89,10,4.0,8/15/2016,"Cheeeeesecake! Yes, I love the cheesecake factory as much as the next person. I came here on a Saturday night and was surprised that the wait time was only 10 minutes. We were seated super quickly and I felt like our service was pretty quick as well! My boyfriend got the cuban sandwich which he said was pretty good and I ordered the lemon salmon. I wish they had a baked potato rather than mashed potatoes (but just a personal preference). For dessert we had the hazelnut cheesecake. It was ok, I prefer the oreo one though. We will definitely be back, even if it is just not the cheesecake :)"
Sunshine M.,"Glendale, AZ",266,143,783,4.0,1/24/2015,"I must say that this was a pleasant experience at the cheesecake factory. I feel like I could appreciate eating here more now. Well to start, the place was poppin so it took us a while to get a table...about 30 mins to get an outside table...it seemed like half the town was in here haha But of course I love the bread the give you at the beginning omnomnom! And ooh that butter tho haha so good. It took us a while to pick what to eat because the menu is literally a book. I saw someone say on here that they need to cut it down a bit... I kinda agree... As long as they keep my new found favorites...miso Salmon and Javanese Salmon! O em geee...so good and I am glad that I found these dishes and decided to try them so now I can understand that Cheesecake Factory is not totally overpriced (I still think it is a little bit tho)  Anyways... Miso Salmon reminds me  of like a teriyaki type salmon and JavaneseSalmon hasabomb pesto sauce and the fish is sooo soft and juicy! Go try it! We got the white macadamia cheesecake and it was good but it was just too sweet for me. Plus our server was really great!  4 stars for the two bomb dishes and our server!!"
Marc B.,"Tucson, AZ",11,28,1,2.0,6/15/2016,This place is a cluster f@ck of poor management. Consistently an amazingly long wait for what is moderately good food at best. Tons of tables available yet no one being moved. And where is management? probably just messing around with the waitstaff back by the kitchen.  35 minutes to be seated while the hostess lies to us. PS Manager heard my concerns. She's not in back messing around. Upgrade to 2 stars. Btw the portions are absurdly large. Absurdly.
Debby A.,"Sahuarita, AZ",10,213,137,5.0,4/8/2017,We had a party of 14 on a Saturday for lunch. They got our tables set up fast.  Heath was a wonderful waiter.  He was very patient and did a great job in serving us all. The food came out quick and hot. Everyone enjoyed their food and the cheesecake was to die for. Great job Cheesecake Factory.
Jenna F.,"Mesa, AZ",0,14,3,5.0,8/16/2017,"We came down from Phoenix and had dinner. Our experience was really great, and the food was delicious. I don't frequent the Cheesecake Factory often, but might have to now! We were greeted with a friendly conversation and smile. Our server was wonderful, attentive and always on top of anticipating our needs. The food was delicious and the portion sizes more than enough. Great dining experience! Thank you!"
LaNoya J.,"Tucson, AZ",35,90,210,5.0,2/14/2016,Went on Valentine's Day around 1pm and the wait was 20minutes. Not bad at all. Great service! Waiter was very patient and very good. Just the right amount of service I would hope for. My wife's rice was an issue because they had to make more or something so our waiter was told 4 minutes but in actuality the manager said it would be 10 and they misquoted when they told the waiter. For the inconvenience we got a cheesecake on the house!
Melissa R.,"Tucson, AZ",0,12,,3.0,1/17/2017,"3 stars is about the highest that I can ever give this restaurant. I've been to a ton of restaurants that have food items that they don't specialize in and they typically turn out pretty good.. For Cheesecake, it's basically everything on the menu besides the desserts. The dessert is fantastic but every single time, the actual food has just been totally underwhelming and over priced. I think this restaurant is almost stressing themselves out over the ridiculous sized menus that they offer. The ONLY reason of me ever coming back here has to be the Oreo or The Original Cheesecake. Ugh, soooo good (Yes, I'm super plain)  Great for dessert, mediocre at best for.. anything else."
Anita H.,"Tucson, AZ",14,10,5,5.0,3/30/2017,"We were a party of eight which I like because there are different dishes to sample. The waiter for the evening was Eli and he was attentive as soon as we were seated. I must say it's great to sit out on the patio on a spring night. My sister started out with a  Calamari appetizer which she found tasty and good. Eli came back to check on how she liked the Calamari. The bread is good as it always is-(does everyone fill up on bread?) The food came by way of 4 servers--Wow feeling special-- IT is now quiet while everyone is busy eating. First review is the mashed potatoes which are rich and flavorful perhaps a little too much pepper. Next is the Fettuccine Alfredo my daughter said she liked it-it was creamy and rich. My sister had Chicken  Castaletta which is her usual order. The chicken was moist and the asparagus was large add the mashed potatoes for a big meal. Next came a mac and cheese burger she usually gets the  Louisiana Chicken Pasta so she stepped out of the box! She liked it as there isn't any burger left! Then there was Chicken Alfredo it to got a good review. Finishing was the Louisiana Chicken Pasta minus the mushrooms,peppers and onions they loved it! Eli was a great waiter so attentive ask for him if you come here. All in all everyone was satisfied with their plates so tonight we give Cheesecake Factory top stars!!!"
Alma C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,64,16,3.0,6/5/2017,I was here when they first open 5 years ago with some friends and just had Cheese cake. So we decided to go in tonight. We were very surprised it only had 3 starts. Now after today I understand why. We got there at 6 we were on our table super fast. I wanted the chicken pizza with the Alfredo  sauce. It was on their special menu of the day and yep they were out. We order a Jambalaya and it was to dry we had to ask for more sauce. I ended up getting the chicken with mash potatoes and asparagus. First time my potatoes were cold. They took it back and brought it the second time the plate was super Hot. My potatoes nope were worm not Hot. The manager was great he brought them out the 3rd time and yes everyone at the table were done eating and I was just starting to eat my food. The manager did give me a dessert for free. Thanks but we are probably won't be going back.
