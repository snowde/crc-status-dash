Megan C.,"Tucson, AZ",13,113,41,5.0,7/14/2016,"My family has frequented this restaurant over the years, and I've never had a bad experience. The menu is RIDICULOUS. It has page numbers. If you're craving something Asian or Mexican or a light salad or a hearty steak or healthy avocado toast, they have it all. Plus, the cheesecake! I didn't know they served regular entrees when I first came here. I was all for the cheesecake. It's a bit pricey, but you get so much food! I've never gone home without leftovers. I even had a lunch special with my last check-in and still took part of it home. I've had several chicken dishes, orange chicken, burrito, various brunch options, tacos, and several appetizers. I've probably ordered off each page of the menu at one point or another. I've never been disappointed. The best part...the cheesecake! I've stopped in just for coffee and dessert, picked it up to go (such a beautiful thing), or had it after dinner. They have so many different kinds. Even if you aren't into the typical cheesecakes, they have fruit options as well! I love the mango key lime. It's refreshing. Every cheesecake I've eaten is delicious. I typically order it to go at the end of the meal and have it over three servings."
Aaron S.,"Tucson, AZ",76,7,1,1.0,12/10/2016,"Food 5... quality of service... ZERO... rude, slow, forgetful, ran out of bread... HOW? I can only imagine... she then let us order soup, took to long to get it... comes back 20 minutes later to ask if we got our soup... disappears for who knows how long only to return to tell us that they ran out of soup... probably because you took over 20 minutes to get it... oh wow... LMFAOOOOOO as I'm typing this, one of the servers brought a main dish that was totally wrong... another fail... now my dish just arrived... wrong also... so far 2 For 4... sigh... 50% what a horrible experience... management FAIL‼ 845pm sat dec 10 Oh ya and none of our drinks have been refilled..."
Barbara P.,"Tucson, AZ",44,122,275,4.0,5/28/2016,"I cannot think of a single dish that I have tried and didn't like at the Cheesecake Factory!  Tonight my husband ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano - a favorite of ours!  It did not disappoint!   I got the Barbecue Ranch Chicken  Salad.   It was great as usual! What wasn't so impressive was the amount of time it took to get our order.  25 minutes!  That usually doesn't happen here. When it was brought out, the person who brought it asked if I wanted freshly ground black pepper.  I told him yes.  He had to go get it.  After grinding the pepper, he asked my husband if he wanted cheese on his pasta.  Of course cheese was desired..and you guessed it.....he left to go get it.  Wow!  Talk about inefficiency !  Why wouldn't you bring it with you as most people probably say yes.  If nothing else , why wouldn't you bring the cheese when you went to get the pepper?  Oh well, maybe he was new! Our waitress,  Elizabeth,  was great!"
J C.,"Tucson, AZ",25,110,84,3.0,6/6/2016,Too pricey. Long waits for food also. I don't believe the portions and prices plus food quality is what it used to be.
Ashlee V.,"Tucson, AZ",10,131,24,3.0,9/10/2016,Sad to say I was genuinely unimpressed with this particular location. First off the Service was very slow... We ordered and they claimed to be out of bread but one minute later a different sever walked by with bread for his table. We ordered our Cheesecake Factory usual and then finally bread was delivered. Our server was nice enough at first. When our food arrived we noticed that the pastas seemed very watery. And the more we tasted our food the more we saw that it was extremely watery and lacked taste. We waited for a full 10 minutes for our server to reappear.  We explained this to our server and said our daughter wasn't going to eat the watery Alfredo and asked for it to be taken off the ticket. We showed her that you could literally stir the sauce like it was milk.  This is when the server developed an attitude. Instead of being apologetic and asking if our daughter wanted something else or offering to get her another one she took the plate and became extremely standoffish. She could clearly see that the food was not right but somehow offended that we returned it. We went on to order cheesecake to go and she continued to have an attitude.  They did take my daughters meal off the ticket but she also went without dinner and they didn't seem to care. Extremely disappointed in the Tucson Cheesecake Factory!
Merle S.,"Kaanapali, HI",3,6,,4.0,7/4/2017,"So...two years later and we thought we'd give Cheesecake another try. We went for the happy hour and had a great time!  The server, Alex, was very attentive, the food was served promptly and was freshly prepared, the drinks well made.  All in all, in addition to the obviously fantastic , wonderfully made cheesecake, it was a 180 degree different experience than our last visit! Thanks, Cheesecake...we'll be happy to come back again!"
Omar F.,"Tucson, AZ",82,7,,1.0,9/12/2016,"Lord help my anus region, I ordered the orange chicken and it tasted like burnt orangutan, the brown rice tasted like 90 second rice. Couldn't finish the entire dish, had to pass it to my boi Adam, and he eats everything, and he thought the food tasted like dirty bathroom tile."
Chris S.,"San Miguel de Allende, Mexico",139,647,401,4.0,6/10/2016,"Typical and predictable. It's a big chain but the service is good, tons of menu choices, prices are fair enough, ambiance is nice. I'm not giving it 5 stars because it's not as good as it gets, but when you are traveling and want something you can count on, this is one of the spots."
Kayla K.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",47,60,1,3.0,4/16/2017,"Good food and decent service. Our server was nice but the guy with the ponytail that brought our appetizer out (not sure his name) was chewing food every time we saw him, even when he brought food to other tables. Really unprofessional!"
Trevor H.,"Wahiawā, HI",0,49,51,5.0,3/24/2017,"I like this Cheesecake Factory a lot! The service was great today as always! They go out of their way to make sure you are happy with the food. As usual, my girls ate less than half their food so I got to have like three meals in one!"
Rayne M.,"Tucson, AZ",33,54,79,4.0,5/5/2015,"Can I just say as the Elite Dessert Decider this is a go to place! My goal is to try eer flavor of cheesecake they bake! So far, I must confess I have really only tried the pure chocolate ones.  -Chocolate Mousse -s'more -Godiva Chocolate -Chocolate anniversery -Banana creame The chocolate ones are all   and the banana was actually my favorite of them all! The presentation of the cheesecakes come out so beautiful you almost hate to eat it! ( i may hate to eat it but let me tell you...i devour it!)   As for the rest of the food it always tastes amazing! I like the loaded tots and the baja tacos. The food is very pricy so prepare to dip into the wallet, even more if getting dessert because dessert runs $7+. I would never go there if I was not ordering the cheesecake but hey if im already there I mind as well try to eat some food with malnutrition value before the cheesecake!"
Glenn A.,"Winchester, CA",3,163,43,2.0,8/22/2016,"I haven't been to a Factory in a while. Portions are still too big and probably full of your daily caloric count. Perfectly cooked medium rare classic burger but requested condiments initially were missing. Ending up with a very soggy bun. Nice environment. They spend a lot on decorations. Cloth napkins. Clean. This still is a place that if you share dishes and save room for shared cheesecake you will be happy. Sadly, I don't think our waiter liked his job."
Rob L.,"San Jose, CA",93,469,99,3.0,1/25/2015,"Good place for a kid birthday More a fan of Cheesecake Factory for their desserts. Horrible for your BMI mind you, but oh so good when eating. There are more cheesecake flavors than NFL teams. We've had maybe six and all are yummers. Food is standard fare and I find it unremarkable. Good options for kids though, so it's a standard choice we can all agree on for a meal. This location is nice-- clean, attractive, active staff, and relatively quick for a table. They were also very cool to sing to my daughter for her birthday. (Tip: they used to comp the birthday person's dessert, but do not appear to do that anymore, or at least this location doesn't.) Service crew was nice and quick with drinks. However, the timing of dishes was random and our last person started eating almost ten minutes after the first person's dish arrived and we had to ask three times for missing utensils. On a better, more consistent service day, I'd probably give them four stars."
Josue M.,"Tucson, AZ",0,1,,5.0,6/11/2017,"Avocado egg rolls are great with sauce. My fave is their jambalaya pasta, rich in flavors and huge serving."
Adam F.,"Flagstaff, AZ",45,317,1615,3.0,6/24/2015,"Almost three years later, I am updating my review for The Cheesecake Factory. This place has not changed at all since that 7/7/2012 review. The service was much better back then, but there is nothing bad about it now. They are very willing to accommodate specific orders. This is important because anyone who does their research on the food at this restaurant should know that the average dish contains two/three day's worth of one's sodium and sugar intake. They also have rolled out a menu designed to be a healthier alternative, but still watch out for the sodium in that. To me, The Cheesecake Factory is not a place where I would eat frequently. This is a special occasion type of place."
Nickol O.,"Tucson, AZ",0,15,,2.0,3/7/2017,"It was my mothers in laws 60th bday an we decided to treat her to a nice meal and desert! When we arrived the lobby was rather busy and we put our name down for a wait of 10-15 mins for 3 people. As coupes started being seated after arriving we noticed that we must have some how been skipped? I went to double check and our name wasn't written down or got lost? Must have waited 25 minutes instead of the 10-15 that was quoted. One seated my mother in law was ordering her favorite chicken Alfredo! The chicken Alfredo arrived and absolutely tasted horrible there was no creamy sauce it reminded me of large noodles in a pizza sauce. I felt horrible as it was her bday and we argued to bring her here instead of the Olive Garden! We notified the sever and she said  there were new cooks in the kitchen and they are still learning the ropes!  She politely comped the meal on our ticket. Secondly, the even more sad part is my mom always loved the Khalua Cheesecake! She placed her order and the server came back probably almost with a lump in her throat, and notified us that the Cheesecake was not taken off the menu so they no longer had it! At this point I'm literally about to cry! I feel absolutely horrible that this was her birthday experience! For the bill the service was great our server was very apologetic, but the price of what we received was not worth it. I'm sad because I loved the Cheesecake Factory and have always had good experiences but I'm unsure if I will be returning after this experience."
Vanessa A.,"Tucson, AZ",0,4,,4.0,11/20/2016,"Nice place , feeling like I'm in Las Vegas watching those ceilings, the food was tasty , but the menu is huge! Makes me feel confuse what to order"
Alison K.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,12,,4.0,4/24/2017,This place serves more than just cheesecake!!This place always has a great atmosphere and great service. The menu offers several Different options that can please anyone in the group! Will go back again!
Cy C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,31,6,4.0,9/2/2016,"Big portions. Cheesecake is amazing. I would revisit this establishment . I got the bar b que ranch chicken salad and today my cheesecake of choice was fresh banana cream. O M Goodness it was delightful!  The waitress was ok. She must have been training but didn't introduce this poor guys shadowing her and would hand him plates without instruction.  Overall, clean restaurant. Fast service and good food-GREAT cheesecake! Even if I'm full, I'm getting a slice of cheesecake."
Michelle G.,"Tucson, AZ",45,239,175,5.0,12/27/2014,"My parents and I stopped by last weekend after doing some holiday shopping. There was no wait and we were seated immediately. Our server was excellent. My mom asked about a salmon dish that she had ordered in the past and we were informed that it was no longer on the menu. Our server offered to ask the chef if he could make it for my mom and I. The chef obliged and we were pleasantly surprised that they would accommodate us. Our meals were excellent and we had to order dessert. I had the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake, it was glorious. I have to somehow get my hands on this recipe!  Our server was very personable and attentive. We will definitely be back!"
