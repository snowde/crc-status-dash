Dawn K.,"Marana, AZ",528,189,7113,4.0,8/9/2013,"Boy am I delighted Cheesecake Factory came to Tucson. They have: a huge menu which is hard to make a poor choice with(it's all good), wonderful drinks , fabulous cheesecake; their new S'more cheesecake totally rocks.  If only they could have everyone in booths; when I am seated at a table I feel smashed between strangers at a fast food place and it ruins the dining experience. Also it gets loud there, at times I have trouble hearing people at my table because the acoustics of the room, in combination with the Muzak."
Ernesto A.,"Tucson, AZ",0,18,,4.0,10/2/2016,I really like this place. More and more I see restaurants having a limited menu. Not here! This 16 page menu and has something for everyone. Good for families or regular customers. The bar has a wide selection also. The cheesecake is amazing. This is not just a special event restaurant but good for lunch. I would come more often but can't resist the cheesecake.
Tashima B.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",15,24,1,4.0,3/1/2017,My kids loves coming here for lunch after a long hang our day in Tucson. The healthy options are a god sent for people on a low carb diet. I asked for the chicken bacon burger wrapped in lettuce and it was delicious! Customer service is always top notch.
Brody M.,"San Jose, CA",1,31,17,2.0,8/31/2015,"Other locations of The Cheesecake Factory (Phoenix, San Jose, Arlington) are better managed. More often than not, the Tucson staff are noticeably unfriendly even before you've been seated - so confusing! What did we do wrong? I see rudeness is a complaint from other Tucson Yelpers as well. If the wait staff are resentful toward customers for every little thing-it's always management's fault. It's a shame since it's rare that I like a corporate restaurant as much as CF. Be aware other locations have festive atmospheres and kind servers! Wish I was at the CF bar in Arlington, VA right now! CF's reputation is based on it's consistency. Tucson may be a 2nd city but we deserve better! Please complain to corporate as well as Yelping:"
Jeff B.,"Marana, AZ",4,18,5,5.0,2/29/2016,"We eat here regularly. The service is consistently what I consider ""first rate"", the food is always delicious, and the staff incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. It's getting harder and harder to find large chain restaurants who don't cut their portions and raise prices *cough Mac Schack!*. I'm pleased to report that prices at Cheesecake are the same today as they were when we moved here several years ago, and the portions are huuuuge."
Ken K.,"Tucson, AZ",0,8,,5.0,9/3/2016,This is one of the best restaurants in Tucson. I have been here 4 or 5 times in the last 6 months and the staff is very friendly and the food prepared perfectly and brought out hot. My favorite meal is the Thai lettuce wraps. The Salmon is also delicious. I look forwards to eating here again soon.
Anna J.,"Tucson, AZ",0,1,,1.0,11/29/2016,Just ordered take out from the Cheesecake Factory- in the past we have and it was good. This time it was horrible. When we got home the first thing my husband noticed when he looked at his burger was that there was a bite like part missing (not saying it was a bite but that's just how it can be described). Thought that was weird but whatever he went along with it. Our burgers ended up being so dry we could not even eat them. They tasted like they were leftovers- but worse! Figured since our entrees were messed up the Cheesecake will be great... well we thought wrong. Our cheesecake was FROZEN. How horrible is that. Definitely disappointed as we use to love coming to the Cheesecake Factory. A WASTE of $100.
Lynn L.,"Tucson, AZ",0,2,5,5.0,8/13/2016,My husband and I come here 5 times a month. The food is always good and fresh. The portions are huge. The staff are always friendly.  I'm surprised they only have 3 stars and the place is always full and we have never had a complaint.
Mia M.,"Tucson, AZ",0,12,,4.0,1/31/2017,I don't know why this place has low ratings. This is one of our favorites place to eat. There's such a variety on the menu to choose from. Food is always good. Staff is awesome. Place is spotless clean.  H
Emily S.,"Tucson, AZ",174,63,33,4.0,10/27/2015,"I've been to other cheesecake factories and the food here is pretty similar to the other locations. It's not anything super special, but hey, it's the Cheesecake Factory! Decent prices, large portions and variety. Our waitress was fantastic. Very attentive (she kept our waters filled and paced our appetizers, entrees and desserts very well) and sweet."
Maritza S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,2,,1.0,2/24/2016,I used to go to cheesecake because i love their food but last time i was there i took my best friend for her birthday. It was a disaster we went during lunch time so it was not as busy. It took like 20 mins for the waiter to vet us water than another 20 to get our drinks. What really killed it is that we ordered some cocktails and the bday girl her cocktail with a mosquito in it. We told the waiter and not even a sorry thats when we decided to just not stay anymore and left.. Horrible experience! Not only for me but for the birthday girl
Liz J.,"Vail, AZ",0,20,,4.0,1/7/2017,"I have always loved the Cheesecake Factory its kid friendly and Romantic, relaxing and fun all in one! Service is always awesome and the food selection is by far the best!! One of my favorite places with there were more locations"
Chametria H.,"Tucson, AZ",53,116,40,4.0,5/22/2015,"Took my daughter here for her graduation congratulations lunch. Overall everything was really good. I had the macaroni and cheese burger it was actually really tastey, the mac and cheese was flavored just enough to really stand out in the burger. We had the crab and spinach dip as an appitezer and it was good but really heavy on the olive oil.  All and all good food, good service we will be back."
Matt H.,"Tucson, AZ",55,93,71,3.0,5/7/2016,The food here is ok. The cheesecake is great but that's about the only great thing here. The service is so so. I'll be back for something different but only if someone asks if I want to go here.
Houston B.,"Houston, TX",2,13,,1.0,5/15/2015,"Don't really take reservations on a Friday, except between 2 and 5.  That means we would need to come in between 2 and 5.  Fortunately, that was explained to me on the phone.  :(  Guess that means that they think customers have the IQ of a grape. I guess if you are full, there is no reason to make it convenient."
Kimmy F.,"Tucson, AZ",31,37,1,1.0,12/10/2015,"It just keeps getting worse and worse every time! After waiting 44 minutes for lunch special we walked out. I asked to speak with a manager who just never came out! They were not busy, there was zero reason to be slow with a salad and a kids meal... get it together."
Chris R.,"Tucson, AZ",10,8,30,4.0,8/23/2015,So wanted to hate this place but it was fun and the food delicious. The service was also excellent. Portion sizes are out of control. I hate to admit that I'd go back:) it was a nice food experience.
Kat M.,"Tucson, AZ",34,110,417,4.0,6/1/2014,"Sunday Brunch? why yes please! My husband and I usually stay away from the chain restaurants, but holy wow! Our food was fresh, our service amazing, the bloody Mary's quite possibly the best I've ever had! I definitely recommend the Tomatoe Basil cheese flatbread, and the grilled artichoke! Delicious fresh food! My husband loved the Monte Cristo and it was super yummy! Eat well, live well! Enjoy"
Kristy N.,"Tucson, AZ",138,460,119,4.0,8/29/2013,"For a chain restaurant, I like the Cheesecake Factory. My favorite dish is the Cajun Chicken Pasta which is enough to feed two people and take home for lunch the next day. I've never had a bad slice of cheesecake - all the ones I've tasted are yummy! I've always had good service and the restaurant is clean, the restroom is clean and the service is good."
Johnny W.,"Vail, AZ",34,40,,2.0,9/19/2014,"We went today-- a 30 mile trip too. This used to be one of our favorite places to go. the last time and today were total disappointments. In reviewing  keep in mind I hold a place that charges 12 dollars for a sandwich at a much higher standard than a fast food joint. Today I ordered the new macaroni and cheese burger == described as a gourmet burger with oozing fried mac and cheese on the burger-- $12.75 -- I ordered mine with mayo and asked that it be cut in half-- I got it a long time later-- no mayo--not cut in half. Mac and cheese was a patty of mac and cheese that had been deep fried-- and it was cold-- the meat luke warm -- the sliced tomato cut hours before and the sliced onion old-- the  service was slow and the server was not attentive and as I got impatient waiting for a refill of iced tea ( a long wait) I decided to go get it myself-- only then did she appear form some where.   My wife had a salad that she reports not too bad and generous but the fried onion rings were stone cold making it very greasy and unappealing. The bread basked brought to the table was dried out so much that I could bang it on the table like a gavel-- really you could not get your teeth into it-- I told the waitress and demonstrated the hardness-- she said ""oh my"" and swept it up and hurried off towards the kitchen-- but did not bring back more( that was probably a blessing) I think something was up in the kitchen and the front too-- someone must have been missing or chaos had replaced order--  a great price for a big disappointment!!!! GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER __ CHEESECAKE WE WANT TO LIKE YOU"
