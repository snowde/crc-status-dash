John T.,"Estacada, OR",0,8,2,5.0,1/2/2018,"Let me start off saying that this restaurant employes the greatest host I've ever met. He deserves a raise because we came in on NYE and after 45 minutes of waiting (Which I totally understand) he greeted us and we felt very welcome in this establishment. We immediately connected with him talking about The Twilight Zone and Black Mirror, and that was the icing on the cake (No pun intended).  Whoever in management reads this, make him a server immediately, because I work in a restaurant, and an employee like him comes once in a millennium!"
Kelsy T.,"Renton, WA",0,11,5,3.0,12/28/2017,"Like: rose-colored glasses that don't work anymore  When we first went to Cheesecake Factory, there were these sorts of expectations surrounding it. It is a bit pricey ($7ish for a bowl of strawberries??) and so we've always thought of it as the kind of place you'd go to for special occasions. The look of it all also made it seem a bit more high-end than your average American restaurant.  If you looked at the menu, there are an abundance of choices ranging from pasta to seafood to steak. There are even Asian choices that my little Asian self was kind of wary of. As time went on however, like those rose-colored glasses, it didn't seem as high-end as it used to.  I think there's this sort of feeling you get when you find yourself in a space where you've already painted a picture of it in your mind. Since I thought of Cheesecake Factory as this high-end, for special occasions, kind of place, no matter how the food tasted, that thought still stuck. But once you grow older, you realize that it can't always be like that.  Mind you, there are a lot of good food at Cheesecake Factory. The sliders are pretty good and their New Orleans Shrimp was a fave.  But then there is the buffalo chicken tenders that looked as if they hastily threw on some sauce while leaving some with barely any of it. There is the Steak Diane that wasn't necessarily bad but left some to be desired and the Chicken Bellagio that was kind of bland? Among a few more, there is also the Skinnylicious Chicken Pasta with pasta that wasn't cooked enough and a strand of fettuccine here with another penne there.   I'm sure one can find a dish that they like at Cheesecake Factory but with all the things we've tried, I can't say it leaves much in the desire to try new things.  It's still expensive for a restaurant to frequent often so I wouldn't recommend it if you were looking for a cheap place to eat at and I would just say that it is really just your average American restaurant (with a wider open space). Recommended for: generally anyone for the first time, I recommend you try it out at least once. Who knows? You might find that there is one dish that will keep you coming back"
Charles F.,"Kent, WA",209,1,,1.0,12/21/2017,"Thought this was an ok place but stay away from curbside to go. Waited an hour to get my order when it was only a 25min wait originally. Called in saying I'm here and they said only like 10-15 mins left and I sat there for an hour upon arrival. Paid my order after waiting for someone and the guy said it will be out shortly. Then a girl comes up saying if they could offer a discount cause the food was still not done but I told them I already paid, how am I going to get a discount? Not only that, she didn't even know i paid. Then she offered free cheese cake and didn't come back till 15 mins later with my food. Off I went to later find out I didn't even get cheesecake. Not only that some of the food was cold as if it was sitting there for the hour. What kind of a joke service does this establishment have?"
Christine M.,"Renton, WA",364,47,134,3.0,10/27/2017,"Don't you hate running into a restaurant an hour before closing on a week night? Knowing you're going to order appetizers, drinks, entrees, and desserts because you haven't consumed anything but caffeine for the past 10 hours? Hoping not to stress your waitress because you empathize with her long work hours? We were that couple a couple nights ago.  I'm not one who enjoys browsing a 100+ item menu, so I ordered from the designated Specialties list crafted specifically for people like myself. The crunchy pineapple chicken and shrimp was the best choice I'd made all day. I was once again a pest with the waitress and asked for a ""no cilantro"" accommodation which made the dish perfect. I couldn't see myself enjoying the mounds of fresh basil alongside it. My fiancé's grilled salmon was cooked to perfection, and the sautéed spinach along side it was a nice touch. The mashed potatoes leave little to be desired."
Reba H.,"Renton, WA",243,133,419,2.0,10/27/2017,"For the last three years my husband and I have dined at the Cheesecake Factory with our children because it has been a kid-friendly restaurant. Recently we noticed a shift in the service. Unfortunately, the wait staff seems to be getting younger and more inexperienced. I am not kidding when I tell you what happened to us last night. Hold on to your seat. So yesterday my family and I came to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner. I guess you can also call it an escape from the kitchen for a night. Well we arrived at the Cheesecake Factory around 7pm to the usual 20-minute wait. That went by pretty quickly considering the first bathroom trip with two children. When we were seated we ordered our food pretty quickly we're familiar with the menu. There is a lot of options at this restaurant heads up. I would recommend if it's your first visit check out the website and get an idea of what you want to order before you show up because there are many many options. We ordered the spicy nuggets and grilled cheese with bacon for appetizers. I wouldn't recommend either one of those to be honest. Then we ordered side salads, the countryside side catfish, and a pasta for my husband. The catfish was okay, tastes a little bit like chicken but it was a decent dish. My husband's pasta noodles are sticking together in a seriously huge clump and served a bit cold as though it had been sitting and waiting for a long time. One of the servers knocked my glasses off of the table spilling it into my lap and then crashing it down to the floor and breaking into pieces and cutting my ankle. After this occurred the server walked off and said let me grab my manager. My husband's response was to ask him for a Band-Aid and a cloth before doing so. The manager came and sort of checked out our moods I believe to see if we were going to cause a big fuss about it. Which we weren't we have children we understand that accidents happen. They gave me a Band-Aid and took my drink off the order. Which I was puzzled about. It was polite for them take the drink off the bill, however, I'm sitting there with my ankle bleeding and my lap wet and it didn't seem as though this was anything out of the usual for them. It was very odd it seemed as though they have issues like this all the time because it was kind of just back to business as usual. No fuss at all. And I don't remember a time I've ever gone out to a restaurant and left bleeding with a Band-Aid. It was just an interesting night to say the least but we've decided not to come back. I make a slammin dessert and it's just a mess there. And I mean that literally like the table and the seats were dirty they just need to get it together at this point."
Christopher N.,"Seattle, WA",70,68,84,3.0,10/25/2017,"I reference how I'm not that smart often, and now I'm going to tell you a story on how I know this. A few years ago a coworkers's wife sent him to work with a cheesecake. She's an amazing cook/baker/all around kitchen whiz, so it was delicious. Now, I've always loved cheesecake from the Jello instant to something you'd get at a high end bakery. I innocently asked him how its made, and to my shock (and disgust) I learned the filling is made with cream cheese. I was floored. It was like my head was getting sucked into a black hole. I thought the ""cheese,"" in the name was a play on words. Plus, I never considered cream cheese to be cheese. Its a man made product much like Chili's Burger Meat (shots fired). I've never looked at or had cheese cake since. Its rather quite tragic. In fact, thinking about it is bringing back bad feelings. Is it happy hour yet? I went to The Cheesecake Factory ten years ago in California. Because i'm dumb, I ate hot pasta, outside, on a blazing day that made it less than memorable. I think Seattle's dark, and rainy days is a more apt setting. Isn't it cuffing season, so we're allowed to start putting on a few pounds? With that said, I've never really  had a high opinion about the joint. I always thought it was a chain restaurant that dumb people go to thinking that they're getting fine dinning. Well, friends visited recently, and they insisted on going. I can call them dumb, cause I know they don't read but in the case that they're reading this, ""One Love,"" as the great Nasir Jones once said. I was pleasantly surprised to some extent on our visit. The main entree was pretty good (Four Cheese Ravioli/Pasta). Generously portioned, very cheesy, and the sauce was pleasant. We also ordered two appetizers that were less than memorable. One was what I assumed was going to be an empanada, but was more a breaded cheese stick. The other was so unmemorable that I even forget what it was. Don't be fooled by the name of the apps, or my words...I did eat them a couple of days later when I was drunk.  The service was great though. We sat at the bar, and the bartender/server was fast, courteous, and bagged up our leftovers like a pro. She even let me not have a giant napkin in front of me as I ensured her that I wasn't some animal who can't keep the food on the plate.  I'm on the fence with this place, but I can see why some people like it. Its good for large groups, and people who like a wide range of options. The food is decent, but nothing extraordinary. I imagine I'll probably have to take my parents here on their next visit since they're not adventurous eaters (hey, they're old, and didn't grow up watching Bourdain taint their minds, and pallets). Its a solid option if you're in the area, so I won't judge...too much. Salute!"
Deanna H.,"Lake Stevens, WA",140,205,1169,4.0,5/25/2017,"Stopped in to grab a late lunch since I was catching a flight out. Seated ourselves in the bar, which we quickly learned we did incorrectly.  Only high tables are for self seating.... not the regular tables.  My bf ordered the original burger.... which wad just that,  pretty plain.  I ordered the ahi appetizer and we had the avocado egg rolls.  My food was delicious. We had waited a little too long for our food to come out,  so we loaded up on bread.  Which also left us with no room for dessert,  but we weren't planning on it any way.  Service was good.  Food was good. Really only complaint was length of time it took to get our food,  because it wasn't busy when we were there.  We were able to get in and out with ease,  and get right back to the airport. I was very glad we ate since my flight got delayed! Didn't have to eat at the airport!"
Prajna T.,"Seattle, WA",41,96,107,4.0,6/25/2017,"I mean, can you ever really hate on a Cheesecake Factory?!?  I like the convenience of this location and entrees are as to be expected, they are consistent with the chains standards. A lot of families at this location, so we're always able to walk in and find seating at the bar area, which makes it super fast on those nights you just can't wait. The servers are all friendly and they seem to help each other out a lot.  One question though, why are the floors always a little slippery, seems dangerous lol.  Anyway, great food here, good service and you can't beat the mall location. Parking can be a little tight, but dont worry, you can usually find a spot in the garage of the mall."
Tracey M.,"Downtown, Seattle, WA",13,2,,1.0,1/3/2018,"I've given one star due to the lack of service from both our server and manager.  Second time in a row service was extremely slow.  Ordered coffee ($3.95)  and did not get a refill even when still waiting for food to arrive. Requested mustard for burger, it never came. Ate it without. When the server finally asked if we wanted another cup of coffee (we said yes please) it didn't come. He finally said he was brewing a new pot. At this point we have eaten and are ready to leave.  Manager did the usual ""I'm sorry"" but offered no reduction in bill. My return business was not a concern for him. Good enough, I won't be back."
Michelle P.,"LaPlace, LA",13,17,34,5.0,12/13/2017,"This was my 1st place I went to eat when I landed in Seattle. Food is always good, beautiful atmosphere and nice host."
Keisha S.,"Redmond, WA",0,21,,2.0,12/12/2017,The Cheesecake Factory varies from location to location by a lot. It's surprises me a large chain can have so much variance. Service and quality here is suspect. My boo and I got over and under cooked food. I had order a steak well done and he had ordered med rare. His was way closer to well done and mine was still a little pink. We both ordered different steaks so either the waitress or the cook goofed. At least the appetizers were good. I didn't want to complain we just finished our food day left. I didnt feel like waiting for them to re do everything since it was busy and we had to wait a while already. It was more I wanted to go asap. The whole vibe just didn't go too well for me. Plus I wasn't too thrilled with our waitress anyway.  This Factory was the one at South center mall. I usually eat at the Bellevue one and Come to think of it I should write something good for them. The Cheesecake Factory is known for having a very large variety of selections on their menu.
My Food J.,"Auburn, WA",0,2,3,3.0,10/17/2017,"A chain eatery. For my personal taste the menu is too big. However since they are his big, wait times are not big, especially during weekdays.  Decent selection for vegetarian and vegan patrons. Staff is nice and friendly. Food quality is average. Easy parking. Easy accessibility.  A decent place for a quick lunch or for big groups (esp given their vast menu)."
Nina M.,"Seattle, WA",54,53,91,4.0,8/27/2017,"We sat in the bar area because the wait was so long.  Our server was very helpful, engaging, prompt. The sandwich I wanted to order was no longer on the menu, but our server was kind enough to inquire with the kitchen to see if my request was possible. They ended up granting my request and made me the shrimp and bacon club sandwich. I usually have a great experience at this location!"
Craig L.,"Seattle, WA",182,68,87,2.0,8/27/2017,Same as any Cheesecake Factory but the service here is a little slow. Took a long time to get the food. And honestly their food in general is not that great and is overpriced for the quality of the food they are serving!
Mishel W.,"Seattle, WA",27,45,96,4.0,8/24/2017,"Ok it's a chain restaurant, and I know some of you care about that. But not me! This food was BOMB.COM my friend. The outside area was perfect. It's midrange pricing and comfy environment. The cheesecake...??? Don't even ask, you already know!"
Melissa L.,"Seattle, WA",184,125,167,4.0,8/9/2017,"Great place to go for people who aren't really sure what they want to eat - this restaurant has pretty much everything! Pasta, pizza, salad, steak, etc. I used to come here A LOT because there's so many things on the menu to try.  Some favorites are the Steak Diane and Firecracker Salmon. Drinks are a bit pricey and too sweet for my taste, so I usually avoid ordering drinks here. Cheesecakes are obviously good here - too many flavors to try. Would recommend splitting one since they average 1200+ calories - yikes! Plus they're like $8 a slice.  Service is a little inconsistent here. I've had both good and bad, but most of the time it's okay. The wait time can also be pretty long on the weekends."
Val K.,"Kent, WA",0,20,3,2.0,11/5/2017,Tiramisu cake we took home was nasty. It was salty and soggy and disgusting. Never ordering that cake again.
Ramsey V.,"Kent, WA",1,2,1,1.0,10/9/2017,"I usually try to post more positive feedback here but after our experience I feel this is necessary. Staff needs more training or new management. Long wait times for food. Last two visits, my wife had to wait for her order about 30 minutes after I get my food. I don't get much time with my wife due to my busy work schedule. I prefer to eat with my wife when we're dining out,  not eat my food while she watches me.  I understand it being busy. Just don't tell me my wife's food will be out in one minute and have us waiting another 30 minutes. That's just a bad way to handle your paying guests.  This happened yesterday.  I spoke with the manager to cancel and explain the reason.  It didn't seem like he understood why we were canceling her order but after an awkward pause he apologized and removed it from the bill. As we were leaving, I noticed he was having a conversation with another associate and he pointed right at us as we were leaving.  Not sure what was said but thanks for making it awkward dick head.  Get it together cheesecake tukwila!"
Vanessa K.,"Kent, WA",0,13,10,1.0,12/15/2017,Never received bad service until tonight. Took her 20 minutes for a menu. 12 minutes after that for water . 15 minutes after that for bread. Table behind us got here after and their drinks and appetizers cane before our bread. And after I requested for a new waiter she had the worse attitude. No it wasn't a busy night
Richard T.,"Bellevue, WA",151,416,15,4.0,4/27/2017,"One of my favorite chain restaurants as I always enjoy their food and the overall atmosphere of the place. This one was really busy on the day we went and the place seems smaller than the one at Bellevue Square. The menu selection is always enormous and there seems to be way too much on the menu to pick through.  It was hard to choose what to eat and I ended up picking the Pit Beef Dip sandwich which was mainly a roast beef sandwich with melted cheese and caramelized onions. The sandwich was very tasty especially after dipping in the au jus. It was flavorful and the beef wasn't overcooked as some are usually. The serving size was big as usual and I had to doggie bag some to bring home. The fries were a great side item and they had a good crunch to them from being deep fried. I also tried their key lime cheesecake which is one of my favorites as it has a good tartness to it and with the added whip cream on the side, it really complements each other. The serving size is always a good amount and there is no way I can ever finish one after a whole meal. The service here was good as we had prompt service by our waitress even though the place was totally packed and she got our drink orders out quickly. The food took a bit longer to get to us, but with how busy the place was I could understand it could take awhile. Overall a very good time here since I haven't been to this exact location in quite a few years and the place seems to have changed a bit from what I remembered since the last time I was here."
Mas A.,"Renton, WA",224,23,,3.0,1/1/2018,"This is actually one of my go to spots. Food is always great and service has never been an issue. The wait time is a given, this place is popular with good eats. They estimate a longer wait but generally I've always been seated sooner. Recently, it seems that this place has really gone down in service. I wonder if some of these servers are even trained. We got sat in the Octagon aka the forgotten section. We asked Brandon to bring out the appetizer before the main course (this is actually a no brainer) however he explained that how the system works is, you put in the order and it all comes at the same time. Made no sense to me as I've waited before and I know that you can time your courses. He never put in the order for the appetizer so it never came anyway. Steak was well done and not medium-well as ordered. Pasta was Luke warm. It was probably sitting for a while. We would have told the server this had he come back to do a quality check. He pawned us off to another waitress who was just as bad. I looked around our whole section and everyone seemed to be having a poor experience. Lesson learned, don't get sat in the octagon. You won't get bread service, water service, any service."
Holli M.,"Renton, WA",74,180,438,4.0,6/10/2017,Food was good not great. Service was good. The Alfredo and meatball my kid enjoyed very much. The Renee's special sandwich was good. Usually comes with soup but not in the mood for potato soup so they substituted for fries - that was nice. Salad with vinegarette dressing was good but they overdressed it. The salad was good - Applebee's is better but still flavorful.
Rosie P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,39,110,4.0,7/15/2017,"Awesome food and professional service all around.  It's a diverse crowd and our server smiled the entire time! It's great to feel the positive vibes and the staff seemed to enjoy being there.  The food is amazing and it was worth the wait. Our server was THE BEST! Kudos to the establishment for their professionalism , excellent service, and efficiency."
Grace D.,"Seattle, WA",6,40,43,3.0,7/20/2017,"This restaurant is very popular and super busy, especially on weekends. Be sure to plan ahead, it can be an hour or more wait for your party. I do advise to try and get at table at the bar, for those over 21.  The food I usually order have been great! I usually order the Cajun Chicken Littles, and sometimes I'll switch it up and order the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. So GOOD! Their bread, milkshakes, strawberry lemonade and cheesecakes are good too.  Service can be good or bad, depending on your server and how busy it is. I've experienced both good and horrible."
Marian D.,"Seattle, WA",46,48,146,3.0,5/17/2017,"Ahhh Cheesecake. I frequented this place in my youth and by that I mean age 17-21. Peach Bellinis are delicious as always, don't drink em too fast or you'll get a brain freeze!  Family dinner tonight, my parents both got the crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp that is currently on their special menu and both enjoyed it. They said it had the right amount of sweet and spicy with the pineapple balancing the dish out.  My husband ordered the chicken gumbo, but said he's had better. I ordered the chicken pot pie from the skinnylicious menu and it was alright. It didn't come out in original pot pie form but rather a bowl with chicken, peas, carrots, cream and then a small piece of puff pastry on top.  The real rock star was the calamari as an appetizer. This staple on their menu has stayed the same throughout the years and still tastes as great as ever."
Jenn D.,"Stockton, CA",234,175,98,3.0,9/16/2017,"I'm a fan of the cheesecake factory, but this was my first time at this location. I have gone to other locations in California. We ended up at this location because it was the only restaurant that was open without a lot of patrons. We ended up eating in the bar area in order to get seated quickly. The food and drinks were great, but the service was eh. The server herself appeared to do her best. She had told us that she generally does not work in the bar area, which was fine. I felt like overall, the service from walking in to walking out could have been better.  Although the services was so-so, I would probably return for the food and drinks."
Misha Niners S.,"Acton, CA",18,17,5,4.0,11/29/2017,"Great happy hour menu. Most places have only a few choices but here we ordered a few things & they were amazing. Started off with the avacado roll, wow what a treat that was. The staff was friendly & the e service was good too."
C M.,"Kent, WA",22,11,,2.0,8/21/2017,"I order for pick up quite a bit and every single time the hostesses behind the Cheesecake counter that handle it are super rude. This place is the only time I've not ever tipped because the service is horrid. Every. Single. Time. I've done that job, it's no so bad you can't be somewhat nice to the customer. I've never gotten much more than an eye roll and one of them is on her phone behind the register while running people's debit cards. Really not comfortable with that ever. A few days ago I went and stood in line only to have the girl take the middle aged persons BEHIND me's order first. Seriously? I'm a paying customer who stood in line it shouldn't matter whether I'm in my 20s or not."
Kyle S.,"King, WA",0,5,,1.0,10/9/2017,"Um, we bashfully get delivery from the Factory a bit through Door Dash, and I gotta admit they kinda nail it! Their menu is outrageous, their delivery prep is on point, and they're silly fast! I don't twitter...#doordash...? That was a while ago...I got on here for another reason and saw that that post didn't actually post whenever that was... Tonight we placed the same order, pretty much, and the delivery man showed up with no food, over an hour late, claiming someone else picked up our order!? W T F We still have no food!? Oh, if you charge us!?!?"
Maryjane N.,"Seattle, WA",10,27,7,5.0,10/30/2017,"The prices are o, but you get a lot of food, and the food is amazing the service is great too. Thai lettuce wrap,  poke, hibachi steak and the Chipotle chicken pasta are my favorites.  . The cheesecakes are HUGE! I always stick with new York. At the price, I'm scared to change it up, and it ends up being too sweet for me.... the lunch portions are crazzzyyyyy"
Eric K.,"Denver, CO",38,89,42,4.0,11/14/2016,"Please note - the floors throughout this particular restaurant are EXTREMELY SLICK and have been so for at least 3-4 years!!!!!! Mgmt claims that the cleaning crew uses an anti-grease wax on the floor and is the cause of the sloppiness but whatever it may be, this floor is like an ice rink!!!!! My flight was delayed 6 hours so I hoped over to the Cheesecake at SouthCenter for some much needed fuel before the grueling wait. I've been to this Cheesecake Factory a number of times in the past and like every other CF, the food is consistently good!   My favorite part of the restaurant is the Rotunda-styled dining area out back... a two story vaulted ceiling with booths organized in a circle.   Tonight I ordered the kale salad to start and the Thai glazed salmon for dinner.... as always, excellent.  The portions are always generous and food FRESH - I honestly think it has something to do with the sheer volume of patrons and the food turnover being so high.  This was the best time of night to come 10:30pm on a Sunday - service was super quick and the food was out quick and hot off the grill.  Another great experience."
J. J.,"Seattle, WA",0,12,3,4.0,7/1/2017,I love this place.  Fantastic food and service!  HowEVER!! Waiting to get a seat is always ridiculous.  There will be 200 empty tables but they have you wait 10-20 minutes. Today I was there 10 minutes after they opened and there were many people waiting to be seated.  I was alone and still had to wait.  I waited 15 minutes and then gave up and left.  Wasn't in the mood.  Wish they would figure out a way to seat people faster!  It's maddening!
Alma B.,"Oak Harbor, WA",26,56,146,5.0,7/22/2017,"Prompt service. We had a longer wait because we had a party of 13, so we started our evening in the bar area. Our drinks were delicious and the server was great. Once we got seated, we were properly taken care of, got are refills and our food was tasting the same way that it always does - excellent !"
MyAnne K.,"Seattle, WA",190,116,1928,4.0,10/6/2016,"Honestly, I don't visit Cheesecake Factory NEARLY as much as I should. Since I was a kid till now, I've always been so ""WOWEWWWED"" by the extensive menu choice...Skinny, GF, Dessert, Vegan, Meaty choices. As I write this review, I seriously want to go back here! The fact that they offer nearly a thousand menu options, food is solid. Service is solid."
Emily J.,"SeaTac, WA",95,168,233,4.0,6/21/2017,If you've been to one Cheesecake Factory you've been to them all. They are all exactly the same. The menu is huge you feel like you're reading a novel there's way too much to choose from. However the food is really good and the service is always top notch. My favorite items go to items are the avocado spring rolls and the fish and chip plate. But the real reason I go to The Cheesecake Factory is ultimately for the mango coconut cheesecake. That thing is top-notch wonderful perfect in every way and is my go-to piece of cheesecake. If I could I just go in and pick up a slice and take it home. And thinking about that I think I'm going to go and do that right now.
Lee L.,"Renton, WA",0,8,5,4.0,8/2/2017,Good happy hour prices. 20 minute wait. Only 3 draft beer options. Sweet corn tamales and stuffed mushrooms delicious
Barton C.,"Olympia, WA",9,17,2,3.0,10/17/2017,My shrimp summer rolls were so tough felt like they were made this morning but the crispy salmon rolls were super tasty along with the sauces both rolls came with!!
Maegan L.,"Bend, OR",9,117,254,2.0,3/28/2017,Cheesecake Factory used to be my absolute fav.  Now it has just become too chain-y or something because things have went downhill.  The food quality just isn't the same.  The taste and care of what they're serving isn't what it used to be. Things taste slightly different.   I hope they do some major quality repair before it runs into the ground or becomes an applebees.  Service isn't always great here either. Had a bad/rude experience with a MANAGER over curbside pickup or whatever they call it.   If you ask for specifics for your order they don't follow direction/accommodate.  I really argued with her over wanting extra of the tomatillo sauce that goes with the sweet corn tamale cakes. They tried to give me some cashew sauce??? And then had the nerve to treat me like I didn't know what I was talking about when I literally get the dish every time for years.  Ha
J N.,"Issaquah, WA",1,18,4,1.0,12/14/2017,"Extremely disappointed with our experience here. We came to celebrate our friend's birthday - we had five different servers (not an exaggeration) we waited over an hour for our food to come out, and they did not say happy birthday or acknowledge it. However, they sang to the table next to us and brought out a sundae. Overall, we spent over two hours here and had horrible customer service. Never will be back."
Rachel S.,"Seattle, WA",171,91,554,4.0,3/24/2016,"Service never disappoints.  Parking can get full and packed during their lunch hour and dinner time, but never a huge problem since the restaurant shares the same parking lot as the mall.  The wait for a seat and your check maybe long, but you do get your food quickly.  Today I ordered a little salty but tasteful lunch pasta with shrimp and sausage. I'm glad I didn't feel like they skimped out on the meat and seafood.  The ultimate red velvet cheesecake was creamy and soft. The cheesecakes are pricey per slice but worth the experience since you are at the Cheesecake Factory."
