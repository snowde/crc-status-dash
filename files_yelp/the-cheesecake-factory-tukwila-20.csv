Lauren P.,"Kent, WA",695,737,373,2.0,1/1/2015,"My experience at this Cheesecake Factory was awful. This past weekend, and last year as well. Let's start with my group's wait time - ONE HOUR when it was projected at half an hour. The hostess at the front forgot to give us our pager, so there was that as well. Once we actually got seated, things were slightly better. Our server was very nice, so no hard feelings towards her. Our food was at our table within 20 minutes - I got the chicken Caesar salad, which was very good. Overall, the wait at the beginning really made the whole experience frustrating and the fact that the hostesses at the front weren't very nice didn't help either. I probably won't choose to come back."
Cobra C.,"Seattle, WA",4,61,1,2.0,3/11/2016,"Sure the food is still good. The portions got soooo much larger. Not in a good way. It's just too much food. Serving staff is now suddenly horrible. One should never tell a customer not to order certain items. Did I want fries? No. Fruit would've been my preference. But to ignore me, and bring me a salad with rancid dressing on it. Which I left sit on the table. I'm paying for the meal, why not LISTEN when I talk. I'm neither quiet, or easy to ignore. The server who took the order, didn't even bring it out. Our meal arrived staggered. Three different staff showed up, with one plate each.  When we needed something, I had to get up and find our server. NOT COOL. Check on us at least once, yeah?   When we asked for boxes to take the massive amounts of food home, the wait staff dumped my spouses pasta in her lap. Even after being told, "" Hey, that's too much to add to what you're carrying.""  The server had to be asked to bring a wet napkin to try to get the stain out. I expect better from this place. I really do. I've been here off an on over the last five years.  If I could use this forum to curse your server out, Cheesecake factory, I would. She should be fired for the way she treats your customers. We pay to eat here. Your opinion about what we eat, and what we order, should NEVER come out of your wait staff's mouth.  If this is something you allow to continue past this date, I, and every person whom I can speak to, will not spend one cent in your establishment."
Karen D.,"Renton, WA",53,347,,4.0,12/18/2013,"It takes a lot for me to give a restaurant a 2nd review, especially a chain, but,  I just had to give some love to the Southcenter Cheesecake Factory.  Went here for an office dinner and drinks party to celebrate the holidays.  All I can say is wow.  For starters, there were 12 of us, and we needed the bill split up all kinds of crazy ways...it was ""separate checks"", but those of us who were there with our spouse wanted checks for 2.  Then I decided to treat the table to a bunch of appetizers.  Another person bought the wine.  One of the couples bought cheesecake slices for the table.  And so on.  Somehow our angel of a server, Michelle, managed to keep everything straight.   Michelle and the people who backed her up were just perfect. Michelle was friendly, helpful, and efficient.  Everything came out right when it was supposed to, drinks cold and food hot.  I also have to give a nod to the bartender named Ivy, as those who ordered cocktails thought her mixed drinks were divine, particularly the lemon drop, which at least 3 people at the table were swooning over, and not just from the alchohol! The food received mixed reviews from the group.  As I have noted before, Cheesecake Factory can be inconsistent in the food department. I never order pasta there because they usually overcook it for my taste.  I know what I like there, and that is the grilled salmon with sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes. I usually order that and am happy.  This was no exception.  My spouse ordered the exact same thing, but unfortunately her salmon was overcooked and dry.  That's the inconsistency I'm talking about.   You generally can't go wrong with the cheesecake for dessert.  I ordered the tiramisu flavor, which I have liked in the past, but this time there was an off taste to it; just not sure why.  The reeses peanut butter cheesecake was awesome.   All in all, we had a fabulous time at the office Christmas party this year, and it had a lot to do with the wonderful service and atmosphere at the Southcenter C.F."
Ted And Tammie F.,"Bend, OR",0,18,,1.0,1/9/2016,"Sorry this place is not impressive! Table was dirty, bus boy wipes food onto my lap! I asked him what he was doing and he continued to wipe the food crumbs in my legs. Most staff at this location, English is a second language. White that said the waiter could not understand what I wanted to order and I I harp repeat myself a few times only to be brought the wrong food. When you come to a place like this and pay a fairly high price I expect a little better service. I will not give this location another chance."
Juan S.,"Miami, FL",89,1406,31,4.0,4/13/2015,Reliable delicious food and great service. I am crazy about the Salmon Genovese...really a tasty dish and a good sized portion. Nice to have places like CF when traveling for business.
Smaly K.,"Tacoma, WA",110,418,1541,4.0,3/31/2014,"Oh, gosh, their menu is huge; I can take hours looking through it.  I've tried many things, and most are pretty good.  My favorites are Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Bistro Shrimp Pasta, Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp, and the Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane Combination.  The best thing I had there was the Caramel Ginger Chicken, but sadly, they took it off the menu."
Shelby T.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,14,,4.0,1/3/2016,I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory and last minute on New Years night my boyfriend and I decided to try it as he had never been either. He got a very delicious fettuccine Alfredo while I got the spicy chipotle mayo crispy chicken sandwich. The sandwich was very good and would recommend it to chicken lovers. I also got the original cheesecake with strawberries on top. We saved that to take back to our hotel since we were quite full. When we tried it we realized they skimped out on the strawberries a bit since there were only 3. The only issue I have is with the price of the items on the menu in this restaurant. For the quality of food they're serving it could be a little cheaper. Could definitely get better fettuccine from Olive Garden for a better price. All in all it was a good experience.
Aaron W.,"Tukwila, WA",34,69,19,4.0,3/15/2016,"Great food , great customer service for a good price. I would recommend this place to everyone. The next time I go I need to try the cheesecake. But the only down side it the long wait time to sit"
Azeer K.,"Kent, WA",0,10,,2.0,3/11/2015,The Cheesecake Factory. It's the absolute place to go when you've got a lot of people in your party --- there is something for everyone!!!! I like this fact about this place. The menu is so giant that everyone is pleased. The cocktails here are wonderful and great to the taste.  My family visiting from Canada didn't enjoy this place as much.
Kitty D.,"Alamo, CA",64,756,913,3.0,12/31/2013,Cheesecake factory is always open when I need to satisfy my hunger pangs. It has all the popular food and surroundings and interior design for each branch is consistent. Nice staff. They allow substitution which is great. Wish I could eat their cheesecake though but unfortunately I cannot.
Ruby P.,"Kent, WA",2,189,43,4.0,3/18/2015,love the food  and the cheesecake is BOMB..  bites of heaven . :)
Tiona C.,"Tukwila, WA",0,9,1,1.0,3/3/2015,Poor service by our waitress Lauren. She had the worst attitude and got our order so wrong. Never coming back.
Delilah R.,"Seattle, WA",139,451,56,1.0,11/18/2014,"One star for cheesecake.  Although very rich, it is one of my favorite deserts and I don't actually have much of a sweet tooth but can appreciate so many varieties. I was incredibly disappointed in the actual food.  Uninspired, their menu has no focus and as little a theme as the decor.   The wait is atrocious, with a standard 30 minute stand by via walk in.  To reserve requires a party of 7 and only available during certain hours.  Without a 30 minute wait, being seated within 10 minutes of walking in you can still expect a 30 minute wait to get your food, even if your order is in immediately.  I had an almost 20 minute wait on my wine, which was needed much sooner. I had the factory burger on wheat with sweet potato fries.  I ate the first half, having to soak up the very sharp and bitter red that I was sipping.  The burger was incredibly dry.  So much so that I gave half of the half of my burger that I was eating to my husband, who then slathered it with ketchup and then choked a little because it was still too dry.  How can you screw up a burger?  The fries were over done.   Dave had the meatloaf.  It would be better compared to salsbury steak rather than meatloaf.  It was covered in a dark, almost BBQ like sauce and coated below was a slather of caramelized onion.  The mashed potatoes were bland and covered with a very salty gravy.  I have found that salt in access is usually a sign of a cover up, which makes me nervous for the hubby.  He fed me a bite and offered a second and I asked him as sweetly as possible not to put anymore near me.  Ick. We took a slice of vanilla bean cheesecake to go, the only redeeming quality of our visit."
Jim R.,"Coeur d'Alene, ID",16,82,92,5.0,5/26/2015,"It's Cheesecake Factory. They are all alike, the food is always good. Service here was good and food was prepared well. I have no complaints. I'd eat here again."
Jesse W.,"Seattle, WA",122,31,16,5.0,5/5/2016,I have been here numerous times and have had great service every time. The food is sensational. Used to go to Red Robin religiously and now I have found my new spot. My friends get the Vegetable Burger and their Skinnylicious menu. Will be a regular at this great Restaurant. The air conditioner could be a little less freezing but all in all- great service great food!
Monica T.,"Seattle, WA",161,189,36,3.0,12/20/2014,"Okay...helpful hint, if your planning to come here with a group....DON'T...especially on a Friday/Saturday...it's a nightmare. Went here with a group of 8 and had to wait 2 hours to get seated.  Blah!  (Try the Seattle location, a lot better...usually 30-60 min wait).  Typical Cheesecake Factory.  The food is always good and they even do curbside.  The staff is friendly.  Place is clean.  Love the food."
Kellie D.,"Seattle, WA",54,48,,5.0,7/18/2016,"The perfect place to splurge. The name says it all  CHEESECAKE FACTORY . 2 pages devoted just for Cheesecake. Service is always good. Make sure you try to book ahead it possible. I was told 10 minutes for my party. It was only 5.  But for biggr parties or peak hours expect a 45 minute wait at least Amazing food choices. Get the Louisiana Cajun pasta or another hit like the steak Diane. I usually get the Americana burger or Cajun chicken littles. Big drink menu. Strong Mai Tais and Long Island iced teas. Can be a little loud but as the night winds down this is an awesome place to go for a quiet intimate setting.  They bring two types of bread for starters. Sourdough and sweet molasses. You'll always need a to go box though since portions are huge. Bathrooms a little small same with the tvs in the bar but this isn't really a bar place.  Also if you don't like big groups by you just ask to be reseated. I don't like big groups of teenagers or loud groups. I'm 25 and im mature for my age. I believe patrons can have a decent night out with out the interruptions. A couple of times I was seated by a big group and 2 guys kept standing up right next to my booth blocking my view and one almost knocked over a waitress.. So when I get here I usually request a table somewhere not in the open and they always accommodate which I love. For some reason I never see kids here.. I'm guessing it's more of a grownup restaurant Get a piece of cheesecake to go. Either ultimate red velvet or tuxedo. They see decadent. Don't know why this place gets a bad rap. You can dine for about 20 bucks and still have leftovers for 2 days. Chicken, seafood, pasta and burgers. They've got it all. Biggest menu I've seen."
Magdalena B.,"Mapleleaf, Seattle, WA",134,81,495,5.0,11/6/2015,"I love cheesecake factory. It very suitable for family, date, you name it. My favorite food here is the red velvet cheesecake, it is super duper good. !!!"
Dead M.,"Seattle, WA",1,167,8,2.0,4/8/2015,"Normally I love this place. Today, it sucked. Waitress was really bad. Did the bare minimum to provide service.  I had to ask for refills, etc.  Wife found blonde hair in her chicken and biscuits.  OMG Will try place again but this almost broke the deal. Combo of hair in food and bad service. Grrrr."
Alla M.,"Seattle, WA",59,8,4,1.0,12/26/2015,"Ordered steak, got through most of it and noticed a big black thing in my potato. Turns out potato was rotten.. Manager didn't even act sorry about it. Bad service."
