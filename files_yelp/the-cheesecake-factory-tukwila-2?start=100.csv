Michael D.,"Tacoma, WA",41,26,,2.0,1/29/2017,"Ordered the 20$ Chicken Alfredo. Major Disappointment.... I don't know how you can mess up Alfredo. It was the first time in my life I have bought runny, low viscous Alfredo sauce. For a premium price, and possibly half a chicken breast worth of chicken... 86 it off your giant menu if your not gonna put the effort into making it properly.  The other item I got was steak tacos. They were okay, I give it 3 stars, and the Chicken Alfredo 1 star as it was the worst Alfredo I have ever had."
Morgan R.,"Bellevue, WA",44,1,,5.0,12/12/2016,"I went there with my then boyfriend and now husband about a year ago. The place was overly packed and they said our wait would have been about 15-20 minutes. I was particularly hungry, however so my husband asked if there were any seats at the bar. The hostess led us to the bar and kindly asked a couple to move down a seat so we could sit comfortably at the bar together. We ordered a drink, which was delicious. I always order a Blue Hawaiian wherever I go and it was made perfectly.  We waited about 15 minutes or less for our food. I ordered a nice bowl is spaghetti with red meat sauce. Let me tell ya, it was AMAZING. It came with a nice, big serving and garnished with a dehydrated and DELICIOUS basil leaf and the sauce was incredible. If you're craving spaghetti, and can't make it yourself, this is the place to go!  I'm sorry I don't remember what my husband ordered, but I had to let him finish the rest of my food because the portion was too too much for me! (Which is always awesome). Loved it."
Annie T.,"Waldorf, MD",0,3,,1.0,2/23/2017,Told 15 minute wait. Waited almost 30 minutes while everyone else was seated before and after us. When I asked about the long wait I was told it was because we had 5 in our party. If you have no idea how long it will be just say so. We would have even broken up into two tables if given the option. SO FRUSTRATED and they don't care.
Reginald N.,"Kent, WA",144,59,247,4.0,7/29/2015,"What can you say? It's The Cheesecake Factory. Their bible of a menu is all over the place and is fairly pricey. Has anyone ever really ordered the teriyaki chicken or orange chicken here?!  Why would you?  However, I have learned that they have an awesome happy hour (Chicken sliders for 5 bucks? Heck yeah) and have been exploring their small plates and appetizers too.  Their flatbreads, stuffed mushrooms and the samosas are inexpensive yet tasty.  Plus it's better to keep the meal light and save room for cheesecake.  After all, that's why you're there."
Amanda S.,"Cheney, WA",2,12,6,5.0,2/13/2017,"I love The Cheesecake Factory, it is my favorite restaurant. This location in particular is the best one IMO. The wait times can be pretty long and they don't take reservations, but it's so worth it! They have so many options for anyone, including vegetarian and vegan options. I used to always get the Chicken Bellagio or Shrimp Scampi, and never (at this location) has my food come back wrong, bad, or in any way not to standards. My waiter/waitress is always awesome, friendly, and attentive (shout out to Chris, she's awesome.) Now that I'm vegetarian, I try some different pasta dishes when I come here. So far my favorite is the tomato basil pasta with no chicken. All of their dishes are very flavorful and filling. They have huge portions for the prices on the menu. It can be a little loud, but that's because it's always busy. It's good for kids and it's great for a date night or just a dinner stop on your way home (they have a car side to go program.) For dessert, they have 2 full pages of different kinds of cheesecake to choose from. You can always come here and have a complete unique dining experience every time. The slices of cheesecake are fair in size and perfect for sharing. If you aren't a Cheesecake person, they have other kinds of cake and ice creams and pies to choose from as well. Overall, this restaurant has menu options for any taste/diet and this location is always awesome in quality, time, and staff."
Nada C.,"Tacoma, WA",44,117,163,5.0,4/30/2016,"One of my favorite places to go with the family for brunch or happy hour. Bread is always baked fresh and I love the sour dough mix rye. Calamari is never fishy and seasoned perfectly. all of the dishes are pretty tasty. Let's see our favorites are: Cajun chicken strips with fries try their ranch! It's made in house! I love the Luau salad it's is fresh and the dressing is delicious.  the steak Diane and shrimp scampi is the  . Hmmm...oh the cheesecakes! Red velvet, snickers, dulce leche and much more. The lines are ridiculous so we usually sit at the bar or ask if there are tables outside."
Jessica M.,"Jenks, OK",56,106,18,3.0,6/7/2016,"We stopped in on the way home from a party for a quick dinner. We love the range of food and always can find something good. Sometimes the wait is long but they do have a few bar tables you can usually snag which is nice. On this recent trip, we got two slices of cheesecake to go. When we went to indulge at home, there was a fruit fly smack dab in the middle of the banana cream pie cheesecake my husband ordered. Quite disappointing given it was the first thing we saw meaning the attention to detail from the bakery could be better.  The stars I did give were for our meal and the cocktails which were very good. I feel like bugs and hair in food are absolutely unacceptable. Hopefully next time we'll have a better experience.  On the bright side, our server was delightful and attentive!"
Eric H.,"Seattle, WA",31,62,,3.0,3/11/2017,How can you go wrong with the cheesecake at the Cheescake Factory??  Everything else is good.  There's a wait most of the time but all in all good.
Jeannie G.,"Olympia, WA",157,3,1,5.0,1/14/2017,"Stopped in to get a slice of cheesecake to take home. Put our order in and waited 35 minutes. The people who ordered behind us got theirs before us. This and the excessive wait were easily forgiven when an additional 2 slices of cheesecake were brought out to us with a sincere apology. It's expected to have to wait on a Saturday night, but the host went above and beyond to ensure they apologized for the added wait time due to their mix up. Customer service at its finest. Thank you, Benjamin H."
Krissy U.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",0,9,5,3.0,2/9/2017,I gave it three stars because I seemed to know the menu better than the bartender. I ordered an appetizer and asked for an addition but had to explain the order and it still wasn't served as ordered. It wasn't complicated either. :(
Tina R.,"Eugene, OR",0,2,,5.0,7/25/2017,"I always enjoy going to The Cheesecake Factory. I especially love the chocolate cheesecake! Tonight, I was very disappointed in my meal, which has never happened before. I did not make a big deal out of it, but the manager came out and talked with me and decided to take the salad off my bill.  I really appreciated his professionalism and his desire to make my dining experience a good one. I look forward to visiting the Southcenter Cheesecake Factory again."
Kasanita V.,"Renton, WA",191,38,,4.0,12/3/2016,"The wait time was literally less than five minutes. The hostess was alright, no smiles, no nothing. However, the server was great! She was attentive, kind, and very efficient. The food portions are pretty big as well. They weren't my favorite, taste wise, but that's just me. The prices were pretty much expected, maybe too pricy for my taste, but I'd understand why they charge it. The restaurant was clean and the servers were friendly. Overall great experience!"
Kristy W.,"Eugene, OR",288,414,437,4.0,2/21/2016,"I know it is a chain, but they have some dishes that I love to crave! Especially the fact that we don't have one in our hometown. The service here was pretty good, and we had the typical wait because it was dinner time. No complaints about that because it is a popular place. My usual go to is the spicy cashew chicken, but I switched it up and got the bang bang chicken. It was pretty good. I also ordered the apple crisp for dessert, huge mistake on my part! Hence the fact this is the cheesecake factory! The apples I think were a little too crispy for my liking. But hey that is my personal preference. I stole bites of my guys cashew chicken, it of course is still my favorite... Not that the Bang bang chicken was bad. I might just keep it in rotation from time, to time. I almost forgot to mention my yummy pineapple Mohito. One of the best I have had."
Steve J.,"Tacoma, WA",9,13,,4.0,1/11/2017,"I was a bit overwhelmed by all the choices, but there were all good choices. My daughter and I choose from the lunch specials . The food was excellent and the portions were more than we could finish. Our server was attentive and helpful."
Kevin M.,"Des Moines, WA",23,95,196,5.0,10/7/2015,"Awesome restaurant! Service is very well in point. Location is easy access. There's always a line since it's the only one in the area.  Food is good, not the best and actually is on the heavier side. Servings are big! Great for families and crowds. Prices are moderate. Not cheap but not expensive either.  Best part are the cheesecake. They live up to the hype!  A definite will come back! :)"
Yuuri C.,"Seattle, WA",0,7,,3.0,6/25/2017,"The food we had on a Sunday night was good, came out fast and in big portions. The only thing that was bothered me was our server. She seemed very rude, I asked for a substitute on my dish, she forgot, my bf asked for a hot sauce, that never came. We ordered a slice of cheesecake togo, she did not bring it out. We had to asked another guy to get it for us. What bothers me the most was her inattentive and her rudeness!"
Nellys S.,"Seattle, WA",583,107,65,2.0,8/15/2016,"We came here for dinner at around 5 on a Sunday and there was no wait, which was a pleasant surprise. We snagged a seat outside, and enjoyed the sun. We enjoyed quite a bit of sun, actually, because service was moving at a snail's pace on our visit. Our waitress Lanae came over to introduce herself and get us our drinks quickly, and she said she would be back with bread. Well, we didn't see her for nearly 20 minutes and our meals were brought out (not by the waitress) before she came back with the bread. A few minutes after our meals were delivered, she brought out our bread. We are never going to say no to bread, but it would've been nice to have it before the meal. After she delivered the bread, she checked in with us only once and then we didn't see her again for close to another 20 minutes when she asked how we wanted our checks divided. She brought them, but it took another long while for her to bring our cards back. Sad day that even when there is no wait for a table, there is quite a wait to get anything to our table. I still love me some cheesecake, but service was lacking today."
Christopher F.,"Maple Valley, WA",0,12,,5.0,7/10/2017,Love going here! The food is always great and the wait staff have always been kind and attentive. It's busy and can be a long wait depending on when you go. But it is worth it for sure. Open bar seating helps if you're over 21. The menu is huge and it's great to try new things. Prices are fair for what you get. Some of the meals are large enough for two people!
Micheli F.,"Renton, WA",32,3,3,1.0,10/21/2016,I have always enjoyed the factory for great food and atmosphere but this time has totally blown my impression of the place.  I ordered guacamole to order extra spicy no cilantro and my fiancée ordered a burger.  First of all they put cilantro in the guacamole and extra salt in his burger.  When we told them they said they could make the guacamole without cilantro which I have order plenty of times before.  Needless to say we will not recommend this factory to anyone.  If you want a good experience with a factory go to cali.  They got it down packed ......
Tracey M.,"Seattle, WA",8,18,7,1.0,1/2/2017,"I expect a wait to be seated but once seated I expect good service. You should not have to wait an hour for your food after u order. Once we received our food it was clear the order had been sitting for sometime as it was barely warm. Service was mediocre at best. The waitress disappeared for extended periods several times throughout the meal. Thought about saying something at the restaurant but seriously, who want there food messed with?? So I find that a review is the only recourse I have. They won't try to make it right, so next time I'll just dine elsewhere. Very disappointing."
