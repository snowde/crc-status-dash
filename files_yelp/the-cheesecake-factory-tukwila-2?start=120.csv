Mariah E.,"Seattle, WA",332,161,281,5.0,4/5/2016,"I really love Cheesecake factory, their steak, their pasta, their fettuccini, I always order shrimp prawns and salmon to put in my pasta hahaha. Great family place. Great good. Low lighting. Sets the tone. A lot going on in here though lol, but love the decor actually and the art work displayed. This place always has yummy food. Love the bread and butter too lol lol."
Jules S.,"Prosser, WA",9,80,12,2.0,3/25/2016,"I came in here for lunch on a Friday at 2 and the wait was forever so I went to Duke's chowder house. Yay! 5 star food. No wait.  I really wanted to try their famous cheesecake so I came back to get some Togo. I saw huge slices sitting on the counter going out to the tables and ordered the turtle and keylime.  Unfortunately, I didn't look at them until I drove the 3 hrs to get back home. Ugh.  What a disappointment!! They were tiny. I paid the same (over) price as the in-house tables and feel cheated. Won't be returning."
Jason B.,"Portland, OR",3,9,,3.0,12/27/2016,"The three stars are for the food which is usually always good, hot and well prepared.  But if it was based on service it would be one or two.  Due to a handicap I always do the curbside pickup.  Inevitably each time I call someone answers and when I say I want to make a curbside order they transfer me and I end up on hold for a long time.  Usually five or more minutes.  Doesn't matter what time I show up, always a long time on hold.  Once they finally answer the process is fine.  I'm fine to be on hold for a minute or so but I do curb side orders at many restaurants and this CF is without a doubt the longest gold times of any of them.   Ok rant over."
Diana Y.,"Renton, WA",13,19,16,4.0,8/18/2015,"I've always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory. From all the locations I've visited across multiple states, the ambiance, service, and food are consistently good. This location is no exception- the only downside is it's always busy here since they are next to the mall, so most of the time there is a wait no matter when you come in."
Zambrano A.,"Gig Harbor, WA",23,15,21,5.0,7/13/2016,Our waitress IMAN A was one of the best waitress i have seen in a while we will definitely come back to this place really happy with our night:)
Mb H.,"Boise, ID",46,22,5,2.0,3/15/2016,"While they take reservations, it's only for parties of 7 or larger which is something to keep in mind. If you're unable or unwilling to sit in the bar, expect to wait 30+ minutes on a weekend night for even a party of 2.  service is mediocre at best always, food is consistently average at best. But you get a lot for your money. Noise level is always high and wait staff always look like they're five steps behind.  Cheesecake on the other hand is a completely different story. I've never been disappointed with their namesake. If you're just in it for the food, almost worth it to call ahead of time and place a to-go order. No wait, less (if any) tip, and the same quality food."
Nam N.,"Renton, WA",677,802,135,4.0,2/4/2016,"I've been a frequenter of TCF since their first opening back in 2002-03 when they came to Bellevue Square.  I was invited to a soft opening and have always been impressed with the quality of food as well as the service. This location is nothing short of par of a standard for chain restaurants.  When I do stop by and there's an extensive wait I'll either attempt to sit in the bar area (first come first serve) or I'll just leave so the wait has never bothered me.  I pick the right days (avoid weekends and no school nights) to visit and I'm typically sat within 5 minutes or less so that helps with my experience.  Considering I've been coming to TCF locations up and down the west coast for the past 13 years, the menu isn't daunting to me because I know what I want already, which helps.  Because if you are new - the menu is very much overwhelming with too many options for the indecisive to decide.  The have everything from every kind of pasta to beef carpaccio, vietnamese spring rolls to steak diane, mango salads to firecracker shrimp.  If that isn't enough to confuse you what to get, you'll have two pages of different desserts to choose from. My favorite part is the honey wheat bread and butter - delicious! My go to appetizer is the Luau Salad, fresh choke full of fruits and veggies topped with mangos and chicken, it really is a meal in itself.  The ahi tuna salad is also a great choice for healthy eats.  Main course wise, I haven't had anything that I hated, the jambalaya and fettucini are good go to dishes, meatloaf and the burrito are hefty portions and good flavor that can easily be divided by two.  I will say I wasn't a fan of the nachos, only because twice I ordered it and twice it came out dry, most likely due from sitting under a heat lamp waiting to be delivered.  Desserts are a tough choice but I'd have to pick the red velvet cheesecake, not over sweet but dances with that idea, the white chocolate shavings paired with vanilla bean ice cream and it's pure bliss.  My second choice is the strawberry shortcake, towering high of ice cream, shortcake, and ice cream - you can easily share any dessert or food portion with two to three folks and still have plenty to eat. Is it the best food ever? hardly.  Is it the cheapest eats you can find? far from it.  But thanks to the consistency of service and food and my experiences here I do like the place.  And will come back, most likely sooner than later."
Bao-Yen T.,"Seattle, WA",561,157,809,4.0,2/4/2015,"I've never been a fan of chain restaurants but I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory.  PROS:  The atmosphere is elegant, relaxing, yet casual and fun at the same time.  The menu is huge! Can be a bit over whelming for a first timer. Portions are HUGE so be prepared for lots of leftover. They recently came out with a skinnylicious menu and a small plate menu for those who are counting calories. The food has always been pretty consistent.They start you off with fresh baked bread and butter. I've tried a variety of their dishes but i do have a few favorites.  -Caesar salad: It's perfectly tossed, not too heavy. It's very garlicky which i love.  -Steak Diane: I LOVE the mushroom wine sauce served with caramelized onions  and mushrooms.  -Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic: This is my favorite pasta from cheesecake factory. The sauce cream sauce is not too rich. I also love the roasted chunks of garlic served with it.  -Cheesecake: So many different choices of cheesecake to choose from.  CONS:  This place is almost ALWAYS packed so be prepared to wait for a table. They do not accept reservations.  They discontinued my favorite cheesecake! I usually get the simple oreo cheesecake, now there's the oero dream cheesecake which is too rich for my taste buds. That won't stop me from coming back."
Nella N.,"Kent, WA",120,4,,1.0,12/17/2016,"Im shocked by their customer service here. I absolutely love cheese cake factory. But I called them to place an order to go, a girl answered and I told her I wanted to place an order to go. She hung up on me. I called back and a male ansered the phone and out me on hold. I was on hold for almost 10 minutes before I got fed up and hung up. I call back a third time and tell the host I think I was forgotten and they put me on hold for another 5 minutes. All of them seeming super annoyed that I am calling . also last two times I had chicken ballagio it was undercooked"
Stanley W.,"Renton, WA",88,30,43,4.0,2/6/2015,"The thing I love most about the Cheesecake Factory is the portion size and price. You will almost always get a decent value. It's what keeps bringing me back. When I went to the Tukwila one for dinner recently, I ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps, and Chicken Madeira. The wraps are probably one of the better presented items on their menu. It comes with three different sauces, and a lot of colorful chopped veggies for your wraps. The chicken was cooked well and delicious. Of the three sauces provided, I enjoyed the peanut sauce the most. The Chicken Madeira was fantastic. The sauce and mushrooms on their own were amazing, but when paired with the cheese-covered chicken they were absolutely on point. The dish was a little under $20, but was a decent portion size. I ended the meal with a Red Velvet Cheesecake. Like all their other cheesecakes, this one was filling and delicious. They didn't overdo the frosting on the top either.  Overall, the food was fantastic. The service was good. My only gripe was that we were seated really close to a few other tables where we could hear each other's conversations, but it wasn't a big enough issue to detract from the overall experience."
Edie S.,"Tacoma, WA",2,19,13,1.0,3/27/2017,"The description of this restaurant lies: they DO NOT take reservations.  We wanted to take my son and his family out for 4 birthdays that all happen within two weeks of each other. There were 7 ""full size"" people and a 4 month old baby. I called to make reservations and was told they didn't take them. They said the wait would probably be more than 30 minutes. Since I already told my son we would meet them there my husband and I went there to check what the wait would be. They didn't lie about the time. The parking lot and the entry to the restaurant was packed so it didn't look promising. I asked the hostess how long it would be. She wanted my name immediately, put it into the system, then I was told she had to check with the manager for how long on bigger parties. She just stood there so I said, okay are you going to check? She turned to someone else who went off toward the kitchen. I waited for several minutes more. I was never given one of the beeper things so I had to just stand there. I finally asked where the manager was and she finally turned to a man who had come into the hostess station a minute before and then he came and told me it would be 50 minutes. We decided that was too long to wait with a baby and 3 other kids under 12. I said it was very unfortunate that they don't take reservations. One hostess agreed and the manager ignored me. I made sure that he heard me. I asked if it was a store policy or corporate, and he said corporate. The corporate page says that some stores do take reservations for large parties. The manager was less than friendly. I'm sure they don't care because they are obviously busy enough but it would make for a much more enjoyable experience to be able to have a shorter wait with a less crowded waiting area if they actually did take reservations. We went to another restaurant close by and got in immediately. Oh and my husband said that the restroom was a mess and he had no desire to stay after that!"
Meredith M.,"Vancouver, WA",69,184,,3.0,10/2/2016,I love to eat here when I am up in the Seattle area.   The service is great here but depending on what time you go expect a wait unless you get there right when they open.  The other day we got there just as they opened at 11 am and we pretty much had the restaurant to ourselves.   We were seated in 2 top corner table which was fine until they decided to sit another couple right next to us (like literally less than a foot away) a few minutes later.  Just want to say that the other 15 tables down the line were empty.   I can understand if they are busy and need to do that but at 11 am?   It put a damper on our experience especially since the couple decided to start talking to us.   Food was good and it came fast.  Order the Shrimp with Dynamite sauce!   Also had the chicken avocado club.   Ask for mayo on the side!    Overall a good experience food wise but it wasn't great because of the close proximity of the other couple.
Kathy D.,"Tacoma, WA",0,6,,2.0,12/28/2016,"We frequent Cheesecake Factories, and have been to many, many different locations. This location is the WORST out of all we've been.  My kid's pizza was burnt on the bottom. Our crab dip appetizer had the consistency of soup. The espresso ordered was mmmm... I don't even know that it was an espresso. They were out of what I ordered, so went with fish and chips that were ok. Calamari was more a pile of batter with few actual pieces of squid. Finally the salmon was over cooked and dry.  On the up side... service was great as is at all locations! The wait was rather short compared to other locations (now I'm thinking because people don't come back due to the food). Tiramisu cheesecake... of course amazing!"
Anais A.,"Bellevue, WA",0,7,,1.0,12/20/2016,"The guy at the front was being rude, and then the lady that took his spot for our re-seating was even ruder. The layout was ridiculously crammed compared to the Cheesecake factory at downtown Bellevue and the people eating here seemed to have the um... Let me just say Eastern Washington vibe. Oh, and no wifi to make the ridiculous waiting time go by faster."
Thao N.,"Seattle, WA",1683,441,245,4.0,12/28/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory. For some reason this always seem to be the surprise first date spot, birthday dinners, work party, or family get together celebration. It is a safe choice, a nice atmosphere with great food without going too overboard, plus it could be a restaurant that is family friendly for kids. They have a huge menu, it's pages and pages of options ranging from typical american dishes like steak, pasta, and burgers to Mexican and Asian fusion. Some of my favorite appetizers are the avocado eggrolls and Thai lettuce wraps. I heard the fried mac & cheese are a popular choice, but it might be too fattening for my taste. They didn't call it Cheesecake Factory for no reason, the cheesecake options are a menu itself. I've never seen this many choices, you have to try the red velvet cheesecake. If anything, the New York Style cheesecake is always a classic to have if you aren't adventurous in trying new things. You have complimentary bread when dining in, there's 2 kind that they give you;brown and white and let me tell you the brown is the shit, I think it's chocolate flavor. The best part? UNLIMITED bread, but don't get too hooked to it, you still need room for your food. All the entree seems to be huge portions so yay leftovers! Weekends and dinner time are always going to be busier, they don't take reservations on weekends. Watch out for homecoming or prom season because there tend to be large parties on the waiting list so that might delay your wait time. I was there when I was in grade school, it sucks on this end too to have to wait 2 hours to get a table that will hold that big of a party. Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)"
Camilla M.,"Federal Way, WA",58,130,544,5.0,1/31/2016,"My sister, bf and I came in late around 9pm on a Tuesday. We were promptly seated. We got drinks right away and took some time to decide on the food. Ended up sharing 6 large appetizers. Also got drinks and a cheesecake. Our waitress Valerie was incredible. She was so on top of everything from suggestions to answering questions to bringing us everything in the blink of an eye and never forgetting anything we asked for. Just fabulous. Best service we've gotten in a long time.  We frequent CF - and this is just another affirmation as to why !!"
Nareet B.,"Seattle, WA",0,5,2,5.0,6/3/2017,Cheesecake factory is one of my favourite restaurant. Quality of food is really good and i always enjoy their food. The menu is like encylopedia so its really hard to decide what to eat. Their service is good too....
Josh B.,"Lacey, WA",256,905,6224,3.0,11/29/2014,"Sigh....I really want to give this Cheesecake Factory more than 3 stars, but I simply cannot. There are a lot of positives but the one negative that I will explain below really put a damper on the entire experience.  It's hard for me not to like Cheesecake. They are usually always busy in the restaurant area as well as the pickup and cheesecake counter. So, it's popular and slightly trendy.  They have at least 8-12 pages on their menu with a lot...and I mean A LOT of options for practically every diet or set of taste buds. I'm not sure how many of the items are gluten-free though so I would check the menu online before you come. There were a lot of options for myself as a vegetarian, so I was happy about that.  They usually set you up with some warm bread and butter while you wait and skim the menu, but don't eat too much bread because usually the portion size for your entrée is quite large so your eyes need to be as big as your stomach.  I opted for a Veggie Burger as I wasn't feeling like one of the many pastas that I could have eaten. It was actually a good size but basically fell apart as it is mainly made of brown rice and black beans. It would have been better without a bun since the bun didn't serve it's purpose of holding the burger. The burger was also lacking in flavor which was kind of odd since it was basically homemade and some spice or grill flavor could have been added to raise the basic burger up a notch or two.  I didn't opt for cheesecake this time as I didn't want to be too stuffed for the ride home, although most of their cheesecakes are pretty original and very good.  Now to the one item that really stuck in my craw. We went around 7 or 8 in the evening. Understandably, the ambience is suppose to be a little more romantic or intimate with how dimly lit the place was. Seriously though, it was SO dark that we could not see the menus without squinting. We all had to actually take out our cell phones to shed light on the subject. I actually went into the bathroom with the menu because there was more light in there to see. Also, it's hard to see your food when it's so dark and I like to see what I'm eating as sight is a part of the experience of eating along with smell, touch, taste, and even sound. Also if I can see what I'm eating I can tell if it's undercooked or has hair in it or something else. All I'm saying is it would have been nice to have a lamp or light directly on the table or maybe even a faux candle that would brighten up things without sacrificing the intimate feel of the experience.  I will be back to this Cheesecake Factory, but during the daytime. Also, parking can be a little hectic too since it's right outside the mall."
Annette L.,"Palm Springs, CA",40,225,324,4.0,12/6/2015,"This location is ALWAYS busy, thankfully there's parking! They have a horrible waiting situation though. You constantly feel as though you are in the way...because well, you are. Once seated though I have consistently been greeted by the friendliest waitstaff. The food is always timely, hot and delicious. Maybe a little too delicious. Have you ever looked up the calories? If not, don't do it!!  I love the chicken bellagio, the steak and cheese, the burgers are great, the bread with real butter and any of the drinks - YUM! Oddly, I have not found a cheesecake that I like. I usually get the strawberry shortcake. I highly recommend it! Great for small groups or a large party. You can't go wrong. Everyone will find something that they will enjoy."
Adrian G.,"San Jose, CA",1,3,,4.0,11/17/2016,"Went here on a 1st date, dinner evening time (not too busy on a Sunday night).. New to WA, been here 6 weeks (from CA).. Cheesecake Factory always delivers for me and my guest(s).. Service was good, food was good, and drinks were great!! Will go back for sure for a lunch date!!"
