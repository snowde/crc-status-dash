Sonu S.,"Seattle, WA",0,1,,1.0,2/12/2017,What a horrible service I had today...I took my mom today to this place for a great experience but our server turned out to be duche bag...soon as I sat down order a drink and a appetizer.. he came back and said are you ready to order dinner within 2 minutes....I told him are you in a rush?...he said no...ok...no problem...their is as very a huge menu at this place...which is great...but it takes a while to figure out what you want....no disrespect to the cooks food came out and it was ok...i have been to this place few times and food is decent. While I ordered another beer...and working on my food...server came and asked are we done and need a box for pizza and I said yes...he assumed I was done with mine as well and picked up my plate as well...I had to tell him I am still working on it....OK after being Thier for 45 min...I was spose to down to beers and an appetizer and a pizza and my Cajun chicken pasta...and be ready to cash out...OK ...server asked me any deserts.. I said yes do you have any ice cream...he said yes only vanilla...I said ok no worries...he said Thier is a yetti yogurt right around the corner...I looked at him I said that's not what I meant...so long story short ...I don't think this person was trained well enough to be a server...you should never rush your customers answer secondly even though he was trying to help with the suggestion on yetti yogurt...it didn't settle in with me to well...because if cheesecake factory can have such a huge as menu for all the other stuff in thier menu... then they can expand Thier ice cream section as well...it comes in pennies to the dollar....also at the end off your meal ticket Thier were 4 options for gratuity...15% 20% 30% or 40%....this so stupid...it customer is not happy with Thier service then why are they begging  for gratuity...I still choose 20% option...because I didn't want the server to be left out....overall experience at this place has gone down...I will not be contributing to this establishment... usually I never leave bad reviews...but I was truly disappointed.
Kelli E.,"Richland, WA",1,64,1,3.0,3/22/2017,"This was only my second visit ever to a Cheesecake Factory, and a first time for dinner.  First of all, this place was nuts.  After a 45-minute wait, we were seated.  I guess this is the norm here.  We ordered drinks and a couple of appetizers to share.  The spicy Korean-style cauliflower was the best thing I had all night.  Next time, I'm going to order off of the appetizer and small plate menu, as their dinners are ridiculous.  I've always wondered how the calorie and fat counts for Cheesecake Factory were so high (when you read Eat This, Not That).  Well, mystery solved.  It's because the portions are enormous and overwhelming.  I do not want or need a platter of food for any meal.  I will definitely visit again, but I won't order an entree."
Kristina K.,"Kent, WA",120,223,36,5.0,12/28/2015,"This location is ALWAYS busy. The food is great, the service is helpful and the company is amazing but there is always a wait! I am unsure if they are unable to get their customers put through fast enough, if the customers lounge around for hours or if it's the restaurant staff - but the food is delicious and if you have a couple hours to spare - the wait is worth it."
Teresa M.,"Kent, WA",41,428,119,3.0,2/7/2015,"I should say that I'd never come here had I not been invited for a small work function; I'm not their target market and because of that I gave them a higher rating than I would have otherwise. The menu is overwhelming and comes in a spiral bound booklet. The food is what you'd expect from somewhere that serves everything and the kitchen sink - just okay. They're so busy working on quantity that quality suffers.  Service is absent. We were there about 4 hours (not entirely by choice, service is sllloooww) and we were never really checked on. It took forever to place orders and receive them. I saw plenty of staff walking past the table, but no one actually helped us. The times we did receive service it was friendly.  I ordered a margarita (which is served straight up) and received a martini. *sigh* I'm not into gin, but it took so long to receive (~40 min) that I opted to just put up with it, it's was okay (until I keep the price in mind, not worth it!!).  The food is nothing to write home about and it's also overpriced. The burger I ordered had a soggy bun and was so greasy I could only eat half before I felt bogged down for the rest of the evening. Unfortunately I can't comment on their cheesecake. I felt so bad after that grease ball...I mean burger... I had no interest in food, not even for take home."
Eric G.,"Puyallup, WA",3,4,1,5.0,10/18/2016,awesome food great variety of crazy cheese cake all kinds of different flavors ones you would not even imagine wife and are enjoying a birthday lunch awesome
Jiwan S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",5,30,12,3.0,9/30/2016,"It is always very busy here and I finally got a chance to try this place out. Ordered crispy chicken sliders which were great. As for food, my jambalaya was subpar. Very little chicken and shrimp and the pasta used was very very bland. My wife enjoyed they fish tacos and I had a bite of them too and I would probably order those next time. The drinks are not worth the money here though. The raspberry cheesecake was good and that's the one I would get again. Overall this was a very 'meh' experience and didn't live up to the hype for me."
Roger P.,"Lakewood, WA",13,8,5,2.0,8/3/2016,We just dinner here. My son had hair in his Mac n Cheese. I had the classic burger and also had hair in my burger.  We did not even get an apology all we got was do you want a new one. My answer was NO. my son had only taken two bites myself had three bites.  Not very pleased with the food at all.
Stephanie K.,"Seattle, WA",233,32,84,4.0,7/8/2016,Wait time for table is exceptional due to no reservation required. Service is average! Food is always great!
Anthony W.,"Auburn, WA",0,6,,3.0,1/28/2016,"The wait: There was an extended wait, even after my wife asked (via telephone) ""can I go ahead and put my name down, I'm outside in the Peking lot..."" And they would not allow her too. She had to go in.  The service: Over all, adequate.  The food: Amazing! The cheese triangles were just right as an appetizer.  I ordered the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp. I ""must-have"" cuisine! Succulent Thai flavoring, not over spice, and finished with a sweet aftertaste.  The meals would have received  RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Allow customers to reserve a table if they are in the parking lot. If they do not answer when their name is called, simply move to the next name! 2. Review your imagine on Yelp, and make improvements. You probably have a marketing representative that is telling you ""it's just a few negative comments...""  You want to keep customers...listen to them.  3. ""Wow"" your clients. Have your manager/supervisor come by, and ask...""what could we do to improve our service...?""  4. Offer a military discount."
Makio P.,"SeaTac, WA",510,68,216,3.0,11/20/2015,"Went here to celebrate my first week at my new job! It's the best place because of their jambalaya pasta, and strawberry cheesecake! They're open til 12:30 on Friday nights, but their prices are pretty high. That's my only negative thing."
Morgana C.,"Auburn, WA",46,3,3,4.0,1/8/2016,"I came with my family and I had the orange chicken, it wasn't bad, it was pretty good, but it tasted too much like lemon. The pieces were a little too big also, I had to cut a few in half to get a decent bite of chicken and rice. When I asked for chopsticks our waitress said she'd check and she came back with the last pair of chopsticks, thank God! Our waitress was very nice though, she was very understanding with the younger kid at our table who was very talkative and picky about what he wanted."
Alanna M.,"Seattle, WA",2250,649,1953,4.0,7/1/2013,"You know for a chain restaurant, this has improved a ton over the years!  Their cheesecakes have always been pretty awesome but their food selection is pretty decent now.  It used to be pretty bad, but they've revamped it quite a bit.  I often like to play it safe and order the vegetable salad with grilled chicken.  The dressing is awesome & it's refreshing & light.  They have a skinny version, but I prefer to eat a smaller portion and have it taste good.   They've got all your basic American style dishes including steaks, salmon, salads, and a mixture of stuff from all over the world including Vietnamese salad rolls, Samosas, etc.  If I have to go to a chain restaurant for whatever reason -- usually there are kids involved... this is one of my top choices because there are healthier menu items to choose from.  The menu is also pretty extensive so there's a little something for everyone. Service is always pretty decent."
Sarah L.,"Bremerton, WA",11,24,19,5.0,7/20/2016,First time here. The best meal I have had in Seattle. The aloha salad was amazing. The cheese cake Smores was awesome. Get it and share. It's super rich but super good!! Will be back!
Rubina P.,"Renton, WA",12,104,95,3.0,11/11/2015,"Hmm this may not be the best cheesecake factory around. There were flies flying around near the kitchen area. And the food wasn't as great as other cheesecake factories. I was really confused when I ordered mac n' cheese and they brought out some fried balls. It wasn't gross, but definitely not what I was expecting."
Joni K.,"Seattle, WA",430,108,1969,1.0,8/24/2015,"My family and I had dinner at the Cheesecake Factory (Tukwila, WA location) for my cousin's 30th birthday Sunday, August 9th. We arrived around 7:30pm, and since the dinner crowd had died down, we were seated after about a 10 min wait which wasn't bad. We had seven (7) people in our party and three (3) of them were hungry children.  While the dinner rush was dying down, we literally saw our server at our table perhaps three (3) time out of the entire meal (twice I had to go to the front to track him down). We literally waited ten (10) minutes for our waiter to come take our drink order. Then we waited another fifteen (15) minutes for our drinks and starter bread. By that time, the kids were whiny and hungry.  Our dinner entrees took a long time to arrive so when it finally did, we were each excited as we were famished. I'm medically diagnosed as gluten-free and become highly ill when I am exposed to gluten. Therefore, when I placed my order, I communicated this to our waiter. He assured me that both mine and my spouse's gluten-free pasta dishes would be safe and explained that the dish would be served with a fusilli (corkscrew-like) pasta noodle. When our food arrived and after taking several bites of my gluten-free carbonara, I was highly disappointed to find that there was a spaghetti noodle in it. I tracked our server down and explained that since it was my cousin's birthday, I didn't want to cause a scene but wanted to confirm if the only gluten-free noodles they were serving was in fusilli.  My waiter confirmed that the only gluten-free noodles available were in the fusilli shape which is what he had served me and my spouse. I then informed him that there was a spaghetti noodle in my gluten-free pasta which basically meant that I was exposed to gluten and would now be getting sick. At that point, he almost robotically informed me that the meal would be deducted from my meal. Despite the lack of empathy, it was a nice attempt to try to resolve the matter. However, being medically allergic to gluten, his resolution did not comfort me as I now knew that I would be getting sick due to the lack of diligence.  After I had already explained to our waiter that I didn't want to disrupt my cousin's birthday celebration, the manager then arrives at the table to inquire about the meal. I pull him to the side and again, explained that it was my cousin's celebration so I'd prefer to speak with him away from the table. At that point, the manager, Steven, curtly tells me that he intended to come to the table to not only follow up on the status of my gluten-free meal, but to also check on everyone else as well. Steven then proceeded to tell me that since he was now only speaking to me, he wanted to tell me that, ""The kitchen takes celiac allergies very seriously. Out of everyone in the restaurant, you're the only one who has a regular noodle in their gluten-free meal."" I found his response to me was non-empathetic and unprofessional. I informed him that I had saved the noodle on the side of my plate and that if he was insinuating I was making it up, he could verify himself. He then told me he would like to make me a new meal or give me mine free. At that point, the kids were tired and exhausted from waiting forever for service and food and we all just wanted to go home. I politely told him that we had waited forever for service and food, that I wasn't happy that I was now going to become ill due to non-gluten-free meal. I asked him to please immediately have boxes sent to our table and also the birthday treat I had previously requested them to provide to my cousin.  After waiting another fifteen (15) minutes, I went to the front and again, tracked our server and asked for our boxes and check. As I was walking back to my table, I saw another gentleman speaking to the manager, Steven. The customer was obviously upset as I heard the customer tell Steven, ""It's not even about the bad food, but no one even apologized for their mistake."" Steven was disregarding this customer as he disregarded me. I left the restaurant exhausted, sick, and hungry. My cousin left without his birthday celebration treat and proceeded to wait another twenty (20) minutes in the ""To-go Cheesecake"" line to order his own birthday cake. By the time we left, it was around 10:30pm. Overall TERRIBLE TERRIBLE experience... bad service, lack of empathy and care with client food allergies, and non-empathetic management which I'm sure which all derives from the horrible ""lead by example"" leadership style exhibited by manager, Steven. This lack of leadership teaches his team to not care for their customers. I've ate here several times in previous years and I've never had a problem. If Steven continues to lead the team at this location, this restaurant will soon be unsuccessful. As customers who understand the true value of customer service and quality of food, will find it very easy to resort to dining at the next restaurant in the busy Southcenter mall area"
Mae D.,"Kent, WA",137,314,404,1.0,9/26/2014,"Rude rude rude. They were having some medical issues in the bar area. I told the lady up front and I had asked to let us know when the bar opened up since the wait was a 30 minute wait. The lady had told me again no seating in the bar. Duh, I said to let me know when it's open again. I was not pleased with my first encounter at this cheesecake. And it has been open for along while now and it's still busy! May as well go to Bellevue or Seattle... At least the food is consistent so, doesn't matter which location you go to. My experience with the takeout staff was very smooth. The gal at the cheesecake counter was nice, friendly and accommodating. I called in my desert order and they had it ready for me. That I really liked. I just wished the front desk would have been as accommodating. I totally understand medical issues happen, all I wanted was to be notified if the bar opened back up. I didn't need the attitude. I may try it one more time, but definitely not worth even a 15 minute wait... I will call for take out though, they are a lot nicer and more accommodating."
Corinne M.,"Tacoma, WA",488,532,119,5.0,9/21/2015,"I consider myself to be a foodie, we talk food all of the time at our house. We've had friends in the past tell us to only go to the cheesecake factory for the cheesecake, however to never eat there because the food wasn't that good (they were wrong FYI).  I took my youngest son to this place late one summer night recently, we tried the food, and we loved it.  I latter wanted to surprise my oldest son with dinner from here for his birthday,  at first he was reluctant to eat here because he had heard all of the negative comments too.  Vanessa was our server; my son was determined to give her a hard time (in a playful way); she got down to his level and played right along with him, he warmed up, and even attempted to share his food with her.  The drinks and appetizers were delicious.  There were a few hick-ups with the dinner part, but we didn't care one single bit due to how well we were being treated by Vanessa.  Life had thrown us some curve balls earlier that week, we weren't in the best of spirits, however for the time that we were there Vanessa took such good care of us, that our worries, and heartache were able to subside, and were able to be set aside our problems for even just a few hours, for us it meant more to us than just having a good server, or food.  I told her that the world needed more people like her, and it does, people like Vanessa don't come along very often, I know that I'm singing praises about her right now, but it just truly showed me what humanity was all about, and how someone can make someone else's day brighter just by smiling, engaging with them, and being kind to strangers; so I just had to give her another shout out in a review!"
Skeptical A.,"Seattle, WA",0,12,,2.0,9/19/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has highly ""popularized"" food - defined by market researchers to give people what they want: loaded with fat, big portions, and sugar galore. Once in awhile, it's irresistible. Nearly everyone likes it even kids. And who can resist 1,000 calorie slices of cheesecake?  So go once in a blue moon. BUT know that this particular cheesecake factory is rude. Tried to make a reservation for a birthday party and they were so rude about saying they don't take them (except for the 1st 45 minutes they're open - huh?) Anyway - note to MANAGEMENT - if someone wants to bring a large party to your restaurant, you probably should accommodate them. Big parties typically mean big receipts."
Joshua J.,"Seattle, WA",107,54,89,5.0,8/28/2016,Always a pleasure when I go here. The chicken bellagio is a must try for pasta and chicken lovers. The crisp batter on the chicken gives a nice crunch while still tender on the meat and the pasta sauce is always just right. Very light look to it but almost creamy when you taste it. Definitely a nice and simple place for great food.
Amy O.,"Silverdale, WA",91,59,8,4.0,6/21/2016,"Super long wait. But food and service was great! I don't know why so many people rate it low, obviously they are doing fine cause it was PACKED and we waited an hour."
