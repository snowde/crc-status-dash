PJ P.,"Renton, WA",1,28,2,4.0,11/24/2015,Portion here are rediculously huge!  Happy hours are usually 4 to 6pm and their appitizer aren't any smaller then their regular meals for around 5 bucks!  Great eat for just about any kind of food.  Their menu are like 4 retaurants combined.  There has got to be something that the picky eater in your party has got to like.  Great environment.  Wife and I enjoyed eating there often.  Crowded at night and weekend. Only reason I took off a star was because some of their younger staff at the front end taking in waiter aren't as nice as expected... sometime outright rude... but they're young... and stupid LOL  wateva
Yuen Tung P.,"Seattle, WA",173,123,96,3.0,8/6/2014,"We came here for a goodbye lunch for a coworker that was leaving us on aSundayreafternoon. Weather was a little hotter than usual but we opt to sit outside because there was no line and the heat isnt something we can't handle. One person got the table first, and then within 10 minutes, everyone was there and seated. The waiter/server didn't come by to offered anyone any drinks or to take appetizer order till 15 minutes later. I find that to be unacceptable. And he told us, we have to ""ask"" for bread since is no longer something that they have to give to every table. Yet after observing other server and other tables, we notice that servers are still bringing the bread to the table without being ""asked"". So what made us that special??? I also had asked for a couple extra butter and more bread. But he never came with them. Near the end of the meal, I asked him to add a loaf of bread to my order so I can take it home. He was like ""oh im sure you can get it for free and that I wont have to add it to your order."" But it was on my bill in the end. I mean, I was planning to pay anyways, but why would you suggest something or say something if you can't follow up with it.  The only reason why there is 3 stars is because I love the food here and when our server went on break, this other guy name Joseph took over, and he honestly deserve the ""best server award"". He was funny and caring and he genuinely listen to what you have to say. Everything that our previous server was not.  If I ever were to come back, I would only want to sit at joseph's area. Just saying. :)"
J.a. O.,"Renton, WA",0,6,,2.0,11/9/2015,"I'm surprised by the lack of quality control. Our appetizers were forgotten until we reminded our server, one of my party was missing asparagus from her hibachi stake and I found a potato stem in my potatoes. Thankfully their kitchen manager Jim quickly righted our issues and compensated. A lower rating for this out of the ordinary experience."
Kristy T.,"Seattle, WA",2,38,23,3.0,10/10/2015,"I've been to this location multiple times and I love eating at the Cheesecake Factory but the wait during the evenings is so long sometimes but worth the wait. (If you come before 5:30pm on the weekends, the wait is at least 5-10mins).  The customer service at this location is a hit or a miss. Sometimes your waiter is friendly and sometimes not so much, depending on who you get. When I went yesterday, our waiter was wonderful and helpful. I believe her name was Ronnie.  Our complimentary bread, drinks and food came out at a reasonable time.  I always get the Steak Diane and strawberry lemonade and it's always good.  The steak Diane comes with mushrooms and mash potatoes. It comes with a good portion at its price.  As for the strawberry lemonade, it's the best strawberry lemonade I've ever had. They give you a reasonable amount for the price as well.  I ordered to go food towards the end for my aunt and it came out right when i received the check. Also, when our waiter came back to give us our check back, she also checked to make sure that our to go food was correct which was wonderful.  The customer service here last night was wonderful and so was the food."
Stacy O.,"Renton, WA",0,12,,3.0,9/23/2016,"Never been here before, but I had a gift card to use so hubby and I tried it last night. Wait was approx. 30 minutes which isn't that bad, considering this location. Booth was very comfortable. We waited about 15 minutes or so for our drinks but they were pretty good. Server was really nice and checked on us often throughout our meal. I believe her name was Sara. We both agreed that the food was just ok, nothing special. (I had the Cuban sandwich and he had a burger).  I agree with someone else's review that the piece of to-go cheesecake I ordered was a sliver compared to the size you see in the restaurant. Haven't eaten it yet as we were both too full from dinner to have it last night. Don't think we would go back for food, but maybe cheesecake sometime."
JLM B.,"North Bend, WA",36,18,24,1.0,8/4/2016,"Called in advance (and spoke to the Bakery Department) for  a half strawberry,  half original cheesecake.   Was assured that it would be ready in ten minutes.  We arrived 35 minutes later, and the order wasn't ready.   Ended up with half original and half Hershey's because it was going to be faster than the five extra minutes it would take to put strawberries on. Was not an unreasonable length of time if I ordered at the counter.   Was completely unreasonable for a pre-order."
Crystal S.,"Wapato, WA",188,56,83,5.0,1/31/2016,"Had a great lunch with family during a layover before headed back to Cali. I had the garlic pasta and added chicken abs it was yummy! Not too much garlic and I asked for the sauce in the side.  The complimentary bread was yummy. For dessert I ordered the Godiva chocolate cheesecake . It was so smooth and the chocolate want overbearing and eating it with the whipped cream was silky and smooth. Thanks again for a great lunch before flying out,  will visit again."
Theresa W.,"Lynnwood, WA",0,6,,3.0,9/19/2016,Spent the day at hospital with family. Wanted to relax with dinner. Food excellent but about the end someone proceeded drop a very large amount of dishes. Of course very loud but the worst part was how they cleaned it up! Even louder slamming the dishes not caring at all about people trying to eat
Carmen R.,"Seattle, WA",10,33,46,5.0,7/31/2016,"I Love the Cheesecake Factory. The hostess and waitress were very nice and considerate. The food is really good, my favorite is the fried cheese and the smores cheesecake. The wait time was only like 10 minutes on a Friday night so that wasn't too bad. It can be a bit noisy but its not unbearable. I ordered a pasta that I didn't particularly like and the waitress took it off of our tab. ( I didn't even ask). She checked on us many times even though she had a lot of other tables."
Kathy L.,"Seattle, WA",630,16,16,2.0,8/27/2015,"First time at Cheesecake Factory. **and I must start off by saying that yes, I have history and experience working at restaurants. ** We were told the wait would be 20 minutes to sit inside. After a 35 minute wait, we told them it's fine if were seated outside because we didn't want to wait any longer (which we noticed was near empty on our way in, because it was a little colder outside due to the overcast).  10-15 minutes later (after we told them we'd rather just sit outside of its easier /faster for them) -- we were finally seated, inside. Given our menus without a word and approached 15 minutes later to ask what type of drinks wanted. If you ask me, maybe they can spend less time adding random mediocre stuff to the huge array of a menu that they have and hire more waitresses or bussers to get people in and out in a more timely manner.  Bottom line: if it were my choice, I wouldn't go back."
Amanda S.,"Renton, WA",134,99,164,4.0,7/11/2015,"The menu is a beast to navigate. But for a chain restaurant, Cheesecake Factory is my favorite. It is consistent, clean, delicious with very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  We arrived for Iftar (breaking fast during Ramadan) at 845 on a weeknight and were seated immediately (which is not typical). I love the bread basket to start and ordered the Greek salad. It is delicious and contains baby arugula, tomatoes, cucumbers, feta cheese and kalamta olives. I had the Skinnylicious shrimp tacos for my entree.  I couldn't eat all 3! So delicious and flavorful.  We had the strawberry cheesecake for dessert! Always a favorite.  Will come back soon if we want a chain dinner lol."
Kimberly E.,"Ephrata, WA",21,17,,4.0,7/31/2016,"As first time customers we were pleasantly surprised at the variety of the menu. Overall the food was very good. The Alfredo sauce was amazing!! The dinner bread was very good. We had the original cheesecake and the snickers cheesecake and both were amazing!! My only compliant is I feel our waiter could have been more  attentive. He didn't bring ketchup for my sons burger nor did he ask us if we wanted refills, but other than that his servers was ok."
Sheri C.,"Seattle, WA",210,1826,1610,2.0,6/23/2015,"I am updating my review based on my most recent experience.  Go elsewhere for dinner. Last week, I came in to have dinner with the BFF. He told me he was there 10 minutes before I arrived. When I went to the host stand and said I was meeting someone, the hostess stared at me for a minute then said she didn't have anyone down for waiting for a guest. I asked her to look again, giving her my name and my friend's name. She acted put out and said she had nothing. I asked if I could look around. She glared at me then said fine but she knew he wasn't there. I walked around the restaurant and wasn't able to find him. I called his cell and texted him; no answer. I then went back to the host stand, gave the same girl my name and said I would like a table until I could connect with my friend. It was 5 pm on a Wednesday; a few people were waiting. She said I could wait for a table. After a few minutes, a waitress was yelling over the noise of the restaurant - it is ridiculously loud in here - ""party of 2"" over and over. No one responded because she didn't say a name. She then barreled over to me and angrily asked if I was waiting for a table and before I could answer, she demanded to know why I didn't give my name to the hostess. She showed me a ticket while doing this that didn't show a name. I said yes, I want a table and yes, I gave my name and my friend's name several times! Finally seated, I connected with my friend who told me he had put his name down for a table before going outside.  We had talked for 30 seconds when our waitress appeared, asking what we wanted to order. I told her we just sat down, give us 5 minutes. One minute later she was back. My friend hadn't opened his menu yet, telling me about his day. She came back one minute later so we both just picked something.  My friend got spaghetti and I ordered a salad. The food was just ok. The salad was a huge portion. I took half home. The waitress grabbed the plates while we were still eating, but we didn't say anything because we just wanted out of there. The point of having a meal is to enjoy your company and your food, and we couldn't do that with the constant interruptions and sheer noise due to the horrible acoustics. She dropped off the check without asking if we wanted any dessert, but again, I was happy to just go."
Rik A.,"Spokane, WA",0,74,1,4.0,7/27/2016,"I don't actually like cheese cake, so I'm not sure what I was doing there.  That being said, the menu was HUGE.  It was a bit too daunting for someone who had never been there before.  They even serve breakfast.  Faced with too many choices, I opted for spaghetti and meatballs.  They weren't good, they weren't bad.  After dinner I did have the most delicious chocolate cake I had ever had. The food was fine, the decor kind of strange (it bordered on a Reno casino-type feel), but every single person there seemed to hate their job.  The male host was not at all friendly and we had to drag some personality out of our server.   The cake made up for its shortcomings, though."
Spencer J.,"Kennewick, WA",0,1,,1.0,8/6/2017,"The food was good, but that was about it. When I brought in my own bottle of wine and expected them to open it for a corking fee like most restaurants use, they had absolutely no idea what to do with it. It was more of a hassle than it was worth. When my sister ordered her second glass of wine at around 10 pm, a new server came over and told her that they had to stop serving as of now because of a mechanical issue they were having in the bar. My husband called BS and ended up getting her the wine in the end. The man was very rude about it. When we got up to leave, my daughter wanted a piece of cheesecake as we walked by the counter. It was no later than 11 and the girls behind the counter let us pick one out and everything before they told us that they were no longer serving Cheesecake. An hour and a half before closing time they stopped serving cheesecake and two and a half hour before closing they stopped serving alcohol. There's nothing mechanical about pouring wine. Unless your arm is broken there should never be a mechanical issue to stop you from pouring wine."
Anna K.,"Seattle, WA",0,50,53,5.0,2/5/2016,"My boyfriend and I go to TCF once or twice a month, and so far we've had only good experience. The food is good, price is fair and cheesecakes are amazing!  Customer service is always great! Restrooms are spotless clean. Dinner rush can be a real pain, due to long wait, but if you go during day time it should be fine"
Greg M.,"Federal Way, WA",22,28,2,1.0,1/25/2017,Not sure I will be going back. I used to like it there but two consecutive times we have sat in the bar area and had NOOOOO service. No acknowledgement. No menus. Completely ignored. We even stared at servers. Nothing. We waited over ten minutes. I tried to get a table in the normal dining room and mentioned my displeasure. No one cared. Business as usual. I can't give them my money anymore.
Macee F.,"Roseville, CA",19,21,2,1.0,6/26/2016,"So disappointed. Came here, there was a wait which is fine except they failed to mention that they were out of a bunch of stuff. We were seated and waiter came to take our order. I asked for the fried zucchini and she said they are out. Then I asked for pepperoni pizza and she said they are out of pepperoni. Then I asked for a different pizza and she said they are out of dough for the pizza. And to top it all off she was rude. When we asked for a wine sample she poured so little that it was impossible to even get a a good taste. Not coming back here."
Mariel L.,"Seattle, WA",43,11,69,3.0,8/2/2014,"We ordered calamari for appetizers & I really enjoyed it esp the sauces (garlic dip &  cocktail sauce) that it came with. The calamari are not overly coated with veeading and it doesn't fall apart. However, my BF said it's not seasoned enough that he went looking for salt & pepper to dash some over it. Then we ordered the garlic spaghettini noodles with fresh asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, tomato, pancetta, peas, caramelized onions In a roasted garlic-Parmesan cream cheese ~ I enjoyed it! No complaints - pasta was al dente, the chicken was moist and crunchy on the outside, the asparagus was not overcooked & the mushrooms - to die for! However, again, my BF thinks it's too salty & he can't taste the garlic!  We ended it with Reese's peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake - which he enjoyed but I'm not a sweet tooth person so I can't comment much on this!"
Ross R.,"Seattle, WA",0,3,,5.0,2/11/2017,"I have been dining at Cheesecake Factory locations for almost 20 years.  If you want to see an All Star team in action dine at the bar here in Tukwila.  They are courteous, professional and friendly.  Let them pick a dessert for you and you won't be disappointed."
