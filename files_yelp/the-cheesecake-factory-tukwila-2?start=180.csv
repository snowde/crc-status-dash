Timothy S.,"Tacoma, WA",41,1,1,4.0,2/10/2016,Nicole was our server...and she was awesome. Food was quick to come out! Very nice place. I'll be back for sure.
David W.,"Bellevue, WA",99,21,6,4.0,1/14/2016,This place is pack all the time for a reason. The pasta was really enjoyable and the cheesecake was great. (That's why it called Cheesecake factory!).  The waitress was a little slow when we were eating there. They may need to hire more people for such a busy restaurant. It was a great experience overall.
Chris S.,"Chatsworth, CA",255,1601,6242,4.0,10/28/2015,"Being a huge national chain, most of us who eat out often know what to expect from the Cheesecake Factory. Rest assured this location is no different than any of the others. You'll find solid service, consistent meals, quality and large portions. There's few better places for dates, celebrations, family meals or solo outings at the bar stool. This is one chain that always delivers. Why so many people give it average ratings has always surprised me. I'm guessing it's because the meals aren't dirt cheap. Meanwhile, what do you expect? With portions as big as they are and quality meals you get what you pay for. In fact, many eat half and take the rest home.  In fact, even the bread they bring to your table is better than many meals served by competitive chains, as is the passion tea. Another factory to consider is there is something for everyone here. On the other hand, a massive menu can't make it a chore to decide what to eat. There's nothing on the menu that doesn't hit the spot, and if you disagree you are one of those guests that complain about everything."
Jeff R.,"Spokane, WA",113,245,1199,5.0,6/17/2014,"We had the Mac and Cheese Burger, Shepards Pie, and Soup and Sandwich.  All we excellent and cooked perfectly.  For desert we shared a S'mores Cheesecake and it was our of this world good.  The only thing that did not meet expectations was the Tropical Iced tea that my daughter ordered.  It tasted like it was flavorded with a bar of soap.  We let the waitress know and she removed it from the bill.   So this really isn't a negative as they took care of the issue.  We will definately be back."
Shane Y.,"Seattle, WA",46,176,17,1.0,3/23/2015,"I will never, for the life of me understand how this place is always busy. Its a chain restaurant that serves horrible meals at asinine prices yet the place is always full. I've been thinking about coming here for years but never wanted to deal with the crowd. Showed up at 11:00 a.m. on a Friday and decided to give it a try. I nearly instantly regretted the decision. We sat ourselves in the bar area which apparently isn't allowed, we were immediately scolded by a waitress that we weren't allowed to do that but since it was slow she would let it slide. Why inform us at all if you are going to serve us. I don't need to be told cheesecake bar-room adequate is different from the rest of the country if you aren't going to do anything about it. I apologize for seating myself at the bar, had you had a competent hostess I wouldn't have broken your unwritten bar rules. Needless to say I wasn't impressed with the service.  The food itself is what you can expect from a chain that doesn't have an executive chef. Frozen style meals heated up by minimum wage earning high school kids. A margarita pizza to them is frozen dough, with tomato sauce and a cheese stick chopped into pieces and barley melted. (Yes the same cheese sticks you buy at Safeway for your 3 year old child.) No one told them about basil apparently. Maybe you shouldn't have a menu of 200 items if you cant' remember what goes on each dish. How about specializing on 30 things you can do really well... Overall it doesn't matter morons will still dine at your establishment so whats the point of cooking good food. After lunch we waited 40 minutes with half full plates in front of us because our waitress forget about us when the lunch rush started. We expected this since she of course still blamed us for eating at the wrong table or something.  At the end of the day none of this matters. For some reason people still eat here in droves. Instead of reviewing the restaurant I should be shaming the fools that dine here. If you eat at the cheesecake factory you are disgracing American food. There are hundreds of places in the same vicinity that deserve your business. This establishment doesn't. I hope you don't make the same mistake I did and find a pleasant place to eat where the food is delicious, the staff is courteous and your hard earned dollars are supporting people that deserve it. I will never lower myself to the standards set by the cheesecake factory and eat here again. That's my promise to fellow yelpers who care about where they eat."
Jermone S.,"Seattle, WA",134,7,,4.0,1/5/2016,Possibly turned into one of my favorite restaurants around southcenter. The four cheese pasta was bomb!!!!!! And so was the cheesecake but it took about 15 minutes to get out.  Recommend if you're a baller $$$$
Shauna C.,"Federal Way, WA",0,9,2,2.0,12/18/2016,"We come here on plenty of occasions and had amazing service.  Well we went here tonight and the services was horrible.  First you now offer an app on the phone to pay for our food and we had to ask four people before anyone even remembered about this app. I ordered a kids spaghetti and meatballs in the past the waiters have kindly had this split for my kids as my 3 year old and 6 year old aren't going to finish a giant portion of spaghetti we still bring left overs home, well tonight we were told they are not allowed to spilt kids portions, when you have three kids to attend to this is a  pretty big deal and it would be nice to be given this option as we have had in the past and as many other restaurants are willing to do. I ordered the Jamaican black pepper shrimp and literally had 4 pieces of tiny shrimp in my meal that were sold extremely over cooked."
Jeff N.,"Seattle, WA",421,284,8268,4.0,8/18/2015,"If you have a friend from Korea visiting and want to take him to someplace American, this is a great place.  The menu is huge, the food was good and the service was impeccable.  I did not have to ask for anything.  My friend was very impressed and really liked the food.  We ended up only getting one piece of cheesecake because we were so full and we're taking most of the food home I recommend this place if you're bringing people from out of the country.  It is a slice of Americana in excess!"
Kelly J.,"Kent, WA",0,8,8,3.0,7/14/2017,"the salad and the pasta were pretty good, my sons frys were not fresh at all. the worst was the staff the waitress just seemed annoyed to be there and the girl that asked if we needed parmesean cheese just rolled her eyes at my daughter when she said yes. the only reason they are getting a 3 is because of the cheesecake if there wasnt cheesecake there they would get one star."
David W.,"Auburn, WA",133,17,,4.0,7/27/2016,"This place always has very good food. However it always drives me nuts that the wait is so long. I had the shortest wait I've ever had there, it was about a half an hour. The place is always packed. I guess that is not a bad thing, it just makes it harder for me to have the desire to eat there again. The waitress was very professional and did well though.  Bang bang chicken and shrimp is a must!!!"
Scott O.,"Lewiston, ID",12,150,64,3.0,7/25/2015,"Love the fact they are open late, created a perfect setting for a perfect day.  The waiter was quick and gracious and the cheesecake...heavenly!   Prior to my dessert, I had the macaroni cheeseburger, it was ok but not anything to brag about.   Will I return, I believe so and perhaps my review will increase to 4 stars."
Alishea T.,"Seattle, WA",1,24,5,4.0,4/16/2015,I'm only knocking off that 5th star because they replaced their amazing beet and faro veggie burger with some typical mushroom based abomination. :( I wish places would stop doing this. We are sick of mushrooms and black beans. Your old veggie burger was AMAZING! Now I end up getting a few of small plates and appetizers which is fine. But ends up being about 3 times the cost of the burger and fries. Frustrating and just not as good when what you want is a good burger! The food is tasty and hot. Servers are friendly and prompt. My only complaint is literally the burger!
Lyndsey N.,"Saint Louis, MO",52,263,267,5.0,3/1/2015,"I was in SeaTac and looking for a great restaurant to try while in town. I have always loved the Cheesecake Factory, and this location was very nice. I sat at the bar and ordered the amazing Georgia peach, yes, $10 for the drink but its worth it., sneaky how the cocktails don't show the price! I arrived at happy hour and they have a great selection on that menu. But you get a large traditional menu which can be overwhelming only because everything on the menu sounds great!...I decided to try the crusted chicken romano. delicioso! They never disappoint and have top notch wait staff and service. I was happy I found this place while I was visiting town. Best meal I had while in Seattle."
Natalie G.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,13,13,4.0,9/18/2015,"THE VEGAN COBB SALAD WAS GIGANTIC! A+ for presentation as well as the variety of vegetables, beans, and grains. I just wish they laid off the salt on the chestnut but other than that, it was fantastic."
Tracy A.,"Omaha, NE",16,63,47,3.0,3/29/2016,"Consistent food, decent service, and always love the cheesecake. Only issue I have is the hosts...they're usually not very welcoming, don't really smile much or offer a friendly hello."
Vik B.,"Belmont, CA",2,40,7,4.0,6/2/2016,Had to wait 29 minutes to get a table. Wish they took reservations. That's the only reason why I gave this restaurant 4 stars and not 5. Otherwise food was delicious. Ambience was nice and most staff was friendly.
Daniel P.,"Renton, WA",0,6,,1.0,10/11/2015,"I was in here on Saturday night, October 10th. Me and my family frequently visit this location and the Bellevue one but after what happened last night I'm going to be cautious about coming here and ordering here.  No complaints on the costumer service or any of that but my complaint here is me and another family member both got sick from the burgers there. It's sort of clear since they were during the rush they didn't cook the meat well enough or maybe it was old meat. I'm very disappointed that a place like this would give me and another family member food poisoning. Don't order burgers from here."
Kelsea-Ann L.,"Hampton, VA",57,37,31,2.0,1/20/2016,"I don't like giving average ratings but this place deserves it.  First, the wait is long like I expected and I was told 30 minutes. When I came back after 40 minutes they told me 30 minutes yet again. After almost 2 hours of eating we were seated. We knew what we were going to eat but the waiter was nowhere to be seen. We were seated for 20 minutes no water, no bread, no help at all. Finally 30-35 minutes of waiting the waiter came to our table asking what we wanted. We ordered our meals and said for dessert we want a cake. The first thing that came was our dessert. We said we wanted it later so the waiter suggested go pack it up. Which we didn't want at all. So we kept the cake on our table while we wanted for the food. Once we got our food everything was fine. Food was okay. The pizza my dad had was burnt. My brother had the Thai curry. I had the Chicken Bellagio. It tastes pretty good. Yet the service was really killing me...he was quick to give us the bill and pick it up which gave off a bad impression. I understand he might have been busy that night but giving attitude when we ask for napkins or more water pushed my buttons. I can't tolerate a bad attitude especially if me, a customer is being nice about it...not sure if I want to go back.."
Nittaya S.,"Auburn, WA",3,65,10,2.0,3/14/2016,"Food quality is okay, the best thing there is the dessert. Service is VERY SLOW, which I am surprised because I see servers and bussers everywhere! When we dine it's normally busy. And as I get seated, I always see a table that needs to be cleaned/cleared every time, and it stays dirty for at least five minutes.... Like do you know how many people are waiting to be seated right now. I work in the restaurant industry and servers can at least help here and there. It doesn't hurt to...."
Mark V.,"Renton, WA",55,39,13,4.0,6/22/2015,"My visit tonight was 4 stars. A Monday night and I must say there was quite a lot more people tonight than I would have expected. We checked in and they said a 15 min wait, I asked do we get a pager? She said nope not for waits this short .  Actually. The wait was just over 15 min. We got seated and our waitress greeted right away. Food was fast tonight and filling. Togo is always a great choice too! Don't forget the cheesecake! The red velvet cheesecake is my favorite!"
