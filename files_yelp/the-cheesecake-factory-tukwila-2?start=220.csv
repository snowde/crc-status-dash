Andrew H.,"Port Orchard, WA",1,9,,2.0,4/24/2016,"So what is the appropriate compensation for a restaurant to give you for getting a mouth full of mud half way through your dinner?  They don't charge you for just the entree.  Really?  My meal is ruined, I get to watch the rest of my family eat ALL of their dinner and all I get is $16.95 off the ticket.  If we ever come back it will be just for the cheesecake."
Remus H.,"Maple Valley, WA",105,57,50,5.0,3/3/2016,"I have been to both eastside locations and both have great food. I also went to brunch with some work friends and service was great, the waits are always so long but, understandable the spaces are always next to malls .. ( people go to malls ) favorite items are the tamales and the club sandwich .. when i did drink the adult gorilla milkshake was also a hit."
Sally H.,"Des Moines, WA",0,8,,4.0,7/23/2016,"Went there for my little sisters birthday, they charged her for the cake on her birthday (why I took a star down) but other than that the food was great! The bill of a family of 5 was a little over $120, but we expected that price range walking in! Will be going back (:"
Mike L.,"Des Moines, WA",35,26,11,3.0,12/28/2015,"We waited forever to get seated 50min.  The waiter took 20mins before getting us water, bread or even taking our order.  My water nor anyone else at my table water was ever refilled.  But for pros the food was definitely a 5 star.  So I'm going to average it out as a 3.  If you are patient enough for some good for this is the spot for you."
Christian A.,"Renton, WA",0,8,,4.0,10/17/2016,"Had a birthday meal with my folks.  We were seated very quickly.  The restaurant is always busy, but we got lucky just after the lunch crowd & before dinner.  I'll have to remember this time again.  Our server was prompt, but seemed very dismissive.  The food was excellent.  I had the miso salmon, delicious...I'm very picky about ordering seafood.  This was cooked perfectly, not overlooked like many restaurants do.  I will order this again.  Seated quickly, great food, fast service...a little too fast though.  Note to servers:  Don't ask me how my meal is as you walk away as I answer your question.  Hey, we all have off days...She still got a 20% tip ;)."
Michael Y.,"Auburn, WA",63,239,44,4.0,1/25/2014,"We came here while staying at the nearby Double Tree not expecting too much with an over all three star review. We arrived about quarter to five on a Saturday evening. There was about a 45 minute wait, which turned out to be pretty close to right on.  After a few minutes of getting situated at our table we were greeted by our waitress who was quite friendly. The menu is huge!  Lots to choose from for food or (of course) cheesecake, but only three beers on draft :(. Oh well - I will drink anything with bubbles and alcohol so I made it work.  I ordered a sirloin steak for $18.99 and my wife ordered the chicken tacos. The meals came much faster than expected and the presentation of both were great. My steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and was very tasty. The fries came on a separate plate, which was a nice touch so they all stay crisp.  My wife's tacos were also very good.  The place looks a bit like a palace inside and is very inviting. It is definitely worth a visit. It is a little on the pricey side for a regular meal, but I'm sure we'll be back."
Roger F.,"Seattle, WA",1,3,,5.0,9/20/2014,"Hi fellow foodies, it's Roger here I'm back with an review of the Cheesecake Factory Restaurant In Southcenter Mall! Okay let me start off by saying I had a nephew who worked here in the early 2000's so I'm a little biased to give this review because I almost feel like it's my family's own restaurant but I'll try to give a fair Everydayman's prespective. Okay now that I got that out of the way about my nephew, who worked here in the early 2000's, here is my fair, Everydayman's prespective: The Cheesecake Factory Restaurant In Southceneter Mall is in my top 10 Restaurants List, and the review book I'm currently working on (think Zagets Rating or Michelens Stars) will have a much longer in depth ""long form read"" about the ins and out of this place. It's what us on the food blog circuit call a Top Crown. I honestly wonder if the people who haven't yet given this 5 starts have a rare taste bud syndrome that's causes them to have a bad taste in their mouth. I say ""who haven't yet given its 5 stars"" because I think, if they actually DO have this so called rare taste bud syndrome and then they someday lord willing get this syndrome fixed, they when then later get this place the 5 stars it deserves. Here is a short list of things, to be fair, that I think The Cheesecake Factory Restauarant in SouthCenter Mall could improve: 1. When I visited here there menu had a breakfast section and a breakfast item called ""Factory Heuvos Ranchers"". Huevos, in case you didn't know, I think it means Eggs in Mexico. Now look, I know that the large appetite of America for Eggs means that we must use factory chickens farms in order to supply America's large appetite for Eggs, but it's awfully off putting to see it listed on their menu that the Eggs are factory made. Although I can understand that they want their consumers to know exactly where they get their Eggs, so for that I give it a Pass! When my ex wife who has since passed God bless her, would come here, she would always order the same thing, every time, like a clockwork! I can't remember what it was, but in closing, I think I'd like to quote her, if you friends don't mind, about her favorite thing about here. It's from a diary entry she wrote before she passed, and I found it while sitting out her things. I think it pretty much says it all:  ""It seems like we come here all the time and every time Roger says we're coming here, I wonder if I'd made a mistake. I always end up getting the same thing, and it's usually pretty good but...""  And then she goes on a little bit more into detail but I think what really stands out about her review is that she loves the food and most importantly she found that it was ""Always really good"" her words not mine. That, my foody friends, is what we reviewers call a one heck of a endorsement! Try out The Cheesecake Factory In South Center Mall in Tukwila near Renton, Today! Roger that!"
Martha G.,"Tukwila, WA",10,6,6,4.0,7/11/2015,"Good! Love  strawberry Martinis  delicious  salmon, not expensive,  A bit too noisy."
Sally T.,"Kent, WA",6,30,13,5.0,10/21/2014,"I always recommend this place for their pastas! Amazing proportions (i always have left overs!) and amazing blend of spices for their sauces.  I remember i came in an hour before they closed for a late night dinner with my boyfriend and as a person who loves food, i can't help but want everything on their menu. I usually grab the Farfalle With Chicken And Roasted Garlic but this time, i wanted something crunchy/fried as well and the waiter was so helpful! He recommended that i get my usual pasta but this time, substitute the regular pan seared white chicken for the Louisana style chicken.  When my pasta came? It was the most delicious pasta i ever had. The sauce was so creamy and i still can't get over how cute the pasta are bow-tie shaped! If you ever get the chance, try this version of the Farfalle pasta! I also highly recommend their Crispy Crab Wontons as a great appetizer."
Kelle D.,"Seattle, WA",0,5,,5.0,10/9/2016,"Out of the handful of times I've been here, I haven't had any bad experiences.  No complaints, other than it is busy every time I've gone....but that is a good thing, right?  The last time I went was for Mother's day.  There was a long wait if you wanted to eat indoors.  It was cloudy out and had been sprinkling earlier in the morning.  We decided to sit outdoors since there was guaranteed seating right away and it wasn't raining at the time.  It was perfect.  The heat lamps helped too, but it wasn't freezing to begin with....if we would have decided to sit indoors, we would have been waiting for probably 45 minutes at least.  The service was great, food was good and of course the cheesecake is always delicious."
Navy M.,"Federal Way, WA",11,33,148,4.0,9/8/2014,"I definitely have a weird love for this franchise of a restaurant. Everything I've ever tried has been very good. No matter the craving, The Cheesecake Factory has an extensive menu to choose from and can fulfill all cravings. It's always a good vibe. My niece and nephew love it here as they have an addiction for the deep fried Mac and cheese balls...AMAZING, deep fried, gooey cheese goodness."
Shannon J.,"Scenic Hill, WA",70,8,,5.0,4/5/2016,"Would it be cliche to say I love the Cheesecake Factory? But oh how I do! Honestly, my only complaint is they don't care how much I hate myself the next day when I admit I consumed 10,000 calories in one meal! I had to set some ground rules if we were going to continue this unadulterated dining... So now I only allow myself to choose anything I want two times per year... All other visits require me to choose from the ""skinny"" menu which is still delish!"
Ray I.,"Seattle, WA",20,288,3,1.0,11/5/2014,"Good cheesecake. Kale quinoa salad was alright. I imagine that if I got a ""real"" entree, I wouldn't have liked it due to the higher prices. These price points are normal for a more swanky place, but for a typical casual chain restaurant? i don't think so. I got the peanut butter cheesecake togo...the non Reese's one. As I was chewing, I had to stop and pull out a big piece of the wax/parchment paper out of a my mouth! It was in the cheesecake somehow. Disgusting"
Katie H.,"Seattle, WA",330,147,29,4.0,7/29/2014,"I am all about expectation setting, and if you have the right expectations about The Cheesecake Factory, you will have a good experience.  If you don't know what you are getting into, you probably won't enjoy your time here. Happy Things- The Cheesecake, and any dessert for that matter, is always good- ALWAYS.  My fat cells jiggle for joy when I come here because they know they are about to get some new friends.  My favorite cheesecakes are the Pineapple Upside Down, the Tuxedo, and you can never go wrong with the classic.   The portion sizes are huge.  It is true that this place is pricey, but you do get a really big portion for what you order.  Also, you can never actually eat said portion size because you will fill up on bread (and by ""you"" I mean I will fill up on bread, delicious carbs, mmmm). The food is never bad; you always know what you are going to get, and truly, that's what chain restaurants are for.  If you want an experience that is unique and tasty, don't go to a chain restaurant.  The fried mac and cheese if phenomenal, and event though it is an appetizer, I routinely get it for my meal.  Bread, fried mac and cheese, and cheesecake- perhaps this is why my jeans keep shrinking and my dryer isn't the culprit... The menu is huge, and anyone can find something tasty here.  Just keep in mind, that as a chain restaurant recipes are meant to appeal to as many tastebuds as possible.  That means that the flavors are going to be safe, but find something you like in the comfort food/Southern fare area of things, and you will probably enjoy what you get.  If you order Thai food here and expect what you are used to in the Seattle area- that is all on you, chief.  Expectations, people- you don't get good Thai from an American chain restaurant. I have never had bad service here; the wait staff is busy, but they work it!  Sometimes I have had the thought that some restaurants that are 25% full, have stationary servers, and empty customer glasses could learn a few things from The Cheesecake Factory wait staff. Sad things-  You will WAIT to come here unless you come at a weird time.  And by waiting I mean stand forever.  The lines are are sooo long.  Either be prepared to wait, or come at like 11 AM.   Price- it's not super pricey, but for what you spend here in the Seattle area, you could get something much better.  Don't expect a $15 lunch, however. Drinks- never bad, never strong, very generic.  If you want a great cocktail that is over $10, go to a bar, not The Cheesecake Factory.  The drinks are flashy, but it the bartenders are never generous on the alcohol side of things.   I have been here more than once, and I will probably be back.  Have your expectations in line, and you won't have a terrible time."
Madison G.,"Seattle, WA",23,286,318,3.0,9/16/2014,"I used to hate the Cheesecake Factory for the longest time. Everything I ordered wasn't any good and never left me feeling satisfied. I finally discovered the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic and it became my absolute favorite pasta ever. Any time I come here, that's exactly what I order. I made the mistake of ordering the nachos the last time I came here because I wasn't hungry enough for the huge pasta. My mistake! I should have known. Nachos were gross and covered in more red sauce than they were cheese. Icky! Service isn't consistent. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's slow. It's never been bad, just not spectacular. Lines and wait times are extremely bad Friday - Sunday. Everyone wants to bring a family of 6 on those days, lol. Prepare to wait."
Chris B.,"Maple Valley, WA",0,10,,2.0,3/10/2016,Great food but horrible customer service I was placing a curb side Togo order and was hung up on this has happened more then once btw.
Tiffanie N.,"Renton, WA",52,12,1,5.0,3/30/2016,"We went on a Tuesday night it was very busy for a week day I thought. Once at our table our waitress arrived, she apologized for the wait which was not long. Sarah was our waitress she was very familiar with the menu and made great recommendations. She was wonderful with our 3 year old son ensuring that she was listening to him. The food was excellent and the service was remarkable from the moment we were seated."
Nancy R.,"Covington, WA",119,61,15,4.0,1/8/2015,"Great for a casual lunch, salads and pastas are my go to at the Cheesecake Factory. I've never had cheesecake from this location. Traveling through Hartford CT, friend and I stopped for some dessert  and ordered the Oreo Cheesecake, it was good, bit too rich after two bits. Great attentive service at both locations!  I refuse to order drinks at the Tukwila location, after few visits they always seem to make my drink far too strong. (I know right? Complaining about too much alki lol)"
Ray H.,"Federal Way, WA",0,10,1,5.0,6/8/2015,I had a great time at the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered a steak with fried asparagus and mashed potatoes Plus macaroni. the steak was medium rare the potatoes were still hot asparagus wasn't too deep fried. the steak was so juicy not runny but juicy . As me and my buddy arrived the customer service was so polite helpful courteous and fast. before I can finish my beverage the waiter filled it back up for me. As this being my first time experience it was not bad at all. the only thing that was kind of annoying was the space between seats. The scenery of this place is awesome and I will recommend this place for business or pleasure thanks for reading my review.
Dave C.,"Federal Way, WA",0,4,,5.0,9/23/2016,Excellent food great drinks and atmosphere very nice atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and professional. Love this place.
