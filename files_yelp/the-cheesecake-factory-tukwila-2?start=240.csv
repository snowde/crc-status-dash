Stacy F.,"Lake Stevens, WA",0,67,6,3.0,8/29/2016,"Haven't eaten here in a while and they no longer have my beloved Thai Pasta  I am staying nearby so I did the curbside carry out. I asked for utensils, bread etc but got none. Pasta I did get was garlic with shrimp. Very tasty. Side salad was mostly just lettuce and bitter but ranch was lickable. Overall ok but not happy with missing items."
Wennie H.,"Junction, Seattle, WA",282,325,186,3.0,8/17/2013,"You know, they have surprisingly delicious French toast. I ordered it kind of not expecting much, but it was really really good!"
Chantelle I.,"Seattle, WA",156,18,12,4.0,6/29/2014,Cheesecake factory is pretty enjoyable- today we had brunch. He ordered the Monte Cristo which is basically like a French toast version of a mcgriddle but waaaaaaaaay better. l ordered the crab hash which was my first time trying it and it was sure delicious! Food was great only dissapoinment was one of the orders was wrong so by the time I was done with my food his food had just come out. Also the side of English muffin promised with my entre did not come out with it and the side of sauce I asked for also didn't come out with the entre and by the time it did come out I was already finished with my food  but other then that customer service was great and food was delicious!
William G.,"Redmond, WA",31,25,4,4.0,3/4/2015,The food drinks and our server were prefect !! The only thing. The people who got sat 10 mintues after we did got there food before we did and had to wait another 10 mintues
Whitnai S.,"Vancouver, WA",3,21,7,3.0,6/7/2016,"Pretty discouraged that they wouldn't take a reservation for 50 from our company, or even try to accommodate us. As much as I love the food, service is everything!"
Amanda K.,"Seattle, WA",14,131,11,2.0,11/18/2015,"I've usually always had good experiences here, although this last time left a pretty sour taste in my mouth. We had a party of 6 people and it was my birthday (made very apparent by the birthday gift bag on the table.) Our waitress took our drink orders and then never came back. My mother in law flagged down a manager and he ended up taking our drink order and bringing it to us. The waitress finally returned and took our meal order, which went smooth I guess. She seemed a little bewildered when one of our family members asked for his steak rare or medium rare and her response was ""you need to pick one as I have to push a button on the computer"" ...what? Haha. When our food came, our waitress was reminded that we had a birthday at our table. She ignored the request, and also ignored my request to get a glass of water. The manager finally noticed the birthday and when our cheesecake came they brought it out on a plate that said happy birthday with a candle which I thought was a nice touch. It was irritating that our waitress was so aloof, but what made me drop my review to only 2 stars was because when my boyfriend went to eat his leftovers the next day (pasta dish with chicken), his chicken was bloody in one chunk of it. I don't mean pink, like blood was coming out of it and running down the meat. After that, I'm not sure if I ever want to eat here again unless I'm just grabbing a piece of cheesecake to go. Luckily he never got sick!"
Aaron S.,"Seattle, WA",114,54,1,5.0,10/4/2014,"Love this place! A lot of people are hard on franchises like the Cheesecake Factory & Olive Garden, but they never realize how much of a challenge it is to serve such a large volume of people every night, and the Cheesecake Factory does it well.  In addition, the only place i think that deserves to have such a big menu. Every time i try something new.  Have had the occasional slow service, but never a bad experience."
Hali K.,"Covington, WA",2,15,,5.0,2/14/2016,This Cheesecake is one of our favorites. The wait is never really that bad in comparison to other locations we've been too. Our server yesterday was beyond awesome and the food is always great. We always leave feeling full and happy!
Kristin L.,"Folsom, CA",93,142,29,5.0,12/26/2015,"Best service I've had in a long time! You can really tell they focus on team work which is awesome. The waitress kept apologizing because our food was taking a while, the manager even came to apologize. But my husband and I didn't think our food took long at all. They even took off our slice of cheesecake which was really nice. Food is always good here. Try the buffalo blasts for an appetizer or even an entree."
Jenny A.,"Seattle, WA",36,61,,3.0,11/25/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is famous for... it's cheesecake. Food has always been mediocre and with the 20 pages of food, I'm sure you will find something that will fit your needs. Hands down though, best cheesecake go-to place for take out and the best pumpkin pie cheesecake that I look forward to around this time"
Amy W.,"Seattle, WA",118,341,66,3.0,1/3/2013,"I had a late lunch there today with a party of seven. The food came quickly. Overall, the food didn't stand out.  I had some chicken Parmesan sandwich, the bread was a bit on the hard side, there was more tomato than chicken, and the fries were coated with sodium. I  only had one bite of fries, too salty. My husband had the chicken balliagio (chicken with pesto covered noodles). My husband liked it enough but the first thing I noticed wad how oily it was. I wasn't fond of having to wipe my lips after every singly bite. The factor of the meal I enjoyed the most wad actually my server. He was very attentive to our table, answered our questions about the menu, and interacted with my party easily. I really liked how he asked us if we wanted to split our check or combine. He even gave us time to decide and asked how to split the shared appetizer, ""everyone ate some, right?"" One thing I can't stand is paying more to cover for someone else's bill. Call me picky, but I always get shafted in this area (example :paying $15 for a $5 salad when I didn't have any wine ordered for the whole table) Anyway, food was ok, service was better."
Tony H.,"Seattle, WA",1,28,24,4.0,1/24/2016,Food is really expensive but the portion are huge! I would recommend the cheesecakes they are the best!
Camille Y.,"Seattle, WA",58,316,107,4.0,8/10/2014,"This chain of restaurants is our most favorite! The food is always good (don't recall out of our 30+ visits in 5 years if we ever had a bad meal) and the prices are more than reasonable. It's also one of the few restaurants on this level of expense that still gives you a basket of bread! Sweet bread along w/ sourdough--enough to fill you w/o too much of an entree! Last night when we visited The Cheesecake Factory at Southcenter, it was extremely busy. The poor waitress did not get to us until 8 minutes after we sat down. That's a bit too long and it was hot yesterday, so we were needing water fast. After the waitress apologized, she was pretty efficient in getting our orders and our food."
Vipin S.,"Seattle, WA",28,24,2,5.0,1/23/2016,"We have always loved the food, eaten there about 10 times.  The wait can be long some times, like tonight, but that is expected for Saturday night and big parties.  But our waiter, who had a slight accent was amazing.  We had the best time ever and the food was great.  The whole staff was responsive and they did everything better then expected.  Thank You for making my daughters birthday special!"
Cathy L.,"Bonney Lake, WA",0,11,,1.0,8/31/2016,not pleased. went for lunch with daughter. my drink glass came with food on inside. waitress brought me a new drink that one came with a bug floating in my drink. Daughter ordered green tea it was a mint. when she asked for something else they charged her for two  drinks. The ceaser salad only had dressing on one side of plate and no croutons. the dessert area had such a loud employee that you could hear her across the other side of restaurant. I love other cheesecake factory restaurants but will never go back to this one.
Mathew A.,"Maple Valley, WA",0,24,2,1.0,10/8/2015,"I love the food at CF but I am very UNimpressed with the service tonight. I will be spending well over $100 for dinner for 6 tonight. My wife and I ordered the Orange Chicken to split. I like brown rice, my wife likes white. I asked if we could get both brown and white rice.  The server immediately said no. If I weren't talking about $0.05 worth of rice I would understand, but the past 3 times we ordered this to split, we received both brown and white rice, no problem. I don't care for bad food but I had poor service. I'll come back, but I will avoid the server we were assigned today at ALL cost!!!!!  My belief is that servers earn their tip, and it's not automatic. She earned her tip tonight, $0!!"
Jasmine W.,"San Francisco, CA",2,12,17,5.0,1/20/2016,"On vacation and did not feel like waiting all the at until we drove into the city when there's a Cheesecake Factory 5 minutes away from our hotel! Surprisingly no wait which is crazy for the Cheesecake Factory but it was lunch on a weekday. Our server was awesome I felt like we were surrounded by tables giving her a hard time, but maybe because I work in the food industry I respect servers but whatever JAMIE working the bar area and our small section you were awesome as hell! Very attentive and our food was amazing! I always get my her crusted salmon which did not disappoint but the bragging goes to my boyfriends catfish dinner may be my new favorite go to on the menu!"
Danielle A.,"Federal Way, WA",2,7,,5.0,10/6/2015,"I probably go to this restaurant more often than any other. The food is really delicious, never had any problems with my meals. The only thing to is the portions are HUGE so I would consider splitting the meals. The waiters/ waitresses are really nice and check up on you often. The inside of the restaurant is very nice and has a good atmosphere. Overall, I'd say that this is a great restaurant."
Cyd L.,"Seattle, WA",7,18,7,5.0,9/27/2014,"My Mother and I dine at the Cheesecake Factory at the Southcenter Mall at least once a week.  The food is delicious, and the choices are endless.  However, the reason we keep returning is the wonderful service we receive.  Our favorite server has to be DEE SHIPMAN.  She is truly amazing and takes great care of us.  She has an awesome  personality and is always very friendly.  I just wanted to give a shout out To Dee and Thank her for the Great Service!!!!"
Israel M.,"Auburn, WA",125,252,141,3.0,7/18/2013,"It's cheesecake factory...they're all pretty much the same.  Loud, super busy, overpriced.  The menu is huge so you can spend some time just trying to decide on something.  Service at this location is hit and miss.  I've had some awesome servers and I've had terrible ones.  But the food is always pretty good, cheesecake is awesome.  definitely try to avoid coming during the peak hours or weekends.  You'll usually wait at least 10-15 minutes for a party of 2.  If you've got more than 4 people, you'll wait a while sometimes."
