Ali K.,"Auburn, WA",4,32,,4.0,1/18/2015,They have great food and a huge menu so there is something for everyone.  I am a big fan of the happy hour. They have a good selection and good sizes (of food and drinks). The only bad thing is it can get pretty competitive to get a seat for happy hour especially on a Friday. Also happy hour is only M-F.
Roman G.,"Irvine, CA",4,174,29,2.0,11/25/2015,I ate here right after lunch had ended and there was a little time before shift change. I usually eat at the bar when I'm alone and I had ordered the Renee special which is always very good. The great thing about the Cheesecake Factory is if you've been here before you can almost always be guaranteed a consistent meal no matter which location you eat at even with a thick menu book of items to choose from. The issues with Cheesecake Factory are almost always service issues and this was no different. The bartender had one guest to take care of and that was me. He basically ignored me the whole time talking to other servers and checking his Instagram and Facebook pages. Food 4 stars and service 1 star.
Kalani F.,"Seattle, WA",145,376,,3.0,6/20/2013,"Oh the food! Soooo good! I love the bread here. LOVE it.  I am a Cheesecake Factory addict.  I love Evelyn's pasta, it's my standby.  They have tasty coffee drinks too. The bad side of course, is that the drinks are a tad spendy and probably aren't really worth it. I love the atmosphere of the Cheesecake factories everywhere. The bad about this place: I've been here twice to the bar, and wow, there are some plain mean bartenders here. Just not into customer service. They are rude and very annoyed about pretty much everything you ask them during happy hour. Don't expect to go here and have a happy chat with a bartender during happy hour. It isn't going to happen. Major attitude.  Last time I was in here, I ordered spring rolls, somehow something different was ordered, and the bartender actually argued with me that was what I ordered. It was weird. While that rarely, if ever has happened before, as a former waitress, I know that you smile, nod and shut your mouth and send it back to the kitchen. Do not argue with your customer. It frankly made me really mad.  Now why does this get 3 stars? Good waitresses outside of the bar. Really good service. Just don't go to the bar. I've tried, it's a lost cause."
Emily F.,"Puyallup, WA",0,9,,2.0,2/15/2016,Don't go here unless you expect to wait 45 minutes for your food. Also the bar only has about 4 tables for open seating. I saw an empty table in the bar and went to it and sat down. I was rudely told to move from a server and was explained to that they don't really have open seating. The service is mediocre and also their ladies bathroom is very small and only has 3 stalls. This is ridiculous based on their large restaurant size. Also waiting for a table is ridiculous because you would think they would have a designated waiting area instead of everyone cramming together near the entrance and you basically get trampled by everyone else waiting. The bread they serve before you get your food is extremely hard like it has sat out overnight. Probably won't go back and if I do it will not be for the overpriced menu. I will be buying my cheesecake to go.
Sheena H.,"Seattle, WA",22,14,46,3.0,6/29/2015,"Ashlynn who is 7. She had the kids bow tie pasta with butter and parm. She said it was good. I had the skinnylicious salmon rolls. Which was a deep fried wrapper filled with salmon and spinach. When it came out it was way too greasy and soggy. Good idea, bad execution! Also had the skinnylicious fresh veggie salad was good. just alittle heavy on the pomegranate vinaigrette!  I also subbed romaine for spinach yummy!"
Brendan M.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",339,58,16,3.0,2/25/2016,"Server was great, extremely nice, easy to talk to and good with the kids.. Gave it a 3 because the quality of food and the price. It was $90 for my wife and I and the food was below average. Music was also a bit on the loud side. Probably won't be returning. Nice building though."
Mia M.,"Redmond, WA",0,4,,5.0,8/17/2014,"We came here for the Cheesecake but also to celebrate a co-worker's retirement. This was honestly the best experience we have ever had on a group outing.  First of all the menu is endless. I love the calamari but also the avacado eggrolls are divine! I ended up splitting the Louisiana Pasta with my friend because I wanted to save room for the tuxedo cheesecake. Yummy! The wait was actually not that bad for our group of 11. We sat in the bar and were served by Judith and Katrina. They had a sense of humor and were on top of everything. I also noticed a reviewer said they don't have a kid's menu here. Are you kidding me? My kids always get the mac and cheese and it doesn't have a ""boxed"" taste to it. Will be back for sure. I didn't get to have the eggrolls this time. Darn."
Michelle F.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,93,9,4.0,10/5/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory was good, but good grief was it packed to the rims! We had a 30 minuet wait, that took even longer than that. Food is so worth it though. There's not much to say...it's a pretty established restaurant chain. The cheesecakes are amazing (mine was not as good at other kinds, I had the apple one this time and it just tasted kind of odd). The Louisiana pasta and the chicken and biscuits are both amazing. The portions are of course huge, so come hungry or take home a doggy bag. The service was okay, but nothing crazy amazing. Just go and prepare to wait, a while, but enjoy the experience."
Marci G.,"Renton, WA",0,5,,1.0,8/13/2016,"I wish the customer service could improve..for how often the prices increase on the menu you'd think the long wait for EVERYTHING (on the phone, in person, sitting at the table, etc.) would improve just a little too. But it hasn't. Clearly they are not putting the money into better management, staffing, and operations. Food is good but a little steep for such poor customer service and small portions"
Todd O.,"Beaverton, OR",1,31,11,3.0,12/31/2015,"It's good. The kids like it. Come early otherwise you'll have to wait. Easy to drop $100 for a family of four plus dessert. They have every thing on the menu, Mexican, American, Asian, Italian...  Maybe not everything but they do have a variety. It's a typical chain restaurant I think."
Melissa H.,"Seattle, WA",0,26,,3.0,1/17/2017,"Having been to any number of this chain restaurant locations, I was happy as usual with the salad and Chicken Farfalle with Garlic Sauce. In fact, the pasta dish was really good. I usually don't bother getting a slice of cheesecake because I don't need the calories but tonight I decided to get a slice of the salted caramel to take home and it was AWFUL! And I mean downright inedible. The ""crust"" was some sort of soggy cookie/brownie thing, I think, but it lacked much any meaningful taste and again, it was soggy. The ""cheesecake"" part of it was apparently supposed to include some nuts but there were barely any and those that were included were chopped so small that I could barely taste or even feel them in my mouth. And it sure as heck wasn't ""cheesecake"". Texture was light and airy, but no recognizable flavor at all. I didn't even taste cream cheese or a dairy flavor. It was weird. The caramel on top was decent, but I ate two bites of it altogether to see if I was wrong when I wanted to spit it out the first time , but I wasn't. I immediately threw the rest out. A complete waste of $11.00 or whatever it cost. When you have ""cheesecake"" in your restaurant name, even if it's a chain, how about trying to make a decent cheesecake?!?"
Malique N.,"Kent, WA",25,27,,4.0,1/18/2016,"If you been to the Cheesecake Factory then you know especially this one n tukwila is always filled with people,  since it's right next to the mall. So expect to wait a little bit, you could always make reservations. Every time I come here I usually get and burger or pizza and it's great every time, the service pretty good for the amount of people that the factory attracts. You can never go wrong with eating at the factory there a reason why there are so many right?"
john b.,"King, WA",9,47,6,1.0,10/24/2015,"Horrible customer service and horrible place to place orders, even days ahead and still got it wrong. We ordered a 7in and they told us they forgot to thaw it and gave us a half of 10in and charged is for a 7in. NEVER giving this place anymore business. How the hell can you charge a customer for a full order knowingly your establishment screwed up and not receiving a full order and it was ordered DAYS in advance. This is a bunch of BS! How is any of this sound right to any human being, no matter who you are? I was forced to give some sort of a star, so I'm forced to give one. I want to give them ZERO stars! So wrong in everyway possible. Not happy and don't even want to continue with this obsurd situation..."
Kathy H.,"Yakima, WA",0,1,,1.0,1/28/2016,"We are a family of 4 and it was a Thursday evening around 7pm. It was my daughter's 19th birthday and she wanted to go somewhere new. The wait was supposed to be 20 min but ended up being 35. That was the first red flag.  The second was we were seated under the vent with a cold draft at the end of January. Then we could barely hear each other due to the loud music and how busy it was.  Our waiter took our order and we barely saw him again. My husband got coffee and I had to get his attention just to get it refilled and to get bread for my son. I asked about singing for my daughter's bday and got oh yeah ok. When our food came 3 of us got ours and my husband had to wait 3 min to get his. My fries were cold and so were the sautéed mushrooms  on my burger. My husband's $26 rib eye was so salty he had to rub it off with water. Again our waiter wasn't even the one to bring our food so we had to ask the people who did for steak knives and tarter sauce. The tarter sauce was so bad I had to stop eating my meal. My daughter's steak was cold she also had the $26 rib eye. My daughter finally got her bday song as we got our check. We hardly saw our waiter ,David, but we saw him talking a lot and hardly working.  I will never return to this establishment. This experience ruined my daughter's evening she wanted to spend with her family having a nice meal. She spent it with her family and all we could do is talk about how bad the food was and if we could find the waiter and get out of there. If you had a good experience you are lucky."
Sydney H.,"Sumner, WA",0,4,,5.0,1/27/2017,"My family and I have gone here for years, but we came last night and had by far the most AMAZING experience. I hadn't ate all day so we ordered the Guacamole and cheesy bread. That guacamole was so fresh and amazing that I literally had to order extra chips because I wanted to scrap the bowl clean . I decided to switch it up with dinner and got chicken fettuccini alfredo. It was so DELICIOUS.  My mom and brother even both took a little plate of my Alfredo along with their dinners. Aside from how amazing the food was, our server was INCREDIBLE too. We don't all get to see each other as often as we like so to be able to enjoy a meal without constantly being interrupted was wonderful. Our server immediately got us started with some beverages and appetizers than let us browse the menu. We literally took probably 30 minutes to find our dinner and he had no problem waiting  and didn't seem the least bit annoyed. None of us could finish our dinners so HE BOXED up our food for us and put them each in our own separate to go bags! How nice is that?! Overall, we had an amazing experience and it made me realize I do not come to this restaurant enough!!"
Mary M.,"Seattle, WA",106,96,121,5.0,9/19/2015,"We had  an early dinner arrival so very short wait. Our server Carlo was amazing in timing, attentiveness, and just right personably. Food and beverages arrived in good time and all in our party of 6 enjoyed their food. I had an ahi avocado app that was delicious. A pleasant surprise. :)"
Gerald S.,"Federal Way, WA",1,11,3,1.0,11/18/2015,"So as soon I walked in I was not greeted appropriately by the 3 employees who where standing around chit chatting. Although they were not very professional and blew us off when we came in I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and stay. the food was sub par, definitely on the bottom of the list when comes to cheese cake factories. Only upside was parking was not a problem."
Johnny P.,"Tacoma, WA",55,6,1,2.0,6/7/2015,Good food... The only thing is we waited for over 45mins when they told us 10-15 mins. We watched about 10 groups be seated that came in after us. Seen something I never seen before one guy come in and waited for a lil then noticed an empty table and went and sat down. Needless to say I was a lil upset... He just took a table for 6 and only 1 person. No one said anything to him...
Kelly P.,"Bellevue, WA",0,1,,1.0,11/28/2015,"horrible service. they lied to me and lost our spot for a surprise party. I called ahead and waited 2 hours, had 12 guests waiting from out of state. so embarrassing, never coming back. 1/2 of a star."
Kaycee G.,"Seattle, WA",5,115,8,2.0,3/16/2015,"Went here today for happy hour with 2 friends. We ordered drinks, several appetizers, entrees, and a slice of cheesecake each. Our food was pretty good but surprisingly the cheesecake wasn't amazing. It was the reeses one.. I think maybe it's too complicated and i should stick to simple, classic cheesecake. The thing that was really off putting was our server. I will remember his name so that I can make sure we don't get him again. We were there for over an hour and he literally never smiled once. Every time we said thank you (which was often), he never once said ""you're welcome"". He seemed annoyed at every turn and when we requested to sit at a booth after just being seated at one of the high bar tables, he looked at me like I had just asked him to fetch me a pot of gold. If you hate your job so much dude, work elsewhere. It really put a damper on out attempt to have a fun night out."
