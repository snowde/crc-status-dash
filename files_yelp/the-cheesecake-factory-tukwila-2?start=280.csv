Eric R.,"Renton, WA",0,5,,2.0,11/27/2015,The food is what you expect from a chain restaurant; predictable menu with large portions. I used to really like this place but the quality of service has gone steadily down for years. Go in expecting a TGI Fridays experience and you won't be disappointed.
Delfina G.,"Kent, WA",66,96,216,3.0,3/31/2014,"I hate how it's always busy there. Very crowded and not enough sitting space while waiting to be seated. I have had a few things from their menu which I am not so crazy about, but their warm asparagus salad was pretty good."
Rona L.,"Federal Way, WA",227,663,2435,3.0,4/18/2010,"I've never been disappointed here.   Always great service (even though it can be a little slow on the weekends), good food, big portions, and delicious cheesecake.  And I love the complimentary bread that they serve - although I wish they wouldn't give us pre-packaged butter (whipped butter would be nice :-D).   Last time I went, I got the Chicken Bellagio (breaded chicken with prosciutto on top of basil pasta).  It was delcious!  And it came with three large pieces of chicken (plenty enough for lunch the next day, and then some).  I was incredibly full but ordered the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake to go (one of my favorites!)   I guess depending on what you order, the food can be a little on the pricey side.  But I love to go once in a while and ""splurge"" anyway.  P.S.  They've started happy hour at the bar Monday through Friday from 4-6pm.  I want to check it out."
Sue K.,"Long Beach, CA",5,736,748,1.0,11/14/2014,"Two years later we returned to say farewell to the very same boss who used to pick this place as our annual Xmas dinner destination and it's still the same CF of Olde.  However, they must be reading customer feedback because they now offer a separate ""Skinnylicious"" menu constructed to keep your calorie intake under certain levels.  I ordered the skinny chicken pasta which is under 500 calories, yielded no leftovers and set me back over $15 with tip and without a beverage.  The meal itself was alright but the price left a sour taste.  Still a lone star act."
Rachel S.,"SeaTac, WA",85,3,,3.0,12/23/2015,Cheesecake Factory nothing really spectacular nothing really bad. Just your average restaurant. Cheesecake Factory seems a little expensive tho compared to Olive Garden which was right across the street.
Seth S.,"Renton, WA",0,1,,3.0,12/23/2015,Appetizers are good. All the pasta and chicken dishes tend to taste the same. It's a festive atmosphere with a great menu selection. Expect it to be busy and parking to be tough around Holiday weekends.
Kim P.,"Danville, CA",365,177,43,5.0,6/24/2014,"My friend and I decided to get lunch here and we sat out on the patio. It was so beautiful and nice out. I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a long time and forgot how extensive their menu is! It was so hard to choose what to eat because everything sounded good. I ordered the hot spinach cheese dip and the pear & blue cheese flatbread. Both were amazing! The flatbread was on the skinny menu and is a small portion, but good enough size to eat. The dip was huge and definitely needs to be shared between two or more people. Our waitresses were super friendly, attentive, and filled up our drinks constantly. It was a very pleasant experience of tasty food and great customer service. I'll definitely be back to try all the other meal options I wanted but didn't get to order."
Kevin J.,"Seattle, WA",6,13,4,5.0,9/27/2014,"One of the biggest menus I've seen at a restaurant, the options feel unlimited. I can't say I have a favorite meal because I've had quite a few great meals from here. I'm always greeted in a professional manner and I always have a good visit. Excellent food."
Katherine P.,"Portland, OR",78,14,185,2.0,10/21/2014,"Great food, good drinks, nice waitress, horrible hostess and long wait. At first I called and asked the wait time. The hostess said it was 45 min, subject to change, and as I tried to ask the next question hung up on me. I called back, asked about making a reservation for the next day, and she said she couldn't take reservations after five, and didn't even let me ask times to take them. We go to the place to wait, because I know they have amazing food and I really wanted it. There are only enough benches for four people and then a ton of standing space. We sign our names on the list and that 45 min wait became an hour wait. We finally get a seat and it is next to the kitchen area and we can hear everything the wait staff is doing. At least five times dishes shattered just behind the thin wall that was our booth.  on the good side - the food. The cheesecake was amazing - but they seriously could use less whipped topping it was just as much as the size of the freaking cheesecake. The stuffed tatter tots were yummy. I had a peach Bellini and it was to die for. I would totally go back to The Cheesecake Factory, just not this location. I think I'll stick to the one in downtown Seattle, because this air port area location sucked at hosting."
MeiSean T.,"Seattle, WA",98,30,53,5.0,2/23/2012,"I really do enjoy eating here. I love the bread that they start yu off with & the food that I order is usually very good.  5 star rating because of the good food & I always get good servers.  Dishes that I love: Steak Diane, best steak i have ever had from a restaurant. The sauce, mushrooms, & mashed potatoes were soooo good with that steak. Louisiana Chicken Pasta, this is one of their popular dishes. The parmesan crusted chicken over the bow tie pasta is js delish!  Smokehouse burger, I absolutely love this burger. Definitely a favorite. Cooked to order. It has yummy crunchy fried onions & comes w/ a side of yummy BBQ sauce."
Renata L.,"Bothell, WA",25,8,,5.0,10/12/2015,"My sister and I came in for lunch today and was seated right away. Even tho it was a little into the lunch hour. That was nice. I've been meaning to try the macaroni and cheese burger and let me tell you, I wasn't disappointed. The food was flavorful without being too salty (considering it had a cheese sauce on it). Out server, Kristina, was amazing and very attentive. If you decide to go there, you should ask to be in her section. I'm a huge sucker for customer service and she went above and beyond to make out experience wonderful."
Amiram H.,"Redmond, WA",46,26,1,5.0,7/27/2015,"I almost never write a review on chain or franchise restaurants.  Clearly, one branch reflects nothing on the other, and the service level variance can be significant.  Indeed, the same menu is used, but it's quite possible that raw materials come from different places, the chefs have different methods, even the water taste different when you move a few blocks in any direction.  And yet, when something is exceptionally good, chain or not, I felt the urge to share.  The first time I visited Cheesecake Factory was in 1987 in Marina Del Rey.  Apparently it was the second Cheesecake Factory, and the first and only time I couldn't finish a meal...  Yesterday we went with friends to the Cheesecake Factory in Tukwila Washington, and this branch is the subject of my review. The choreography, the furniture, the menus, the uniform, and many other things are most likely the same all over.  Wait time too.  Truthfully, I hate waiting for beepers to go off when I'm hungry.  I hate it even more when I have a hungry child nearby.  But the wait wasn't so bad - not even thirty minutes, and my child was swinging between hungry and nauseous, so we were kind of OK.  The ""server"" (I personally prefer waiter/waitress, and given my Information Technology background, ""server"" is hardware) was particularly courteous.  She quickly brought water and took our orders.  The orders arrived within a reasonable window, and were as ordered, nothing to be taken for granted lately.  Everyone at the table commented on the flavor and presentation of the food.  For me it was the pasta.  The pasta I had yesterday was closest to the pasta my grandmother used to make in her own kitchen from scratch.  I know, sounds incredible, not even possible.  How in the world can a chain restaurant afford to make their own pasta?  I have no idea.  But I can tell the difference between dried overcooked pasta and fresh thick, meaty and flavorful pasta.  I would have expected it at a small mom and pop Italian restaurant, but not at Cheesecake Factory.  I guess positive surprises are still possible. My grandmother passed away almost twenty years ago, and yet I can feel and taste the pasta she used to make in her own kitchen.  Yesterday's pasta at Cheesecake Factory was the closest ever.  Last but not least, our server was really nice and efficient, but I like Penny better."
Nancy C.,"Redmond, WA",1,9,5,1.0,8/23/2015,"Quality of food went down significantly. Came here for brunch and ordered the Baja Chicken Hash and it came out COLD. They then offered to ""remake it"", which in their terms meant shoving it into an oven for 5 mins....... Food came out burnt and way overcooked. I've been eating at this establishment for years and have never experienced such horrible service and food. Will not be returning back."
Gentle V.,"Seattle, WA",60,190,521,1.0,9/1/2012,"I've normally had okay service at this Cheesecake Factory before - However, this last experience was a different manner.  I'm actually a very patient person, but this will be the last time I go to the Cheesecake Factory in Tukwila/Southcenter.   I had a larger group for someone's birthday. It was a Saturday night, so I called ahead in the morning and they told me wait times would be approximately up to 2 hour to get a table (they didn't do reservations).  I was actually okay with that since there was no alternative and they didn't do reservations on the day of.    However, when I arrived (at 5 pm), they told me it would take 3 hours instead. It wasn't ideal, but I worked with it.  Ultimately, my group didn't get seated until 9:20 pm (which was 4 hrs & 20 minutes of waiting).      Anyways, I went ahead and put my name down since I arrived early and decided to waste the rest of my time at the Mall close by.  When I came back a couple of hours later, we didn't get seated until 9:20 pm (when I was expecting more like 8 pm.   When I asked the hostess about how long, she had a very condescending tone every time I talked with her.  There were other seemingly nice hostess, but the one that I spoke to twice was not very pleasant.  She also told me twice that a table would be ready soon (within 5-10 minutes or so because they were clearing out the table) but she forgot about us twice.  After 20 minutes of waiting, I had to go up and ask another male host if the table was ready.  He was much nicer, but told me that a table wasn't ready yet and the outdoor table was still ordering dessert, which was a much different story than what she told me before.  The hostess said they were clearing out the tables, not that the previous table was just ordering dessert.   When we finally sat down, the other waitress was nice, but I was in a bad mood already and it didn't make up for the experience.  The food was okay, but it wasn't amazing."
Yvette B.,"Renton, WA",22,128,38,3.0,6/28/2014,"Hit or miss... Service isn't like it used to be here.  Three of us went for lunch... Took 2 hours from being seated to getting the bill. Our server would leave for long periods of time, when we needed him, to order food, and get our bill.  We wont be back for a year, that should be enough time for us to forget.  Food: Skinnylicious menu: steak medallions, was good, except the potatoes on the mashed potatoes weren't mashed. Club sandwich: my sister hated it, she said she could of made a better one @ home. Had tons of mayo.  Reg menu: Shrimp and herb crusted salmon: moms liked it."
Lisa M.,"Olympia, WA",0,9,27,5.0,1/5/2014,"The service here is always amazing. The food is good. The only problem is choosing what to eat from what seems to be a chapter book of a menu. The bread is always warm when served and you can eat as much as you want. The Chicken Bellagio never fails and the portion is really...REALLY big. Any cheesecake off the menu is good because well, it is called The Cheesecake Factory after all."
Kathryn V.,"Kent, WA",24,20,2,3.0,4/8/2015,"We visit the cheesecake factory often, some of our regular orders are the Chicken Madeira (which is awesome), Asian Lettuce Wraps (awesome, which you can also order a smaller portion), and the kids usually get spaghetti or some kind of pasta off the kids menu.  Its surprising the that kids menu doesnt have as good of a quality food as the adults and also child desserts.  The last couple of times the lettuce wrap chicken has been slightly undercooked and makes it look pinkish and chewy, so I have to now order my chicken ""well down"" to make sure that its cooked through.  The sauce on the lettuce wraps are what keeps me coming back which they offer for sale in the front.  The service is usually good, however it gets so busy that you wait sometimes over an hour for a table during the weekends."
Sammie H.,"Portland, OR",0,31,4,2.0,10/12/2016,"Been here loads of time, truly a disappointment on this visit. Sat within 10 min, which was great as you always expect to wait but from there on was the waiting. Our wait staff took forever to get to our table and it wasn't that busy around us so we had to wonder what was going on. Brought our drinks, then disappeared again as she forgot one. Took our orders and didn't see her again for another 20 min, where we finally got our bread. Had to ask for a refill at this time and again she disappears. Our food came out half hour later, all given to the wrong people but we sorted that out. One salad we never saw till the meal was over and she then asked if he still wanted it. Really? Had to ask for refills again...Everyone seems happy about the meal they received but my favorite was disappointing. Spicy cashew chicken was too sticky sweet, goopy with sauce and the quality of the rice has changed, being the cheap dried out version you get in Chinese restaurants. We asked if we could have a slice of cheesecake as a courtesy to our guest who never got their salad. Yes, no problem but again she disappears, so we paid our bill and had to walk up to the cheesecake counter and ask for it. Horrible, horrible service! Sadly, we came up from Portland and had so many choices on where to eat in this area. Will take a pass on it on the next visit. Oh, the salad was delivered to the table as we leave...."
Jaytee L.,"Renton, WA",1,5,2,3.0,8/10/2015,"Yesterday night, I went here to eat with my cousin. And the waiting time was pretty reasonable so i don't have much to say about that but i was upset that the waiter didn't give us our breads...so i was just like okaaaaaay, did he forget or what? Also, i orded fish tacos, but it was okay...why i say that is because as soon as i picked up the taco, everything fell apart. Meaning the tortilla was way to soft and everything was just a mess. so i ended up using a fork to eat the rest of the tacos. Maybe next time will be better."
Rob F.,"Kent, WA",37,103,,4.0,6/18/2015,Very typical Cheesecake factory.  We were promptly seated and served reasonably quick.  The Cheesecake selection is what they're noted for.  This location seems to always be very busy all day so a little patience might be in order.
