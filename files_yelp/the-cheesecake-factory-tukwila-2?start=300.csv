Mach M.,"Gig Harbor, WA",3,64,12,1.0,6/18/2015,"Slow service, wrong food served, served food was undersized, management was unhelpful & the food is overpriced... It earned the ""Anus of restaurants"" title.   What an ordeal! After we were seated, it took approximately 10 minutes to be acknowledged. Alternative staff other than your assigned waiter literally ignored any eye contact.  Food was served a bit on the long side,  25+ minutes... But the worst part was they served a wrong dish to our table and also another dish served was WAY undersized.  The skinny turkey burger is smaller than a McD's hamburger and the meat patty was literally smaller than a human tongue.  It was freakishly tiny!   When we addressed the waiter with this bizarre sandwich, he shrugged her shoulders and said ""I can't do anything do you want to talk to a manager?"" So then this sweaty manager walks over and can't seem to grasp customer service and correcting the matter. He just offered an alternative meal?..  It was like being in the twilight zone of restaurants with no customer service whatsoever.  However the cheesecake is always good there and the customer service at the Cheesecake counter was excellent!    I paid my bill and still left a tip.  But I cannot recommend eating here and you might as well spend your money somewhere else."
Cindy N.,"Auburn, WA",382,6,2,4.0,7/3/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory never lets me down on their quality of food! They have both quality and quantity. I usually never finish my entree. The restaurant is definitely popular for its cheesecake (as said in the name). They have a wide variety. All of which is delicious! I recommend buying a slice to try it. However, this place is usually busy - even on the weekdays, it tends to be pack. I went late night on Wednesday but I still had to wait for a while. The pricing of the food is more on the expensive size. Even for its quality of the food, its still a bit pricey. Overall, I would come back again. I recommend future customers to go on the weekdays to avoid the long wait on the weekends."
Alaina W.,"Kent, WA",346,506,89,3.0,12/29/2013,"I don't know why I keep coming back.  It's always crowded. The menu is mind-boggling. Depending on what you order, it can be overpriced.  Maybe it's the cheesecake. Maybe it's the Boom Boom Chicken and Shrimp.  Maybe I just expect something better every time I come back. What's that? Insanity? I suggest coming for lunch to bypass the wait."
Lyna N.,"Lynnwood, WA",299,98,270,3.0,9/20/2013,"I had a very unpleasant experience at this particular Cheesecake Factory today due to our server. His name was Donald H. Since he first came to us (my boyfriend and I), his customer service was horrible and he made it clear that he did not want to be our server for whatever reason. His attitude was bad and chewed gum obnoxiously whenever he talked to us. Our bread he gave us was cold and when I tried to get his attention while he walked past us to get it warmed up, it took me two tries to call him over and he still walked past me but said ""okay."" When we came back to our table to grab the cold bread, he just chews his gum and grabs the bread from the top, touching the entire thing with his palm. That was disgusting. We were very polite to him and always said thank you whenever he gave us something but his attitude was still bad. It's funny that I observed that he was being incredibly nicer to other tables and not ours, perhaps because I am not an older white american like those at the other table? Who knows. I am giving this three stars because the food is great. Our Chicken Bellagio tasted very good, and it is my go-to order at Cheesecake Factory. And our appetizer was also good, which was the guacamole with chips (though we did add lots of pepper and salt to it). It is also a convenient location with lots of food options, and so I find myself coming back here. My favorite cheesecake is the white chocolate raspberry truffle. Anyway, I cannot believe how bad of a server he was. His voice only changed to an enthusiastic tone when he gave us our bill, probably because he wanted tip. The entire time though, he was uninterested and NOT welcoming at all to us.  Donald H. gave us terrible 1 star customer service."
Marlon G.,"San Jose, CA",151,26,9,1.0,2/14/2015,"No. NO NO NO NO! Waited an hour and I ordered through take out! Ordered at 6pm, got there at 8pm and did not get my food till 9pm. NO NO NO NO! Unacceptable. I dislike corporate restaurants."
Amy H.,"Seattle, WA",0,2,,2.0,8/2/2016,"My husband got burned on a plate, as did another customer at our table when he bit into his food. The plates are way too hot--too hot to hold. The food that comes for kids is too hot. They need to reduce the temperature, especially of the kids' foods, and the plates that come to the table. it's common sense. The volume was way too high, even on a weeknight. The place was packed, too stressful; you couldn't hear people talking to you at your table. I'm not sure why this place is so popular! The pizza was sub-par; not one of the better pizzas I've had, thin and cheaply made. Then when we went to leave, they gave us a bag for our to-go cheesecakes. One cheesecake just fell out of the top of the bag and landed, opening up and getting on the sidewalk in the process. Yuck. I'm glad someone else paid for this dinner. I can't say I liked this place, although I'd say the service was pretty good. Don't think I'd want to come here again. It was so loud when we got to our table at first I wanted to leave! I'm pretty sure the food here is not clean, it tastes funny and is making my stomach hurt."
An T.,"Redmond, WA",72,308,191,3.0,2/4/2012,"Came for dinner with my friend, I had the hibachi steak.  The steak was cooked well but the sauce they used was unusually sweet. The tempura asparagus was nice and the wasabi mash had just the right amount of wasabi that was not too overpowering, but noticeable. She had the Sheppard's pie. It was surprisingly good. Nice minced pieces of meat in a nice gravy."
Steve R.,"Federal Way, WA",58,8,3,5.0,9/21/2015,"Went with a group of friends to try Cheesecake Factory and we never got to try any cheesecake, because we were so stuffed with great food. Tried the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta which was excellent I would highly recommend it especially if you like things a little spicy. My friends allowed me to try their shrimp scampi, steak Diana, and hibachi steak. All the dishes were well cooked and very tasty, my least favorite thing surprisingly was the shrimp scampi. My favorite was still the Cajun jambalaya pasta which was superb. The decorating was a little tacky, but the service was spot on. I'd give this one a five out of five stars. Hit it up for a nice date, happy chowing!!"
Anne R.,"Seattle, WA",52,66,26,3.0,5/3/2015,"I come back to the Cheesecake Factory because I always know what to expect: long waits to get seated, huge portions of high calorie food, and a friendly staff. I always enjoy my food. The menu is huge so there is something for everyone, but can be a little overwhelming when you are trying to decide. They just added a ""skinny"" menu which tells you the calorie count of your meals if you are watching what you eat."
Victoria C.,"Seattle, WA",444,651,10,2.0,9/26/2011,"This is the place to be if you like HUGE portions, lots of calories, and average quality and flavor. Go look at the nutritional guide. Only the salads are less than 600 cals.  I come here probably once every two years. It's not a place I go out of my way to eat at, but my parents like it. Go figure.  PROS: 1. Huge portions. Enough for two or three meals per entree.  2. Prices are meh. You pay for what you get.  3. Good service. Overly friendly wait staff trying to earn their tip. CONS: 1. The food fails to impress. Always. The pastas are meh, the sauces are lacking in flavor, and it's just not that great. Nothing to write home about. I hate the fact that they give you so much food. I'd rather pay less for less food. I hate to say it, but on my way to and from my seat, I couldn't help but notice that most everyone I passed in the restaurant was severely overweight. It's restaurants like these that encourage America to be the fattest nation in the world. Sick."
Dylan M.,"San Francisco, CA",448,112,64,2.0,4/13/2014,"The menu is a complete mess. There's no rhyme nor reason to how it's organized and it's completely overstuffed with countless foods and drinks. I guess that's kinda the draw of Cheesecake Factories, that they're a cheaper version of an upscale dining experience but the quality of the food and the atmosphere they provide do not make up for the price they charge. Also as a note the floors are extremely slippery and seem very dangerous so be careful when you're walking around."
J F.,"Seattle, WA",192,31,,1.0,7/29/2015,"This is for not having drink prices on their menu AS WELL the waiter not knowing drink prices or even how they are grouped. The waiter had to cross the floor and price check each drink individually  at the register to find out prices one at a time, and then having to go back again when said drink was too expensive until I just picked one without knowing the price. REALLY bad inefficient system - not fair to your customers or severs as it makes them look stupid and adds extra stress. when your drink menu varies from 7 to 14 dollars people should be able to pick their options depending on how much $ they want to spend. That's just common sense"
Aaron B.,"Olympia, WA",162,14,3,1.0,1/12/2014,"This place has a huge menu...because that make NOTHING well--well, maybe cheesecake. Chili's, Applebee's, Friday's, Ruby Tuesday's are all restaurants of the same ilk; however, instead of strange and meaningless pictures on the wall, at the Cheesecake Factory it's ever stranger and more meaningless decor.  Not to mention, everything has that extra ""You're at the Cheesecake Factory!"" $5 added to the price. My food was horrible.  My wife's food was horrible.  The plating was bad.  The coffee was bad.  The drinks were bland. Something big would have to happen before I go back to this Cheesecake Factory.  I used the love The Cheesecake Factory when I was a kid, too."
Sonya L.,"Kent, WA",752,1280,239,2.0,8/15/2011,"Went here for lunch with a co-worker.  The noise level was extremely loud - so much so that it was hard to hear our waitress tell us about the specials. The Thai lettuce wraps were pretty tasty - we split them.  However, our waitress seemed to think we were weird for not ordering more food (hello, have you seen the portion sizes here?) and pressed us several times regarding the rest of the menu and if we wanted more food.  We said no over and over, but she still continued to ask.  It was frustrating and annoying. Both of us got a mojito - um, was there any alcohol in this?  Because for NINE DOLLARS there should at least be SOME, right?  Apparently not... It is unlikely I will be back here."
Nina P.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",9,13,3,5.0,6/16/2014,Usually order nothing but cheese cake but this time I tried the Oreo milk shake and it was AWESOME! Customer service was great. Our server was warm and friendly!!!
Chloe B.,"Puyallup, WA",100,19,16,4.0,4/10/2015,"Ok, so the wait was pretty crazy, but you won't be let down. Great, freshly made food. Awesome vegetarian burger patty with brown rice, black beans, farro, couscous, and mushrooms. Plus, the two pages of cheesecake is leaving me wanting one of everything!"
Ashani F.,"Seattle, WA",115,2,,5.0,8/22/2015,The wait time may be long but the wait is definitely worth it. I've had numerous things on the menu and they've all been good. My fav restaurant by far.
Stacey P.,"Stockton, CA",49,6,1,5.0,7/13/2015,"Only a 20 minute wait. Had a delicious turkey burger!! It was made fresh, nor frozen!!"
Megan W.,"Auburn, WA",1,59,5,5.0,5/12/2015,"I always have a good experience here. Tonight it was exceptional. The wait was 15 minutes, not bad.  The Sante fe salad was the bomb, as it is every time.  But this time the service was so good it was really worth rating them 5 stars.  Consistent, great selection. No complaints from me on this spot."
Lee P.,"Seattle, WA",0,22,,5.0,4/30/2016,This place is one of our regular stopovers after seeing a movie at Southcenter. Their menu offerings are vast and it always takes me a long time to decide what we want. There's something for everyone to be sure and so far everything I've had it was quite good and then there's the cheesecake and they are so good. The place is always busy as heck which is a good sign that it must be a good place. So after your next movie down there just take a walk across the way and check these people out. No disappointments
