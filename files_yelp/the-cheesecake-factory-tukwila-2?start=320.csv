Drocks F.,"Seattle, WA",0,1,,2.0,4/7/2016,15 kids running around in lobby. Told I had to be put on a wait list for the bar but watched others just walk in and sit down. I was told that I would wait 15 20 minutes 30 minutes ago.  There are empty tables.
Kelly W.,"Seattle, WA",11,23,8,3.0,5/24/2015,"Went in with a friend of mine since the wait time wasn't too bad and everything started out ok. Then a waiter spilled water all over the floor and didn't clean it up. Fish tacos were very good, but I was charged for soda water! I was literally charged for CO2. Not ok in my book. Also slipped and messed up my foot on the water that was never cleaned up."
Öner Ö.,"Irvine, CA",3,2,,5.0,5/21/2015,I like this place! Cheese pizza it was awesome! My advice you should try this pizza! So delicious
Yuliia M.,"Renton, WA",26,6,,5.0,8/2/2015,Recently had dinner there. The food was delicious and service was great! I love the tiramisu cheesecake! Really nice place :)
Isaiah I.,"Seattle, WA",0,53,16,1.0,5/21/2015,I visited this location on May 20th 2015. We went in the late afternoon for a work function with about 13 guests.  I ordered the chicken bellagio.  First bite into the chicken and out comes a 6IN LONG HALF MELTED PIECE OF PLASTIC!!!!!! The waitress was right there when it happened. She took my plate immediately and brought it back 30 minutes later after all of my coworkers finished eating. I got it to go. They didn't charge me for the meal (company was paying anyway).  Do not visit this place. Service is good but realistically you're paying for the food. It's not worth it.
Dorian R.,"Burbank, CA",65,1,,2.0,8/1/2015,"The cheesecake factory food quality has really gone downhill!  I had one of my favorite dishes, the jamaican pepper shrimp and it was almost inedible!!  The best part was the tasty sauce and the plantains.  EVERYTHING else was dry and overcooked from the shrimp to the rice and black beans which is sad because i used to like this place!  Will not be coming here again!"
Sarah L.,"Seattle, WA",154,111,30,3.0,2/25/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is huge. Everything about it is huge. The building, the menu, the staff, the crowds of people. There are so many menu options that is honestly overwhelming. They have a little bit of everything which makes it hard (at least for me) to decide when I am super hungry. The food is pretty good but not spectacular, probably because there are so many to serve all the time. The cheesecake is delicious and comes in a wide variety, definitely worth taking a slice home. The food is also pretty pricey here so be ready. Overall it doesn't blow me out of the water. I would return but not with great expectations and I would probably order something safe and cheap."
Tara H.,"Kingsland, GA",51,123,92,5.0,2/24/2015,I'm never disappointed when I come here! They always are consistent with whatever I order. Tonight we came to celebrate my moms birthday. She had the fresh grilled salmon that comes with mashed potatoes and broccoli. I had the chicken and mushroom marsala. The pricing is great for the portions we were served. Service here is always superb! This older lady server is the best. She has great customer service skills. All the servers I've had here were all so great! Lots of parking.  And most of all there's a family restroom with a changing table! They also offer slings and high chairs!
Ahmed K.,"Federal Way, WA",3,26,3,5.0,4/21/2013,"I know what you might be thinking right now: Why do you give a chain restaurant five stars? My answer in this case: Exceptional customer service. While I've never really cared much about customer service when I eat out in general, I was amazed with how good it can get when the restaurant management knows its customer service. This was not my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory. In fact, I've been going to the Tukwila and other branches for a while now, but never felt the urge to write a review on it, until today. I went with a friend here for dinner. It was the typical Sunday evening wait time (20 minutes). However, we were seated in about 12 minutes. My friend ordered the salmon with a white butter sauce (they said it wasn't on the menu and it was today's special). I enjoyed the fact that their skinnylicious menu was big enough to have dishes that satisfy practically any taste. I have been dieting and counting calories so I went with the shrimp creole (less than 590 calories, not bad for dinner). Of course, I had to have a couple pieces of their dark honey whole wheat bread, amazingly tasty as usual. My friend and I kept talking and talking for a while only to be interrupted by the manager saying: ""I am really sorry your dinner is taking so long. Your dish looked like someone else's order and was sent to another table. In the mean time can I offer you a complimentary soup or salad?"". I didn't even notice the food was taking so long! Maybe I wasn't so hungry, but still I found it be a great gesture coming from the manager himself and without us even complaining or asking about food. My friend's dish came out 5 minutes after that and mine 5 minutes later, each time with the server apologizing for the delay. I got my dish and it was flavorful, filling and a nice change to the diet food I eat on daily basis. The server checked on us twice, the second time she says: ""I hope you enjoyed your meal and don't worry we'll take care of that for you"". Huh? I thought you already apologized by giving me a complimentary salad. When she brought the bill, they deducted my dish from the total. So basically I got a free salad and entree! The reason I am emphasizing on this is because I wasn't even angry the food took so long, I was enjoying the conversation with my friend. But again that goes to show you that some people take pride in their job and provide excellent customer service. I've been here on many occasions, loving their food from pastas to steaks to cheesecakes. This time, however, will be my most memorable visit here yet!"
Mickey D.,"Tacoma, WA",0,3,,1.0,7/16/2015,"First time visit, last time customer.  The server was the ONLY good part of this visit. He was attentive and caring, and checked on us often, so we acknowledged his efforts kindly.  Crab/artichoke appetizer was spicy, and menu did not mention it. My wife could not eat it with the brick-for-bread they brought. Server tried to get us some edible bread twice, but finally ended up taking it all away and removing it from our bill.  Manager was understanding at this point.  Wife asked to substitute asparagus for green beans on her order. Platter came out with green beans. Asked the person who brought out the food to get her the asparagus. It came out quickly, but was uncooked, like they just tossed it on a plate and 30 seconds in the microwave. Her mashed potato something was cold and tasteless. Her pork chop was tough and she couldn't eat it.  My Chicken Marsala was at least edible, but I have had better at ""Olive Garden"". Then came the dessert. We ordered it to go, and when we got home, I felt the container it came in would have tasted better than the Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake.  All in all, this earned a ""Skip it"" as dining experiences go."
Jaime B.,"West Seattle, Seattle, WA",5,2,,5.0,7/16/2013,"Was out on a date with my lovely lady. Our server Veronica was great!! she help my Spanish learning girlfriend practice her Spanish (which made the visit great, she had a great genuine personality).  My lady had a Tuna salad. which i could not resit from trying!! (it was season raw tuna!! kinda like sushi!! with out the seaweed and rice, it was good!!) lol As for me i had the Mushroom Burger, which for all you mushroom lovers, it was greasy and delicious, with a well done patty and melted Swiss(and a side of fries haha). Muy Bueno!!"
AnnaLee Z.,"Lakewood, WA",224,72,532,1.0,4/7/2013,"Once upon a time I thought the Cheesecake factory was good... Maybe I should only come here for cheesecake. Perhaps it was just this location, but I was so not impressed.   I was meeting my mom and sister and I arrived earlier than them so I decided to have a happy hour cocktail at the bar while I awaited their arrival.  Huge mistake.  First of all between two bored looking bartenders, it took them about 10 minutes to acknowledge me and another 10 to make my drink.  The drink was too sweet with way too much citrus.  When my mom and sister arrived we weren't even seated in the normal dining area even though I had put us on the list for a table when I arrived.  Instead we were seated in the bar.  The only saving grace was our very polite server.  As far as the food was concerned I felt like the tuna was not fresh enough, the flavors were lacking, don't bother with the gumbo and for the most part everything seemed as though it had been grease bombed.  Why was the food so greasy?  I just don't understand!"
April F.,"Atlanta, GA",74,160,172,5.0,2/9/2012,"The Cheesecake factory has gone skinny!!! They have a new ""skinnylious"" menu with TONS of options, from drinks, salad, soup, burgers etc! Just pure awesomeness, and just like their regular menu ALL the food tastes delicious!  BRAVO to the cheesecake factory!!! This place NEVER lets me down! ....Only ""con"" is that they do not have any Brunch options on the skinny menu yet..."
George G.,"Olympia, WA",0,3,,1.0,7/6/2015,"Extremely Unsanitary! They sat us down at a table that had food particles on the seats and table. When my wife looked at her silverware, the fork still had food dried on it and then we watched the girl clean a table next to us with a dirt rag and left food particles on that table. I won't be back there soon!"
Dustin D.,"Langley, Canada",72,60,11,5.0,8/22/2013,"This is an amazing place to eat as long as you plan ahead for a mild-long wait. It can be anywhere from 10 minutes to over an hour depending on the time you go. In my opinion, the wait is well worth it! Our server was Autumn, and she was excellent at helping us choose our foods to eat, knew the menu like the back of her hand (they almost all do), and had a huge smile on and kept us happy for the 45 minutes or so we were seated. Food was excellent (I had the Southwest Chicken Burger, buffalo style) but it always is. Huge portions. But save room for cheesecake afterwards, it's amazing! Key Lime is my fave of the lighter ones but others are amazing too if you want a heavier cheesecake. I might be biased as a Canadian who doesn't get to the Cheesecake Factory too often, but I think it's that wait in between trips to it that makes it so worth-while. :-)"
Erica W.,"Bothell, WA",91,369,485,4.0,1/2/2014,"Came here for lunch since I was in town for a work meeting. We thought this would be quick, since it had been in the past. Well unfortunately it was the peak of holiday season and it was packed. The waiter was quick though, and took the drink/food order together to expedite our lunch. The food came shortly after, and we chowed down! I ordered the Ricotta & sausage flatbread pizza, which is a GUILT free lunch choice, and only $6.95! I found it on the ""skinny"" menu, along with a great selection of choices under 550 calories!  If you haven't been to a CF, you usually need a good 10-15 minutes with the menu, as it is HUGE. It is a book. Literally. Choices range from breakfast, to pizza, to burgers, to salads, to comfort foods... endless options! I am also a fan of their breakfast!  Now let's get to the cheesecake! Holy moly, probably 2 pages of cheesecake selections, oh I might need 15 more minutes with the menu for dessert as well!! I've sampled several of them myself, the one that always stands out to me is the Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake, and the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. (Vanilla Bean is always good too!)"
Jenna S.,"Lewiston, ID",24,45,95,4.0,5/4/2013,"We come here when time (and space) allows.  It's always packed.  I love all of their food, but since I am trying to behave, I tend to stick to their awesome ""Skinnylicious"" menu.  I truly love that they have this option available. We had Henry as our waiter last night.  I really wanted to give him some love.  He was the perfect waiter.  Attentive but not annoying.  He answered questions easily about dishes and was on top of our drinks.  He had a pleasant personality and swiftly took care of a tiny problem we had. I would have given five stars, but that's only because of an evil chair."
Ariana D.,"Renton, WA",0,6,,1.0,2/28/2016,"This review is based solely on one experience- but this included an encounter with a manager that supposedly  claimed she had 43yrs of experience in this industry... however being a professional myself she did not exemplify quality customer service in fact the total opposite, until of course I called her back after we left the restaurant to inform her that I had called two Cheesecake Factory locations asking about the happy hour menu and pricing on drinks that were made as skinny drinks not until I told her that then she became very sweet and was trying very hard to apologize however still in the end she did nothing to compensate our bad experience. She did not even offer to pay us back our money for drinks that had been overcharged on her command to her bartenders.  The manager did not know that our bartender knows us as regulars and corrected the bill after Manager left-however the manager left thinking she overcharged us. She apparently did not know that skinny drinks or skinny versions of drinks on the happyhour are still happyhour priced items she kept on telling us that they were not happy hour prices. She repeated over and over on how happy hour drinks were only for the regular versions and she said that they have never offered the skinny drinks there is not even an option to do a skinny drink under the happyhour price so that's why I took things in my own hands and called to other locations asking about that and I was informed that they were the same price. We were very kind when she approached us at the bar and she automatically had this kind of wall defense up we were being super nice and we did not fight with her we simply told her that we are regulars and we have always ordered skinny drinks and they have always been charged as happyhour drinks she was basically telling us that no no that couldn't ever happened. We love the bartenders at Cheesecake Factory! That is why we go to happy hour with them because they are good people and they value our service and they always provide us with quality service! The manager is the one that messed it up for us. This managers name is CYNTHIA & if I knew any better those 43 years of industry work were spent at a Dennys not at a cheescakefactory no way with that customer service quality there is no way that she ever spent 43 years of cheescakefactory no absolute way! She needs to learn the menu and know how to correct her errors."
Chris S.,"Kent, WA",0,10,,1.0,4/11/2013,"Came in for anniversary. Started out with bad table. basically sitting with other people I didn't come with. In the lounge but ""not"" loud busy people passing by. Not   Private in any way. I could have participated in others conversation had I wanted.  Next! They served us water in plastic worn down ugly mugs. Scratched and cloudy. I expect a glass call me strange.  Our waiter presented himself as if he just finished smoking a bowl and came straight to our table. He mumbled and never shared the specials with us.  Our food was slightly cold because the food runner couldn't finds ""us"" they asked the table next to us with food but before asking us they walked back around to the kitchen and a long while later they found us! I'd never return unless I was getting cheese cake to go. Over priced ""getto"" experience. I expect better From a place that cost what they did."
Samantha A.,"Seattle, WA",540,71,165,5.0,5/29/2013,"Their food is outstanding, serivce is excellent, and I haven't been able to try their cheesecake, but by the looks of them in their display cases, I'm sure they are out of this world. The quality of the food, service, and overall experience is hard to come by these days. PLEASE check this place out!"
