Fritz S.,"Vancouver, Canada",404,247,31,4.0,12/14/2013,"Yes.. Yet another trendy franchise restaurant filled with hi energy nice pretty servers and fast service, along with beautiful ambiance and a cheesecake menu a mile long!  We came here for lunch so it wasn't too busy. I've never been to the CCF and didn't have to wait 2 hours to eat.. so go at lunch if u can ;)  My recommendation for hot foodie goodness is the Kobe beef burger (medium rare of medium)  served with grilled onion and shrooms. Super juicy and very flavorful... My shirt had a few bites as well... -__- #messyfail  some of my favorite cheesecakes are the S'mores cheesecake and the chocolate mousse.. DDEEAMMMM! There's a million other delicious items to choose from.. you might need more than a minute to decide.. of if you're me.. 30 minutes...  #indecisivemuch  u gotta try if you're in the states.."
Alex H.,"Kent, WA",356,258,183,4.0,1/6/2014,"If you're the least bit indecisive your brain might explode while looking at the menu here.  So many choices... The menu is huge and based on previous experiences I'm actually pleasantly surprised by the quality that comes out of that kitchen every single time.  I've had many things here and nothing has been short if delicious. Especially their deserts. I really enjoy the top notch decor and environment there.  Except when it's packed. Which often times it is.  They take full advantage of seating space as sometimes you're practically seated at the same table as the patrons next to you.  Unless you're at a booth being at the tables, they are so close to each other.  Not that I don't have fun when I end up just making friends with them during dinner anyways.  I also really enjoy the out door patio on a nice warm day which yes, is rare like my steak. The service has been hit or miss.  Sometimes you get that waiter who has been there for far too long and clearly has no interest in serving today, which I feel for but is still disheartening. And sometimes you get the waitress that makes your whole day better."
Sam M.,"Renton, WA",1,61,,2.0,11/25/2015,"I've been here and few time and really can't figure out why there is always a line of people waiting to get seated.  This place doesn't really wow me. Since this locations has opened, I have visited it maybe four times.  All my visits the service has been okay.  I think the prices are a little high for food that I think is just okay - I've had better. On my recent visit, I realized how dark it is in the restaurant.  My friend and I had our flashlights out so we could read the menu.  We noticed other tables were doing the same thing.  I am beginning to dislike restaurants that are so dark that you need a flashlight to read the menu.  Do they keep it so dark because they don't want diners to see what they are actually eating? Besides being dark, the other thing I don't like about the Cheesecake Factory is how close they have the tables shoved together.  I was in a party of two and we were seated in a section that was nothing but a long line of tables for two that were spaced out a few inches apart.  When the hostess seated us, she seated us right next to an occupied table.  That would have been fine, except the party of two seated at the next table, instead of sitting across the table from each other for some reason had to sit on the same side of the table that is only meant for one person.  Since I was going to be sitting on the side where the two were sitting, I asked the hostess if we could sit at the empty table two down.  At first she said no, then as I was trying to squeeze in past the two dingbats, she came back and told us we could move. I have to wonder about the hostess because if she had any common sense she would have realized the two sitting on the same side of the table would make it difficult for the next table, but no she didn't because after my party and I moved down two tables, she seated another pair at the next table.   It will probably be a long time before I go back to the Cheesecake Factory."
Shert J.,"Renton, WA",10,230,41,4.0,5/28/2011,"Our family of four ate here on a Wednesday night.  Maybe because we went somewhat ""off hours"" (did not arrive til about 7:30pm), found the place to be so much less crowded and zoo-like than the Bellevue location. We were immediately seated and our waitperson was super.  We had very good service all night.  Started with cocktails and beer.. we were all happy. The menu is huge.  Last time I ate at another location, was not too happy about the food quality.  But this time all was excellent.  I had the Chicken Bellagio--  full of fat, calories, cheese, pasta, pesto, whatever.  It was heaven on a plate.  I only ate half, and happily took home leftovers for lunch the next day.  Other entrees ordered were shrimp scampi, chicken piccata, cobb salad.  All pronounced Very Good!!! So the food is pre-made somehwere else, frozen and shipped up to the restaurant to be re-heated and plated.  The huge amount of cheese, cream and calories in the dishes makes up for that, and makes the dishes ""nummy"".   Menu offers a huge variety-- but maybe TOO much.  It is hard to make a choice. Cheesecake for dessert was wonderful.  Four of us split two pieces, and gobbled them up:  A new mango flavor, and raspberry tiramisu.  Yummmmmmm  ..I am almost in a food coma just thinking about it!"
Linda L.,"Renton, WA",75,52,69,2.0,8/12/2014,"I had called 4 days ahead and placed an order for a red velvet cheesecake with a chocolate plaque. I stated that it's for birthday that will be picked up at 3 pm on Saturday. The girl took my order and asked for my name and phone number. Upon arrival at 5pm my cake was NOT ready. Their reason was because the order was not complete. I feel that if an order is incomplete, someone from the staff should have called to get the necessary information to complete the order. That way when I pick up my order I don't have to wait an extra 20 minutes for something that should have already been done. On top of all that they wrote ""happy birthday""in red gel on top of a chocolate plaque that you could not even see the writing."
Jessica Y.,"Saint Paul, MN",34,160,214,4.0,9/17/2011,Consistent service and food.
Laura S.,"Bellevue, WA",67,8,,3.0,12/24/2014,"My boyfriend and I frequent this location a lot, usually one us receives our food before the other, and by the time the other entree comes out, the other person is almost finished with there meal. This one particular experience my boyfriend ordered a burger well done and it came out pink, our waiter offers to throw the meat back on the grill, with the cheese and sauce on it and everything. Is that normal?!?!"
Myduyen N.,"Seattle, WA",92,132,80,2.0,6/10/2014,Our family used to go here often but it has gotten busier and the wait is just ridiculous! It's hard to wait when long when you have kids.  I went here yesterday and the wait wasn't too long. We were seating within five minutes.  Our server took our drink orders and we ordered food for the kids so that they don't become anxious. It always work from our experiences! After we got our drinks we ordered our food. A little after we ordered our food we were told that our original server was helping out while our server was on break. They were both really nice.  Our appetizer came out and a little after that our entrees came out. We didn't really have time to finish our appetizer which was fine. We still didn't get the pizza for the kids so we asked our server. She checked into it and was honest. She told us that the ordered wasn't place. She must've told her manager who came by to apologize. He offered a fruit bowl to my daughter while she waits for the pizza.  The pizza came out burnt and the crust was somewhat hard so the kids didn't eat the crust.  We ordered the tater tots which was ok. I wouldn't order it again. It tasted good the first two bites. We also ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta which is absolutely delicious! I love how much pasta they give you. I was able to pack some home for lunch!  Of course we don't leave without ordering dessert. We had to order the red velvet cheesecake to go because we were stuffed. We ate some when we got home. It was amazing!! It was a decent size so we were able to save some for later! I highly recommend the red velvet cheesecake or the Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Those two will never fail ur sweet cravings!!!
Paul T.,"Seattle, WA",353,21,9,5.0,11/30/2013,"Food worth waiting in line for. Period. No time? Call in for take-out! I don't know of another casual dining restaurant with a menu that can even come close to the Cheesecake Factory. In fact, I've had $200 meals while WISHING I were at the Cheesecake Factory. Favorite appetizer: Texmex Eggrolls - every.single.time. Favorite entree: Hibachi Steak - tender meat in a sweet au jus w/onion and bean sprouts, wasabi mashed potatoes (as delicious as they sound), and fried asparagus. It will become one of your favorite dishes in the time it takes you to down one bite."
Traci L.,"Renton, WA",27,11,,2.0,1/23/2016,"Went to dinner for my son's 25th bday. Wait time was told 40 minutes. We were seated 1.5 hours later. When I checked in, I told to the host about my son's bday, they even asked for his name. They were going to sing to him and bring him a free sunday. When we sat down and placed our order, our waitress came back to our table and said they were out of the turkey burgers that I wanted. After we ate we got cheesecake and got out bill. They forgot to acknowledge my son's bday. Thanks Cheesecake Factory. ..we will not be returning."
Christina G.,"Seattle, WA",0,4,,1.0,2/28/2016,"The wait here is always insane.  The only reason we come here is because my daughter wanted their desert for her birthday.  We were quoted a 55 minute wait. After 50 minutes of waiting and seeing several parties our size that arrived after us get seated,  we struggled through the crowd to the podium to ask about how much longer.  We said  it's been about 50 minutes and wanted know about how much more, to then get the response from the hostess it has only been 47 minutes,  she insisted several times it was only 47 minutes and not 50. She was so rude,  what does about 50 minutes is so drastically different than 47 justified a hostess being so rude?  I found her to be just looking to argue,  I am sure she had a lot of pissy customers due to the ridiculous wait but I don't think how we asked her was in a rude manner or justified how she talked to us.  She then informed us it would  be 20 minutes more.  After waiting 25 more minutes,  I went to inquire to see how many more parties were ahead of us to then watch the hostess arguing with another customer about their wait time,  the customer hardly spoke as the hostess tried to put her in her place over the fact it hadn't been over an hour she had been waiting.  I guess I can take solace in the fact the time reprimand wasn't just for us.  After waiting an hour and 40 minutes we finally got buzzed.  Every one is now hungry and grumpy.  We agreed to be as positive as we could it's my daughters birthday and it's about her.  The food is not awesome especially for the cost or the wait.  My fish and chips order was fried shrimp,  even the food server said fish and chips as she handed me the shrimp. When I did get my fish and chips the tarter sauce was so hot from being under the heat lamp for too long.  Nothing appetizing about hot tartar sauce.   The waitstaff is the one highlight,  they were friendly and as quick as they can be with  the chaos and trying to get through the sea of people and orders.  Never again will I wait to be treated poorly and get sub par food,  I will get my daughter cheesecake to go if she really wants it (even though the takeout is crazy too)  at least it won't be almost 2 hours and a rude as hell hostess for sub par food at a  not worth it price."
Michelle C.,"Puyallup, WA",9,65,22,5.0,10/11/2013,"I LOVE Cheesecake Factory! My all time favorite item is the sweet corn tamale cakes (3 tamale cakes with sour cream, avocado slices, and a slightly spicy green sauce). It's under the appetizer section BUT it's more than enough for a meal! (If you're not sharing).  Out waitress, Tiffany, was really nice and helpful. It's restaurants like this with great food & customer service that gets my return business. Tiramisu cheesecake is to die for!!!"
Robert T.,"Pomona, CA",24,18,9,1.0,1/1/2015,"Where's the service? I was  here a few months ago and things seemed ok. However today we had a very rude hostess, and a very lazy sarcastic server. With bad service I'm starting to realize the food isn't all that great and pretty overpriced as well. I'm actually wondering why I came back. It actually feels like I'm annoying the staff by wanting to eat in their restaurant. I think I'll be staring clear of this place for the near future..."
Tiffany C.,"Seattle, WA",5,28,13,3.0,11/7/2014,I really enjoyed the free warm bread they serve but my pasta was lacking in flavor. They threw 5 pieces of shrimp and tomato on top of my watery angel hair pasta. This place is good for dessert only.
Cecil J.,"Seattle, WA",16,31,1,2.0,8/3/2014,Gross food. Very cheap and nasty. This place is more like a glorified cafe. Only buy the basics here don't get fancy
Kristina D.,"Renton, WA",7,13,4,1.0,2/8/2015,"When you run out of a menu item that you only make available for Sunday brunch and was the only reason I was at your restaurant in the first place, you do not get a good review.  Not happy."
Deedee R.,"Seattle, WA",0,51,19,5.0,8/21/2014,"My second fav restaurant behind Gordon Ramsey Steak. Iced green tea, grilled artichoke for appetizer, and Bang bans chicken and shrimp with brown rice. OMG every bite so delicious but too full to finish! Super yummy leftovers. Love love love Cheesecake Factory!"
Rich S.,"Puyallup, WA",1,8,,5.0,8/24/2014,"Always good food.  Thai lettuce wraps BOMB!  Salmon and asparagus BOMB! Of course the Tuxedo Cheesecake BOMB!  The only problem is trying to get seating. The seating staff act like the place is the Palisades.  Super snooty and smarmy.  It's like ""really?""  You're just putting people in an open spot.  My two year old can do that on his Leapfrog."
Kristen B.,"Bremerton, WA",38,47,19,2.0,8/10/2014,Food was great!! I recommend the sirloin with the fries... Cause it's totally life changing but the two times we went this last week the service was horrible... Slow and forgetful. The second waitress was pretty good but the kitchen was incredibly slow and the girls in front lost our name or sis my write it down and I had to go to them and ask them what happened for them to realize what they did and seat us... But the food I had the second time was bomb
Wesley W.,"Vancouver, Canada",79,352,416,3.0,4/20/2013,"While on a weekend trip with my family, we visited my cousin who lives in the area and decided to go here on a Sunday night. We knew there would be a long wait especially for a party of 12. They told us it would be about an hour and 45 minutes but to come after an hour. We went to the mall to kill time and called after an hour instead of going in. Good news, they were preparing the table. We arrived at the table and the floor was extremely dirty including a squished fry. Looks like they just wiped the previous party's mess onto the floor. Anyway, the rest of our visit here was standard Cheesecake Factory. Not bad, not great."
