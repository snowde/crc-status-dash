Alexandrea P.,"Renton, WA",7,73,,4.0,10/21/2012,"I went with a couple of coworkers as a girls lunch, and this is what I will do next time.  Because their portions are so large, it is really better (IMO) to just order the smaller, cheaper items from there.  Yeah.  Order a few things, pass them around, everybody tries something.   They offer the SKINNY menu, which is much smaller than their huge menu.  I would have thought they were bringing me a complimentary novel, if I hadn't known any better.  The wait time wasn't too horrible, and I avoid this place altogether if it is a weekend, holiday, or if I can see the heads of hungry patrons bobbing aimlessly in the doorway waiting for their disks to buzz them.   I wouldn't bother getting drinks from there again.  Ordered a mojito... twice (shame on me) and I think I would have been better off drinking sweet minty water, other than something thats supposed to have some booze in it.  If I'm going to pay for a drink, at least let me taste the ""drink"" portion.   So, what have we learned?  No ordering off of the novel, stick with the ""slim"" menu to cut cost (and fat/calories they cram into their food... Oh wait, haha, thats called flavor)  -No ordering drinks.  Unless it's wine or something, because its hard to water down wine and get away with it... -avoid going on thursday/friday/saturday nights.  Sunday is generall alright.  DEFINITELY don't go on valentines day... in fact, just don't go Valentine's week just to be safe.  However, as someone else mentioned before, arriving here later in the evening is alright, when everything has died down.  (Remember, they do seat later than surrounding restaurants of the same caliber.)"
Jim H.,"Jacksonville, FL",9,22,,1.0,6/25/2014,"Stopped in for a quick bite on the way to the airport. Ordered the avocado chicken club sandwich. Bad choice! Bottom piece of bread was soggy, there was no middle slice (it's a club, right?) and the rest of it was a mess. Wife had the regular chicken club, which was OK, but mine was inedible. Have eaten at plenty of Cheesecake Factories and not had any problems, but this sandwich was a disgrace."
Destiny B.,"Puyallup, WA",0,38,2,2.0,6/25/2014,"Today was the first time I've been to the cheesecake factory in a very long time, and now I remember why. The service is HORRIBLE! Seriously, the servers were standing around chatting it up, while our drink glasses remained empty. We saw our server a total of three times. Chatting and checking out the arm pit stains on a fellow co-workers shirt seemed more interesting to them than any of their customers. When a table of 3 drops $60.00+ dollars for lunch (and the restaurant wasn't busy) a refill or two certainly wouldn't hurt. I won't be returning any time soon."
Dayana M.,"Renton, WA",20,31,3,5.0,11/15/2015,Hershey's chocolate cheesecake!!!!!

With their pasta any one of them BUT SERIOUSLY HERSHEYS CHOCOLATE CHEESECAKE!!!! (I must note I'm not w chocolate fan and my husband isn't a cheesecake fan yet we both couldn't get enough of this)
Stacey P.,"Renton, WA",50,387,11,4.0,2/26/2011,"Wonderful delicious Cheesecake Factory! Cheesecake Factory has delicious, consistent food. With their gigantic menu you'll have no problem finding something to satisfy your belly and with their colossal portions you're practically guaranteed to leave stuffed.  The service is great, plenty of parking, and the decor is typical Cheesecake Factory.  All that said you are warned you will wait to be seated. Sure, there will be times you'll slip in with a friend or two and be immediately seated. But more often then not you will wait and depending on the night you may end up waiting upwards of an hour."
Crystal D.,"Seattle, WA",186,371,43,4.0,2/22/2013,"Great bartender, friendly wait staff, great ambiance, tasty drinks, and amazing food.  I've been here several times as well as the Bellevue location.  This location is much easier to be seated at and has faster service.  Parking can be a night mare, but that is expected with being next to the mall.  You can never go wrong with a meal or drink here."
Eva S.,"Auburn, WA",3,12,1,5.0,11/9/2014,"all time favorite restaurant. The cheese balls are to die for  great atmosphere always friendly service, overall love."
Julia W.,"Seattle, WA",91,653,336,4.0,4/25/2011,I'm a girl who looooves happy hour. The cheesecake factory has always been known for their extensive menus (20+ pages of food) and also for their large portion sizes. The wait times can be a bit long but they seemed to have gotten better at seating large groups and adding bar space. I went with my girlfriends recently and discovered there is a Happy Hour. It's always nice to be able to get a discount on drinks or apps when you would already be present. I typically get their pasta or at times their breakfast (avail all day). Their portions are large and a little on the medium price range ($20/entree is typical) but you will have a to-go box. I am not a fan of cheesecake but they also have a large range of flavors of cheesecake. I have enjoyed their goblet of strawberries which is shareable and delicious. Would recommend for anyone who wants a nice place to eat where family style eating is encouraged and also family friendly.
Ray D.,"Northwest, Denver, CO",0,15,23,5.0,7/1/2014,The food is great the manager girl and staff are always friendly and astute don't limit yourself I have tried a large variety and it has always been great and satisfying
Joshua S.,"Seattle, WA",15,141,8,4.0,4/11/2013,"Only drawback is that this place is WICKED busy almost all the time.  Food is awesome, service has been great he last several times I've been there, location is awesome."
Jenny M.,"Seattle, WA",0,6,,3.0,1/7/2015,"I've been to this restaurant many times, and I've always had pretty good service, until last week.  Our server, Anastasia, was very rude.  She asked us how our food was and a member in my party was not happy with their food.  She just said she was sorry.  That was it.  The highlight of our evening was when Dustin took over for her, because she had to go on break.  I hope to never have our other server again."
Traci N.,"Auburn, WA",144,39,35,4.0,5/12/2012,"We showed up hungry...really hungry... BIG mistake.  I think we ordered just about every appetizer!  Everything was delicious.  So much so that we should have been taken out of the restaurant in wheel-barrows.  The cheesecake - how could you NOT get some cheesecake when you are here?  We asked the server which cheesecakes were the top sellers and she knew them all with no hesitation.  We then asked if there were any that people had said were just too rich (because with us there is no such thing) and she replied, ""Yes, the Godiva Chocolate one.""  So, we promptly ordered and devoured it along with the Dulce Deleche.  Even unbuttoning the pants didn't help at this point.  We were beyond the point of no return. I will be back, but I will NOT come hungry and I will start with the cheesecake.  :)"
Sandy H.,"Renton, WA",2,83,,4.0,8/30/2014,"I love the Chicken Marsala.  Prices are a bit high, but food is always good.  My favorites are the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake and anything chocolate!"
Stephanie B.,"Olympia, WA",12,2,,4.0,12/24/2014,"For a holiday I already expected a long wait for a party of 8, but although we waited an hour, as soon as we were sat, our server was there ready to greet and then have our drink orders. She was very attentive and friendly, and I would say wonderful in customer service.  I, myself working in a restaurant, understand how hectic it gets. I would have given 5 stars but I don't understand why the hosts don't know which server has which table... seeing that there were 5 hosts on those 3 hours we were there I would of thought one of them would know who our server was.... get on that ladies, otherwise good job. But if one of them was right then I would like to thank Lauren for her wonderful service. We loved our food and my boyfriend and I will be back soon :)"
Diana L.,"Seattle, WA",511,445,57,1.0,2/4/2012,"Gross. Moo, America. MOOOOO. Salt, SUGAR, preservatives.  Mountainous piles of lard disguised as salads, mind bogglingly large menu, though it matters not what you choose, as it all tastes the same. 1000% recommend portion of fat for a decade found in a single dessert. Fuck. Gross, America.  This is why you're fucking fat."
Colleen V.,"Bellevue, WA",3,6,,1.0,12/22/2014,"I recently reluctantly went back to eat here. My first experience was not impressive. The food is good but that's about it. My service was still not very good. My daughter's meal came significantly later than the rest of the table.  I also feel like you are sharing tables with everyone around you. They have them so close to each other you feel like you can't enjoy yourself. The only reason I went again was because we had giftcards, I don't think I would go if I had to pay with my money. The reason you go out to restaurants is for the service, if that's not any good you don't need to go there."
Syn M.,"Tacoma, WA",1,32,13,5.0,4/30/2014,"Great customer service, my pasta wasn't to my liking they not only were happy to trade it out but offered me additional items while I waited. My new pasta plate was delicious, very thankful to the management on hand"
Nate F.,"Philadelphia, PA",21,145,13,3.0,1/16/2013,"It was my first time ever going to a Cheesecake Factory the other day. Kinda confused on what type of restaurant it's supposed to be. Kinda all over the place. We went on a Monday night for a friend's birthday so it wasn't really busy in there. Well the menu was overwhelming. They had too much different meals. I mean, I know they're known for ""cheesecake"" but where does that leave me for my entree? I had no idea what to get. The good thing is they had a choice of ""snacks"" and then ""appetizers"". I started off with my usual wings. They were standard. Nothing too great but not bad either. After sifting through the menu 20 times, I finally just decided to get an Americana cheeseburger. I would have liked to try something different but there was too much stuff to decide. I'm not mad I got my burger though, it was extremely delicious. I even had enough leftovers for lunch the next day. Whatever the special sauce is, it's amazing. So why only 3 stars?? The service was terrible. I don't know how it usually is but they took about an hour and a half just to take our order. The lady was nice and I don't know if it was her fault but that was ridiculous. Service has to be bad for me to dock stars because the food is always the most important part for me. No doubt, I will come back here and leave a rereview if the service is better. It could be an unusual instance. No restaurant is perfect. Also, I'll check some Yelp reviews to decide what to get instead of guessing on that crazy menu."
Puddytat C.,"Honolulu, HI",14,160,74,2.0,3/10/2013,"Not the best Cheesecake Factory I've experienced.  Had the seafood pasta and it was pretty bland.  Usually, their pastas are full of flavor, but this one was borderline so-so. Won't be going back to this location."
Heather P.,"Bainbridge Island, WA",0,14,,2.0,10/29/2014,"It was ok - food is pretty good as expected. But I tried the skinny mojito and was disappointed. It was way too sweet, and the bartender didn't muddle the mint into the drink. It came with whole mints leaves and lime wedges completely intact, so there was none of their yummy goodness to mix on to the drink. I basically muddled it myself with my straw.  I would have added some water to cut the sweetness but my waiter forgot my water.  My waiter was a very nice guy but I barely saw him. He went way too long between times to check in on me. I actually came early, 5:00pm, to avoid a big rush, but still had long waits before getting food, drinks. Ordered the homemade guac, mild. Tasty but a bit sweet (?). Wish they'd put a lime on the side so I coulda cut the sweet flavor..."
