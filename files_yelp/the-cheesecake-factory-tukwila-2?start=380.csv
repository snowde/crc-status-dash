Alexis S.,"Silverdale, WA",1,25,,1.0,8/23/2015,Very disappointed server was nice though gave us lots of bread but one thing I noticed was how dirty the utensils looked like almost made me lose my appetite the dishwasher there act like they didn't care only good part was the cheese cake first time I felt disappointed at this place
D P.,"Puyallup, WA",36,6,,1.0,10/17/2015,"Lied to by the hostess...she claimed a 40 minute wait.  At 40 minutes, she claimed another 15-20 minutes.  They don't do reservations to alleviate this issue either."
Erika V.,"Renton, WA",63,9,,4.0,7/11/2012,"For late fathers day, I took my boyfriend out to eat in Cheesecake Factory. They usually have good service and serve good food. But this one time they made us wait for our food for a good 30 mins. Also, they forgot our utensils. Anyway, right after they delivered us our appetizer, which we enjoyed. They took forever to serve us our main dish. We have to talk to the manager and ask for our food. He responded with an apology and served us our food instead. He explained, one of the waiters served our dish to the other table. It all settled the confusion and our hunger. And right after when we asked for our bill... the manager waived our total amount to zero. We had a free lunch that day. Thank You!"
Katie A.,"Renton, WA",8,38,15,5.0,4/6/2014,"We love going here. Some things are better than others, but everything weve tried has been good. Our servers are always great. And the cheesecake is amazing!"
Sylvia M.,"Auburn, WA",58,120,,5.0,7/29/2014,"I have been here many times and have ALWAYS had a great experience.  True, their menu is like an encyclopedia because it's so HUGE!  But i think that's a good thing.  I have tried everything from their pastas, pizzas to steaks burgers and sandwiches.  The amazing thing is all of their food is delicios.  If you want healthy food, why would you dine out anyway because healthy is tasteless and boring.  If you are a health fiend, go on a cheat day.  Oh, and don't forget the super yummy cheesecake!  Staff is always super attentive and friendly as well."
Corinne S.,"Puyallup, WA",22,16,76,4.0,7/28/2014,"Portions are HUGE! Got the factory burrito grande - very good but I could only eat a third of it. Share meals here for sure, unless you want leftovers."
Rachel F.,"Bremerton, WA",10,16,,1.0,1/23/2012,"If you feel a deep hankering for their cheesecake, do yourself a favor and order it to go. If you are a first timer to a Cheesecake Factory some pointers -Don't go on a weekend night.  They don't take reservations -Expect a large menu (great if you are going out with a ton of different picky eater but always a bad sign in a restaurant since there is no real ""specialty"") -huge portions so skip the apps, or use them as your meal if you are staying for their namesake The Good:  The dessert was wonderful and our substitute waiter was an absolute delight.  We wish we could have given him the tip. The Bad:  The food.  The wait, feeling very rushed (the apps came out mere minutes before after our apps and dinners were grabbed from the kitchen as they came so we all were eating at different times at the same table.  Our waitress.  The Experience.... For the first time we doubled dated with our friends (a married couple with +1 expected) and let the lady with the bump choose our place to eat. After our hours drive and hour wait to get seated we were all pretty ready to eat. Our server was pleasant enough and took our order, brought us our bread and drinks.....and then went on break. Our apps came out a half hour after seating along with the pre-dinner salads.  Not normal but we didn't complain since we finally had food on the table.  As most people are, when I'm hungry my standards slip dramatically, and I was ready for anything.  Anything except what I got.  I ordered the crab and artichoke dip for an app....it tasted of warm mayonnaise some artichoke and the crab was probably juice since it tasted awful.  I took a few bites and had to waive the flag.  I chowed down on my partners potstickers (pretty good!) We hadn't even finished our apps when 1/2 of the dinners arrived.  There was no sense of timing with the waitstaff and the kitchen.  We did not hold up our pregnant friend from eating and had the rest of the apps boxed up.  This was really upsetting since one of the apps was just guac and chips. Boxing that up felt insulting. The dinner.  After the disappointing apps I was ready for dinner, and with lower expectations.  It still didn't soften the blow.   I ordered Wasabi encrusted Ahi tuna with veggies instead of rice.  The wasabi encrusted Ahi was bland.  Hats off to the chef for making that combo bland.  Ahi is so flavorful unless its of poor quality or storage.  You dont even cook it....I mean scewing Ahi up is just sad and points to a rather obvious problem at this place....no quality control whatsoever.  Bland wasabi?  Are you kidding me?  I had my friends husband try it and he agreed.  I was left with shredded buttered veggies. At this point its been 3 hours....I've barely eaten and the money invested in this meal would have gotten me a pair of designer jeans.   I didn't waive my flag just yet.  I had to order cheesecake....I was hungry and well....hungry. Hooray!  They didn't screw up the cheesecake!  I ordered the Godiva chocolate cheesecake and it was blissful.  The coffee was awful but was turned around with sugar and cream (as Tom described it: it tasted like the industrial sh** coffee we have on the submarine).  Our actual server was so useless for the first time in my life I tipped pre-tax and rounded down. Save yourself the trip, even if you want to impress a girl, take her out to some fancy expensive LOCAL place....the bill goes up way to fast here (no alcohol was ordered either), not to mention the wait or the waitstaff."
Ray C.,"Seattle, WA",0,78,,2.0,10/26/2015,"I really don't know what to think...so I am going to say that we went on a off afternoon. Let me start by saying that I have been a fan since the 90's in Marina del Rey and Beverly Hills, California locations. Never had a BAD meal. My friend ordered the chicken salad sandwich (which looked as though they took a teaspoon of salad and spread it ultra thin on the bread, hoping that the person eating it wouldn't notice on how skimpy the cook was.  Then he had the chicken tortilla soup which wasn't any way close to the tortilla soup we have ever had in California....this was a very thick tomato based soup that was pure yuk ! I ordered an omlet that was so so....it could have been better but I ate most of it, and thought to MYSELF I will never order one again here.  My friend told the waitress what he thought of it and she DID mention it to the Manager....and I have to say kudos to him, he deleted the soup and sandwich from the bill, which I thought was nice & only fair . Since Marc really didn't eat much of it.  Service is ALWAYS good as is the food....so am not going to say that I will never return, cause I will. They are known for their cheesecake, and I don't eat cheesecake so if you do then this would be the place for you to indulge."
Dalin C.,"Kent, WA",134,51,11,3.0,12/13/2013,"I have been to The Cheesecake Factory when it was my idea one time. Every other time, I tagged along. The Cheesecake Factory is a mainstream restaurant. A very mainstream restaurant. So what you will find there is a large establishment with bells, whistles, and money left over for more bells and whistles. The decor is very colorful and from what I understand they're all designed in-house. It's almost like walking into the Island of Misfit Decorations, but the odd shapes, hand-blown glass lighting, and cherry wood accent section.  I am convinced that the Cheesecake Factory believes that more is more. More cheesecake. More art to look at. More pages to turn in our menu. If you go to the Cheesecake Factory, be prepared for an experience that can put your eyes on overload.       My service came with a smile. Sometimes that's all you need. Sometimes it can come off feeling like the most generic action a waiter musters up. Unfortunately, I felt like I got the latter off of this visit. It was a Thursday evening and just as busy as a Friday. Did you know people eat everyday? Anyway, back to the service. It was quick. It was painless. For a restaurant that big and one that caters to so many different appetites, I'm not expecting to fall in love. He checked on us often and save one time, I never felt neglected.      The food portions are where this place genuinely shines. Be hungry. Otherwise, your right or left hand will be carrying something extra when you leave. Every time. From pasta to sandwiches to steak to seafood to pasta again, there are over 200 menu choices to make your waiter come back at least 4 times before you decide. Tonight, I had the Tex-Mex Egg rolls, Chicken Bellagio, and a Mai Tai. My table was all around the world and back. The egg rolls were good. Quite good, in fact, and were accompanied by a small bowl of pico de gallo and avocado cream. However, the egg rolls tasted and looked like something I could have popped in the microwave for three minutes. Presentation didn't scream gourmet to me. Now typically where The CF succeeds in spades is in the presentation of their entrees. The Chicken Bellagio did not disappoint. Lightly breaded chicken over basil pasta and topped with Parmesan cream sauce, prosciutto, and arugula salad. It looked delicious. It looked ready for me to show the efforts of all my knife and fork combination training. It looked ready.  It was ok.       The chicken, while wonderfully breaded, wasn't the most flavorful and the cream sauce was not as plentiful as it probably should have been. It was more of a hint of sauce than it was a layer over the pasta. That could have been the intention all along, I'm not sure. The arugula salad didn't do much to compliment the overall taste of the dish. I've heard great reviews on this meal, so I was a little surprised to come across this. Didn't end up being bad. It was just a little basic. The mai tai, even after stirring a little, didn't blend very well. The sweetness stayed at the top and the rum hung out with the ice when I got to the bottom. I may have needed to stir mor, but every good mai tai I have had, had that nice sweet and sour blend top to bottom.      A couple things I want to note: I wish that there was some manner or method to the madness to being able to control the herds that are waiting for a table. It clogs up the hostess area, the entryways to the tables, and the place where you can make purchases. I understand there's basically just standing room with a couple of benches, but when you have kids and the elderly coming through, not everyone is paying attention. Fact is, most folks think it's absolutely fine not getting out of the way. That's not Cheesecake Factory's fault. However, what is, is their lack of crowd control. Another thing, I really...really wish they would put the silverware on the napkin. Or something. I understand that the tables get cleaned and wiped down before they're put there, but that rag used... unless it's within their guidelines to use a fresh rag each and every time, then I'm going to need better.      Overall, for the pricing, there are better options. For taste, there are better options. They're not quite the fresh ingredient-using, gourmet restaurant that all advertisement claims to be. However, your appetite and eyes will be full by the time you leave. If you go, enjoy it. Part of any restaurant experience is also what you make of it. And I wish you well on your parking journey. I don't know if I have yet to be at a TCF that did not have a ""parking lot situation"" at almost any time of the day. I'll go back. But it won't ever be my idea to do so."
Richard T.,"Bonney Lake, WA",0,7,,1.0,8/1/2013,"Come here if you want to way 1 1/2 hrs - 2 hrs for your meal. And I kind of have the hunch that the original server that was helping us was actually sent home or fired in the middle of dinner service. This was a few months back, just now getting into Yelp."
Shannon H.,"Sammamish, WA",84,303,23,3.0,6/12/2012,"The bellevue location seems to have better food quality and better service.  Otherwise, this is your standard Cheesecake Factory.  Huge menu, millions of tables, 45 minute minimum wait on a weekend for dinner, 20 minutes for lunch on average.   Some of my favorite dishes are the Bruschetta appetizer, the Pasta Da Vinci and the Chicken Piccatta.  Warning: Do NOT look at the nutrition facts unless you are prepared for the waves of self-loathing and regret that will follow. Pluses: They recently released some new lower calorie entrees, and everyone should be able to find something they like, regardless of dietary restriction."
Nathan H.,"Seattle, WA",36,97,12,4.0,1/31/2012,"Honestly, I only come here for one thing.  One thing.   The Lemoncello Cake.  Seriously...it's amazing.  I have eaten here and the food is good but, not great.  It's a chain...what did you expect?  The desserts however...are off the hook.  And my wife and I are addicted to the Lemoncello cake.  Seriously....addicted. Lemoncake with Lemoncello frosting.  Whip Cream and slices of strawberry...not too sweet.  I am drooling right now thinking about it.  Might have to stop off on the way home and pick up a slice for after dinner.   This is a good place for groups but, it can get a little loud.  It is popular and I don't think they take reservations so come early or be prepared to wait.    OOOhhh....don't forget to try the lemoncello cake.  Seriously...try it...i dare you."
Bridgette S.,"Silverdale, WA",7,14,,2.0,10/29/2014,"Overwhelming from the start! The menu is so large it has ads and numbered pages no organization as to where they listed foods types i.e. (italian next to american next to chinese). Got two appetizers and they did not live up to the descriptions. The waitress took almost 10 minutes to let us know they were out of meatballs and the cooks hadn't started more. Got our food and it was way overcooked my medium was well done on the diane steak, best part was the potatoes. Waitress dropped a knife off the table next to us and almost stabbed my husband. Kept hoping the meal would get better but wasnt happening :("
Dembe N.,"Seattle, WA",212,355,5252,3.0,7/20/2014,"We enjoy seasonal salads but not the cheesecakes, not a cheesecake people. Love the Long Island tea and the salads, would recommend to try it, and have some Long Island - please do not drive afterwards!!!"
Randi L.,"Seattle, WA",36,142,52,4.0,7/31/2012,"This is a great place to go for lunch (as I have heard you can be waiting for over 60-minutes during the evening or weekends).  My friends and I had no problem being seated upon entering the establishment at 12-noon on a weekday. I go for their ""SkinnyLicious"" menu that has a plethora of items under 590 calories.  Salads, soups, sandwiches, pasta dishes.. the list goes on and on!  It's hard to find a place that is more of the ""chain"" variety restaurant that actually offers a decent portion of food, lower in calories and for a fair price. Staff is friendly and quick to please. + You can make reservations for parties over 6. + Complimentary bread basket is offered prior to taking your order. + When the weather is nice, you can soak up the sunshine out on their patio area. + They have  FULL bar (with plenty of seating as well as smaller side-tables for those who may want more privacy)."
Jera N.,"Scott Air Force Base, IL",116,11,3,2.0,3/2/2012,"The food is of the same quality as Crapplebee's, oh I mean Applebee's. I had the chicken piccata and it was awful. The chicken portion was so small even my friend across the table questioned if I received any chicken at all.  The angel hair was buttered to the max and very congealed. The lemon piccata sauce was cold and bland. I'm only giving it 2 stars because our server was wonderful  and the delicoius slice of lemon-raspberry cheesecake."
Danielle G.,"Puyallup, WA",14,33,22,2.0,1/13/2014,"We just had lunch here and my boyfriend ordered the sesame chicken and had to send it back and didn't end up eating anything else. The sauce was so salty and overpowering it was not good. We got dessert to go, strawberry cheese cake and carrot cake and that honestly was the best part of the trip. But server was nice and friendly."
Tasam A.,"Seattle, WA",41,11,,3.0,7/27/2014,The Cheesecake Factory has the best cakes ever!! The one in Southcenter is a little bit slow In service but I still love their food
Kayan H.,"Seattle, WA",13,584,4,1.0,7/5/2011,"While I am not a fan of cheesecake (yes, I know, I'm a sinner) I love your jambalaya and hot chocolate. Your salads and sandwiches are not bad either.  I would give you more stars; however, I had a HORRIFYING service experience at the Tukwila location a few weeks ago, so I had to drop it to 1 star only just to make a point.  I was one in a group of 12 ladies who waited almost 2 hours for a table, when we were told we would NOT wait more than 45 min. Why? Because your incompetent hostesses gave our table away. You gave us some free appetizers, though, so we forgave you.  Then, you swapped two entrees at the table: fish tacos to the chicken tacos lady, and vice versa. They sat at different ends of the table so they each sent them back without knowing. Well, fish taco recipient had taken a bite and had the flu. When the correct order arrived, new fish taco recipient saw a big old bite in her taco. Why?? Because the waiter didn't throw the entrees away when they got sent back. They just swapped them and brought it right back out. ISN'T THAT AGAINST SOME FDA FOOD SAFETY REGULATION?!?! I feel like somebody's food handler permit should be revoked for this. I mean, when my food comes, should I have to check for bite marks?!? Fail. Epic Fail."
Joanne J.,"Lakewood, WA",35,44,38,4.0,5/22/2014,Service was great and the food was delicious. We were seated within minutes and our server checked on us several times. They've improved from the last time I came here.
