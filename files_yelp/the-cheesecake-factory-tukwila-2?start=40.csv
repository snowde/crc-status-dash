J M.,"San Francisco, CA",4,115,192,5.0,4/10/2017,"I always try and stop at this Cheesecake Factory when I fly into SeaTac, as it's easy to stop here coming or going.  Their filet mignon is always prepared perfectly and is seasoned just right.  It comes with the best tasting mashed potatoes ever, and fresh green beans. I've had many of their menu choices over the years and I'm never disappointed. Service is usually pretty good too.  After all these years, I'm still partial to their passion iced tea, which is so much better than regular iced tea. And of course, what can you say about their cheesecake except that they're great."
David A.,"SeaTac, WA",0,3,1,5.0,3/12/2017,"My wife and I just left The Factory and we have to give our waitress, Monique C some major props! She is a very nice person; fairly new to the City from the Southside of Chicago and she brought a great personality and some real east-coast style from her hometown to our table. She gave us a great history lesson on Chicago and all its moving parts. Best wishes in Seattle! I'm certain that her Chi-town swag will take her to big-time places in the Great Northwest! Oh, the Spaghetti & Meatballs were 5 Star banging! I've been there many times and never tried the Spaghetti! It is Awesome Sauce!!! Thanks Again!"
Gloria T.,"Kent, WA",23,164,377,4.0,5/23/2017,"Best place for dessert! The menu is like an encyclopedia so it's hard to decide what to eat lol. I've tried burger, pasta, pizza, salad, steaks and multiple chicken dishes. Try almost everything on the small plate section. Nothing really stand out but nothing taste bad either. Some cheesecakes can be really sweet but then again...it is dessert. They don't take reservation so wait time can be long; especially on Friday and Saturday nights. Customer service is okay, can be slow sometimes."
Kevin S.,"Seattle, WA",542,71,,2.0,10/7/2017,Not really a fan of this place any more of the food's okay but who wants to wait in a line for a chain especially one that charges a $10 for a piece of cheesecake also they don't carry a kids menu or kids coloring crayons or anything for kids to do which makes no sense
Trina H.,"Renton, WA",2,45,14,5.0,6/3/2017,"I got a real reply, not an auto answer.  Thank you CCF for that. I hate calling a manager over to the table, but if we can be discreet. So I'm back.... and the lemon drop I ordered was fantastic. Got another one and that was even better. The two girls were Tiffany and Lucy our bartenders and Chenna, well she had all the right answers. Thanks CCF looks like bar stuff was taken care of.  BTW, presentation of the bar and napkin thing was really nice looking. Now the dinner we had.... freakin awesome! The service was spot on. Thanks much. Loved the place and I will tip accordingly!"
Amy J.,"Kent, WA",10,2,,1.0,10/10/2017,Horrible hostess service!!!  Seated a large party before ours...didn't provide accurate seating times and was unapologetic for the one and a half hours we had to wait.  Would not recommend this place!!!
Jencen R.,"Bellevue, WA",902,475,751,4.0,1/28/2016,"The food is a 5 star as long as you stay away from over salted pasta dishes.  Service is a 4, because our waitress gave us a normal menu at the bar during happy hour instead of the cheaper happy hour menu. She was fast to fill up our water glasses though.  The atmosphere here is a 3, since the restaurant really is too small for the dinner rush they get. Really really busy and loud, even at 5pm on a week night. Word to the wise: don't bother with a host if you are there for happy hour. Walk right to the bar or the talk circular bar tables, even if there are dirty plates on the table. They will clean it up and get you a menu quickly."
Gina H.,"Oakland, CA",270,295,854,1.0,8/10/2016,"I am writing a review for take out. Knowing this is a busy restaurant, I called and ordered my single piece of cheesecake ahead of time. I am REALLY frustrated! I went inside the restaurant, paid for my order and then waited forever, and ever AND EVER!!! Even after a reminder, I never imagined it would be a TWENTY-FIVE MINUTE WAIT when all I had to do was pay and pick up my singular piece of cheesecake.  Very disappointed."
Andre U.,"Daly City, CA",1,8,,2.0,12/1/2017,"The way the seats are they remind me of economy class airplane company. You can sit by people you don't know and listen to their conversation and steal their food no problem, they wouldn't even notice it."
Derek F.,"Bremerton, WA",39,62,35,5.0,10/9/2017,By far my favorite chain restaurant in the county. Wanna switch it up?? I dare you to order the veggie burger even if you're not a vegetarian. You'll be blown away it's so good. Have it with a Stella and a side of tartar.
Shonah M.,"Richmond, Canada",11,81,670,5.0,3/13/2016,"Have been to TCF several times over the past 10 years! Not sure what took so long for me to write a review - but last nights dinner had me wanting to share in words - all about it!  I have generally found TCF's to have a cool decor with lots of seating & a pleasant staff to serve you. I like the design & lighting - vibrant, welcoming & relaxing! Oh yeah - it was finally the day I got my -catfish! You see I've been requesting this dish for my last 4 visits & they were always sold out! Even tried ordering it downtown Seattle & Bellevue locations - no luck! Regardless I was still happy with my backup order but longed for the day I would finally get my catfish!!! We ordered the Southern Fried Catfish & Sheila's Chicken & Avocado Salad. These were the best 2 dishes I've had yet. I made it a point to always try a new dish every time I ate @ TCF. I started this 2 years ago always looking forward to something new to eat from the menu! Ok so back to the Catfish! It was so great! I've had Catfish at Sylvia's in Harlem & it was comparable - as in equal & delicious! The Chicken Avocado salad was the best salad I've had ever in awhile - a absolute must for salad lovers! The Citrus-Honey-Peanut Vinaigrette was awesome - I loved it!  We had the very refreshing Strawberry Lemonade to drink - always a delight! I've had a few of their other drinks - try any & all out on your next visit! It's been awhile since I finished off my plate at TCF! In fact I can only recall always going back to the hotel with a doggie bag! This was not one of those times! I ate everything on my plate!!! Now to cheesecake - we took to go - Salted Caramel & Vanilla Bean cheesecake. Yummy! I have tried the massive Sundae, Oreo Cheesecake, Mango Key Lime Cheesecake, Carrot Cake Cheesecake, & yes I love them all! A must try appetizer - Avocado Egg-rolls or Buffalo Wings(they are massive!)."
Linh N.,"Seattle, WA",100,206,265,2.0,12/7/2015,"Came here for dinner with my best friend a couple nights ago because he saw someone's dinner on fb and he wanted to come and get the same thing haha.  I'll start by saying, service was REALLY slow. We sat in the bar area thinking service would be fast and we instantly regretted our decision. He ordered a beer right as we sat down, which was a smart idea because his beer came out really quick and my drink ended up taking like 15min. Our server took forever to come around to get our order and the food and bread took even longer. I was really turned off by the service at this point, but because I hadn't eaten anything all day. I tried to remain patience.( it wasn't busy At ALL ). We both ordered the Spicy chicken Louisiana pasta? It was good but I should have stuck to my reg pasta. I swear I had more chicken than pasta and that's great for someone that loves protein, but for someone that loves carbs like me, I was kind of disappointed haha. My friend also ordered this apple crisp cheesecake and devoured the whole thing in 3 bites.  But seriously, I would have given this more stars if the service wasn't so slow. We were there at 8 and didn't leave till 11. That's too much time to be sitting at a restaurant when it takes like 15 minutes to eat."
Vicky T.,"Durham, NC",643,324,681,3.0,1/8/2017,"your basic pasta dishes for gathering, a little overpriced but it's alright"
Brooklyn L.,"Auburn, WA",58,30,44,3.0,1/28/2017,"We came for lunch on Saturday as it was packed inside. Luckily, the wait was only about 15 minutes. Fancy food but so overpriced, especially cheesecakes around $7-8 a slice. I ordered chicken parmesan with mashed potatoes. One of the best I've tasted! The green beans that came with it had a weird sweet aftertaste though. Also raspberry lemonade was super sweet that I had to share with others and dilute the flavor for lesser tense of sugar lol. Our waitress was very friendly when she helped us out on what to order at first. Salted caramel is absolutely amazing. You got to try it!"
Allison H.,"Gig Harbor, WA",3,5,,3.0,8/17/2017,"Great food, great service. It's awesome that they cater to vegans, but they snuck a little piece of bacon into my Vegan Cobb Salad."
Worldly F.,"Seattle, WA",2,22,5,3.0,8/9/2017,"Everytime I eat here, nomatter what I order, I get sick. Horrible flu stomach cramps and Hershey squirts. Y?? No idea. I come here to entertain ppl from out of town bc the menu is massive. So... Our waitress was in such a hurry, we ordered the potstickers app, I ordered my entree then my son ordered his. Bf my coworker even got a word in, she took off.  I have it 5 mins, then found another waitress and told her we still had one more entree to order. Took 10 mins b4 our original waitress came bk and finally took my co workers order. The best part about our experience was a gentlemen was introduced to our table, a server, who completely changed our experience. He was so friendly, he was Hispanic origin and that's the only way I remember him but was amazing). The rude waitress we had would have made me never come bk, but the gentlemen who took over changed it all.  Food was OK, our appetizer came out after the entrees and the potstickers were cold but we just reheated them at home. Good luck w your experience."
Harry S.,"Seattle, WA",1,19,19,4.0,6/5/2016,I used to go there pretty often. But they haven't been that good lately. I don't like any of their cakes. I would rather go to some bakery for that. The food is pretty good most of the times. Just don't get a take out..it's not worth the money.  The place is pretty busy most of the times so you might have to wait a long time.
John E.,"Seattle, WA",52,182,14,3.0,12/21/2016,"The menu is challenging the Bible for it's length.   Usually when a restaurant has a thousand items to choose from, you get a wide range of mediocrity. So I stick to the Bacon Because you can't go wrong wth 2 different bacons on one burger.    The rest I can skip."
Amy V.,"Seattle, WA",382,65,117,4.0,5/14/2016,"To be honest, the main reason why I come here often is to just eat the brown bread and butter. lol My love for carbs is super strong and never ending. I've been here multiple times and it always gets really busy during the weekends. Your best bet is to try and wait for a table in the bar area if you're over 21. My go-to dish would be the Bistro Shrimp Pasta! It has a very lemon garlic cream flavored sauce with mushrooms and shrimp! I've tried other pastas but it never satisfied me as much as this one.  Most of the time the service is good for me, there has been some off days but that's usually when the restaurant is super packed. When I am having serious carb cravings, this is where you will find me :]"
Onar B.,"Claremont, CA",68,20,2,1.0,8/5/2017,I came here with my family and there was 3 parties waiting before us and they let them eat and once it was our turn the manager came and said we can't take anymore parties because if a maintenance issue. We waiting for 45 min and being told they can't serve us because of a issue they are having and letting 3 parties go before me is complete BS. Guy was really rude.
