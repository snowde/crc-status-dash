Erin R.,"SAN PEDRO, CA",2,23,,4.0,1/14/2012,"I have been to loads of Cheesecake Factories by now. Living in 4 different states in major cities. I like them usually, but they would not be my first choice of restaurant when asked. Which is why I was pleasantly surprised at the Southcenter Mall location. We went on a packed Friday night, so we had the usual wait, but once we got seated we never felt that the waiters were super busy. We placed our drink and food orders promptly and our food arrived in perfect timing. Our drinks were refilled constantly and we never felt like we had to wait to get something. Compared to many Cheesecakes in the past, this one surpassed them all in terms of service. Bravo Tukwila! (I still don't know how to pronounce that!) The food was also good-It didn't taste like it had been sitting under a heat lamp or anything. My husband and I split the Louisiana chicken pasta and it was delicious! A first for both of us and we will for sure order it again. We split it so that we could get our own desserts and not spend a crapload. I got the Godiva cheesecake, my husband got the tiramisu. Both were yummy. I must say that I may suggest Cheesecake Factory for another dinner date in the near future!"
Gregg B.,"Auburn, WA",11,26,4,4.0,5/11/2014,"This place had changed!  I have been here three times in the last several years.  Previously the service was horrible, attitudes and just plain snooty!  My wife wanted to return today and it was great.  Service was great and friendly; I was glad to see the change.  Now I will return again.  If they keep it up they just might get five stars."
Barbara W.,"Seattle, WA",0,8,,4.0,8/16/2015,"Love the Cheesecake Factory!  The dinner menu is extensive with something for virtually everyone.  The problem with going to CF for dinner is the long wait for a table as they do not take reservations.  Truth is, it is worth the wait.  The great news is Sunday brunch is wonderful and there is rarely a wait for a table.  The wait staff is always friendly and accommodating.  The family favorites are the turkey burger (no bun, served in a lettuce wrap), garlic noodles and the four cheese pasta.  Substitution or modifications never seems to be a problem. Always an easy and comfortable place to dine."
Lanie M.,"Wahiawa, HI",70,8,8,5.0,7/5/2014,We went for my husbands birthday and enjoyed our meal. Food was delicious and our server (Rhonda) was great! We will definitely eat there again.
J B.,"Tacoma, WA",44,147,28,4.0,3/11/2014,"Not quite the same...taste...as the restaurants in Maryland and Northern Virginia however,  it eases my cravings for Miso Salmon with Brown Rice and Banana Cream Cheesecake.  Yummy then one must ensure that they hit the gym the following morning :-)"
Justin O.,"Federal Way, WA",13,188,43,3.0,7/29/2012,"OK  it is a chain restaurant and  the price for cheese cake is crazy. I tried something that I rarely see on a menu  a ground turkey burger with garlic mushrooms ,tomatoes ,lettuce and cheese  with a blue cheese spred . I liked the burger it was better than most I have had .the garlic taste made the turkey pop .the  fries that came with were better than any I have tasted . I saw salads on the menu but that prices seemed a bit much for a salad  I did take it to go so I cant tell about the service ."
Morgan L.,"Seattle, WA",198,587,835,3.0,5/17/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is the type of place that it doesn't matter how shitty the service is or how wonderful it is.  You can depend on the food being satisfactory, and they have something for everyone. I would compare them to Red Robin where they are pretty consistent from city to city. Tukwila isn't the best example of CF because the service isn't as nice, and the food isn't either- but it works. If you want to the full CF experience try the Bellevue location.  My favorite cheesecakes are: Chocolate Mousse or Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake."
Mrs M.,"Tacoma, WA",48,164,21,4.0,3/13/2012,Waiter was nice and polite and prompt.  Parking sucks. Food: Slim Menu Veggie burger...FANTASTIC.           Macaroni Burger.....Double FANTASTIC Cheese Sticks/ Triangles...FANTASTIC
Jenny K.,"Bellevue, WA",716,684,363,4.0,7/18/2011,"I have been going to The Cheesecake Factory for a really long time! I've been to at least 10 different locations in WA, Seattle and Colorado and each restaurant has similar decor. However, my experience with service and food quality has consistently been better at the downtown Seattle location versus the Southcenter location. Benefits of this location though are more parking and less wait time. My favorite entree here is the cobb salad and dessert is the choco cookie dough cheesecake. The seasonal pumpkin cheesecake also holds a dear place in my heart. I also love the complimentary bread, especially the honey wheat flavor. You won't be disappointed with whatever you order - Asian, Mexican, Italian or American. Nothing is the best dish you'll ever have but everything is usally pretty darn good. Southcenter location - please do more to ensure your food is fresher and service is better."
Vicky L.,"Seattle, WA",21,88,47,4.0,4/26/2011,"I am going to write about this place because it was where I first fell in love with salmon and mashed potatoes. And as mentioned on my Yelp profile on the side, this would be my last meal on Earth =D  The salmon is nicely cook as far as I can tell and there's a nice scoop of mashed potatoes on the side. And it's real potatoes too with some of the skin! Oh, and there's some asparagus which is nice but not needed. Lastly, spread all over is a lemony kind of sauce that enhances the overall taste of the meal. Mmmmm.... Most people may go there for the cheesecakes or their decent happy hour menu but I am there for the salmon and mashed potatoes. Yum!"
Karla A.,"Mobile, AL",58,89,83,4.0,1/14/2014,"After a trip to the Boeing Museum on my last day in town, My husband and I went to the Cheesecake Factory for a late lunch.  Although we thought it was casual, the decor reminded us of Las Vegas, very ornate.  Frances, our server, was busy handling another table, but sent someone to take our drink order and we started looking at the LARGE over 200 item menu.  It was a bit much for first timers but the Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip was a greater starter.  I had the Steak Diane & Herbed Salmon Combo and my husband has the Chicken Mederia.  Both were plated beautifully and very tasty.  Since I was celebrating my birthday, we decided on the Red Velvet Cheesecake. Frances offered to sing Happy Birthday and after a fun little Birthday banter, I declined the song and she brought out a piece of decorated cheesecake complete with a candle.  She was precious.  The food was delicious and the service excellent.  This will definitely be a regular stop for us when I am in town.  Yes, it is a bit chain like BUT the service tipped the scales for us.  I just wish they could cut back on the menu-it is quite large.  We had beers from the local brewery so I can't really comment on the Bartending Skills, although we do like to patronize Restaurants that support local breweries."
K T.,"Seattle, WA",0,124,1,2.0,7/4/2015,I will say in all honestly I am usually satisfied with Cheesecake Factory.  Not so much my recent visit and definitely not so much with their customer service.  Their 'crusted chicken romano' featured a couple of scraps of chicken hardly 'crusted'.  The pasta was all clumped together and topped with a tablespoon or two of sauce.  A waste.  An email to their corp office went completely unrecognized or answered.  Too many other choices to chance experiences like this.
William M.,"Seattle, WA",23,47,7,2.0,5/28/2013,"If it's the Cheesecake you are after by all means go here but if you want good flavorful food prepared with some sense of what a restaurant should be you are out of luck. I have never had more simple dishes made badly then here, it was all just reheated and not made fresh."
Dolly L.,"Tacoma, WA",2,7,28,2.0,2/24/2016,"I usually don't grade too harsh on places but I really felt like I had an unpleasant experience with my family and friends . I came on a Sunday so I expected it to be busy . After being told to it would be a 45 minute wait we were okay with it seeing that we can do a little shopping to past time by. I called within 30 minutes to see where my name was on the list since the pagers do not buzz anywhere further than the parking area around the restaurant. It turns out my name had been called and the hostess was nice and told us we will be next if we can come asap. Once arriving, we were seated within 5 min or so.. Our server didn't get to us until 10 minutes later . She dropped off some cold bread and ran off again for another 10 minutes. She came by asking for drinks and we all just wanted water . Once she came back we asked for warmer bread and to place our orders. She seem annoyed at our request and gave us a rude remark saying well I'll do by best what you get is what we have... The food came out it was okay...nothing special. When the server was taking away a few dishes she spilled water all over my friend . Seemed to be somewhat apologetic but more annoyed again. When I asked for a togo box the servers usually box the food but she just dropped the box off and took some plates and walked away . When we were finished we had asked for our bill and she wandered off for another good 10 minutes before getting our checks split. Once she ran our cards for the bill to be closed is when she started acting all nice. Never again ."
Rich C.,"Puyallup, WA",9,103,1,2.0,5/6/2014,"Skip the curbside is all I can tell you. I called 30 minutes before going over there and then sat 7 minutes on hold in my spot at curbside and then another 7 minutes waiting for the person working curbside to bring my meal out and get my bill paid. I ended up paying $12.00 for my lunch and it was soggy, greasy, and cold. I'm glad it was a gift card because otherwise I'd be upset about dropping the equivalent of 3 gallons of gas on a crappy lunch!"
David H.,"Bellevue, WA",0,99,,4.0,3/1/2014,"The food was very good and I'm not generally a big fan of standard American type cuisine. I've never had anything from the menu that I didn't like. The cheesecake was very rich and flavorful and there was a ton to choose from, definitely worth taking a piece home. The staff, including the GM, was very friendly. They do get super busy though, so plan to wait to be seated. Overall, a great experience and great food."
Nicholas G.,"Tacoma, WA",0,16,5,4.0,6/9/2014,Great great food.. yes the wait time sometimes does suck but o well its a great restaurant in the area of Tukwila. .
James M.,"Spanaway, WA",52,123,44,3.0,10/1/2013,"Our waiter made us feel very uncomfortable the two minutes we saw him.   He didn't want to wait on us and he made that very clear.  The food was ok,  The food portions was big,  and the price of the mail was good.  The restaurant  was busy, but could use a little cleaning.  The two three stars if for the food.   (We didn't see Penny, I'm not sure she really works there.)"
Jason B.,"Renton, WA",0,89,14,4.0,2/3/2014,"It's not bad. The cheesecake selection is amazing, and every time I've gotten a slice it's been awesome. The food is decent. The wait can be long depending on the day/time."
Akili P.,"Seattle, WA",412,205,56,3.0,1/31/2013,"It was completely slammed in here!  And you could tell by how long we had to wait to get seated!  An hour and a half to be exact!!!  But, that's not really what bothered me.  Once we were seated the wait lasted even longer.  My double Bloody Mary was done POORLY.  But, that's typical if  you haven't read some of my reviews about other places.  Here's the kicker here though, we place an order (and there's only 6 of us) and the order comes out just horrible.  My little nephew (Peanut) is with me as well, and you can sense that he is getting temperment with the crazy wait as well.  After multiple tries of getting our order right, I then start to think to myself that for now on it's probably best if I just bring my own bottle of vodka with me when I come to establishments like this!"
