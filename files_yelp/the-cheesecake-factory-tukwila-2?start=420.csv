Mandy C.,"Fremont, Seattle, WA",393,355,199,3.0,5/26/2011,"Came here on a last minute lunch date with a couple friends. Fortunately, our waiter was on point, friendly and got to us quickly. We ended up ordering from the LUNCH MENU, wherein I decided to order the LUNCH, SOUP & SALAD ($8.95). It came with bread and butter, a salad, and soup of the day (LENTIL SOUP).  The serving size was actually quite perfect. I opted to not eat as much bread, which was fortunate, because even with eating minimal bread, the soup and salad quantity got me pretty full. Other than that, nothing super great. But not half as bad either.  Not to mention, if you click on the link below, it'll lead you to a PRINTABLE COUPON to get a free slice of cheesecake if you spend over $30. Coupon expires in June. Just a little tidbit for anyone that reads this in time. :P "
Brittany S.,"Renton, WA",60,44,9,2.0,5/31/2013,"Food was good, I got the sun dried chicken fettuccine and it was enjoyable. However the service was absolutely TERRIBLE our waitress was rude and unprofessional. When I arrived I asked the host if there were seats in the bar and she pointed over and said, in the lower section and I pointed and asked her right there? She rolled her eyes and nodded. When I went to sit down the waitress said I could sit there and the hostess would seat me, so I told her that the hostess told me to sit here. She then came back with menus and proceeded to tell me ""in the future this is not bar seating and you need to wait to be seated"" as I again said that the hostess told me to sit here and she again rudely said ""no you just walked away without waiting for the hostess"" I found this to be very unprofessional."
Alyssa M.,"Auburn, WA",1,50,18,3.0,3/29/2014,"Its good, staffs nice its usually a good 25-45 min wait (for dinner) drinks are okay, foods okay huge menu that's kinda over whelming for 2 people its was $115 so its very pricey in some peoples opinion the best thing is obviously, the cheese cake your better off just getting the cake then anything else (if your trying not to spend over $30-$45)"
Tarah M.,"Seattle, WA",62,201,19,3.0,4/17/2011,"I'm not gonna lie: I really wanted to give this place 2 stars.  When I was invited to dinner, I thought to myself, ""You're going to despise this place because their food is frozen, it's not a local establishment, and their processed dishes will just make you blow up like the Michelin (wo)man with all that sodium and preservatives.""  But, as I arrived predetermined to write a scathing review of this place, I surprised myself as the night progressed at how decent this place is.  Let me explain with first the bad and end with the good. BAD: This place is a zoo!!  A Friday evening with 4 starving people (myself included) started with a bubbly teenage host telling me it was about a 45 min wait.  As she handed us the buzzer, I thought that surely we could find another place to go.  But, we waited and watched as more people stuffed themselves in the lobby waiting with the same pained looks on their faces as we did.  However, we lucked out after 10 minutes at scoping out a cocktail table in the bar that we attacked like vultures when a couple left..others weren't so lucky.  ALSO BAD: Their food choices are plenty and fill about 10 pages of menu...but be wary if you don't eat meat, as there are very few vegetarian meals offered. I also noticed that their dishes aren't very healthful, and the abundant portions they provide just whisper calorie overload. Sometimes, I do think that less is more with high quality in ingredients.  I just think the focus here is more on quantity, which I don't really prefer when evaluating the 2 ""Qs."" With that said, how could there be anything good at this place? Here's how: GOOD: Considering the limited choices and heavy meal choices, I was able to select a delectable salad with substitutions, and the waitress accommodated my request with no problem.  I was also able to save half of my salad as leftovers because my dressing was served on the side and I enjoyed it the very next day.  Also, the chopped vegetable salad I had was fresh, perfectly made, and very good!  We did splurge on the cheesecake, which we had the mango key lime as well as the red velvet, and it was well worth the splurge! They obviously know how to make their cheesecakes. REALLY GOOD: The service was wonderful!  Considering this place was a zoo, and there were plenty of diners as well as staff, this place was efficiently run and all the staff appeared to be patient, friendly, and helpful!  Our waitress was really nice and attentive, and I didn't expect this at this type of restaurant. I normally wouldn't eat here, but I certainly had a great experience.  A-OK to me."
Ian Y.,"Vancouver, Canada",29,65,677,3.0,9/28/2013,Food was not as good as Bellevue location.  The same pasta dish lacked garlic here.  Flavours weren't as robust.
Sarah B.,"Spokane, WA",109,24,25,3.0,8/26/2013,"I LOVE their food......it's why I go back. But everytime I'm at this particular Cheesecake Factory, the service is never great. Slow, seemed annoyed with us, extremely busy......maybe they don't have enough help? Not sure. Just never that pleased for the money."
Zulkiffly S.,"Seattle, WA",102,96,2,3.0,2/2/2011,"This place really disappoints me. Let me explain. I really love their Hot-wings. The sauce is so good. But. . . They never cook the chicken all the way through. The first time I ordered it, it was perfect. The chicken was cook just right. But the next time I went it was red inside. It took a bite of the first one and it was bloody. I thought to myself that maybe it was just that one piece. I tried not to let it bother me and went for another piece. Once again it was red. Now I'm irritated. 2 out of 8 piece are bloody so far. Went for a third one. And, you guessed it, bloody. I told the waiter, he took it back and said sorry. He asked if I wanted a new batch. I said no. I still had the taste of chicken blood in my mouth. I didn't want to get any chicken at the time.  That was the first time. . .  I went back again about a month later. Ordered the Hot-wings again. Came out half cooked. I told the waitress, she said sorry and didn't take it back. The supervisor came over and told us that the chicken is cooked fresh so it's hard to cook it all the way through, so bloody is ok. (made no sense to me.) Now I'm upset. He made an excuse for his chefs bad work. I couldn't understand how you could serve half cooked food to your customers. They never took the Hot-wings back and even charged us for it. What a donkey's hole.  Overall this happened 4 times. Every time I ordered it I was hoping that this was the time they would cook it right, like they did the first time. But nope.  Enough of that.  Overall though, the place is a good place to take a girlfriend. The food is decent, just don't order the wings. ( unless you're a vampire ) The atmosphere is romantic. Dark with dim lights. The tables are big, so you don't feel like you have to keep you elbows in. The drinks are decent. Everything is decent. . .  I'm going back one more time, if they suck again I will be taking off some stars."
Alexander S.,"Calabasas, CA",0,8,,5.0,4/3/2015,"Fantastic food, and some of the best customer service I have ever received. There is an older lady who's a server, named Dee, who is one of the most pleasant people I've ever met. Best service and best food out of any Cheesecake Factory in WA."
Kay P.,"San Diego, CA",58,47,2,2.0,9/23/2011,"Went the Friday of Labor Day Weekend... It was ok. Not very impressed with the service, or noise level. I guess i COULD chalk it up to it being a holiday weekend, but with all of the times ive been to other locations on holidays and such, its never this annoying, Im pretty used to the experience that I always have in San Diego, and in Willow Grove, PA where they simply and politely, do their job i guess.  Ordered my standard drink, the Rasberry Lemonade, and ordered appetizers - Avocado egg rolls and fried Mac and Cheese. The boyfriend ordered the Strawberry Lemonade, and we split the appetizers, which are ALWAYS GOOD. When the waitress came to ask if we were going to order entrees, even though i had told her before hand that we would only have appetizers, I found it a bit pushy, especially in the way she did it. I mean, if im hungry, ill order more right? But im good right now, thank you....and yes, im STILL good after you come and ask me the same thing for the third time. How about you just get me the check please? Ya. Ill do the curbside to go from this location next time. Food is great, as always. Pushy waitresses? Not so much."
Jamie A.,"Anchorage, AK",3,10,3,5.0,11/13/2014,"We happened to be in Renton Washington for a business trip and decided to go to the mall came across to cheesecake factory wanted to try it because we don't have that in Alaska the wait was terribly long as it was dinner time and waited for about an hour to get seated. Once seated we were waited on immediately by the most friendliest and efficient waiter named Walter. (he got the 20% tip). I had the steak Diane with shrimp scampi and thoroughly loved the flavors, husband had the spicy shrimp but was not too impressed and not what he expected. The Tweens had pizza and cheese macaroni burger which they loved and sister in law had the lettuce tacos (can't remember what it was called) but she absolutely loved it. Finally brother in law had the all American burger and loved it as well. The portions were generous and food was brought out hot. The cheesecake was the best ever! Ordered the Dulche de leche and should have bought the entire cake vs a piece! I do hope this restaurant decides to open here in Alaska! We'd be there very often as would the rest of Alaska. We appreciate great food and great service!"
Debbie B.,"Maple Valley, WA",66,14,,5.0,3/13/2012,"Yum, yum, yum!  I don't think I have ever been to a Cheesecake Factory at any point and not LOVED what I ordered!  Their portions are large so be prepared for a doggy bag or you can share with someone else. The cheesecake slices are out of this world!  I have my favorite but sometimes I'll try another flavor and they're all great!  The menu has so many choices so you can find something that will fit whatever kind of food you're in the mood for!   The ambience is awesome with such beautiful interior design and lighting.  It is a hopping and busy place so be prepared for a wait, especially if you go on a weekend.  The wait staff is awesome and its definitely worth going to."
Christine N.,"Spokane, WA",2,31,9,3.0,11/1/2011,"Full disclosure: I haven't actually tried their cheesecake. It must be good. I mean, cheesecake is in their restaurant title so... I had a veggieburger. It was giant and delicious. The only thing is that the patty is bright red. Seriously: bright red. It looks like raw ground chuck. Um, more than a little disconcerting. Cheesecake Factory makes their own veggieburgers, and the red color comes from beets, which get my seal of approval. I just couldn't really look at the burger as I ate.  Also, they gave us a ton of complimentary bread and butter. Like whoa."
Elizabeth B.,"Seattle, WA",177,150,2,4.0,7/25/2011,"Yum yum yum!  I can never get tired of this place! This visit happened to be for my niece's 12th birthday, which happened to land on a Friday.  Yes, of all nights... we went to Cheesecake Factory on a Friday evening AFTER 5 with a party of over 30 guests!  We waited nearly an hour for our table, which surprisingly wasn't bad at all.  We had 2 waiters for both ends of our long table.  They were even nice enough to add an extra table of 4 on as we had more guest arriving. I been very fond of the flavored Mojitos lately and I gave the Pomegranate Mojito a try.  Still on the minty side, so I highly doubt I'll be having that again... and totally not worth $9! As for entrees, nothing sounded too appealing to me, so I went back to the old Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken.  But I did ask for half spinach fettuccine.  When I got my entree, it was weird to see full sized fettuccine as well as linguini noodles (which happened to be the regular and spinach).  Overall, it was still good and I was happy that they were able to accommodate to my request as they haven't been able to do it all other visits. When it came time to bring out my niece's birthday cake, they made a huge scene singing aloud.  And since it was a small 8"" round cake that needed to be cut in certain sizes just to have enough to go around for our group, I was able to cut the cake and the waiters passed out the slices to the rest of the guests. Overall, I think they did a great job accommodating to our huge party.  Although, I wouldn't recommend doing that large of a group on a Friday evening again."
Bill T.,"Seattle, WA",4,12,,3.0,2/13/2014,Food is a bit greasy. The service was great though. I can't stand the lighting though! Too dim for me
Rose B.,"Seattle, WA",36,372,29,3.0,4/22/2011,Drinks were awesome. I had the Flying Gorilla. It was a shake with alcohol. Basically the best thing ever invented.  We had the crab artichoke dip. It was mediocre. They gave us 5 break pieces for it. We had a poor dip to break ratio.  I ordered a kind of complicated salad. They did a good job with it. My boyfriend got the chicken thai noodle dish. It was a little bland.
Stacey D.,"Seattle, WA",120,42,281,1.0,4/7/2011,"I came in on Friday night and I must say this is one of my worse experience here. I ordered a pomegranate mojito to start off with and it was way too sweet (I believed they added too much syrup and not enough pomegranate juice). For dinner, I ordered the grilled chicken medallions and it was also very disappointing. The chicken was bland and dry and the vegetables was overcooked. The server was very attentive in the beginning, but never came back to check up on us after the food have arrived and took forever to give us the bill.  I've been to The Cheesecake Factory a couple of times before, but after this horrible experience I probably won't come back."
Janielle L.,"Everett, WA",8,12,17,1.0,11/11/2010,"Most disgusting restaurant ever, that is really all I have to say... but I'll continue: I really can't understand why people like these kinds of places.  The food is probably pre-packed and frozen and all they do is heat it up for you when you order it.  It's basically a glorified tv dinner. I had a chicken sandwich and salad.  The salad was not fresh and I could have had a better chicken sandwich at jack in the box. Oh yeah, and the service is horrible."
J M.,"Renton, WA",0,29,1,3.0,1/14/2014,"It's with a heavy heart that I give this place 3 out of 5 stars, but that's not because of the food let me assure you.  I've been here multiple times for many different occasions and about a third of my visits the server got my order right because I had him verify it but the food was wrong (how is that even possible?). But I have had experiences here where everything was perfect (I think the problem may be they need to lay off some of the incompetent ones). The food here is great and one of the best for a sit down restaurant chain! Buffalo blasts, anyone? My favorite meal is the fettuccine Alfredo with sun dried tomatoes! I'm open to giving them more stars contingent upon future visits that are great like times I've had here before."
Sam L.,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",678,482,1418,3.0,3/12/2013,"I had brunch here recently with 7 friends. I was already familiar with their large menu. It was still a daunting task to order from so many selections. The service was very good. The food didn't take long to arrive. Everyone liked what they ordered though some were confused as to the size of the portion they ordered. Regardless, it was all very tasty. The prices were moderate. This is a very large restaurant with lots of hard surfaces and a very diverse clientele. It can get rather loud if you're trying to have a conversation. The parking lot seems to be always full. So arrive early if you're trying to get a space near the restaurant. Otherwise, prepare to rely on luck to find a close in spot or prepare for a walk."
Scot K.,"Bellevue, WA",10,262,,2.0,4/5/2010,"Health Department Alert!!! Here's where you need to be warned.  We were waiting by the counter for the deserts.  There was a middle aged woman behind the counter preparing the various cakes and pies for the wait staff to serve.  She wasn't wearing gloves like the rest of the prep staff and she had a blue cover over one of her fingers, which I assume was bandaged.  She would touch the tops of the plates and use her bare finger to spruce up the whipped cream.   That's not the worst part.  She then grabbed a broom and began sweeping the floor.  She finished that, then without washing her hands or putting on gloves started preparing more deserts touching the plates and the various pies, cheesecakes and whipped cream for service to the diners.  Yuck!  Needless to say, no one in our group ordered any deserts.  She noticed that we had been watching her, so without washing her hands, she put on some gloves. The place was really busy for a Saturday at 5:30.  It must have been all the mall shoppers or maybe early Easter revelers.  We had to wait about 30 minutes to get a seat. As far as the food goes, its a chain restaurant and it was decent.  We went to have a decent meal and a variety of deserts.  But we really lost our desire to have any after watching the preparation. With all of the heightened awareness of hepatitis, E Coli, salmonella and a plethora of food borne illnesses, you would think management would vigrously train the staff to maintain high sanitary standards. I can't recommend this place and doubt that I will return."
