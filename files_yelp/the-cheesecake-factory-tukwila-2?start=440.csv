Shirley C.,"Seattle, WA",19,100,,3.0,4/5/2011,"Not bad, not awesome. Give or take. It's always crowded here on the weekends. I guess it's the 'perfect' dinner date after shopping at southcenter?! The food is consistent and decent. It doesn't ""wow"" me but it isn't bad either. It is fairly expensive, though. I believe burger/fries is $10, Pasta is $12-15.  Cheesecake is around $7 per slice - depending on what you choose. The servers/waiters are usually friendly and attentive to their customers. The only thing I truly dislike about this restaurant is the noise level (they can't help it if there are screaming babies surrounding the restaurant) and dimmed lights. It's super dark in the restaurant and I guess it is one of their tactics (you can't see how much you're eating?) But honestly. Awkward if you're eating dinner with a guy/girl friend and all the sudden the lights start to dim around 7 or 8pm. Their strawberry lemonade is delicious topped with sugar rimmed around the cup."
Bill G.,"Puyallup, WA",8,61,,3.0,12/5/2010,A little more $$ than it warrants.  The menu is so big that yull need some time to read and reread because yull ferget what was on page 1! It's OK - big crowds - long wait - lot's of other choices. My last recommendation split everything - other wise yer gonna get fat eating here!
Douglas K.,"Belleville, IL",74,495,138,4.0,1/8/2013,"I am a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory.  Their food is always good, the servers are always polite, and the cooks will always split your food in half so can have a normal size meal on your plate and a take home portion that is perfect for lunch the next day.  They will even do it with their cheesecake.  They make eating out a pleasure and I am always happy when I leave."
Marigene C.,"Seattle, WA",2,54,,2.0,5/12/2012,6 of us ladies met for lunch..nothing we ordered was anything to write home about.I had the chopped salad and it was rather tasteless....nothing cheap either.non of us were pleased with the food...:0(
Andrew L.,"Renton, WA",147,96,10,4.0,10/28/2012,Food here is good. Menu hasent changed much int he past few years. Service is usually good. They have padio seating that is awesome on a nice day. Red velvet Cheesecake is to DIE for.
Kevin S.,"Seattle, WA",1,49,,5.0,9/9/2013,One of my favorites! I have never had an issue with this place The food is great get the wild mushroom burger wow! the only downer is that it can get really busy thus for sometimes slow service.
Amanda G.,"Tacoma, WA",51,14,,3.0,8/26/2013,"I am extremely disappointed in their weekend reservations policy!! I called to make a reservation for 13 people, but on Saturdays they don't take reservations. When I got there, they said it would be an hour and a half wait, even after calling and giving a heads up. Basically, they took a reservation when I got there, but not over the phone?? Management should make an exception for large groups!  On a positive note, food was great and service was great. The only complaint from one of my guests was that they paid $20 for their meal, and she was very unsatisfied. She would have told the waiter but he was too busy. I'll be coming back, but staying away when I want to go with a group of friends."
Lexie K.,"Kent, WA",3,17,5,4.0,6/8/2013,Pricy but Amazing! Service was a little slow but nice. You will be a very happy fat full kid when leaving here. The menu lacks a lot of information about what is all coming on your plate but staff is helpful. Save this place for a splurge night not fun to go here on budget.
Bill N.,"Auburn, WA",35,263,,4.0,11/18/2010,The menu is huge.   How can they make that much stuff fresh.  It just doesn't seem possible.  They must use some frozen stuff that they just heat up.   But.....the stuff we had was all pretty good. I had the best vietnamese sandwich I ever had.  Meg had a pretty good steak.  Joe had some chinese orange chicken that was OK but must have been frozen and reheated.  He liked it but couldn't eat it all because he ate so much bread while waiting for our food.  Jess had some 4 cheese pasta that was good but he also had the too much bread problem.    I don't like going to chains but I can't find a good reason why I shouldn't go back here.   A couple of picky things- I hate cold foil wrapped butter for the bread and I also don't like glass ketchup bottles.  Why do restaurants think that glass is classier even though plastic is technologically and functionally superior.
Lei L.,"Renton, WA",58,107,24,4.0,1/27/2013,Their menu is overwhelming but I'm glad they came out with their Skinnylicious menu. I always order their lettuce wrap tacos with my Passion Fruit Mojito. Always a good time coming here. Service is great and the cheesecakes are well made. But what keeps me going back here really is their mojitos!!
Corey G.,"West Richland, WA",100,1545,1642,2.0,12/6/2009,"* HEY, it's a chain.  * HEY, it's packed with a long wait (we waited 60min 23sec--I clocked it!) * HEY, the women in our group felt our female server was mean (I thought otherwise, but I'm always a sweetheart to the servers *wink, wink*). * And HEY, they totally gaffled the Da Vinci Pasta!  Where were the caramelized onions, son!?!?  That's why we came here! I had a decent cocktail, and a decent meal, which I can't seem to recall.  It was frigidly cold in the dining area (I almost needed a St. Bernard with a whisky flask around her neck).  All in all I'd give this place just a touch below average = 2.5-stars.  If you're a chain restaurant, YOU HAVE TO BLOW MY SOX OFF  to set yourself apart."
Ed M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",27,48,78,3.0,12/11/2010,I had the Shepherd's Pie and it was good. The lunch portion is big enough for two people to share. The sour dough bread was really good also.
Ponnnn P.,"Seattle, WA",3,19,12,4.0,7/26/2014,awesome place to take the kids for pasta. love the ambiance! my son and I love the cesar salad.
Kellie M.,"Seattle, WA",34,318,11,4.0,9/27/2012,"Good place to stop for lunch after shopping. Extensive menu, reasonably priced food, lots of available parking."
Janice Marie B.,"Waipahu, HI",555,15,153,4.0,6/16/2012,"Visited on Monday, June 11th.  I went with my cousin, niece and nephew.  We chose Cheesecake Factory Southcenter Mall because we went shopping at South Center Mall or else we usually go to Bellevue. We walked in at noon and was seated right away without having to wait - Thats the best thing considering there is a waiting list by the hours at Waikiki Hawaii's location. The service was exceptional as always but it took the 2nd round for the server to get us the warm bread basket. I ordered the Lunch Portion Chicken Picatta and it was a fresher & better butter lemon capers sauce than my fave place Paesano's.  My niece had her usual Lunch Portion Chicken Fettucini which is always a winner.  My cousin had the Lunch Portion meatloaf and she thought it was so - so, nothing spectacular about it.  My nephew had the regular shrimp platter and that too was just alright. Half way through lunch you get full because of two rounds of the wheat bread basket that you have to take home the leftovers.  We also did take out on the Red Velvet Cheesecake which was worth the drive down to South Center Mall from Lynnwood & Mulkilteo.  Although we were all too full to have a bite of the cheesecake, I'm pretty sure it was as awesome as if you tasted it before. Other than that, I'm always a fan of The Cheesecake Factory!"
Annie L.,"Renton, WA",11,109,39,4.0,12/19/2012,"The food was excellent!  I took 1 star off for the 2 hour wait.     I had the buffalo wings, gumbo soup, sweet potato fries, and mexican salad from the skinny menu.  To my surprise the food was delicious!  Even the wheat bread was yummy. However, the red velvet cheesecake was not impressive at all.  It was very heavy and buttery.  I can actually taste the chunk of butter.  I would not go there for their Cheesecake.  How ironic.  The service was good.  The waiter was very attentive. I first tried their location in Long Island NY and were impressed with their food.  I'm glad I gave it a second chance.  I've been craving for their food the very next day!"
Allan-ester D.,"Vancouver, Canada",59,611,28,4.0,3/10/2012,"Cheesecake is consistently good, nice service, great selection, reasonably priced...that's why there is always a line up for this place"
Sherry S.,"Seattle, WA",13,82,528,4.0,8/9/2010,"This is usually my go-to place when I want something American-ish but aren't sure what exactly. The fact that they have such a HUGE selection is awesome. Sometimes the wait is super long but if you're not THAT hungry and have friends to pass time with then it's not so bad.  I've had a range of service here from horrible to excellent. I guess it really just depends on the day and who you get.  I'm usually happy with the food I get at TCF... USUALLY.  List of things I've had here:  *Buffalo Blasts: Loove the crispiness of the wrapper. Can get a bit greasy sometimes but I personally love this. Tasty! Love the kick of this. *Crispy Crab Wontons: Not bad... I would get it again. I love almost anything with cream cheese but it can get nauseating. *Fettucini with Chicken and Sun-dried tomatoes: This was probably the first dish I had at TCF. Used to be my favorite... now it's so-so. Love the creaminess of it though so if you're craving alfredo-type-like pasta this isn't a bad choice. The sun-dried tomatoes add a good tang to it.  *Louisiana Chicken Pasta: The name speaks for itself. I do feel like I'm in New Orleans when I'm eating this dish. I actually like the parmesan crusted chicken in this even though it's greasier. hehehe oops *Evelyn's Favorite Pasta: Eh... Don't recommend it unless you like dry pasta... at least when I had it, it was pretty dry... However, I guess it is pretty for the eyes :) *Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic: MMM Used to be one of my favorites but the past few times I've had it, it's been just alright. Good if you're craving a garlic-parmesan type of pasta. *Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta: YUCK. No Thanks!  *Cajun Jambalaya Pasta: eh... a lot of people seem to like this dish but I just happen to NOT be a fan of it.. it's alright... but I wouldn't get it again. It does taste very cajun though. *Pasta Bellagio: This was okay to me... not bad... not great but good. I found it to be a bit salty though but maybe that was 'cause of the prosciutto  *Salisbury Steak: YUCK! No flavor - a waste of effort to eat. lol *White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake: Mmmm this is BOMB in your mouth ... delicious and creamy. I love it *Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake: Delicious! SUPER RICH and Chocolatey - Must be a chocolate lover to like! Overall- Not a bad place to go for lunch or dinner (haven't tried breakfast), also great for birthday dinners and celebrations __________ UPDATED 6/2/2017 Moving up to 4 stars from my last review years ago.  After eating at TCF for years, I could probably conclude that this is my favorite chain restaurant for many reasons. Their menu is huge so options are endless and there is something for everyone. Every time I eat at TCF, I tell myself that I'll try something new but always end up sticking with my usual: Farfalle w/ Chicken and Roasted Garlic (Sub farfalle w/ linguine)  Creamy Garlicky Goodness!!"
Karen T.,"Seattle, WA",3,4,,2.0,3/16/2013,"My boyfriend and I went for lunch at the Cheesecake factory and  I  love the cheesecake factory.  I was totally bragging.  But, I've only been to the downtown  Seattle restaurant.  The Southcenter is not up to the normal standards of Cheesecake factory.  I was embarrassed for talking the place up.  My salad was wilted and lacked ....ummm?  Well, chicken, blackbeans and avocado.   Totally  unimpressed!!  Drinks were nasty!  I will not be returning..."
Carla J.,"Seattle, WA",374,208,175,3.0,7/13/2009,"My tribe was out! We where looking for an adventure that wouldn't break the bank! It is so beautiful inside, the decor was exquisite!  Sunday near noon we where seated immediately, in a booth next to the bar. Our server was a bartender, and very knowledgeable. I had been but Mr., lil Miss and Master Jr hadn't been. The menu is OVERWHELMING!!! Seriously, there are over 100 choices not including the drinks and desserts!! OMG!!! Everytime (3times) I go I order the same thing, Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps. Mr. ordered the Joe's Special, lil Miss ~ Fish & Chips and Master Jr ordered the Cheese Steak Sandwich. We tried a small plate appetizer some sausage on mashed potato... I ordered a Classic Mojito, it was WAY TOO SWEET. Mr. had 2 Bloody Mary's. Food was 2 stars, service made it taste better REALLY wonderful, THUS the 3rd star.  ITS A CHAIN CORPORATE RESTAURANT, and I prefer the Ma' & Pa joints...My tribe reacts like suckers for glitter & glam spots....SOOOOOOOOOOO... I guess my review is kind-of-a back handed compliment..."
