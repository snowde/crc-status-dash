Michelle E.,"Issaquah, WA",60,50,26,3.0,11/10/2007,"I gave the downtown Cheesecake Factory 4 stars, but this one only 3.  The food was good, the service was great... but the location?  Well not the location exactly but the inside of the building, I didn't care for as much.  The downtown Factory is intimate... where as this one is too wide open and not as cozy.  It was just like rows and rows of seating. Oh, and our server seemed a little robotic, but she still did a good job. Be wary of going around noon or 1pm.  We got there early, but by the time we left, the wait was ridiculous."
Misty M.,"Tacoma, WA",45,144,5,2.0,12/27/2009,"I'm no chain food snob, if the food is good I tend to eat it. It's not like I was terribly disappointed considering I wasn't expecting much, but geeze, when your chicken tastes like cardboard it reminds me why I avoid meat as much as possible. The service was fine, the wait was moderate (though we didn't go at a peak time.) I just can't get past the food. It was no where near worth what they charged for it.  I had the Navajo, it's a sandwich with my old standbys avocado, chicken, mayo and something else I don't remember. The fry bread it was served on was incredibly delicious, everything else was just cardboard status or overly salted (the chicken.) The sandwich the person I was with had suffered the same problem, but without the delicious bread to make up for it."
Marie B.,"Tacoma, WA",0,37,,3.0,11/23/2012,"well, the cheesecake was great, love the lemon raspberry, however even if lunch was cheep, it tasted that way. the server was great, he was on top of drinks and making sure everything was great. We will go back, just wish lunch was better, next time we will go for dinner and see if it was just an off day. have heard so many great things, and it is true what we've heard on the cakes, yummy!"
Rod P.,"Renton, WA",0,6,,1.0,4/16/2013,"On Sunday, April 14th, we were invited to attend a friends birthday celebration at the Cheesecake Factory in Tukwila, Wa. My friend had called ahead to inquire about getting reservations as we had a party consisting of nine people. She was told ""The Cheesecake factory does not accept reservations. Just show up and place your name on the wait list."" OK, no problem. We all arrived at about 4:30 and proceeded to place our name on the wait list at which time we were told by hostess that because we had such a large party that she would have to check with the manager first. Uh...weren't we told to just show up and place our name on the list? After standing around for 15 minutes wondering if we had been forgotten, the hostess returns and tells us that they would be able to accommodate our party, but that, ""it would be an hour and fifteen minute wait."" If you check on their website it states, ""We are able to easily accommodate large parties"" Really!? Exactly how was our experience accommodating?  Now mind you that it was Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was exceptionally slow that day. Yes, there were people milling about waiting for a table, but not the normal, people-stepping-on your-toes-line-outside-the-door type of busy. The decision was made to go elsewhere rather than wait for more than an hour just to be seated. The funny thing was that when my friend posted her displeasure on The Cheesecake Factory, they immediately took down her comments. I guess they don't want anyone to critique their restaurant. You would think that they would welcome feedback in order to help improve their customer relations. We will never go back to the Cheesecake Factory again as a result of this horrible experience. There are much better places to dine at that are more than happy to accommodate us and who serve much better food."
Neil E.,"Auburn, WA",13,14,8,4.0,9/27/2012,"The wait to get seated is typically a little longer than most, but it's only because it is a popular place. The interior finishes are nice and is kept very clean. The only part of the atmosphere that is kind of a drag is the noise level. The wait staff is always polite and knowledgeable. The speed of food service is just ok, but is offset by the quality of food. Overall, it's worth a 17-20% tip to the staff."
Melissa R.,"Tacoma, WA",0,11,6,3.0,1/24/2011,"Heard great things about Cheesecake Factory. My first experience was anything but... My chicken and biscuits were bland. No flavor what-so-ever. Stale/spongey biscuits. Tasteless, unseasoned chicken. The gravy tasted like water and flour. Waste of calories and carbs!  Thankfully the cheesecake made up for it somewhat and earned this review the third star.  I'd go back for dessert- but that's it."
Erin B.,"Seattle, WA",7,64,49,2.0,8/10/2009,"The food was good, the cheesecake was good.  The servers need a serious attitude check. Our server was actually pretty nice, I think we had the only guy server in the entire place; the rest of the servers that we saw were catty, unprofessional whiners. You are *working* in a restaurant! You're not on *vacation* in Hawaii!  Everything was fine until we were leaving, when we walked through the corridor through the bar area to get to the door.  We walked past what  I only assume was the bleach-blonde Alpha-B*tch of the restaurant, who glared at us and then made a dramatic swoop against the railing to let us past and then started yelling at us ""oh, I'm sooooo sorry, oh, no, please, it's TOTALLY my fault I was in your way, oh PLEASE excuse me, wait, let me get out of your way, oh I'm sooooooooo sorry"" like the queen of the (PMS) universe, while the rest of the pack cackled along. Apparently the corridor was the preferred route for the servers, and they just couldn't *believe* that CUSTOMERS would DARE walk through there.  I'm pretty sure that after we walked out the door she pulled down her pants and marked her territory all the way down that walkway.  WOW.  I definitely will NOT be returning to the Southcenter Cheesecake Factory, and I'm going to think twice about going into any of the others too.  The food was pretty good, but there are far better (non-chain) restaurants with servers who aren't so unprofessional and who don't have delusions of grandeur."
Jeff K.,"Seattle, WA",41,110,6,1.0,8/8/2010,"They should stop inspecting Safeco Field, Qwest Field and whatever other ballparks. My friend ordered a Kobe burger and there was a blond hair. If you started reading again, well, they were gracious enough to serve another burger and take it off the tab. My own BLT salad was very very very meh. Service was good considering the situation."
Mike C.,"Fort Sill, OK",159,149,60,4.0,7/31/2012,Love this place. Can't beat the steak Diane and tiramisu cheesecake!
nicole b.,"Renton, WA",0,8,,1.0,1/25/2014,I was told the booth wasn't available but it was available to a caucasian couple that entered after us.
Di A.,"Marysville, WA",1,31,12,4.0,8/28/2010,"I went there last night (Friday) with a friend and my 5 month old baby. We were there during the dinner rush so the wait was about half an hour. We didn't mind the wait because my friend was from out of town and so we were catching up. Also, the weather was quite decent outside, so we hung outside for a little bit.  My little one needed a diaper change so we headed for the bathrooms. I was very surprised to see that there was a family bathroom! That was a plus.  We were seated at a nice booth with a window. Our server Priscilla was really nice and attentive. My drink was always filled. I had the strawberry lemonade. I think it was like 4.50 or something but it was bottomless. I got my $ worth by having them refill that sucker up.  I ordered the Chicken Fettuccine with sun dried tomatoes. It  was VERY delish. I was impressed and surprised. The serving was huge. I  should have asked if they can do a half order. During our meal, there was a switch in servers. The next server was so-so, but still nice.  Overall, experience was good. I have had mediocre dining experiences at the downtown location."
Pablo G.,"Seattle, WA",48,157,3,2.0,8/23/2010,"Up and down and run and stop and nice shirt, that's quite a bit of gel on that hair and yeah, dude, wow, amazing, whoa!!! talk about a hyperactive waiter on emerald downs steroids...  this guy apparently just got off the bus and came straight from NYC (he'll tell ya) all about it, forget about it, can you please just stfu for a second and get my drinks? pretty please? My steak was chewy - 1 star Steamed spinach was hyper salted -1 star aside from that I must be fair, service was ok 1 star why was I going to give them one more star? why?...... Ah! of course. Parking 1 Star"
A M.,"Snohomish, WA",0,15,,3.0,6/8/2014,Food is good but the service was terrible and slow. Waited 20 minutes before our order was taken and even longer for our food to come.
Cristina L.,"Los Alamitos, CA",129,437,67,3.0,9/4/2011,The food here is usually hit rather than miss. We enjoyed a nice evening  though the place was a zoo with the amount of people on a holiday weekend. Our server managed to be extremely attentive.
Lauren S.,"Tacoma, WA",82,26,18,1.0,5/30/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory needs a military discount.....we asked our waitperson and he was quick to respond with ""no"", one word unpatriotic! When the Factory implements a military discount, I will give them more stars."
Yvonne D.,"Seattle, WA",23,248,81,2.0,5/25/2011,"I don't want to call myself a food snob, but I'm begining to think I am.... I went in here with a bunch of my friends....by a bunch I mean 3, so the four of us have three different pasta dishes, the drinks...were ... ok. The service was not bad at all, average, not exceptional, but not rude or unattentive or anything, so average. Anyway, the dessert was pretty GOOD, I love the cheesecake (cheesecake factory DUH! ) anyway...the food....I don't know where to begin with the food.... It is soooo bad... just salty...not much flavor going on at all..I had the creamy pasta with shrimp...couldn't taste the shrimp, all I taste was the cream, butter, and salt...."
Onyx R.,"Seattle, WA",6,15,,2.0,3/22/2011,"The cheesecake factory has one of the best Happy hour menu's . Their stuffed mushrooms are a must have, their chicken sliders are great and fulfilling and they have some of the best calamari . You certainly get a lot for your money as the portions are large and many of the items on the Happy Hour menu are about $5. They offer great drink specials as well. I've been to a few different locations for dinner but the staff at this location  just happens to be awful every time. I love the cheese cake factory but I try to stay away from the down town Seattle location because the attitude of the staff is just not the same as other locations.  The Dinner and lunch menu are fairly reasonable as well. So find your local Cheesecake factory and check it out. .. And may I recommend the pineapple upside-down cheesecake? It is sooo very yummy!"
Jolene D.,"Houston, TX",258,163,172,4.0,3/18/2012,"Ordered a pizza here. Of course their cheesecake is delicious! When I went to the one in Seattle I ordered a veggie burger and the peppermint bark cheesecake. At least that's what I think the cheesecake is called. If you like mint and chocolate together I suggest you gotta try it.  Their fried foods are not very greasy and dripping in oil like most places. The spring rolls are average, I don't think you should order Asian food from a place like the Cheesecake Factory though. You should stick to an authentic Asian restaurant. So come to Cheesecake Factory if you don't mind spending a little extra money. It's worth it, I think."
Phil S.,"Auburn, WA",12,154,8,3.0,6/4/2009,"We have a ton of family in town this weekend and we chose to eat at a place that was near where everyone was staying, so we chose the cheesecake factory. This place is good, not amazing.  The pros are that there is an enormous menu, which I guess you could also view as a con. They don't really specialize in anything (aside from cheesecake).. you can get Mexican, Italian, Salads, whatever your heart can dream up they probably have it on their menu. It took our big group forever to make a decision on what to eat. One other good thing is that we didn't have reservation and getting a party of greater than 10 in there was no big deal (On a Wednesday evening granted).  The food was pretty good. I has spicy cashew chicken, which tasted pretty good, though I have certainly had better Asian dishes like that.  In the end we all shared a couple of pieces of various cheesecakes which were very very good. My favorite is their white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. Highly recommended.  All in all, if you are near southcenter mall this place is as good as any, maybe a cut above. Recommended for large groups with varying tastes."
Erik L.,"Puyallup, WA",9,8,3,4.0,8/25/2010,"The family decided to try this location out on a Saturday night. Since my father has never eaten at the Cheesecake before we thought it would be a cool experience for him. First of all I was a little wary because naturally there was a huge Line since it was a Saturday. But we asked for the first available table and were sat outside which was great since it had been a sunny day, and we only waited 15 minutes. On to the food. The menu is crazy huge! Almost three pages dedicated just to appetizers and salads! My brother and I ordered the crab won ton appetizer, Ahh-mazing! For the main course I ordered the chipotle pasta which is also really good and something worthy of getting the recipe down and making at home. My father surprisingly ordered some breakfast platter which looked pretty hearty and healthy. There was some minor hiccups in service though. First was when everybody ordered their drinks. My step mom and brother both ordered their cocktails first and received them pretty quick. But when I finally ordered my long island I waited like 25 min. only waiting for the waitress to tell me that some how my drink got lost or pick upped by someone for another table. Second, we ordered our appetizers and received our main course's like no more than ten minutes later, so we had like a million plates on the table to navigate. Lastly when my Dad checked the bill and they charged us for the first Long Island I never received. Overall, good experience despite the minor hiccups which I just attribute to an off day. Great service, even better cheesecake(best I've ever had) .Cool environment and nice place to take the family every once in awhile. The quality of the food is solid; I definitely recommend."
