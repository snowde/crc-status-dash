Suzanne N.,"Gig Harbor, WA",45,130,80,2.0,7/11/2013,"I love the Cheese Cake Factory, but I'm going to give them 2 stars at this location as the service was not so good.  Our service looked like Borat impersonator and he was not very attentive.  I ordered the Ahi appetizer and then Chicken Penne Pasta.  I was a little concerned when the appetizer came out with my other friend's entree and my entree was missing.  Instead I received 2 appetizers, the Ahi and Chicken Potstickers.  A server came out to bring the food and she was very confused.  She caught our waiter and I could see them talking and she said it wasn't what I ordered and when he realized that I'd ordered and entree and not two appetizers, he just threw his head back like ""oooohh"".  He walked by a couple of times without saying anything then just said ""we'll get that right out for you"".  No explanation what so ever.  Granted, yes, it was obviously a mistake, but it also could've been that the server just grabbed a wrong plate and mine was in the back.  He brought my food out after my friends were already almost done.  He wasn't too apologetic and he continued to tend to other tables and ignore us.  The food was good, but service was not good and not anything I've experienced at the Seattle or Bellevue Cheesecake Factories."
Kris P.,"San Diego, CA",48,172,74,4.0,1/2/2012,"We went back for lunch, yesterday.... and it was a GREAT experience.  This place was pretty swamped, but we were seated fairly fast.  Our waitress was slammed with all packed tables, but she kept on top of everything for us.  Our refills were prompt.  Our food was brought out without a long wait.  And, they were really fresh & left us with a great overall experience."
Kyle T.,"Normandy Park, WA",3,171,,4.0,2/12/2012,"All right a little defense for CF here.  I know a lot of folks don't like cheesecake factory for one reason or another, but i gotta say...at the tukwilla branch they make a damn fine burger.  there are not many restaurants that make a good thick patty burger cooked the way you ask.  every time I get a burger here i am pleased. bbq. mushroom, you name it never a bad burger yet.   Service is always solid too, ""could I get some blue cheese crumbles please""...moments later there it is at no extra charge. Just anticipate the long waits on weekend regardless of time."
Laurie H.,"Barstow, CA",17,15,,3.0,9/11/2011,The food was really good! I got the chicken baja tacos. They were a really good size portion. The cheese cake was super rich. Three of us shared a piece and I am glad we did.
Stin S.,"Renton, WA",0,31,5,5.0,7/15/2012,I have never eaten a bad dish from the Cheesecake Factory in Tukwilla. I've tried about half the items on the menu and have loved every single one of them. My all time favorites are the Bang Bang Chicken and Kahlua Cheesecake. The Chicken Bellagio and Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake follows close behind.
Richard B.,"Lynden, WA",0,17,,1.0,7/10/2011,I ordered their garlic pasta and it was so SALTY!.  I am giving this particular Cheesecake Factory a one. I have eatten at others and eat this same dish and it was wonderful.
Mark N.,"Alvin, TX",0,10,,1.0,9/30/2012,The restaurant was extremely noisy. The food was so-so. My wife had hot tea. She was asked if she wanted another glass of hot water for tea. They brought the hot water but wanted to charge her $2.95 for one more teabag. This restaurant is not at the usual high quality level of the cheesecake factories that we've eaten at around the country.
Sarah O.,"Bellevue, WA",97,31,46,1.0,12/24/2011,"Horrible waiter period!!! Get a new job, if you don't like your job!!! Seriously I swear im paying for your paycheck and you're gonna be rude to ME? Seriously you mut be out of your mind!!! Fix this please "" store manager"" please!!!"
Kim P.,"Tacoma, WA",169,509,42,4.0,2/24/2011,"I tend to shy away from major chain restaurants but I will have to say that the Cheesecake Factory never fails me, it can just be soooo busy sometimes that I don't even attempt to go! Not this time:) My mother in law is in town for work and staying in downtown Seattle and we live in Tacoma so we figured Southcenter would be a fair spot to meet. My daughter picked the Cheesecake Factory over Bahama Breeze, go figure!!! To our surprise, no line! YAY, we were starving too.... Our server was GREAT!!! Good attitude and very helpful with the menu selection. My mother in law ordered the Luau Salad based on his recommendations and she LOVED it and I ordered the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad, DEELICIOUS!!!! My daugther was a little disappointed with her kids chicken quesadilla but I think she's just spoiled, we normally split a dish but I was craving a salad... it helped make room for her to devour her Red Velvet Cheesecake though!!! Only downside was that I ordered the seasonal cheesecake which is a mango, key lime cheesecake,( I asked the server what it all entailed and he said it was just like the key lime but with a layer of mango)   and I normally order the key lime and I LOVE mango, so I figured it was a MATCH:( WRONG.... I ordered it togo and once we got home and I took the 1st biteI realized the bottom crust has a layer of shredded coconut!!! I am allergic to coconut:( booooooo........ Yes, it SUCKS being allergic to coconut, so my daughter scored and got a little extra dessert and more for tonight. P.S. why does it have to be so dark in that dang place??? just wondering~"
C C.,"Salem, OR",3,331,66,4.0,12/2/2011,"Since it was my first visit to the cheesecake factory, I'm only reviewing what I had at lunch. I had the veggie beet burger & it was very good! I never eat at corporate restaurants. My friend really wanted to eat at the cheesecake factory. I just went along. Very crowded, long wait for a table & loud. All in all I'd go back for the veggie burger."
Jeremy H.,"Albany, OR",22,11,1,4.0,2/17/2012,"We ate lunch here before leaving for home.  The food and the service was great.  It was, however, a little on the expensive side for a lunch.  Of all the many good looking dishes offered on their menu, we opted for a cheeseburger and chicken fingers.  Our food was nice and hot and tasted good.  We were full after eating our meal that we got our cheesecake to go.  About an hour down the road we enjoyed our dessert, which was also very good."
AJ M.,"Seattle, WA",17,138,125,1.0,12/30/2010,"Definately not worth the wait! After 45 minutes we were seated. The wait started all over again for our service. The restaurant was busy and LOUD. A conversation with person at your own table was difficult to say the least. I ordered the Hibachi steak for $19.95, Rare to Medium Rare. It arrived Medium-Well and DRY. We started noticing a trend. The person who seated us and took our drink order was different then the person who brought them. And this trend continued as it appeared to be with a different person each time. So requesting anything seemed to initiate the hour glass being turned freshly over each time. Upon dessert time we asked how large the slices of cheese cake were. We were advised, ""Oh they're big. One slice is large enough to easily feed two people."" So much time had elapsed we decided to take the cheesecake to go. Upon arriving home and looking forward to our desserts we were amazed to find our waitress's idea of 'big' is not what the rest of the common world would think of it as. The slices were of average size. About the same size, if not a slight bit smaller, then the slices in the precut frozen cheesecakes at costco. For two adults and two small children our bill came to $75.41 (No alcohol). A very sad disappointment in food quality and taste."
Mary M.,"Seattle, WA",138,313,7,5.0,3/12/2011,Amazing first experience on a late Friday night meal. Pasta was perfectly cooked and extra saucy just how I like it and the cheesecake for dessert was phenomenal as always. I just hope its always consistent.
Keith S.,"DuPont, WA",67,8,,4.0,4/15/2012,I have eaten numerous times at the Cheesecake Factory and I am never disappointed!  I will order different things from the menu all the time and each new item is just as good as the last.  For the money this restaurant is the best bang for the buck!  Wait time is a pain but the food and service is really good.  You will go other places and spend more money and not have as good of a meal as the Cheesecake factory!  Not to mention the Cheesecake!  I recommend the Steak Diane and the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake.
bernis m.,"Seattle, WA",0,39,,1.0,9/12/2010,"I have never had so much ass with my meal as I did at this Cheesecake Factory. Ass, ass and more ass. The damn tables are so close together here, that every time a person from a table next to you gets up, or gets into their seat, they have to do one of those sideways, ""pardon my ass"" moves. Damn, it is so gnarly. Here I am trying to enjoy a piece of bread and butter before my meal, and.... ASS! I try and enjoy my wine and conversation, and..... ASS. Appetizer and ASS, entree and ASS, dessert and ASS. ASS ASS ASS ASS! Now, don't get me wrong, I like some ass now and then.... I just don't like it while I eat dinner. I will have to pASS."
Mollie T.,"Kent, WA",8,50,,3.0,1/24/2009,"Came to the Cheese Cake factory after an early movie today.  We arrived a little over an hour aftre they open and there was already a wait.  Since it was just me and one of my girls our wait was only around 15 mins. We were on a little bit of a time crunch since my friend had to be at work an hour from when we sat down.  We opted for no alcohol and just got cokes.  She had the sliders and I went with one of there specials, Carmel Chicken.  Our waiter also asked if we wanted bread and we said sure. Our bread didnt come out for almost 20 mins and then when our food came I had a chicken plate that didn't match the description off the menu.  After figuring out the waiter put the wrong thing in I waited another 15mins for my  actually dish.   All in all it was an okay experience.  I have eaten here a few times and never been overly impressed but its not a bad place to go for drinks."
Klint K.,"Renton, WA",88,34,3,2.0,12/5/2011,"Nothing makes me crazier than spending $3.50 on a drink only to have a glass of ice sit in front of me for most of the meal.  Four of us ordered the same thing (diet coke). I asked for a pitcher at the table so we could fill our own glasses, but they weren't willing to do this."
Kelly V.,"Ames, IA",38,57,,4.0,2/15/2009,"Not really much to say that other people haven't said. The food comes in the amount of ""lots""...the water and soda are always kept full, the food is good, the price isn't that bad, and if you go in at 11am you get seated IMMEDIATELY!  I've eaten here a few times and today was probably the best. Why?  1) Got in right away (go at 11am for lunch...)  2) Was on a date with my wife  3) We just got appetizers (Texas wrap thinggies and Lettuce Wraps)  4) It was free (we had a gift card).  Why not 5 stars? It's just not ""outstanding"" like some places are. This doesn't mean I wouldn't come back...it's just I won't make a habit out of it."
Hunter O.,"Murfreesboro, TN",41,375,43,3.0,7/17/2013,yelp loud crazy people all over the place.. the avocodo egg rolls still rock thats about all i like here other than the chesse cake..
Shelby W.,"Renton, WA",793,109,53,3.0,1/2/2013,"Every time I come here all I can think is how much money they're making. 90% of the time you have to wait before being seated. I remember leaving once and seeing over 50 people waiting to be seated. They must be doing something right here. Surprisingly we were able to be seated right away. I ended up getting the macaroni and cheese burger. As far as burgers go I think it's the best they have.It's a regular burger with a fried macaroni and cheese patty put in the burger. When you bite into it and taste that nice gooey mac and cheese mixed with the patty there's just nothing like it. I would've given this visit a 4 but our waiter by the name of Colin decided it was ok to try and rush us out because he said he had paperwork to do. We were more than obliged to leave since it was Christmas Eve and getting late. But then when he brought back the bill he just had to say it again and then he said ""if you could just sign that really quick so I could get to my paperwork"". We were like ok dude we get the point you have paperwork to do. Then when he comes back for the signed receipts he says and I quote ""yeah I just really need to get to this paperwork guys thanks"". It was just overkill and my friend was like dude I get it you have paperwork you didn't need to say it again. Aside from the whole paperwork incident everything was fine. I almost forgot that my friend and I shared a Strawberry Cheesecake on different plates of course. It was absolutely divine. I would highly recommend it."
