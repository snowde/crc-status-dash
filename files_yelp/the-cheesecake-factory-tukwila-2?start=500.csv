Jeremy M.,"Seattle, WA",298,340,5,3.0,9/24/2009,"Surprisingly this place still maintains a relatively decent lunch crowd. We came here for a late lunch(1:30) and was told there's a 15 minute wait for a table otherwise there's self seating at the bar.  After we were seated our waitress was quick to come by to take our drink order which to me is a good sign of being attentative. We ordered:  Corn fry fritter- I thought was okay, but my girlfriend liked it. Herb Crusted Salmon- Girlfriends order(bit too strong of a smell for me!) Cashew Chicken Salad- Way too much fried wonton wrapper, but still ok.  For a lunch break this place might possibly be a great choice given their level of occupancy at a relatively cheaper price."
APRIL H.,"Seattle, WA",19,23,6,5.0,10/2/2011,"The Hibachi steak is the best, and wait the pasta is so freaking fresh and to die for I had the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and hubby had the fettuccine with sun dried tomato and chicken. Man o man it was so fresh and filling I will absolutely be going back."
Elizabeth S.,"Kent, WA",126,12,20,4.0,8/3/2011,"The avocado egg rolls are amazing! I get them everytime I come. The chicken Bellagio is also really good. I LOVE cheesecake, so this place is heaven to me... though I don't like that recently they are incorporating a lot of cake layers into their cheesecake. Cake should never contaminate cheesecake!"
Chanelle A.,"Waianae, HI",40,30,189,1.0,1/29/2013,"We'd never been to the Cheesecake Factory in our home state, so we decided to check this one out during our stay in Seattle. From the outside and your initial impression upon walking in the door is, ""WOW."" The decor, the bar, the cheesecake! But as soon as you are seated and handed a menu, you've got about 12 pages to look at! My boyfriend and I kinda flipped through the menu, back and forth, and forth and back... but we were dumbfounded. I had to stop our server as she delivered our drinks and explained this was our very first visit to a Cheesecake Factory. She eagerly explained that they had over 200 dishes to choose from. 200?!?!?! WTH? I'm a pretty indecisive person and if you give me too many options, I'd rather not choose at all. Since I heard how people love this place, I figured I'd try something. So, what do I do? I opt to choose from the ""small plate"" page and selected 2 dishes. It was the only thing I could do. I felt way too overwhelmed and with that many dishes offered, is everything really fresh? I think this chain needs to take a cue from Chef Ramsay's show, Nightmare Kitchens, and simplify their menu. I don't think I will ever go back to a Cheesecake Factory again."
Autumn M.,"Lacey, WA",20,39,1,4.0,4/27/2011,"Great food, fast service! Menu can be overwhelming because so many items. Downside,  there can be long wait to get a table depending on when you go."
Robert M.,"Seattle, WA",0,4,,1.0,7/5/2012,"My gf and I just recently ate here, the food was good but that was it. The place was freezing cold. We had to wait 20 mins for the table and 45+ mins for our food. They had a shift change while we were eating and our waiter introduced our new waitress to us and informed me, my gf and the new waitress that we were going to receive complimentary cheese cakes because we had to wait so long for our food. When our new waitress handed us the dessert menu she said rudely ""these are comp'd, I don't know why"". After we were handed the desserts she gave us our check and only 1 of the 2 desserts were comp'd. We kindly pointed this out to her and she got all pissy, snatched the check and stormed off. Overall I would choose to call in and pick it up before dealing with the long wait and bad service."
Brandy P.,"Federal Way, WA",0,6,2,5.0,3/8/2012,I went here and got a steak Diane..and it was to DIE for!!! Plus the mashed potatoes were hella bomb!
Tori J.,"Seattle, WA",14,252,,3.0,5/3/2010,"Yeah so, they forgot one order.  Four people ordered and three plates came up. I could tell they forgot because the waitress panicked when she realized we were waiting for plate numero qautro.  qautra? It was my dad's but I'm a female speaking. Whatever -those romantic languages are kind of weird with their genders for everything.  Anyhow. I shared my delicious Kobe Burger, my sister shared hers, and my other sister shared her orange chicken. Dad was not starving. It was all good.  Even if that was an obnoxious mistake.  I love this place and so do my sisters.  Dessert arrives for birthday girl, I go and order a cheesecake to go , to save time. Cue sarcastic laughter.  I pay. I wait ten minutes. I track down the person and ask how long it usually takes because I'd never bought one before. Some guy piped up he ordered on the phone and they said it would be ready half an hour ago. Yikes. They took care of him and I tried to get another person's attention. Apparently they just have to get it out of the freezer. The second person I tracked down conveyed a message in the third person...while the woman I placed the order with was within two feet. Aw, they were like a really dsyfunctional family. Adapting to work around the bad habits and non participation of other employees. It was really sweet, in an annoying and unhelpful way.    Finally got the message what I paid for was out of stock. Whatever, it's okay. Nobody wanted to pay twenty something bucks for an oreo cheesecake anyway - even if it was birthday girl's favorite. We pick another and  person two blanches at my receipt. She charged me for a bigger cheesecake(I checked the posted prices), but the guy behind the counter didn't want to admit it so we just got ours quicker.  And I- having spent over half an hour trying to buy something they could reach into a freezer and grab ( In theory. If that cheesecake existed - this story is starting to get metaphysical. You know they're incompetent if you start doubting what you know about reality) was on a schedule so I ate the extra cost and left. In retrospect, every time I've ordered a cheese cake ( last times it was slices) they have been out. Then I ordered something else, but they aren't keeping track of their cheesecake...at the cheesecake factory. It makes you want to hold your head in both hands and sigh. The cheesecake itself can make you forget all the mess ups.   The menu is like a teen magazine and a little ridiculous to most adults.  But the food and the decor is great. I like bright, pretty places. Hey- I'll even settle for pretty in a blindingly flashy vegas way. So I guess that will keep me coming back."
Veronica S.,"Seattle, WA",105,122,18,2.0,7/7/2008,"What do you get if you super-sized Applebee's, and put it in a large cheesy (ahem, pun intended) structure? Yes! the Cheesecake Factory! How does so little inspiration result in a 1"" thick menu? I'll never know. The soft warm wheat bread is good though."
YJ ..,"Kent, WA",0,88,5,3.0,8/6/2013,"Food was decent but it always seems to be busy with long wait times. Also, at night time they need to turn on some lights. Could barely read the menu the last time I went in and had to use the iPhones flashlight for myself and a few others I was with. Maybe it'll get better...?"
Amanda A.,"Seattle, WA",0,18,,4.0,10/9/2013,I ordered the chile relleno sampler and it was sooo amazing. For my main order I got the mushroom burger and it was very good it melts in your mouth.
Eric K.,"Mukilteo, WA",73,20,,2.0,12/1/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is, by default, our to go spot when it comes to large group dinners. First time visiting the SC location. Disappointed by the outcome of my entree - how do you dry out  pasta? Louisiana Chicken Pasta tasted chalky. The chicken was somehow dry, and the bottom side of EACH piece had the breading cut off; note that Bellevue gives you nice strips of chicken. This particular location falls short, unfortunately. Waiter was decent. Food was mediocre. Kitchen staff needs some revamping."
Jacky A.,"Seattle, WA",85,92,39,3.0,8/25/2010,"Waited 20 mins for the table, but 60 mins for food..  within the hour, our friends have already chatted what we needed to chat, drink all our water and already falling asleep, since we sit in about 8:30 and we were starving... but well, when the food came, the pasta kinda stick together and cold... but my friend's steak are fresh... i dont really understand that point by the time... shouldnt they finish up the steak then the pasta? will that be a better way to serve fresh food to one table? well, at least, when we are finished on our food, the manager came by and said sorry, then we got our dessert for free, which is a good enough service recovery action... but yea, we cant finish out pasta since it stick together.. so... yea.... overall.... 3 stars, 1 star goes to the service recovery ;)"
T.J. S.,"Renton, WA",16,29,,3.0,6/29/2008,"The joint is more like a foundry than a factory and it has to do with the portion size!  We started with our usual inoculations against botulism.  Pina Colada and a Pomegranate Mojito.  Ordered up a nice guacamole dip that was supposedly spiced to hot but tasted devoid of all heat.  After placing orders we took in the scenery.  Lots of people, lots of tacky art deco, and oh....lots of people.  It was a deafening roar and I had to ask and be asked to repeat parts of our conversations. The service:  Actually really good.  The service was seamless and even though our current server went off shift there was a good change over and the new server never missed a beat.  The food came out on time, well plated (for a factory) and it tasted good! I had the Bang-Bang Chicken & Shrimp.  It had a decent flavor but I longed for a bit more of a hit of curry as the dish promised.  But other than that no complaints.  The wife and son had a B.L.T. Salad and a Pulled B.B.Q Pork Sandwich, respectively.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal just fine but none of us were able to finish.  What we noticed was the portions were extremely generous and to finish would seem a gluttonous affair. Doggie bags all around the bill came with some damage but not anything out of the ordinary.  I did tip well and genuinely thanked our server.  He did an outstanding job for the venue.  If you're looking to have food served up foundry style, let the Cheesecake Factory pour the industrial portions like a cement truck pouring a foundation.  Plus you'll have tomorrows lunch ready to go in a cute little bag!  Woof!"
Gregory M.,"Everett, WA",11,322,43,5.0,1/27/2009,"I took my hungry family here, and they all loved it. The place is large, and it was packed when we arrived. Regardless we were seated almost immediately. Our server was prompt, attentive, and helpful (in spite of the fact that he also had a table of eight people next to us).  The food - OMG the food is awesome. It ain't cheap, but it's really really good. We had a lot of fun reading the calorie counter menu and making jokes about heart attacks, and then we went and ordered this rich, heavy food and chowed down on it and enjoyed every bite. This is a good place to stop in and have a nice relaxing dinner. Maybe bring ear muffs if you don't like it loud, and definitely bring a light and glasses if you're over forty because the lights are dim at night and the menu print is small. But who cares when the food is this good! Yippee! Burp!"
Bobby B.,"San Diego, CA",17,37,7,4.0,7/6/2011,"Its the Factory. There the same everywhere, and thus far al good. Busy but good service."
Liane D.,"Puyallup, WA",2,13,,4.0,6/19/2011,"The food was excellent. If that's all that counted for a review, I would be giving it a five; however, there were things that was okay. It was too big, so it was too loud for my liking. It was also very crowded. The service was okay, of course, I understand that they were busy because there were too many customers."
Jian Pang G.,"Seattle, WA",0,20,,4.0,10/16/2013,"I had the chipotle chicken pasta, it was amazingly good. Not too spicy and great. I still really wish they could turn the light a bit up. I know I had a little problem reading the menu lol."
Daniel W.,"Vancouver, WA",42,61,1,3.0,5/21/2013,"The chicken Carbonara was very tasty...I am a big fan of the sweetened Mint Ice Tea.  The waitress was very friendly and always made sure that my drink was refilled regularly.  It was busy during lunch but we were able to get a seat fast, ordered our food and there were no complaints.  An overall good experience.  The prices were a bit high."
Erin W.,"Seattle, WA",141,122,1,3.0,1/28/2013,"I don't get it. My aunt wanted to come here for her birthday, so we arrived around noon on a Saturday. Forty minute wait. Seriously? We waited and were seated at a sticky table. The menu was sealed shut with old food, and even skipping the three pages that needed prying to open, there was still too much to choose from. Our waitress was very non-committal when I asked for a recommendation (""I like everything here!"") and I settled on a pasta dish that could have been served as a family-style entree. The food was good--not great--and then the waitress disappeared. Another waitress came by about thirty minutes later and offered to box up our food, but no mention where the first waitress went (my guess? She is lost somewhere in the menu still). I paid the bill and we left. The wait and the hassle of the parking here for mediocre service and overpriced food means that I'll only be back next year, for Aunt Bobbi's birthday."
