B. Art W.,"Oceanside, CA",3,25,4,4.0,1/16/2011,"Cool, this place is nice, I liked the design, food is so good, customer service is so good, try the Salmon with herbs."
R J.,"Seattle, WA",1,55,1,3.0,4/9/2009,"The only reason I went here was because of their chocolate coconut cream cheesecake, which is absolutely amazing. I have been to the others as well, Bellevue and Seattle, and found this one to be not up to par. That is, up to par with the standards of service. The food overall isn't the best but can be a nice place to go to with the family.  Service in Tukwila was very to the point and unwelcoming, just didn't appreciate that. Favorite part was dessert. I would recommend going to either Bellevue or Seattle where the service tends to be a lot more professional for the type of atmosphere that the cheesecake factory is trying to uphold."
Dave K.,"Auburn, WA",1,80,2,4.0,6/8/2010,Deeelish! I had Steak Diane w/mashed 'taters! Try the new Mango Key Lime Cheesecake! Well worth the price $55 for two! No wonder they're crowded!
Naomi A.,"Tumwater, WA",6,54,1,3.0,11/25/2008,"The food is decent. Never had any problems, everything I've had has been fine, and the serving staff usually excellent - but this location is just WAY too crowded at peak times. And I have plenty of experience eating in LA, so I have been to some packed restaurants in my day! The location by my last apartment was always packed on weekends too, but not to this extent. Case in point, I went last Friday put in my name for a longish wait and while attempting to go wait outside in the rain, I just about got DECKED due to some guy trying to get into the restaurant who swung his arm around violently to get the door for his lady. Knocked my glasses off and caused me to swear loudly. Thankfully no black eye developed. Though I had pizza and drinks and cheesecake, and it was all tasty, if I hadn't been meeting friends and it been their pick, I would have eaten elsewhere based on the density of people. Their food is good, but not good enough to tempt me to wade through another sea of reckless humanity for it in the future."
Ben T.,"Seattle, WA",0,2,,1.0,6/13/2010,"Went today (Sunday at about 1:30), party of two.  Neither of us had been to any Cheesecake Factory location.  No wait for a table, but upon leaving noticed a decent crowd waiting, so we may have been lucky.  Was seated at booth/chair table next to loud children.  Then we were promptly ignored completely (no initial waiter with water, nothing at all beyond menus) for 21 minutes.   Waiters were serving the tables within a foot of ours on both sides, but not at all at ours. We left and ate elsewhere. Ambience: very loud, spoon on floor beneath chair, many children (loud of course) Notes: menus had advertisements for other businesses peppered throughout.  (classy!)"
Denise D.,"Seattle, WA",0,93,,2.0,6/9/2012,"If you're in the mood for cheesecake, then by all means come to this place cause it's to die for. However...and here we go. We decided to take our family of 7 to this place for dinner. The place was busy and we waited for about 15 minutes. We were seated and our waiter, David, presented himself to announce the specials for the day. There could have been a teleprompter that he was reading from, for all of the lack of warmth and personality that he didn't have. Dude are you working for tips or what? Ok, so 10 minutes go by and he comes back. We order, he says would you like some bread to begin with, we say sure. Ok another 15 minutes and where is the bread? Hmmm....we're really hungry at this point. Here comes the bread, fast forward another 20 minutes and here come our meals. Well all of our meals minus one. My daughter doesn't get her meal and we say to David, who btw, does not serve but others do, we're missing a meal.He says I know it's coming. Well thanks buddy, we're feeling the warmth for sure. Another 15 minutes and finally here is her meal. 3 of our party ordered pasta, all 3 of these were so incredibly salty that they were uneatable. I order the bacon and shrimp sandwich with fries which was ok but the fries were heavily salted, nope can't eat them. My grandson had a kids pizza, wasn't regular mozzarella but a combination of something, which he didn't care for. My son had a burger which oddly enough wasn't salted enough. One of our party had the salmon with mashed potatoes which he said was great. We don't see David for awhile, he comes back to clear dishes. He sees that the dishes are hardly eaten but he neither offers nor comments on this. Our only saving grace for this meal was the cheesecake for dessert. Any hey people, please look at your receipts, an 18% gratuity is added on but your server will not tell you this. If you don't read this, you will probably add another tip on top of what they are already making. So again, if you want some really great cheesecake, have at it and come to this place. If I'm going to take my family of 7 somewhere, it won't be to this place again. For paying almost $200.00 for this meal, nope my expectations are a bit higher. And to our server, you can't actually act personable when you present the check, it's expected as a courtesy when you are serving people."
Bob K.,"Millbrae, CA",93,21,2,4.0,10/4/2010,"Quality cocktails, solid portions, and excellent Cheesecake. A good choice. I will return."
nate j.,"Renton, WA",53,257,66,4.0,12/28/2007,"Excellent desserts, but $3 drip coffee, c'mon! We went to the Cheesecake Factory at Southcenter (Westfield Shoppingtown at Southcenter) in Tukwila today, but only for dessert and coffee drinks. Quoted a 25 minute wait for a table, we almost turned-tail and left for a Starbucks.  The 25 minute wait ended up being only 10-15 minutes.   The place was noisy and busy (but not as busy as I'd seen at DT Seattle and in Bellevue) but not loud enough to prevent from engaging in table conversation.  Service was also just right. The desserts, a collection of slices of cheesecake, fresh strawberries, and a mud pie cake, were all great and almost too large a serving to be enjoyable (the food has large servings too if I recall correctly)... but of course, it comes at a cost.  For four adults, and two kids, I believe the bill was close to $60+ dollars.  That's an expensive coffee date in my book.  And as I mentioned earlier, the drip coffee was $3! This was a special day, as we'd been spending time with relatives in-town for the holidays, but normally we wouldn't have done this.  If the mall still had a Farrell's ice cream (gone since the 1980s), that'd be the place we likely would have gone to if it still existed. Parking is free and generally plentiful -- there's a new garage built right next to the CF.  Transit riders are generally marginalized around the Southcenter Mall as the stops are pretty far away to the east and there's a long walk to get to CF from there.   Bottom line: I'll probably come here again, but keep it for special occasions."
Michael B.,"Seattle, WA",36,173,7,3.0,1/30/2008,"Meh... It's hard for me to saying anything too bad about the Cheesecake factory, but at the same time, it's hard for me to say anything good either.   Food and service is pretty average w/ exception of their deserts which are pretty tasty. The lamest thing about the Cheese Factory is the fact that they have advertisements on their menu...I mean, come' on Cheesecake factory, aren't you already make enough $$$ on the over priced food?"
Bam B.,"Kirkland, WA",29,241,136,3.0,11/10/2012,"I had the chicken fettuccine with sun dried tomatoes and a blueberry cheesecake. It was ok, oddly my favorite food was the brown colored side bread! I believe its some sort of honey wheat bread, it is the best tasting bread I have ever eaten before! If they sold it in the store I would definately buy it!"
hung n.,"Bellevue, WA",115,76,,4.0,2/1/2008,"It was the strangest thing....  We kept hearing in the background sounds of slot machines as if we were in Vegas.  Then it switched to 'porn music' as my friend described it. I've probably tried a quarter of their menu, which is a 10-page book but what I always gravitate back to is their Jambalaya!  And when my friends tried it, it was a unanimous decision that will be their next order at Cheesecake! Food is good but on the beer-meter, just ok b/c it was a little pricey"
Gene B.,"Seattle, WA",86,281,117,2.0,8/30/2009,"There is something decidedly off about the South Center location. The layout is awkward and counter-intuitive, the service is very plodding, not very skilled and the food is substandard. The first time that I ever went to The Cheesecake Factory it was at the downtown location shortly after it opened and I was prepared to hate it, but it wasn't so bad. I've been there a couple of times since and it's been about the same. Why the South Center location is so different is a mystery to me. You'd think that with a chain establishment there'd be more consistency, but apparently not. No great loss, there's just too many options out there to get bogged down in this one."
Elizabeth S.,"Peoria, AZ",33,15,5,1.0,5/10/2009,"I'm brown, I get down and I can lean with best of cholos... Now with this being said it makes me wonder why ANYONE, let alone the woman serving me and my black friend who find it appropriate to make a racial slur.  It all started one glorious day at the establishment I refer to as The Factory. Normally, this is a three star establishment. The menu is about as thick as a deck of playing cards, the food is a bit better than Applebees but they have the best ranch and iced tea around. And yes, I am the kinda girl who orders a side of ranch for whatever I'm eating.  Anyways, we order our drinks: an iced tea for me (passion flavored of course) and a lemonade for my besty and in about ten minutes they show up at our table. Then we wait on our complimentary bread which shows up in another 15 minutes or so. At this point we are BOTH out of drinks and our order still has NOT been taken. A few more minutes go by and our order has been taken--- 2 sandwiches neither of which were fancy unless you consider the pickles I ask to be put in my grilled cheese. Yes, I was pregnant at the time. And yes, our drinks still had not be refilled. 15 minutes or so later our food comes out sans the ranch dressing. I, of course, ask for ranch again and point out our drinks need to be topped off. Our server leaves for the ranch and the drinks and then then it hits us--- the smell of nail polish remover.... The smell is unmistakable, heavy and is wofting at our table. When the server gets back with our drinks and ranch I have to ask her what this smell is. I assumed someone was doing their nails in the kitchen since we were sitting along the kitchen wall... The server responds with, ""THERE IS A MEXICAN FIXING THE DOOR.""  I was shocked. Floored one might say. Flabbergasted even. It took me a minute to pick my jaw up off the table. What the hell does a ""Mexican"" fixing the door have to do with the smell. And do I care if said person fixing the door is in fact Mexican? And we are clearly a table of questionable whiteness.... Had the person fixing the door been white would we have heard that some white guy was doing the job. I am going to assume that the Mexican fixing the door was the cause of the acetone smell but that was never explicitly told to me.  My advice to anyone, anywhere is to know your audience. If the people in front of you are not your nationality please do not play a race card. Whether you realize it or not it is horrifying to the people in front of you and it will make for a story that will be told for months to come."
Lu C.,"Waterbury, CT",1,41,22,3.0,8/9/2012,"VERY EXPENSIVE! Totally disagree with the $$ rating. Should be $$$. Menu is large, food is great would give it a 4 star if the prices were more appropriate for the food and atmosphere. Noise level is very high as well."
Hillary N.,"Salem, OR",14,33,4,2.0,8/11/2011,"Okay I've been here several times and have never been impressed by the service or the food. If it wasn't for my husband who likes the place mainly for nostalgic memories... I'd avoid it all together. Our waitress was a complete airhead last time and kept making us repeat ourselves. Every drink, appetizer and meal was brought out by a different person. Someone attempted to give our appetizer to the neighboring table and another server gave our drinks to a different neighboring table! Really? The salads are huge but they don't have a good flavor. Mine had cold flavorless chicken on it last time and plastic tasting tortilla strips. The hot wings aren't good either, but you can buy a few live chickens for your yard for the same price as they charge for them. It's just so expensive for the quality..I don't get the hype. Although they do have yummy cheesecake, I can't stand paying 8 bucks for a slice of something I can make a whole one of for less. They should stop selling food and just be a cheesecake place. Save 20 bucks and eat dinner somewhere else."
Kathryn M.,"Port Angeles, WA",66,18,1,1.0,3/10/2013,"We had a very disappointing experience.  First, we were told the wait would be 45 minutes to an hour, Every time we checked in, they told us it would only be 5 more minutes.  An hour and a half later we were finally seated.  It took us about 20 more minutes just to get our drinks.  Then we ordered an appetizer, and it came our with our food.  We ordered the Ahi Tartare, and it came out with 1/4 Ahi, 3/4 avocado.  It was very disappointing; however, it set the tone for the evening.  My granddaughter ordered the Wasabi Crusted Ahi, and I ordered the fish and chips.  My daughter ordered the garlic pasta, and my other granddaughter ordered shrimp scampi.  The first two dishes came out with the appetizer.  The fish and chips were good, but the crusted Ahi was actually soggy.  It was not a crust at all.  It was a soggy breadcrumb coating.  And the bed of rice that was under it tasted like instant rice.  5 minutes later, the other two dishes came out.  The scampi was actually deep fried and was still raw in the center, and the garlic pasta had about 4 shrimps and maybe 5 veggies.  It was a lot of pasta with hardly any sauce, but it did have more than enough salt.  We did send the scampi back, and she ordered fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp.  The fettuccine came out and was so salty that she couldn't eat it.  By that time, we had been in the restaurant for over 3 hours, and we were done.  We asked for the check so we could leave, and the girls ordered cheesecakes to go.  I put $60 cash in the billfold along with my credit card to cover the $117 check.  They took the billfold and when they brought it back, they had taken the $60 in cash and neatly hidden it behind the checks, and charged the whole thing to the credit card.  I am not positive, but it sure felt like they were intentionally trying to have us leave the cash.  We signed the bill and left, and we took the cash with us.  Overall, this was the worst experience I have had in a nice restaurant in a very long time.  The food and the service were in no way good enough to warrant a $117 check.  I will not be returning to ANY cheesecake factory, and I will be posting a poor review on as many review sites as I can to save others from this aggravation and disappointment!"
Abigail V.,"Renton, WA",3,21,1,2.0,9/8/2010,"Not bad, but not worth the raves I have heard in the past.  I have been to the Seattle location and now this one.  Service was... OK.  Dinner was... OK.  Dessert was... OK.  I have had better cheesecake @ the little mom & pop shop downtown Renton (which is now closed ):"
Jerome B.,"Kent, WA",309,155,87,3.0,10/30/2007,"The outside of this restaurant was very cute. hahah, It looks smaller than any other Cheesecake Factory I've been to. The Parking was GREAT! You have a qutie a few spots around the restauarant, but you also have the option to park on the Southcenter Mall parking lot. Very convenient Me and my friend went on a Monday night, and it was super busy. That was expected, because the restaurant just opened 3 days earlier The service was good. Not great. There was like 3 people attending to us, which was kind of awkard.  I got the Luau Salad. For some reason, it tasted better when i took a bite from my friends salad back at Bellevue's Cheesecake factory. However, as i type thisk review, I'm eating the leftovers. LOL, it tastes better the second time around. The strawberry lemonade i got was great the first time around, however the second time around was disgustingly sweet. Me and my friend got the Banana Cream Cheesecake and the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake....HEAVENLY... gahhh Other than the inconsistent food, I could always count on the cheesecake being really good.. I was debating whether i should give 3 or 4 stars. I picked 3 because of the price compared to how good all my food was that day."
Tami D.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",2,16,,2.0,6/3/2010,"The wait here is always long, that could be a sign that they are really good or just really slow.  I would say a bit on the slow side.  The front desk girls were so so and kind've just sat there.  Our waiter wasn't the best or paid much attention to us. So on the service side, I might just have high expectation as it is a nicer and pricer place, but have to say, the rasberry cheese cake is delicious and worth the visit.  I might reccomend next time to just stop in and pick up dessert and skip the dinner portion."
Daniel Z.,"Tacoma, WA",54,123,16,1.0,1/5/2009,"I have been to this location once, and it was my first time eating at the place. It was crowded and we had to wait probably 30 minutes before we got a table. That's was the good part of the evening. We get seated and take a look at the menu, it looked okay, some good things, but I didn't feel overwhelmed with great choices. We took probably 10 minutes to decide what we wanted but then had to wait at least 20 minutes before our order was taken. When we finally put our order in we started talking amongst ourselves just having a good time. Nearly 30 minutes after we put our order in the waiter comes back and asks what I ordered again, I tell her. Twenty minutes after that they bring out food out, keep in mind this is nearly 60 minutes after we sat down, and 30 since we ordered. They bring three meals out and my two friends meals are just as they ordered. Mine... not even close, I ordered a sandwich and it was some sort of pasta with ingredients I can't eat. They take it back and say they will get what I ordered. My friends start eating and at this point I haven't eaten all day so I am sharing the food they got. Without stretching the truth, 45 minutes after they brought my friends food I get my food. Nearly two hours after ordering I get my sandwich. It takes another 30 minutes to get our cheesecake. We are going on about 3 hours since we sat down, I have seen the table behind us sit down, get their food, eat, and leave... twice... This was by far the worst service I have ever received at a restaurant. The food I ordered was okay but my friends food was better. I will go back because I do believe they have some delicious options, but they will know I will not accept a repeat performance."
