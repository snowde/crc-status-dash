Jeannette C.,"Kent, WA",0,11,,3.0,9/9/2010,"The atmosphere was more cafeteria like than upscale quality.  The plates looked great and my husband's food was decent.  The price was a little high for that atmosphere, but it was our first anniversary and we've never eaten there before.  A little splurging was in order.  The tables though were packed in way too close to each other and this was a very distinct thing we noticed.  The ""factory"" system was in full swing and it all seemed a little to inpersonal to me."
kim b.,"Kent, WA",2,15,,5.0,11/18/2008,"I love coming to the Cheesecake Factory with the girls. The service is great and the food is delicious every single time. I recommend the Louisiana Chicken Pasta with the Strawberry Shortcake for dessert. Goodness, the shortcake is way better than the cheesecake. The Pomegranate Martini is delicious as well :) Recommended for groups or dates. Good for absolutely any occasion."
Kalvin H.,"Kent, WA",0,23,,2.0,2/2/2012,"Food is often good, however it's only because each dish is generally over 1000 calories, many being from 2000-3200 which is just insane, also has long waiting times all of the time, problem better off looking elsewhere."
Gavin D.,"Shelton, WA",3,7,1,2.0,1/24/2010,"Good sized portions, decent pricing, the food however could have been better and the serve staff was not the friendliest. Probably will not be dining here again."
Carrie H.,"Issaquah, WA",44,434,540,5.0,9/1/2011,This was our very first visit to this location. Cheesecake Factory has always been a favorite place of ours for Ribeye Steaks and of course CHEESECAKES. We were seated within a few minutes of walking in the door on a very busy Thursday night. The place was packed with many large groups celebrating birthdays. Our waitress immediately came to the table and introduced herself and got our drink order. We had our two daughters with us both of whom are under 6 years old. Both girls got a special plate with bananas and both types of bread both where perfectly sliced for kids! We where VERY happy with that distraction. Our food was very good and the steaks were a perfect medium as requested. The Onion Rings are mind blowing and everyone walked away full and happy. Both girls were offered two scoops of ice cream or a Hot Fudge Sundae. Everything was spot on and even better than expected especially with the lower than average Yelp! rating given by former customers. We will definitely be back after a night as great as tonight!
Cindy H.,"Tacoma, WA",0,94,10,2.0,7/7/2012,two to three stars. no wait on lunch. very cold inside...made you want to leave faster.  had the meatloaf.  didn't like. didn't even eat leftovers the next day.  servers have to wear the same uniform and it is not flattering on any body shape there. just food....on th spendier side.
Amber J.,"Newcastle, WA",40,39,15,4.0,10/25/2009,"For a chain restaurant, I've always appreciated the top noch service from the Cheesecake Factory at Southcenter mall. I go there regularly for movie night and I'm always impressed with their fast, friendly and casual service."
Misskarissa N.,"Fife, WA",0,5,,4.0,6/10/2012,"Stopped in here a few weeks ago after a shopping trip, and have to say I was impressed. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. The food took a littleeeeeee longer than anticipated which is rough when you're hungry, but overall worth the wait!"
Charlie C.,"New York, NY",82,97,3,2.0,7/15/2008,"I went here out of desperation. After 10PM, everything was closed. I was hungry, and I don't eat fast food. The food here is the same standard fare as any other Cheesecake Factory (that's why they're a chain, because of consistency), so normally they would get three stars because it's average. But my chicken taquitos were cold by the time that I took them back. And I was only 15 minutes away, so it means that it wasn't hot enough to begin with. Melted cheese that has solidified is the worst. And it's not like sex, where even if it's bad, it's kind of good. No, it kinda sucked."
Anisia H.,"Seattle, WA",38,26,,3.0,4/16/2008,"Dine smart. If you enjoy the food at The Cheesecake Factory, do one of three things. 1.  Arrive when they open Sunday mornings for brunch.   The Cheesecake Factory offers a great brunch menu Sundays only, and of course the regular menu is available.  We arrived 5 minutes prior to opening, walked in with other early birds and enjoyed no wait, choice table, finished our meal and left as the herds started piling in the entry waiting area.  This is an EXCELLENT time to go with large groups or young children. 2.  Order take-out.   You've seen them while you were waiting for your dine-in table.  Those folks who called ahead or stopped in, placed their order for some pasta, came in to the cheesecake counter and left with their food before you even made it to the top of the wait list.  Most often, poor, inattentive service at any restaurant can ruin a meal of good food.  Skip the risk on service and take-out!  Get your dinner and go. 3.  Order curbside.   Like take-out but a little more convenient.  You can call ahead and not even leave your car!  This is perfect if you have young children and its troublesome to take them in and out of car seats to enter a storefront for some takeout."
Tracy D.,"Tacoma, WA",0,31,1,3.0,11/7/2011,"I always eat in the bar here and the bartenders are consistently fantastic.  The food is pretty good, nothing outstanding but reliably good.  Hands down a better place to eat than Joeys nearby which is a similar venue.  Happy hour menu is very reasonable with some good choices for those that eat meat and those that don't."
Ashley D.,"Renton, WA",29,209,59,4.0,1/28/2010,"Our server and cooks on staff  must of been the best, compared to some of the other reviews. We came Tuesday night around 6:30. It was a little busy, but we only waited maybe three minutes and we were seated right away. Our server greeted us promptly and we ordered something to drink. The menu selection is almost overwhelming for me, way to many choices. At least tonight I knew I wanted steak. The server returned right away with our drinks and some extra bread, I love the bread! I ordered the Habatchi Steak with wasabi mashed potatoes  and asparagus tempura. My brother ordered Steak Diane and my grandma ordered some jumbalaya pasta. Everything tasted wonderful. And the portions were rather large. I also had the red velvet cheesecake, YUMMY!  It was a little pricey though 3-sodas, 3-entrees and 3-slices of cheese heaven was $99 without tip. We really did enjoy it though. By the way Thanks Grandma, she paid so nice of her."
Travis D.,"Maple Valley, WA",1,40,,4.0,11/29/2010,"One of our favorite restaurants. Great menu choices, service has always been pretty good, reasonable wait time for our food, food quality is outstanding. The only knock I have on them is that their wait times are pretty long at times."
Diane K.,"Seattle, WA",0,47,7,4.0,8/28/2010,"H A P P Y   H O U R   I love the space at this cheese cake factory, large spacious bar and great happy hour food!"
Gina T.,"Seattle, WA",197,180,210,5.0,11/6/2007,"Okay, so I am not normally a fan of the Franchise monster restaurants, so please please please don't let that invalidate me right off the bat.  I had too try this place out since it was not that far away and because it was new. I was Highly amazed at the menu and the amount of options there were. Everything from a northwest flair to southern feel to eastern taste. Their corporate chefs are earning their bucks that's for sure.  I might also add that if you are planning on stopping by, go outside of 'normal dinner hours'. The wait will be really bad. Yes the hostess will always tell you 15 minutes but come on people... that almost never happens.  I need to make specific recommendations here... they were that good! Try the Veggie spring roll with the avocado and this sweet nutty sauce was amazing and enough for 4 people. I had the a chicken dish... which for me is a bit odd since I like to try things I can't make myself, but this was the one listed as ""most popular chicken dish"" and I can see why!! With a sweet and savory sauce, asparagus, cheese and mashed potatoes... you might need to get your tush into the gym after this one. Of course we saved room for cheese cake and took some left-overs home but splitting a piece of the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake was sounding pretty good. I could have done with out the 2 cups of whipped cream the piled on the plate but with something like 30 options to choose from there is something for everyone... even if you don't like cheesecake.  All of this came to less than $50 for a three course dinner! Not too shabby."
Joey e.,"Puyallup, WA",23,43,,4.0,3/31/2012,"we were here again!! yes again..and this time i wanted to try their small plates and appetizers. i had the Vietnamese tacos, its kinda like a bbq pulled pork with asian pickled veg's stuffed into a pecking duck bun!  i thought it was okay. i wish that they had an asian style type of meat in there like lemongrass pork or char siu. the idea is great, but the flavors are not in harmony! i also had the wild mushroom flat bread. that was sooo delicious!! three different types of mushroom and melted cheese on a flat bread. sounds so simple but yet very tasty! sometimes the simplest things are the best! then i had the dynamite shrimp. it was whole shrimps with a light batter, deep fried and served with their dynamite sauce. good and tasty. i like the fact that they serve the sauce on the side and not mixed in with the shrimp. it keep the shrimp crispy!! overall i really enjoyed the dishes from the small plates section!!! gonna go back to try more!! happy eating!!!"
Ramon N.,"Seattle, WA",48,22,,1.0,1/6/2008,"Give me a break, are still frequenting cookie cutter chains in this town with so many better options?"
Malea X.,"Seattle, WA",0,405,7,3.0,9/29/2008,"yeah, ok. it's the cheesecake factory. just like all the rest of 'em. i do like the salads and roasted artichoke, and evelyn's pasta is good. but come on - even the salads are 600 calories...with the ""low-cal"" dressing! i pretty much only come here when i'm close by and hungry because they do have a variety of veg options. but now that there's bj's i probably won't set foot in here again unless my family is visiting and requests it."
Megan L.,"Renton, WA",47,157,105,5.0,8/25/2008,Delicious as usual.  Same great service as all other Cheesecakes.  I always order the perfectly made Louisiana pasta.
J G.,"Seattle, WA",0,79,5,3.0,10/25/2009,"Lunch, dinner, and late night treat were okay.  I LOVE their cheesecake, but their meals are not that impressive.  A bit bland, but I'll be back for the cheesecake! ; )"
