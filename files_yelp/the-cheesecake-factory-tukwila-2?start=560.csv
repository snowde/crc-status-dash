will m.,"Seattle, WA",38,116,25,3.0,8/10/2009,"i have a love hate relationship with this restaurant.  i've been here a couple of times and sometimes the service is good, sometimes it isn't.  with that said, this place is ok.  the food are huge in portions, the menu is what i could say, jack of all trades.  being jack of all trades, you tend to know a lot of things, but not be really good at anything.  the menu has a lot of items, it's almost like reading war and peace with colorful ads from nearby businesses, hah hah; but the quality is just ok, not really horrible, but not really good either, i've had better.  the service here can be good, but a couple of times, it's subpar.  they tend to forget you if you don't order right away and also after they set your meal in front of you; instead of the phrase dine and dash, the service here can be summed up as serve and dash.  the ambiance is nice, a little too dark for me though, trying to make a more romantic mood, but being how noisy it is here, it kind of extinguishes the mood.  the high ceilings and contemporary-traditional style is very pleasing.  the best thing i have eaten here is the chicken marsala, sweet and flavorful and huge.  i try to order light here or enter starving so i can have room for dessert, which is great; after all, you can't call yourself cheesecake factory without having a good cheesecake in my opinion.  this location is right outside the southcenter mall, so there is a parking lot and garage, however, for some reason, a gazillion people always eat at olive garden and this place, which makes it hard to find parking and requires you to wait awhile for a table at both places.  this place is good, but not great, it tries to do too much and doesn't really do things well, but at least a sweet ending to this meal is always available."
