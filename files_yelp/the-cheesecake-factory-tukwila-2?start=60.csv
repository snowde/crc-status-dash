Edgar S.,"Auburn, WA",33,56,584,5.0,4/12/2016,Visit this location a few times throughout the year. Love the portion sizes since I can and love to eat. Their service seemed to improve big time. Last two times are servers were great! Only complain at this location is typically the wait time but I guess that's why we keep coming back.  Great job management and team for understanding what good service is.
Tiffany H.,"University District, Seattle, WA",274,3,,4.0,7/31/2017,The food is good! Big portions but quality can sometimes be inconsistent. I suggest the tiramisu cheesecake it's awesome. I threw in an extra star because of the star quality service I receive from Nick the server! He is so kind and sweet and really gives genuine and quality service. Ask to sit in his section!!
Chris R.,"Liberty Lake, WA",24,1,,1.0,8/9/2017,"We walked in with a party of 7 and were told by the manager that we would have to wait for 30 minutes. It was 3:30, Wednesday, August 9. This was fine with us. However, 40 minutes rolled by and we watched the lobby clear twice with many parties of 3, 4 and 5. When we questioned the manager he said he was waiting on a busser to clear our table. My response was that if I was the manager and had a party who's bill would easily be over $100, I would have cleared the table myself. I cannot believe a manager is too high and mighty to make sure his customers got a table quickly. Our server was great. The hostess was great. The food was great. The managers laughed at my suggestion. Very sad."
Amanda M.,"University Place, WA",176,219,448,4.0,3/27/2016,"Always a favorite! I think they may have changed some ingredients in their garlic pasta because something just didn't taste right but overall it was still good. As always, plan ahead.. Parking sucks and it's always busy, even for lunch!"
Chris V.,"Seattle, WA",17,255,599,3.0,5/21/2016,"We had dinner here with our neighbors Thursday night and had an enjoyable time. The wait to get in was long especially for a week night (35 minutes) but they sat us in a nice big comfortable  booth and the wait staff was very friendly & attentive. The food was good but nothing I need to go back for. We had the fish & Chips and Chicken Madeira both of which we're good but I was disappointed with my Dulce cheesecake because of the over the top sweet topping. Overall though, the experience was pleasant but a little pricey in my opinion."
Monique A.,"Kent, WA",0,2,,1.0,3/27/2017,"Saturday 3/24/2017, was a good day until we got to this nasty place!  I  understand the 30min wait and had no problem waiting but when we had to wait 45min for two double burnt bacon burgers and bacon & egg breakfast. The bacon was sent back twice, eggs not done.... Strawberry cheesecake cake was old and had a refrigerator taste. The cheesecake from the to go counter was gross and had a old refrigerator taste too!!! Also waited ""(20min)"" took to damn long to wait for cheesecake to go... we gave the waitress a $10.00 tip because it's not her fault the the food was nasty and ""(sooooooooo)"" damn slow!!! Our bill was $81.00 for bullshit.... I asked on waitress was the ""COOK ANGRY""!! WE WON'T BE BACK! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!......"
Liz C.,"Santa Clara, CA",429,506,2328,3.0,4/16/2015,"Cheesecake Factory, specializes in cheesecake but offers a giant menu of entrees to choose from. I think it's easy for Cheesecake Factory to not have superb food because it doesn't necessarily specialize in one specific cuisine. It offers anything from pizza, burgers, salads, pastas, seafood, chicken dishes, etc. Despite having a huge menu selection, I still had a decent time here with my brother. We came around 5:30 on a Thursday evening and were seated right away. Around 6 pm is when a bunch of people started coming in and a line started to form so I recommend coming before 6 if you can. It gets even more crowded on Friday and weekend nights.  Mai tai - This is one of their most popular drinks. It's garnished prettily with a pineapple, orange slice and cherry. Make sure to stir the drink thoroughly. It has a nice ""tropical"" taste without tasting too much like fruit. You can taste the alcohol in here quite well, so if you like drinks that really mask the flavor of alcohol, I wouldn't recommend this one.  Fried calamari - For an appetizer we started with the calamari. It comes with two sauces: a garlic aioli type sauce and a cocktail like sauce. I think I preferred the garlic one over the cocktail one. The cocktail one seemed like it was missing a component in it, because the flavor just didn't deliver all the way. It tasted a bit more on the ketchup side. The garlic one was pretty good though. The calamari itself was just decent. The breading falls off too easily and it could have been fried a little longer. I think the squid wasn't very fresh, but the place doesn't specialize in seafood so I guess you can't expect the highest quality. Shepherd's pie - I've always heard of this dish and I've seen how it's made so it was finally time to try it. The dish is made up of ground beef, zucchini, carrots, and onions. It's then topped with mashed potatoes with a cheese ""crust."" The whole thing is smothered in mushroom gravy. Thankfully the mushroom gravy was not overly salty - which I appreciated. The mashed potatoes were tasty and I liked the cheese. It wasn't overly cheesy, which I had expected it to be. The ground beef was pretty dry though. Getting big chunks of dry beef wasn't that pleasant. Overall, the dish kind of tasted like salisbury steak. Huge portion, couldn't finish the entire thing. Spicy chicken chipotle pasta - My brother got this dish and enjoyed it. The pasta was cooked to al dente and I like the use of mini penne so that the sauce gets into the center. The sauce had a nice kick, but I felt like it was missing some sort of component that combined all the flavors together. The asparagus pieces and the little crunchy wonton strips add great texture to the dish. There are pieces of honey glazed chicken, but I think there were only around 3-4 pieces in the dish. It was decent, but could have been better. Another giant portion. White chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake - It was pretty good, but ever since having cheesecake from The Confectional, it doesn't compare. It wasn't as rich and creamy and velvety. However, the raspberry flavor was swirled beautifully in the cheesecake and it wasn't overly sweet. I didn't feel like my stomach was going to cave in from richness or anything. The chocolate crust added just enough chocolate to the cheesecake and went well with the white chocolate cheesecake base. Overall, a good dessert to end our meal. Service was good and attentive. Our waiter checked up on us, gave us lots of time and was very friendly. Not sure what service looks like on the weekend, but it was awesome tonight. The dishes are all around $15, but the portion sizes are huge so it may match their price. Cheesecake slices are around $8 per slice, but are also a pretty big slice that you can easily share. You also get free bread (dark bread and sourdough), which is a nice plus. Overall, not a bad place but the food could have been better."
Barbara B.,"Seattle, WA",38,5,,3.0,3/18/2017,"The food is really good, which is why we go there for special occasions. However, they seriously need to start taking reservations.. come in at 5 on a Saturday and are told it is a 3 hour wait min for our party of 9! The people with a ""normal"" party have a min 1 hour wait! It's ridiculous. Allow reservations and it would make it so much easier!!!"
Thomas H.,"Anchorage, AK",41,67,44,5.0,9/24/2016,"I have been to The Cheesecake Factory once before while I was in Las Vegas and I have to admit wherever I am and I drop in....this place is absolutely fantastic!! The menu is kind of overwhelming, but it definitely adds a element of variety to their offerings! I wish that they would open one of these in my hometown of Anchorage. I would be a regular patron at wherever they chose to stick this little slice of heaven up in the far North for sure!   I had the California Cheesesteak entree and the artichoke and crap dip as a appetizer! Both were amazing! I think as I continue to travel my mission will be to see if I can eat my way through that humongous menu selection they are boasting!!"
Cressandra M.,"Sun City, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/19/2017,I was not impressed by one of our waitresses we had. We started out fine and then my daughter needed a moment a we asked for a few minutes before we ordered. A few things did not work out and we needed to get our food to go. So we ordered it to go and the waitress became angry and unpleasant. We have been to many cheesecake factory's before and never had this type of service.
William B.,"Guilford, CT",65,16,6,2.0,4/4/2017,"Listening to a waiter (not my waiter) complain about my salad in ear shot got me a little annoyed. Literally asked for 3 ingredients. Feta, lettuce and olives, no dressing. They sent me a Greek salad (tomatoes, Italian dressing I think, cucumbers, and onions extra). Just because it's feta and olives doesn't make it a Greek salad lol. Anyway they bring me a new one fast and it had like 4 olives and a pinch of feta. Whatever.  The bartender was nice at least, I didn't shaft her tip, not her fault. I know a lot of kitchen guys, they can be so entitled,  go ahead and say ""don't mess with the people who make your food"". I don't care,  you guys suck at simple shit.  The steak....I prefer rare, but I always order medium rare because most places make it too rare (uncooked) or medium, so if it falls to rare or medium  I'm fine. This place unsercooked it more so than rare. I'm ok with pretty rare, so I ate it, but it was borderline even for me. (You can see purple/blue not red) This place wasn't my first choice, but everywhere was busier, I was able to get to the bar at least. Bartender kept it from being a 1 star, because she simply did her job"
Sharon R.,"Seattle, WA",39,4,,1.0,7/6/2017,"Tonight was the worst experience I've encountered with restaurant dining. A friend and I ordered ribeye steaks, one medium and one medium well. The wait was already long and they came out messing up the order. We had to wait another extra half hour for the order to get fixed. I asked for a manager and explained the wait time and the mistake. All he had to offer is a cheesecake!!! For goodness sake how hard is it for you to have just comped the mistake. It's what good customer service should have been. To wait almost two hours is unacceptable. On top of that my friend ended up losing her appetite and not eat it. You just lost a loyal customer and more . Thank you for your less than stellar customer service."
Deb R.,"Rapid City, SD",1,51,2,3.0,12/17/2016,"1st and last time I would ever order the Shepard's Pie from here. Basically a burned hamburger patty cut up and tossed with shredded veggies in a mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes put on top. Bummed because I've always heard good things. For the comment left by Business Manager, I did say something to my waiter about the food being subpar. He chose to ignore that when I said I didn't want to order something else and still charge full price without telling the manager. And never once did a manager come around to see how things were."
Reese R.,"Grand Rapids, MI",71,1,,1.0,2/7/2017,"Great service, our waitress was nice chatted with us told us her favorite dish on the special menu. (Which was confusing, why two different special menus?)  They were afraid to give us as much bread as we could eat while waiting for our entrée. However, when we got our food. The first bite of my Burger I was concerned my food was even fresh. The mac n cheese Burger was bland. I tasted more char from the grill then the mac n cheese. Opening the burger up the mac n cheese that was deep fried was not even close to warm it was in a purgatory of temperature. The burger was slightly warmer. But still not hot nor fresh. On the other hand my boyfriends chicken riesling was hot and had to wait for it to cool down before he could even touch it. Disappointed in the kitchen staff for not know how to get orders put together. Also it's 9:30 at night and dead.  Definitely not coming back after spending 50 bucks on one purgatory burger and one hot dish.  Bad first and last experience."
Emily Z.,"Seattle, WA",0,8,1,4.0,7/7/2017,"Food was great, but service is not up to par. I ordered the four cheese pasta and was asked if I wanted Parmesan cheese on top. When I said yes and was told to tell them when it was enough, they continued to grate the cheese like they didn't hear me. Needless to say, I could not finish my pasta because of the massive amount of Parmesan god damn cheese."
David K.,"Auburn, WA",0,32,,2.0,9/27/2017,Very poor service.  We was there around 130pm.  It was not busy and it took them 10min to seat us.  They had plenty table available.  They finely seated us and the table was dirty.  We even had to ask them for napkins.  Server was not very friendly.  Food ok.  Will not go back.
Hannah R.,"Spokane, WA",0,8,5,3.0,12/10/2016,"We came to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner on a Friday evening, and expectedly had to wait about 45 minutes for a table. The wait to be seated was fine, but the timeliness from our waiter was less than decent. We were never offered drink or water refills, nor did our waitress offer bread while we waited for our food. A food runner delivered our food, and immediately we realized we were missing items. The staff didn't apologize, but at least we got our food. The three cheese pasta and Thai wraps were good, but we were particularly disappointed in the $7 asparagus, which is advertised as ""grilled,"" but had simply been boiled and thrown on a plate without seasoning, butter, or any flavor all. We also asked for some sides that never came, and by the time our waitress returned to our table it was pointless to remind her, as we had been there for nearly two hours, and were ready to leave.  Overall the experience was okay. Hopefully if we choose to visit this establishment again we will have more attentive wait staff."
Sonny S.,"Honolulu, HI",21,8,9,2.0,9/3/2016,I decided to do my review while I wait for my cheesecake.  I'm sure the food is so good here that the lines are long which is why I decided to go with curbside ordering.   Also my baby is asleep in the back seat and I'd rather not wake him up to go inside.   I called the number on the curbside sign and was put on hold for 15 minutes before I hung up and called back.  I was on hold another 5 before I even got to order.   Now I'm just waiting for the delicious dessert that's coming to me (soon I hope).  If you're in a hurry this place will test your patience.  But they do have good food so I'll keep waiting. it has been 30 minutes since I made my first call... Baby is up now...  Thinking about going inside. Got the order! Hallelujah praise God.  Now I'm waiting for him to return with my card...
Elisabeth P.,"Olympia, WA",171,499,1200,4.0,2/15/2016,"We ate here late one night after arriving in Seattle. We needed something still open when our flight got in and we saw on Yelp that Cheesecake Factory stays open late...hello late night carb load.  I haven't been to one of these since I found out I had a gluten allergy so I didn't know what to expect. I was really pleased to see they have gluten free pasta and even have several sauces to choose from. They actually have a pretty impressive gf menu in general. Atmosphere is nice, as are all Cheesecake Factory restaurants. The lighting is low and the decor vibrant and stimulating. This particular location was pretty loud this night do to a large party but they put us in a quieter section which was appreciated. Our server was very prompt and attentive even though he seemed very busy and possibly stretched a little thin.  I ordered the chicken carbonara and my guy had the chicken parmesan. Food came out quickly and both of us were really pleased with our meals. My pasta was prepared well and didn't leave me wanting for anything, regardless of being gf. Portions are large here and we took some back to the hotel. Price is consistent with the chain as was the ambiance. What I did find unique and an aspect to recognize was the great service we received as well as the quality of the food preparation. Great to know this chain is an option for those of us with a gluten allergy."
Chris N.,"Seattle, WA",0,12,,3.0,6/7/2017,Pretty average location. Average food and service.gets busy after the mall closes and on  the weekends. .BUT I have placed a few phone orders for pickup .and it took FOREVER TO PLACE THE ORDERS EVERYTIME..not holding for someone .speaking to a person that is having a hard time entering the order in the system . it's ridiculous 20minutes to order 4 items .
