Barra B.,"Seattle, WA",110,117,183,3.0,9/3/2016,"This location is ridiculously busy which is the reason that I gave 3 stars instead of 4. The ambiance is fun and busy. Food is delicious. My favorite is the bang bang chicken and the red velvet cheesecake.  Great affordable place for a lunch/dinner while having a girls night out! The perfect setting to eat, sip and gossip!"
Mark C.,"Auburn, WA",0,9,,1.0,9/6/2017,"My wife and I have come to the Tukwila Cheesecake Factory nearly monthly for the past 10 years and today was our worst experience in 10 years. We ordered ribeye steak and it was delivered lukewarm to our table. We asked for a manager and requested that the our food be warmed up. The manager returned with our plate and the steak was warmer and  our mash potatoes and vegetables were cold. I asked again for the manager and requested again that they warm up our entire plate. I could not understand how they managed to bring out our food cold after we asked them to warm up our food. The manager demonstrated very little empathy and was overly serious and seemed to be just going through the motions. He could at least have acted like he cared about our negative experience,however, he never apologized for our substandard restaurant experience. I understand that Cheesecake Factory is the 9th largest restaurant chain in America, however, the culture has changed at the Southcenter Tukwila location. Customer service used to be top priority at this location, however, this does not seem to have the same priority as before. It is sad that a restaurant that used to deliver such outstanding service no longer sees the need to treat their customers with the best level of service."
Christian L.,"Orem, UT",131,16,2,4.0,6/24/2016,The Cheesecake Factory is always super busy. We walked in at 8pm and waited for about 30 minutes until we could get our table for 2. Once we were seated our waitress was great and super quick. The menus is huge so you can always fine something you'll like. The food was pretty good but nothing spectacular. I'm giving it a 4 because of how great our waitress was.  Waitress 5/5 Food3/5
Sam S.,"Kent, WA",29,6,4,2.0,4/10/2017,"I've been to this restaurant a few times, but this day the service level is definitely below expectations. Waited 20 min for a cup of coffee. Ask for tobacco sauce the waitress didn't acknowledge me and had to asked twice. Two group of people came after and got their food before me. I do give a credit the waitress refilled my coffee twice, otherwise it would be a one star. It wasn't even that busy."
Mimi P.,"Orange, CA",493,708,5548,2.0,1/7/2016,I'm in town 1-2x a month and I always dine in or do curb side.. This is probably my last time.. Very disappointed.. Missing condiments..utensils and I even asked when I picked up the order. On top of that they've ruined my fav miso salmon dish by over cooking it and drying it out.. And the gumbo was bland and not appetizing at all..will be taking a break from this place for a little bit..
Lisa L.,"Seattle, WA",0,3,3,2.0,7/22/2016,"I haven't been to cheesecake in awhile and I was craving the chicken piccata . When my dished arrived I noticed there was more noodles then sauce. When I mixed it all up it didn't cover all My noodles. I asked my server for more sauce . Waiting patiently for my sauce so I could eat my meal , just to find out the sauce she brought me was cold and not warmed up whatsoever . At this point I was very disappointed with my entire meal. I asked my for check and didn't box my food , more than half my food was still on the plate ."
Rumbullion R.,"Lancaster, CA",10,9,49,4.0,1/15/2016,"High: Incredible service from servers & crew.  Quality food, expedited quickly. Low: Small foyer/waiting area.  Food was a bit greasy.            This place seemed unusually busy for a Tuesday night when we ate here. But I was told that this was normal. With that said, I wish they had a better way/system for their customers to wait. The foyer where the customers are expected to wait is incredibly small & with the cheesecake bar sits right beside it, so it makes waiting a little clausterphobic. Though the front of the house wasn't rude-she was actually prompt and was making sure her tables were seating-she just didn't look happy to be there. Once we were seated though our sever was very quick, prompt and genuine. Additionally, when we needed extra bread, additional fork, etc., we flagged down the closest passing server/busser and they were all very eager to get our needs taken care of. The sense of urgency I felt the employees had made me feel important, regardless of the fact that they had a packed house. Our food came out shockingly fast considering how busy they were. All of the food tasted very good with American-sized portions, which made up for the higher prices. The pasta was good, but could've been a little more al dente. But I must admit that it was a little greasier than I had hoped.  Overall I would say that my experience at Cheesecake Factory was a pleasant one & will more than likely be returning to try out their other menu items...that tiramisu cheesecake was calling my name."
Jakie S.,"Issaquah, WA",31,318,209,5.0,11/21/2015,"Mom and I hadn't been here for years so we headed after shopping. Loved that I could get a glass of wine while waiting. I then ordered Avacado Egg Rolls. Soooo delicious for you vegans! Mom had the nachos. She had the part with meat, cheese, or the chicken. Just the chips and guac. Yum!"
Sam K.,"Snoqualmie, WA",0,188,1,3.0,9/11/2017,The place has really nice interior. It is spacious and well decorated. The staff is polite. The food is okay. Nothing special and nothing bad. I sincerely appreciate that they mention the calories for a dish. That helps you decide what you want to eat.
Kim A.,"Bozeman, MT",0,3,,5.0,5/1/2017,"I would 100% recommend this to anyone in the tukwilla or SeaTac area because of such fantastic service. I Came here on a whim with my boyfriend because we were shopping at the mall close by and neither of us had been to a Cheesecake Factory before. Came in, was seated almost immediately, and our original server, who I didn't catch the name of before he left for the night was INCREDIBLY pleasant and provided just as great of service. He let us know he was leaving so he introduced us to another server, Lenea who would also provide absolutely amazing service. Not to even mention that the food was delicious as well. A huge thanks to the pleasant staff and awesome cooks in there, all of them did an amazing job. Made the 11 hour drive all the way from Montana completely worth the trip. And I totally made this yelp account and downloaded the app just to leave this review."
chris D.,"Seattle, WA",2,8,,2.0,7/12/2017,"Tonight was one of the worst experiences, and all I was doing was picking up MY wallet that I had left there. I had picked up 2 slices of cheesecake 20 minutes prior. On my way home I realized that I had left my wallet at the counter where you get the cheesecakes and the to go orders. I called the restaurant and said I would be on my way to get it. This was at 4:45 p.m. I walked into the restaurant at 5 p.m. there was a line but it wasn't as busy as they usually get, either way I was here to pick up an item that I left and had called ahead for.  I went up and told them I had called about my wallet that I had left and was told that it would be a moment. Ok no problem.  15 minutes later cut to me watching three 2 tops, one 3 top and a baby, one true 4 top and then a 9 top get seated! We NOW have a problem. I approached the hostess stand. She looked me in the face and asked if she could help me. I told her that I could come back for my wallet tomorrow if that would help them out. Then the light bulb went on and she remembered. She told me a manager had to go and get it. I said great! She never told the manager because I saw him run into the bar, mess with the seating chart system, share a joke with a group that wanted to sit outside, run over to the bakery counter side then back to the hostess stand then over to a section with the servers. I have worked in restaurants and have owned a bar. I understand how hectic change of shift coupled with ""happy hour"" can be, but I also know that I need to treat paying and already paid customers the same. Like they matter!!  After another 10 minutes when the 8 top got seated that is when I glared at the hostess and mouthed ""wallet"".  Only then did she run over to the manager. I ran out to my car to get my phone and call the corporate office. When I walked back into the restaurant the manager had my wallet and ""thanked"" me for waiting. I am not an idiot I know that going to a cheesecake factory means waiting to get seated, waiting to order and waiting to eat, but when I call ahead of time for a left item there should be little to no wait! To wait almost 45 minutes is unacceptable. Thank you for your less than stellar customer service. I also thank you for your consistency across the board with the waiting game."
Toby B.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,2,,1.0,7/23/2016,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. I ordered a plain gluten-free cheeseburger to go, but they gave me a burger on a glutenous bun, with the macaroni and cheese.  My partner and I paid $50 for our food (their meal + mine + cheesecake) and I couldn't even eat the food that was served to us. This restaurant is over-expensive and under-impressive. I am so, so surprised they haven't been sued for their ""so called"" gluten-free menu when they screw it up so badly."
Corinna S.,"Seattle, WA",102,357,466,2.0,11/3/2015,"The first time I came here I just picked up a piece of cheesecake for take out, everything was OK.  The second time I came here for dinner and was pretty disappointed.  And it started so good! We didn't had to wait for a table, we were seated right away and got the menu.  Well, that is the last really good part of the evening... our waiter needed a nearly endless amount of time to get our order, we never received any bread (we asked later and he just said that he forgot it, yay...), the food itself was okay but nothing special and it needed a really long time to come to our table. Our waiter was ""lost"" most of the time, never asked us if we needed anything and we also had to wait as it felt forever to get and then pay the bill...  I have to admit that I don't expect too much from cheesecake factories but this one was under the average (already low) experiences I made with this company. And I try so hard to like it :("
Roxanne W.,"Auburn, WA",49,10,3,1.0,12/4/2016,"Okay long review here, but honestly you have to know how I originally viewed this restaurant to get an idea of how disappointed I am. The first time we ate @ CF I ordered their Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic and my husband ordered the Steak Diane & herb crusted salmon combo. LOVED IT!!! It was amazing and perfect! This was at the Seattle location in 2008. Following this wonderful experience we visited the Tukwila Location (it's closer to home). The first visit to TL was great! Semi same customer service, food was awesome, everything was great! We have brought tons of family and friends to CF over the last 8 years and there were times that the meal didn't have enough sauce or wasn't cooked correctly, but typically the issues have been little with no need to complain. We would chalk it up to them being busy or it was an accident kind of thing. (I get the same thing every time though, so I know how it's supposed to taste...)  My previous visit I got my food to go. Got home, ate my meal, and went to take a long awaited bite of my amazing cheesecake. As I pulled the first fork-full away it was still connected by a hair baked into the cheesecake! YUK! I thought awe man!!! And I kept it in our fridge for a good 2-3 weeks thinking I was going to make time to bring it in and show them that it was actually coming out of the cake itself. But I never got around to going and figured I would just say something about it when I went in next. When we got there is when I told the gal that my cheesecake had hair in it last time I took a to-go cake. Her response was to ask if I called in and as I said no and started to explain to her my reasoning. She interrupted me and said I wish you would have called. At that point I just asked for a manager. Who wants to pay $7-$9 for a piece of cheesecake and throw it in the garbage!?!?!? NOT ME!!!! When the manager gets to the table she says the same thing, of course, that the waitress said. And says to call next time. Doesn't want to listen to what I have to say, but sure does want me to listen to her....  She says, 'The reason we ask for a call right away is so we can 'coach' our people and if they aren't wearing a hair net when working then we can make sure they do in the future. I'll go ahead and comp one for you today, but we could have sent you another piece right away if you would have called.'  I said, 'Oh that's awesome! I wasn't aware that they would have mailed one out. Okay, that makes sense. I will call next time. Didn't think it was that big of a deal.' (She then INTERRUPTS me and says something while also mentioning that their cheesecake is not baked in house.) My response to that was, 'how are you going to coach someone that doesn't work for you? I believe I have the same gift card that I used to purchase my meal and cheesecake with me if you would like to use the paper trail to figure out who was working that day, but it doesn't matter because it was baked into the cheesecake it wasn't on the cheesecake.' Terrible customer service. Neither of these two ladies expressed any empathy to finding hair in my food. I have worked in customer service for 12 years. I know how it can be and I give the benefit of the doubt more often than not. But yesterday was the last straw. **We will NEVER GO TO THE TUKWILA ONE AGAIN!!!!** 12/3/16 marks the SECOND time (in a row) that I've gone home with leftovers that I pulled hair that IS NOT FROM ONE OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS out of my food!!!! I am beyond irritated that I drove 45 minutes to spend $75 to eat dinner with these outcomes: Waited over an hr AT the table for our food, after waiting over 30 mins for a table. Which I would have overlooked, however, my husbands steak and potatoes came out 'luke warm' and now I have to throw mine away AGAIN! Even after all that we still gave a 20% tip!! There was no hair in my food when it arrived at the table. I will chalk up the problem to letting the waitress take my food back to the kitchen to stick it in the to go container."
Matthew H.,"Dallas, OR",141,191,1030,5.0,12/13/2015,"What a wonderful place. I went there Friday for our work Christmas dinner and party. We went there last year also. Both times were great. Great food, great service, great fun. I ordered the baked salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes. Very very very good. Some of my co-workers got Jumbalia and orange chicken. It was a great experience and I would definitely recommend them!"
Stephanie J.,"Renton, WA",116,58,221,4.0,10/29/2015,"My boyfriend and I always come here when we can't decide on a food to eat. They have a huge variety ranging from burgers, steak, pasta, salad, and even some Thai style dishes. Plus, you can't forget the cheesecake display they have at the front! It gives me a good idea of what I should try for dinner. My boyfriend got the habachi steak and I got the chipotle pasta. The servings are so huge! I always request that they split my pasta in 2 plates. This way my boyfriend can have his own plate while I attempt to save room for dessert... but still half a portion of the pasta made me full so I ended up taking my cheesecake to go. Habachi steak- very tender and flavorful.  Chipotle chicken pasta- the best pasta ever! Has a kick of spice and some veggies for a balanced dinner as well. Tiramisu cheesecake- better than your ordinary cheesecake and you can't get it anywhere else."
Jennifer L.,"Studio City, Los Angeles, CA",218,33,71,1.0,1/14/2017,When they use door dash their inconsistent and don't attend to specific orders or directions like they would if you were their in the Resturaunt. Disappointing. Was on hold for 20mins to get this resolved and no one addressed this issue.
Brittany S.,"Seattle, WA",0,27,5,2.0,10/19/2016,"Let me start out by saying, our food & drinks were amazing. We had avocado egg rolls for an appetizer. My husband had the chicken and biscuits for dinner, while I had the Renee's special. We also took 2 pieces of cheesecake home. If I could rate only the food and drinks it would have been 4-5 stars. Our service was absolutely terrible. Here is what we endured. It was our anniversary and we were sure going to celebrate like it was. Especially because we both work 12 hour days, go home to two wonderful kids and this mama is also in school. I asked my husband to grab a table in the bar and I would be over in a minute. When I came into the bar he was sitting down at a table instead of the high top. I asked him if he asked to sit there and he said ""Yes. I asked the server if it was okay if we seat ourselves here since a table opened up. He said it was okay and to let the host know. So, I did."" About 5 minutes later our server comes to the table and lectures us on how to be properly sat. Mind you, my husband had just had a conversation with him prior and what baffled me most is, it was 4:40 in the afternoon! And, the bar was only half full. The restaurant was nearly empty. I worked at one of the busiest restaurants in downtown Seattle for 5 years, I understand how to ask the host to be seated at a table, we aren't idiots. However, we brushed it off and ordered drinks.This was STRIKE ONE.. About 10 minutes later he comes back to the table, I ask if we can order an appetizer and bread. He responds, ""Well, I haven't even made it to the kitchen yet or I would have grabbed some."" His eyes rolled so far into the back of his head, I thought he was going to pass out. Now, I'm starting to get irritated. STRIKE TWO. We had planned to move into the restaurant at this point but he came back with what we thought was an attitude check and some bread. About an hour and so later I asked to order my 4th glass of wine. Mind you, my third one was still full but I wanted to get it at happy hour price before happy hour ended. The server looks at me in shock, as if i'm belligerent at the table and says, ""Well, who is driving!?"" I pointed to my husband. As the server walked away I nearly burst in to tears. I rarely ever enjoy myself like this but it was our anniversary, I wasn't driving. To the server, i'm sorry if it baffles you I can drink a whole bottle of wine in an evening and still be responsible. STRIKE THREE. My husband went to talk to the manager who completely BRUSHED OFF his frustrations and said, ""I'm sorry. He's kind of an awkward guy but hes been here a long time."" Nothing like, ""Let me grab you another server and take care of some of your bill."" ""How can I fix this for you?"" ""I'm so sorry. I will speak with him about this privately, immediately."" The manager said it is protocol to make sure someone isn't drunk driving, which I have zero issue with. If he would have said, ""Maam, it is protocol that I make sure after drink ""1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,910"" you aren't driving or order you a cab."" STRIKE FOUR. After working in the service industry for 5 years, I found this service one of the worst i've received. There was numerous eye rolling, judging, frustrations, ext. But, I don't have the time to write out every single thing that happened in our 2.5 hours of dining. Over 100.00 bill. And, I wish we would have just eaten at Subway!  Never again."
Gerald L.,"Maple Valley, WA",0,2,,1.0,8/17/2017,"This has got to be the worst restaurant in the world. My friends and I went to the restaurant earlier today to celebrate a birthday and an anniversary. We went there just as they opened their doors, thinking we would be seated and served immediately. Well, think again. The restaurant just opened. It was empty. We were one of the first people in the door. You would think we would be seated right away. But NO. TCF has a policy of not seating people if they did not have enough servers. Not enough servers as they opened their doors. They should not open the restaurant if they were not fully staffed. We had to stand around and wait 30 minutes for enough servers to be seated. Just to be seated, mind you. Not even to be served. I have never heard of such a ridiculous policy. We had tried to make reservations, but were told they did not take reservations. At the restaurant, we were asked if we had made reservations. We were advised to make reservations  if there were so many people in our party. It was as if they did not want our business or even cared if we gave them our business. There are a bazillion restaurants to go to. There is nothing special about The Cheesecake Factory that I could see or discern. Given that it is a popular restaurant.  We were treated like unwelcome guests. I am never going to The Cheesecake Factory ever again - even if someone else was picking up the bill. The food is adequate. Nothing spectacular. What a great disappointment. I would have given it zero stars if at all possible. One star is the lowest. NOT RECOMMENDED. YOU ARE NOT WELCOME OR TREATED AS VALUED GUEST. YOU ARE TREATED MORE LIKE PESTS. Go to any other restaurant. I have never had this kind of service at any restaurant. GREAT BIG DISAPPOINTMENT"
Min C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3,137,243,3.0,7/23/2016,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, the food was ok.  Had the salmon salad and the Kahula coffee cheesecake.  Neither were spectacular, but they weren't disappointing either.  The salmon salad was a good portion, and the salmon was pretty good.  The Kahula cheesecake probably had a little too much whip cream on it. This is the quintessential American restaurant, a little bit of everything, may be I should have just gotten the cheesecake, I always liked the keylime cheesecake, but then I would have to think about what to do for dinner.  I know this is not a ringing endorsement, but it's at least average, right?"
