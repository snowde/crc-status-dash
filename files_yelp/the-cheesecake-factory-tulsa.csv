Shelby G.,"Bentonville, AR",26,201,187,4.0,11/11/2017,"I was surprised to see that there was no wait for a Friday evening. Every other Cheesecake Factory I have been to usually has at least a 45 minute wait. In Tulsa, we walked in and were sat immediately. Service was very prompt, in fact, a little too prompt at times, with our server rushing us through our meal.  As an app, we ordered avocado egg rolls, my go-to for Cheesecake Factory. They were delicious, as usual. Our entrees came out before we finished our app and after 2 bites of dinner, our server rushed over with the cheesecake menu. She was friendly, however, and did offer several recommendations for Cheesecake.  Overall, not a bad experience, just a little rushed. Cheesecake was on point, as usual."
Russell H.,"Collinsville, OK",82,39,36,4.0,9/26/2017,"I don't get to eat here but maybe once a year.   The food was very good.  I had a BBQ bacon cheeseburger.  My wife had meatloaf.  She loved it.  The service was good, and the cheesecake is always delicious. The only downside on this visit was the amount of time we waited to get our food.   All in all this was a good visit."
Jack C.,"Owasso, OK",100,124,49,5.0,8/28/2017,"So this is a chain... But.. if they messed up on the cheese cake... I would remove a star... But they don't and they always have up front parking so you can call in your pre-order and they just bring it to your car... I mean how great is that! So once  you get passed the 20 page menu of food items...... ...... .... Pretty much everything here is really good.. My all time fave is the steak dianne... I think that's the right spelling... Oh well it is just damn good...  And the cheese cake.. My fav is the oreo.. usually get it all the time and then sit there in my sugar induced coma happy! Be ready for a wait though, everyone loves coming to this place and if you are right in the middle of eating time you could have a 20 minute wait."
Bridget B.,"Broken Arrow, OK",34,55,26,4.0,9/22/2017,"It's a cheesecake factory, so it has a lot of those chain restaurant qualities that can be kind of bleh. However, as far as chain sit downs go, it is definitely one of the better ones. They have just about everything on their menu and it's always at least okay. The appetizers and dessert are the gold starts of this place. Entrees aren't stellar. I give them credit for getting me with the wine though. I'm a sucker for a refill when asked and they asked, a lot. So it is really easy to wrack up an expensive bill here if you aren't careful. Cheesecake is great, but it's not cheap. I recommend deciding what you want to eat and going somewhere cheaper because I imagine the quality isn't going to go down that much."
Jennifer '.,"Tulsa, OK",58,83,151,4.0,9/7/2017,"On a recent beautiful day I decided to try out the patio at Cheesecake Factory. I had to be in that area of town and thought it was the perfect spot to sit outside and enjoy some sunshine.  I've always loved the inside of Cheesecake Factory, but if you haven't tried out their patio, it's worth a visit!   For years I went to CF when I was out of town as a fun special treat.  Now that we have had one in Tulsa for years I kind of forget about it unless I'm out dining on a special occasion.  Of course their cheesecake is amazing but my favorite dish there is a Cajun pasta with chicken and shrimp.  Just the right amount of spice!  Everything I've ever had at CF has been wonderful, but I'm absolutely loving their lighter menus when you don't want to be too indulgent.  On my recent patio trip I got the turkey avocado sandwich that came with a lovely side salad... all for under 590 calories.  They have a huge selection of healthier options, so remember them even when you just want something on the lighter side... and a patio.  :)"
Kenneth L.,"OK, OK",1,5,1,4.0,10/8/2017,This fancy restaurant deserves a these good reviews because one the atmosphere the food is excellent soup was not as expected but still a great soup one of the best I've had in a while the chicken is has a soft delicious batter the seats are comfy looks like a kind of a Egyptian look a nice sealing and flooring tile fast service
Sheri T.,"Tulsa, OK",0,17,9,4.0,12/6/2017,"Had a wonderful experience, server was friendly and very helpful, food arrived in a reasonable time frame, our drinks were replaced quickly, and the bread was nice and hot. Cheesecake was de~lish, more choices than you can imagine. Family friendly, with clean restrooms!"
Steve R.,"Tulsa, OK",135,272,1016,5.0,6/11/2016,"We were indecisive when trying to decide what we wanted for dinner so we decided on Cheesecake Factory due to the wide variety of the menu. We went in a little after 9 and got a booth without having to wait. Our server was Rayleen and she was great. She provided the quick and silent service that I always tried to provide when I was a server.  I decided to try something new and had the Fish Tacos and my Fiance had the Chicken Bellagio. Everything we ordered was cooked fresh and it was all delicious. Even the white rice served with my entree had a surprising amount of flavor. We were ridiculously stuffed but wanted to try the Salted Carmel Cheesecake, so we split a piece (who could eat a whole one anyway?). We have tried several of the various Cheesecakes before, but I have to say that the Salted Carmel might be the best. It is super rich though. Our meal was less than $50."
Whitney P.,"Manhattan, NY",135,51,81,4.0,12/30/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain establishments. We don't have one where we live so we had to stop in while we had the chance!  I love the avocado egg rolls. Always have! They are amazing. If you love avocado, try them. They are wonderful.  I got a Raspberry lemonade to drink and it was ok. I wont order it again. It was extremely sweet and not to my liking, but I'm sure some would love it!  My husband and I got the tostada chicken salad to share and it was delicious. It was HUGE. I usually go with the bang bang chicken, but was looking for a lighter option and this certainly didn't disappoint. We really liked it, but next time I would get the dressing on the side so we could save the leftovers, because there will always be leftovers.  Last, the best part, the cheesecake. I am not a cheesecake fan, but the cookie dough cheesecake if one of my very favorite desserts. That's why I give four stars. Because I seriously LOVE it. It may be because it's basically a slice of cookie dough with bits of cheesecake, but, either way, it's wonderful. I'll always come back to CF, as long as they have the cookie dough cheesecake anyway."
Summer C.,"Bentonville, AR",992,1005,3062,5.0,3/15/2016,"Yes, it is a chain restaurant, but I love Cheesecake Factory. I currently don't live near one, so when I went to Tulsa for the day, my friend and I decided we must go! CUSTOMER SERVICE: The host, our waitress and the other employees we came into contact with were very friendly and helpful. Great customer service. AMBIANCE: All Cheesecake Factory's have the same decor and ambiance. I am a fan and think it is very nicely done.  FOOD: For having such a large menu, they do a good job at it. It seems that most of the time when places have such a large menu, it isn't good. However, the majority of things I have tried here (between a lot of locations) have been good. I have a few things that I stick with because I really like them, such as the salmon salad and Baja chicken tacos. This past time I ordered the Baja chicken tacos and will admit the rice and beans were different and were not good, so that is a bummer, but it has normally been good. DESSERT: This has to have their own category haha. It is The Cheesecake Factory afterall! I love a lot of the cheesecakes. Most of the chocolate, peanut butter/chocolate ones are my favorite. I also love the raspberry one and the lemon one.  I'm also a fan of their non-cheesecake desserts. I love the Linda's Fudge Cake, Black-Out Cake, Lemoncello Cream Torte, and the Strawberry Shortcake. Mmmmm I want some now! Haha."
Tanja M.,"North Charleston, SC",51,80,158,3.0,3/29/2017,You would think that after spending $30 on 3 slices of cheesecake the lady at the counter would be a little more polite. She was really rude. That is why I give this place 3 stars. Plus we just came in for cheesecake and it's taking FOREVER for them to get get it ready. I wouldn't come back to this place.
Deliciously W.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,5,1,5.0,10/9/2017,"Still of the most consistently delicious, fresh chopped salads.. service is always great."
John J.,"Tulsa, OK",130,161,36,3.0,7/24/2016,"I don't have anything in particular against The Cheesecake Factory, but I do think that it's extremely overrated. This restaurant is located on the outer ring around the parking lot at Woodland Hills Mall. It's typically very crowded and the seating is nothing special - quite a few tables have booth on one side and chairs on the other. We were very close to the table next to us and didn't really care to hear every word of their conversation or their children screaming. That being said, the food tastes very, very good. You can order a lot of different foods because it's an extensive menu and I've yet to eat something I didn't like. However, most of the food is exceptionally bad for you so I feel like it's cheating in a sense (give me some butter, sugar, and huge portions and I can make you something good, too). This establishment just seems bad for society. It's generally overpriced and I'm kind of surprised people consider this to be a fancy or nice restaurant - again, it's OK but you can find much better food in Tulsa for a better price. In closing, this restaurant is fine but there are many better options. The food and service are very good, but this isn't a particularly special dining experience."
Rebecca J.,"Tulsa, OK",2,20,,3.0,4/17/2017,"I remembered having great cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory, so I decided to go to the one next to Woodland Hills Mall. A family member and I went and picked up some pieces to go. While the service was fine and they were good after we got them home, the prices per slice gave me sticker shock. $7 for one slice of cheesecake? Really?  Next time I will make my own."
Michelle F.,"Jenks, OK",335,16,20,4.0,4/1/2017,"Pro AND Con: the menu is HUGE. There is so much to choose from that it can be a bit overwhelming.  My cocktail was one of the prettiest drinks I'd ever seen decorated with a pineapple slice and a strawberry.  We had the fried cheese as an appetizer. It came out in little squares and was adequate for two people.  I ordered the ""skinny"" salmon and veggies which was a Great substitute to the higher calorie menu! My son ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich which was ginormous!  Skipped Che cheesecake after seeing how many calories were in each slice! Some had close to 2,000 calories!!"
Anna F.,"Tulsa, OK",51,188,516,5.0,1/1/2016,"My cousin Leesa and I went here today for lunch to celebrate the New Year. It was packed because of New Years Day sales. She ordered a Sauvignon Blanc and I ordered a glass of Prosecco. For our entrees, she chose the herb crusted salmon with asparagus and a fruit bowl. I chose the lunch size fish and chips.  The food was delicious as always and we decided to get our cheesecakes to go. I ordered an OREO Dream Extreme, while she chose a Key Lime Pie. Our meal was delicious and we would definitely come back!"
Tess M.,"Tulsa, OK",188,179,205,2.0,4/18/2017,Of course this place is legit! It is the Cheesecake Factory. The menu is like a dictionary with 1000 choices but they are all good. Portions are huge so you could share. YOU.MUST.GET.CHEESECAKE! You can't live unless you get it! Great location and quite vibe. I dig it!
Davinah D.,"Rosemont, IL",4,2,,2.0,7/24/2017,"We travel from Northwest Arkansas (and anytime we are returning from Texas) to eat here at least twice a year. Love the food, enjoy the service (usually)... until today when we arrive and are told we can't have our dog sit with us on the patio. Excuse me but I just drove very far to get here, have a party of 5, but your restaurant has a policy to refuse dogs ON THE PATIO??!!! Guess this will be the last time we come."
Heathery H.,"Broken Arrow, OK",46,69,,4.0,12/5/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is a great place is you're looking for variety. Their menu is absolutely massive. As a vegetarian, I have multiple options. I really love their veggie pasta. I think it's called Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. Their cheesecakes are, of course, delicious. However, the price point is nearly highway robbery. $8 for a slice of cheesecake is just ridiculous if I'm being honest. I can see $5-6 as fair. It's good for a special occasion, but I can't see eating here regularly because of the pricing."
Kristi L.,"Ada, OK",34,48,21,4.0,3/17/2017,"As always this place was crazy busy. We only stopped in to get cheesecake to take back to the hotel. Cheesecake Factory, you never disappoint! It's way pricier than any food I'd normally eat, but come on, I don't eat cheesecake at 8PM every night.  Great food, good service and cool atmosphere for a date night."
Megan D.,"Chatsworth, CA",452,20,14,4.0,3/26/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory for their Sweet Corncake Tamales and Avocado Egg rolls (especially the sauce it comes with). It's one of those restaurants I turn to when I can't really decide where to go since they have a variety of dishes to choose from, but I always gravitate towards the Fettucini Alfredo, Steak Diane, or the Avocado Egg rolls. The flavor is always consistent and the service is always so quick and accurate. I also order their strawberry lemonade, it's so refreshing but it can be a bit too sweet, so I just add a little more water. I highly recommend their chocolate mousse cheesecake or the keylime one!"
John F.,"Chandler, AZ",1,38,2,1.0,3/6/2017,Once again my fellow yelpers have let me down. Every time I have been to a cheesecake factory the food is bland and lacking in taste.  On top of that the server is extremely slow when I am looking across at many empty tables.  I am done with this restaurant. How anyone can give 5 stars shows me they must eat TV dinners alot.  I have been to this chain and gotten the same results!
Andrea W.,"Blanchard, OK",92,10,1,2.0,3/12/2017,The hostesses were inefficient and the restaurant as a whole didn't seem able to keep up with the volume of customers.
Karin M.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",309,8,1,1.0,2/12/2017,Avocado egg rolls were good but i ordered a Chinese chicken salad to go and i get home and realize that they didn't give me any dressing to go as well. Yes awesome cool expensive lettuce but im not about to eat it with no dressing and now they are closed and im mad that i have no food to eat for my midnight snack so YEA im leaving Oklahoma tomorow and will never get my stupid dressing.
Roy A.,"Tulsa, OK",0,5,,3.0,3/7/2017,"As always the food is good, just watch out for the snarky young blond that seats you.   She was terribly rude to my party, leaving me to wonder why she allowed to have a customer service job."
Elaine P.,"Flint, TX",48,11,17,5.0,2/13/2017,"As always, great food and lots of it. We had the chicken bellagio, chicken marsala, salmon and a burger. Plus Cheeaecake!!!  It was all fantastic! At Cheesecake Factory, consistency is key. Each restaurant has the same great food."
Nadine S.,"Calgary, Canada",2,32,48,2.0,7/19/2015,"Partner and I came in just for cheesecake around 9 PM. We were seated immediately, which I've been told is unusual as it's normally very busy. Our waitress seemed very displeased upon learning that we would only be having cheesecake and continued to make her displeasure obvious throughout the rest of our visit. I ordered the Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake and my partner ordered the Snickers cheesecake. Our cheesecake came about 10 minutes after we ordered. Both cheesecakes were warm - I didn't have a basis for comparison, but my partner told me that they are usually chilled. My cheesecake looked like it had melted a bit, but the other one looked fine. Both tasted very good despite the warmth. Our waitress refilled our drinks very frequently, but barely spoke a word. About two bites into our cheesecake, she dropped off our bill and said ""no rush"" in a tone that sounded quite agitated. Her negative demeanour put a damper on the experience, as we felt quite rushed after that. Overall, not a great experience. My partner assures me that his previous experiences have been excellent, but I don't think I'll be back."
Jamie B.,"Chandler, AZ",296,404,726,4.0,8/29/2015,You can never go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory.  I was happy to see this close to my hotel and that it has late hours.  Both the food and service were great.  We dined here twice while we were in town.
Crystal C.,"Tulsa, OK",67,598,206,3.0,9/8/2015,"Pros: my friend has never been here before. I explained this place as ""they probably have over 50+ different offerings of American, Italian, and Asian food. And a bunch of different types of cheesecake."" Cons: took her 20 minutes to look over menu and pick something to eat. They stopped serving my go to order of shrimp BLT. Got the spicy Cajun pasta instead. It was decent. Friend got some kind of salad.  It was OK."
A. J.,"Flagstaff, AZ",4,301,5,5.0,6/15/2017,"So, why give a chain restaurant 5 stars? We had some excellent service! We wanted to so happy hour apps and that is usually at the bar,but we had a 2 year old and an infant with us. The hostess found a way to make it work. Then the two year old decided to pitch a two year old fit. A waitress stopped back, acting oblivious to the noise, and asked how old the child was. She said she has a two year old and finds a plate of chopped fruit settles her kid down and could she bring us some? She was so nonjudgemental and kind, and it worked like a charm. The Cuban rolls were great as was the pear gorgonzola flat bread. The crab balls were overdone. All the cheesecakes were great. But the kindness of the waitress (she wasn't even assigned to us) was the best part."
Christy B.,"Siloam Springs, AR",0,35,1,4.0,11/22/2016,The service was slow! When we arrived it was before the dinner rush so we expected more attention but this was not the case. The manager had to help the waitress and we had to ask several times for desert. We really had hoped for better service.
John B.,"Jenks, OK",0,8,,1.0,12/10/2016,Place looks nice but what a joke. I had a hamburger which I tasted ok until I bit into the gristle. Burger came with no condiments 5 minutes wait. The ketchup came in a 1/2 dollar size dish 3/8 inch deep. Just enough for the hamburger. So 5 more minutes for more ketchup for fries this time even smaller 8 fries later 5 more minutes for more ketchup. Ask to look at cheesecake and they gave us a menu to share. Wife went to get another 20 minutes later taking cheesecake to go sick if this place.
Sol R.,"Tulsa, OK",0,7,2,1.0,11/16/2016,Went there on a weekend night with my s/o we werent given an option between a booth or table. Our server checked in on us once after taking our order. Meanwhile many servers kept rush from the kitchen and the floor near us making us more and more anxious to leave. Pasta was amazing but the service was terrible so I won't be returning.
Cindy D.,"Tulsa, OK",198,139,591,5.0,10/28/2014,"This was a very pleasant meal and very delicious. I ordered a chicken biscuit which was absolutely wonderful. We had a crab and artichoke dip for a starter, also absolutely yummy!  And for dessertfor dessert, we had pumpkin cheesecake, which was very very good. Our server was attentive. She suggested great food. And kept all our drinks full.  I Will definitely come back."
Gary H.,"Guymon, OK",0,8,,5.0,4/7/2017,"The Best food, choices, and certainly deserts!  The parmigiana chicken is INCREDIBLE!"
Debbie B.,"Owasso, OK",7,25,33,5.0,4/4/2016,"This is our first time. Perfection.. We had the cheese pizza, Chicken and biscuits,  and I had the Chicken Farfalle. . The blueberry mojito was awesome!"
Senie S.,"Tulsa, OK",39,161,169,3.0,9/11/2014,"I go here quite a bit since it is by the mall and they have so many food options you will always find something to eat. I have been to Cheesecake Factories all over the country and this place is not anything special. I mean it is a chain restaurant, and even though they ""specialize"" in cheesecake it is still not made in house and shipped in frozen from a company for you to order. Regardless, the cheesecake is pretty good and i stop by here sometimes for just dessert.  The service here is also pretty decent- I mean they are all mostly younger kids in school working here as a part time job so you really cannot expect much. If you are looking for a place to grab food  and also has a dish for everyone this is a good place. The prices are fair and the portions are huge. I personally just never leave here after eating feeling good about what i consumed.  Don't forget they also have national cheesecake day where you get cheesecake for half off!!!"
Kevin C.,"Long Beach, CA",24,7,19,1.0,2/1/2015,"I have eaten here 10+ times.  Always great service.  I had to ask for bread, I had to ask twice for sugar for tea.   I am so disgusted. We haven't got our food yet and I want to leave.  My wife that just had brain surgery two weeks ago wants Cheesecake or I would."
Joel D.,"Kingwood, TX",3,25,16,5.0,7/22/2016,Awesome Food & Cheesecake!!! Ceaser Salad Is Awesome & The Chocolate Mousse CheeseCake Is Awesome! Close By The Mabee Center Where I Had To Go!
Tyra H.,"Tulsa, OK",7,5,12,5.0,11/15/2015,"Great atmosphere, a bit dark but my eyes are sensitive to bright light so that was a plus. The service was excellent. The food ordered was a giant portion and I took half home as well as my party."
