Joseph D.,"Martinez, CA",8,117,13,4.0,9/14/2013,"Bar staff was good. He kept out drinks filled and was friendly. I had a chicken dish, I think chicken marisala, he said it was a hot seller and I can see why! It was fantastic. The mashed potatoes were perfect, the chicken cooked just right and the sauce with mushrooms was creamy and had a great flavor."
James W.,"Canadian, OK",1,16,1,5.0,1/3/2015,"What can be said that hadn't already been said? Nothing, everyone in my family loves it. The service is great, the menu is a book that has something for everyone, really everyone, no really e v e r y o n e, the food is thought out and very good, the portions are unreal so there is alway something to take home. Good luck on choosing cheesecake cause it's all good (you'll be taking that home too). It's usually busy and there's some wait time to get seated, so plan a little time for it if your like us and drive from the country to Tulsa to shop."
The S.,"Queens, NY",1,16,,2.0,9/7/2013,"The service was doting and excellent. The food, unfortunately, was horrific. I ordered chipped beef sandwich and it was the saltiest thing that I ever put in my mouth. My wife ordered fish tacos and she seemed had the opposite problem--no flavor at all. I've heard good things about this Cheesecake Factory before so I'm hoping it was a chef's error. My meal left me in physical pain, however, and after that I won't be back."
Adrian A.,"Tulsa, OK",1,7,2,5.0,9/21/2014,Cheesecake factory is one of the best restaurants in the Tulsa area. The Tuscan chicken is outstanding!
Nathan B.,"Ocala, FL",41,208,96,5.0,6/15/2012,"Most excellent meal for our first time. Had the shepherds pie. Very good but different spin on what I'm used to in shepherds pie. Only thing I didn't particularly like is the lightning. It was very dark and hard to read the menu which nicknamed the ""phone book"". The cheesecakes my gawd don't know how many they had but the mango key lime was excellent."
Natalie D.,"Tulsa, OK",51,168,55,4.0,6/10/2013,"Evelyn's Favorite Pasta is good. Corey, our server, is great."
Tania H.,"Austin, TX",55,246,403,2.0,9/17/2009,"So maybe I went on a week night and things were not up to par... The Cheesecake Factory is always beautiful with a huge menu etc... But I was there alone on a business trip, got sat in the bar area and then it took roughly 15mn for someone to come over and ask if I needed any water!  After that, service was sketchy at best, but my appetizer was great, my bread showed up with my meal, and my Endives/Pear salad looked like a heap of lettuce with shreds of endives and some sort of candied pears...   I guess it wasn't what I expected... and it was a LOT of not what i expected."
Scott D.,"Houston, TX",73,171,150,4.0,7/26/2009,"You always know what you're getting with Cheesecake Factory: fresh-made food at a chain restaurant and portions large enough to feed an army of horses. We started with the ahi carpaccio which is always delicious, especially when the kitchen goes light on the mayo-based drizzle. The Pasta Da Vinci was a savory, splittable second course.  Of course, the cheesecake is a nice cap on any meal (try Vanilla Bean or Macadamia Nut), but dessert is overpriced."
Nix F.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,16,,4.0,7/28/2009,"It's Sunday, and the church crowd is hungry. You'd think service at a restaurant like the Cheesecake Factory would be painful and asinine to attempt.  Well, we decided to bravely attempt it anyway, and were surprised.  Upon arriving, we noticed the parking lot was full.This and the plethora of people dressed in formal is always discouraging; however, to our surprise, we were hastily seated.  Our waiter was flooded with other tables, but we still received much attention  What made this a great experience was the fact that even during their busiest time they still manage to offer great service."
Christina B.,"Brooklyn, NY",36,105,1,4.0,6/2/2011,"We don't have one of these in nyc, so I always go when I am on vacation.  I almost always get the same things--either the Cajun Chicken Jambalaya or the Crusted Chicken Romano, and of course, I split a slice of cheesecake (usually picking whatever the special is).  I love this place."
Tatiana D.,"Palmdale, CA",24,85,4,4.0,1/29/2009,"See, here's how I see CCF. There was one in Pasadena,CA so whenever I took the drive over the bridge from Glendale, I would walk down Colorado to window shop and check  things out. Night outings would show me a crowded lobby of the CCF there. A table would take at least a 50 minute wait. So when I visited last, my dear friend and I wanted to dine here and due to the wait, we instead dined at Louise's across the way. So, the wait has never been an issue (except the last time, I was 5 months pregnant with son #2 and I was hungry!). Also, the wait has never been news to me. If you want to go on a Friday night date night and want to eat here, you have to be prepared for a wait or go early.  Now, onto the food.... delicious. The only thing is there is so much on the menu, it is hard to decided waht to order. But once you do, it is awesome. I haven't had anything bad here."
Cheryl P.,"Fresno, CA",0,7,,4.0,5/20/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is just what it is food wise, but what made my time there tonight was the service.  Richie our server was so friendly and accommodating, despite numerous special requests from my ""high maintenance"" co-workers.  In fact one of the ""skinny"" drinks was returned because it tasted funny and Jacob, the manager, came over, talked to my co-worker to get what she wanted, just as she wanted it.  Both Richie and Jacob made this a great dining experience!"
Rebecca F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",162,79,40,3.0,1/2/2009,"The food is awesome. Seriously- five star food. But... I have to take into account everything else, so three stars it is.  The place is HUGE. Too big. I know it's nice to be able to get a table more quickly, but the tables are so close together you might as well pull up a chair at the table next to you. It's weird. You feel like whispering because it seems inappropriate to talk at an audible volume with strangers so close to you. Let's say you get a booth. Score! The booths are HUGE. You must have a family of nine, because the booths are large enough to accomodate a mid-size sedan and are usually filled with children. So many children. (Plight of going south in Tulsa, I suppose.) Here's the next awful thing: The menus are HUGE. They make close to every style of every dish ever. The thing is, the menus don't just have food in them- they have advertisements. I'll repeat that- ad-ver-tise-ments. It's offensive. I should be eating for free if they're getting paid by advertisers just to have me look at their menu.  Lastly, and I know this is nit-picky but I'm a Virgo, the waitstaff is forced to dress in white. Do you know how hard it is to find white pants? They look awful on everyone, they have a touch of the dingies and I feel so bad for these people to have to have more than one pair. Although, the young man who was serving us smelled as if he didn't worry about having backups or washing the current pair of choice. Excellent. Good food, but is it worth selling your soul? That's for you to decide I suppose. I did love the primavera......."
Ryan F.,"Tulsa, OK",1,9,,4.0,8/1/2009,"Despite being packed from open to close, The Cheesecake Factory is one of the classier, finer places where one can make a reservation. It is a chain, but it sets many standards to which others can follow. The presentation is very elaborate and well-maintained, and the service is professional. The staff truly make the place what it is. Were it any less, I would liken it to the flighty service (if one can call it 'service') from, say, TGIFriday's. The real shame is that even in a place like the Factory, where half of the people attending have the good sense to dress at least somewhat nicely, the rest just show up in hoodies and coveralls and moo-moos and the like. It's a great place, really. The location just seems to give people the impression that they should just come in the same clothes that they wore when they went next door: the mall. The food is magnificent. My appetizer was the pot stickers, and my main course was the most expensive item on the menu: the filet mignon. For any who can appreciate a good steak, I highly recommend it. I ordered mine well-done, and the mark of any good chef, in my opinion, is their ability to cook a steak to order. It seems simple, yet so many get it wrong. A steak cooked well is my favorite, yet it seems to be the biggest challenge for those in the kitchen due to the fact that I almost always have to send it back in because it's red. (Even still, once I get it back, chances are good that when I cut in, it'll still be red.) No such problem here. Upon cutting in, the meat was perfectly done, and not to the point where the chef merely left it on the grill to ""make sure"" it was done before serving it to me, effectively drying out the piece of meat as I had suffered through in other restaurants. It had no color, and it retained its juice. Needless to say, I was extremely impressed. I cleaned my plate, despite the gargantuan helping I'd been served, and I'd gone through roughly two or three Cokes. With my eyes being bigger than my stomach, I ordered the Linda's Fudge Cake for dessert, which, looking back, was a mistake. The cake weighed in at a massive six layers, with the slab of chocolate nearly taking up most of the plate, with three large puffs of heavy whipped cream lined up at the edge of the cake. Word to the wise: the whipped cream is just as rich and heavy as ice cream, and the cake is possibly the most succulent piece the bakery has to offer. I didn't finish, but the waiter was more than willing to take it back and box it up for me. This is a nice service-- if you don't finish your meal, you won't have to worry about taking your plate and clumsily letting your main course or dessert tumble inside, losing what form it may have. It is done for you. Don't overlook The Cheesecake Factory, even if you don't like cheesecake."
Laken G.,"Tulsa, OK",11,21,5,1.0,6/17/2009,The cheesecake is wonderful.   Service was absolutely horrid!!  We will never eat at The Cheesecake Factory again!
Josh G.,"Broken Arrow, OK",26,45,79,4.0,4/18/2010,"I chose this past weekend to take my wife out on a date, unknowing that it was prom night. Oops. Big mistake right? Wrong. I was surprised when I called ahead ( from my Yelp BB app) that the wait was only 30 minutes, so we decided to risk the limos, makeup, and pimples. Walking in the decor is amazing.  It has the look of a very fancy upscale restaurant. Definately a plus when taking the Ms. out on the town. The waiting area left us a little cramped, but I'll give them that on prom night. Lets just say they were busy. Our wait was just around what we were quoted and we sat down in a private booth got to business. Drinks- Strawberry lemonade that was rediculous. I had heard the lemonades were good, but this was lemonade heaven.  She had the avacado chicken club. A mammoth sandwich packed with chicken, avacados, tomatoes, etc. I thought it lacked a little on dressing but it was good. I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Bow tie pasta in a southern spicy sauce with what looked liked southern style chicken fingers on top. The portion was more than I could finish. The flavor was similar to Outback's Toowoomba Pasta, and the chicken complemented the sauce well. Dessert was the Banana Creme Cheesecake.  Cheesecake with a banana creme topping, whip cream and sliced bananas. Do I need to explain it? Overall I liked this place and will be back. Good service, good food, great atmosphere."
Cassie M.,"Bentonville, AR",177,418,1724,5.0,12/19/2007,"One of my favorite restaurant chains and this was in no exception. The menu is a book of many delicious items and so many different choices. I tend to lean toward ordering what I know. The Chicken Madeira- Sauteed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese, Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce.  Served with Mashed Potatoes. YUM. Order a strawberry martini-they infuse fresh strawberries with Ketel One vodka, hand crafted per order. Stout but awesome-you can see the seeds floating in your drink and I always finish off with White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake. So rich and by the point, you are stuffed but you have to have cheesecake. So, eat half your meal, take the rest home and always make room for dessert. I have attached pics of my last meal as described here. The only bad thing...prepare to wait!!! Everytime I have been here (3 times in last two months) the lobby is standing room, body to body of people waiting and its usually an hour."
Olivia D.,"Coffeyville, KS",11,106,25,3.0,10/19/2010,Typical chain food. Not bad.. The best and only reason we go to the cheesecake factory .... the cheesecake .. duhhh...
John B.,"Carthage, MO",33,152,148,5.0,8/31/2010,Caramel Chicken is so good. Enough food to split. Excellent service.
Lisa N.,"Tulsa, OK",6,11,25,1.0,4/18/2010,I been here twice already and I have had the worst luck possible. The first time the service just sucked. The second time everything I ordered was out. They took 15 minutes to tell me they didn't have any tuna left. I would never come back again.
