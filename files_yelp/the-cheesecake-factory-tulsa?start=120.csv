Dana S.,"Juneau, AK",1,97,4,5.0,8/4/2009,"I love this restaurant!  Fantastic selection, excellent food quality, good service, big portion sizes, decent prices, wonderful cheesecake, you can't go wrong.  I wish we had one of these where I live.  I got an appetizer for my main meal and didn't even finish it, then got some cheesecake and didn't finish it either, so I had plenty left over which is cool."
Ken H.,"Tulsa, OK",10,83,,3.0,6/19/2008,"A huge menu -- I mean the selection is awesome -- and great food presentation.  Too bad the food itself doesn't quite live up to the reputation as often as not.  The serving sizes are far more than the average person can eat, so plan to take some home -- you definitely are paying for it!  The tab at Cheesecake Factory always manages to be considerably more than you had planned to spend.  Great decor.  Loud.  Busy.  Over-rated."
