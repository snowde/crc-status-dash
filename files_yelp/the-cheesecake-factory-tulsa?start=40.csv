Haley K.,"Langley, OK",7,42,,3.0,10/23/2015,"The pros: My salmon was good, a tiny bit dry, served with tartar sauce which is unusual with salmon but turned out to be pretty good. Good mashed potatoes, broccoli was steamed just right. I really like the bread. Big portions mean at least one meal of leftovers at home.  The cons: Far too many items on the menu. Seriously, less than a quarter of that would be preferable, I think the quality would be higher.  There is an ""original"" (plain) cheesecake, and there is a ""fresh strawberry"" cheesecake. The strawberries are glazed on that one (ew). They wanted to charge me more than a couple dollars to sub fresh (non-glazed) berries for the glazed ones. Nope. That's dumb. Kinda soured the experience for me. We spent $67 (before tip) on dinner for two people, and they couldn't put un-glazed berries on dessert? Service was about a 7/10.  Still pretty good dinner, but there are other places in Tulsa I'd rather spend that much money on."
Jon P.,"Broken Arrow, OK",4184,123,223,5.0,2/10/2016,"Five stars without question. Stopped in for lunch today and had the steak diane which was very tender medallions of certified angus beef steak covered with black peppercorns and a rich mushroom wine sauce, served with mash and grilled onions. By far the best chain steak I've had in a long time, and coming from the Cheesecake Factory who would have thunk. The staple strawberry cheesecake was bursting with flavor as would be expected. There are some menu items you probably would not order at this type of restaurant, but there's enough of a variety that your bound to find something very good off of the menu. Nice clean restaurant with great service and atmosphere."
Natalie N.,"Midtown, Tulsa, OK",0,7,,5.0,8/12/2015,The best food hands down! The appetizer firecracker salmon is amazing! The portions are huge when I was expecting maybe 2-3 fish tacos but it came with 4 big ones! There was a mix up with our meal and the manager came out got on our level and apologized. He threw in a free slice of cheesecake that topped the night off! I also highly suggest getting the blueberry mojito! We will be returning for our next date night!
Amanda S.,"Tulsa, OK",88,150,166,4.0,3/15/2014,"It's hard to find fault with a place that has a novel for a menu - unless it's one of those places that has 1,000 menu items and does all of them poorly. The Cheesecake Factory does a nice job of having a variety of menu items and does them well - even the pasta is cooked acceptably.   As far as the Cheesecake...I am not sure I've ever had it. Famous for their crazily caloric portions, I'm not sure how one leaves room for desert at this establishment. They all look good and there is an amazing variety.  Maybe everyone orders off the ""skinny"" menu and saves room that way? I give props to them for creating a menu of lighter, healthier options, but honestly I didn't look at that menu. I don't go to an establishment like this to eat baked chicken or steamed fish. Did I mention the portions are enormous? The crab wontons are delicious and easily enough for a table of four.  The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is quite yummy - parmesan breaded chicken, spicy creamy sauce, and bow tie pasta with peppers, what's not to like? Get ready for a to go box and lunch the next day! Items like the chicken tacos are also yummy...honestly, there are so many items on this menu you'd have to be a hardcore regular to try them all.  One of these days, I'm going to get a cheesecake to go, just so I can feel like I had the whole experience!"
Ronda M.,"Lutz, FL",260,20,14,5.0,6/24/2016,Enjoyed the great service!Thai lettuce wraps are my favorite.Need to make sure your getting the wraps and not the Thai tacos.I didn't understand and got the taco's.Both are delicious the taco's are all assembled and you don't build your own and less messy.
Jessica D.,"Fort Smith, AR",3,17,69,5.0,7/3/2015,Big location with good customer service and very friendly staff. I wasnt sure what to get and our waitress  was knowledgeable  and recommended a few different things. I ordered the stuffed tortilla and it was amazing. My son ordered the mac and cheese  burger and he loved it. Of course no meal can be complete at the cheesecake  factory  without dessert. We opted to share the white chocolate  macadamia cheesecake  and it was amazeballs!
Ted S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",497,177,140,4.0,12/31/2014,You know what you're going to get when you come to a Cheesecake Factory. The menu is vast and the quality is level across the board. I can't remember ever ordering a meal here that I didn't enjoy. I'm recently in a depression since they removed the Ahi Tuna Roll from the menu. I had a soul connection with that appetizer.. The wait staff here are always on their A game. Enjoyed myself immensely and I'm coming back whether they like it or not.
Serena T.,"Tulsa, OK",4,19,,4.0,4/16/2015,"I had pretty low expectations for this place, but it was actually pretty good. I've had bad experiences at so many non fast food restaurant chains so I try to keep my expectations in check. The wait time was insane, definitely make a reservation. Avoid the weekend if you can.  The service was good, our waiter was attentive and helpful despite how packed the place was. The chicken parmesan was delicious and the portions were generous.  The main meal was good, but the cheesecake was the best part. So good! I recommend the s'mores cheesecake.  All in all, don't expect a fancy gourmet meal at the Cheesecake Factory and you will enjoy it. It's a bit expensive but the food is much better than what you get at Applebee's, Olive Garden, Chili's, Abuelo's, etc."
Jes N.,"Tulsa, OK",2,10,,3.0,8/30/2015,"Stick to what the name says, Cheesecake.  That was the only food that was prepared how it should be. The key lime cheesecake and red velvet cheesecake are to die for. But as for the man course dinner, I was disappointed to say the least. I got the shrimp and chicken gumbo with white rice, the flavor was good if you could get past the huge chunks of fake tasting rehydrated peppers. My wife ordered the fish tacos with black and cilantro rice. The black beans tasted as if they were straight from a can and were also quite cold, and the rice was clumped together like it had been sitting all day, also cold. And the ""crispy"" fish was soggy from all the grease. Horrible food experience, service was desent, but will only be back for cheesecake."
Kumar K.,"Bartlesville, OK",5,21,65,5.0,11/2/2014,"We have been to this CCF with family 4-5 times over the past two years. Every time we are satisfied with their ambiance, service, selection and quality of food. This makes us wonder why we don't go there more often! Must be because they are so busy all the time and we don't want to wait. This time they surprised us when we were able to make a reservation!  Hope that this was not a fluke."
Iris F.,"Highland Park, Los Angeles, CA",8,3,1,4.0,3/7/2016,"I love their appetizer bread soooooo much, haha! Surely, the cheese cake is the most popular in their menu! I always get a velvet cake when I come every time!"
Anna O.,"Las Vegas, NV",104,3,,5.0,3/19/2016,Great experience! Came in with the whole family and our service was excellent! Plus great food and huge portions!! Must save room for cheesecake of course! Will be going back next time in town :)
Megan S.,"Tulsa, OK",19,34,14,4.0,1/11/2014,"First time I went I had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta (Chicken Breast Lightly Breaded and Sautéed to a Crisp Golden Brown. Served with Lemon Sauce, Mashed Potatoes and Fresh Asparagus). It was everything I hoped it would be. The lemon sauce was to die for. My boyfriend got a burger & fries, the fries are really good and for all you ranch connoisseurs, this is the GOOD ranch! The menu is a novel, I suggested checking out the online menu first so you have an idea of what they have if it's your first time going. Second & third time I went I had the Chicken and Biscuits (Sauteed Chicken Breasts Covered with a Rich Pan Gravy, Served with Our Mashed Potatoes, Vegetables and the ""Best"" Buttermilk Biscuit). It definitely is a ""Comfort Classic"". Portion size is huge, so you might wanna share.  Oh yeah... the cheesecake is awesome too."
Larry K.,"Dayton, OH",12,40,10,5.0,10/23/2015,"I've never had a bad experiences at the cheesecake factory. Great food, great waitors. Only thing is they told me they were out of Turkey cause of avian flu. Which must've been an inside joke because the next day I went to Arby's and had a Turkey sandwhich. It sounds as through they ran out and Ned to anticipate better on stocking turkey meat."
Alex C.,"Pryor Creek, OK",0,2,,5.0,3/7/2016,"Excellent food and good service. My husband and I are here on a Friday night so there was a long wait time, about an hour and a half, and I feel like the restaurant was way over capacity with all the people waiting. But I was expecting a long wait on a Friday at 7pm. I ordered the parmesan herb crusted chicken with green beans and mashed potatoes, my husband got a bacon cheese burger and fries. The food was all amazing, I couldn't finish my meal and brought half of it home. We ordered our cheesecakes to go but had to try them in store. I got the red velvet cake cheesecake and hubby got the Oreo dream cheesecake. Both were phenomenal, huge pieces, and the taste was to die for. It was my first time eating there and I was not disappointed! Will be back many more times!!"
Josh C.,"Gentry, AR",41,195,22,2.0,7/12/2014,"First time at a Cheesecake Factory. The restaurant is beautiful inside, and we were seated quickly on a Saturday afternoon. Then we realized that the decorations that were intended to look like torches around the dining room looked very much like the Eye of Sauron from the Lord of the Rings. Our server was less than interested in helping our party of six decipher the enormous menu, that had more items on it than I have ever experienced before. It is so large that when we were telling each other about entrees we had to reference it with a page number. I had the seared tuna salad, and it was good, everyone's food was good, the cheesecake was good, but it was all expensive. Our server kept the drinks full, but not very nice at all. I doubt we come back for a long time."
Brent H.,"Tulsa, OK",82,16,2,4.0,9/8/2014,My wife and I had dinner and dessert on Sunday night. The hostess seated us immediately and the wait staff was very quick and very responsive. We've been several times before and the hardest part is deciding what to get on their very broad menu. Because we knew we wanted dessert we passed on the appetizer and settled for the Cuban and Italian Sandwiches. Both were awesome.  We ordered the sweet potatoe fries and they came out hot and delicious. We splurged and each had a slice of cheescake. My wife ordered the chocolate variety (can't remember exactly which one) and it was so rich! I wanted the Key Lime but the waiter returned and said it was frozen and not available. Sad. I settled on the Mango-Key Lime and it was pretty good.....but I really wanted the Key Lime. We left very full and pleased with the evening.
Dea D.,"Kansas City, MO",47,113,264,4.0,5/6/2014,"Have been here a few times and have enjoyed it tremendously. Haven't had any complains on their food, It's always fresh and well cooked. I find myself wanting to try something different on their menu but I keep going back to the same thing! Their sirloin is very juicy and tender..Their loaded mashed potatoes is delicious, and you get two types of breads upon your entire visit, one is sourdough and the other is wheat bread. If you haven't tried their fried macaroni balls then you should definitely ask for them. They are quite large and you get 4 on a plate with an excellent type of marinara sauce. It's not a cheap restaurant at all. My fiance & I both get the same thing (sirloin steak, mashed potatoes, and the macaroni appetizer and our bill is usually $60 (without tip) and if we both get 1 slice of cheesecake each then it runs around $70-$80 Reason i'm rating this a 4 star is because i am a fan of this restaurant, their food is amazing and the staff is always nice and the overall appearance of the place is nice and clean. The 5th star it's lacking is the price, there's not a lot of decent places that have great food and service quite like the cheesecake factory, but it's hard to go when your on a tight budget. They do have outdoor seating that usually isn't packed like it is inside. If it's going to be a bit chilly out then it's ok because they have tall heaters that keep you nice and toasty."
Lori G.,"Edmonds, WA",4,8,9,5.0,8/20/2014,"I love this place for date night or girls' lunch out.  I always get the Thai chicken lettuce wraps and I save room for dessert.  I love the service and the ambiance. For lunch, arriving right at 11 gets immediate seating."
Amber Lynn W.,"Tulsa, OK",0,3,,4.0,2/1/2016,"Quality of the food has seriously gone down while the price has gone up. The portions have also gotten smaller. I only go for the dessert. I am a huge fan of the key lime pie cheesecake and the caramel pecan ""turtle"" cheesecake. You really can't go wrong with any cheesecake there, the actual entrees though are another story. The ambiance is beautiful there, as always."
