Holly D.,"Tulsa, OK",0,3,,1.0,7/5/2016,"Went in for an early dinner and it was not even busy...had TERRIBLE service!  Staff were unattentive and barely checked on us.  It took forever to get our food and it was cold when it arrived...I mean COLD!  When I complained to the server he nodded and simply said ""OK.""  He then walked away and only returned to give us the bill.  I work too hard for my money to come into a place like this and have it taken for low end service!  Sadly I will not be coming back!"
Shannon B.,"Phoenix, AZ",179,274,251,2.0,7/6/2012,"If you have a large group and some picky eaters with you, Cheesecake Factory has everything!  I've been to several CFs and am not really a fan of their non-specialty menu. I feel like if a restaurant wants to do something really great, it will narrow down its options, but that's just my opinion.   Do NOT order salad at CF! They are totally worthless and not worth the $9-10 or whatever the cost is. I don't know why I don't remember this each time. If you order any type of salad, it appears huge...it's mostly filled with maybe 3-4 cups of iceberg/some romaine lettuce. Whatever the salad was advertised as (i.e. roasted veg, chicken, etc), that particular topping might be in the quantity of 1/8 to 1/4 cup. So you're paying for iceberg lettuce.   My mom ordered some chicken tacos from their SkinnyLicious (or whatever it's called) menu and enjoyed them.  Besides my crappy salad that was maybe 100 calories and did not fill me up, I ordered an egg, tomato and English muffin. The eggs appeared to be powdered eggs (that odd yellow color), but I could be wrong. The tomato was surprisingly good for a chain restaurant and muffin just OK.  Everything I've eaten here on this visit and others is just OK.  I've ordered the Vietnamese spring rolls wasn't all that impressed. IMO, the cheesecake is too waxy and I prefer homemade. The service, however, was great. Our server was happy and pleasant and came by numerous times.  She did an excellent job!"
Jessica D.,"Oklahoma City, OK",9,5,,4.0,12/2/2015,My husband says this is the best food he's had in Tulsa since we moved here. He is in love with the fish tacos. I had the chicken medeira and it was good. Cheesecake was superb.
Chris A.,"Tulsa, OK",12,28,10,5.0,5/30/2015,"Surprisingly all around excellent. Excellent staff, excellent waiter, and excellent food. I had the loaded potato soup. I cannot imagine it being more excellent. Everyone was pleased and the place was packed on a Saturday. After eating at The Rusty Crane, I have to say this place kicks that place squarely in the nuts, and it's a chain. Oh, not a fair comparison? You're right because TRC is just that inferior. Sorry..."
Sarah M.,"Manhattan, KS",4,15,6,4.0,10/3/2015,"Bread is brought to the table at the start, one white choice and one brown choice.  I have no idea what kind they are, but the brown bread was some of the most delicious bread I've ever had.  It was sweet and soft, but not in a weird way. The white bread was extraordinarily average.  I enjoyed the Carbonara with chicken, but the order came out wrong (I specified no peas.)  Also, our appetizer, nachos with spicy chicken, came out after our pasta, so the manager offered us a free piece of cheesecake. We ended up getting the Hershey's chocolate, and it was delicious. Overall, the food was really good, and our waitress seemed very nice.  There seemed to be miscommunication among other servers and runners, and that's what caused our lapse in service."
Kay T.,"Muskogee, OK",0,22,,2.0,11/10/2014,It's alright  The food is average  The service is average  The cheese cake is average for $8 $40 before tip for 2 people and well I know of better place to go eat for less
Amanda M.,"London, United Kingdom",1010,790,4374,4.0,12/2/2011,"I'm sure all the Cheesecake Factories are incredible. At this one I ordered the quesadillas, which were, naturally, fantastic. Then I had the banana cream cheesecake (I'm having a hard time ordering anything else because it's just too amazing)... and it was.... can you guess? Amazing! hahaha! Yep, this place is great. I'll be back"
Brittany S.,"Broken Arrow, OK",2,10,8,2.0,3/28/2014,"This is the second time I've been here and this is the second time I have not been impressed. The wait wasn't too long, but the hostess and front staff did not look organized and sat our party at a table meant for a different party.  Then, it took forever to order and even longer to get the food. The food has large portions, but the food was decent."
Bobby B.,"Shawnee, OK",1,7,1,4.0,7/7/2015,"I know, it is a chain. Yes, it is true, if you've been to one Cheesecake Factory you've been to them all. This is truly a very good and quite underappreciated thing. I've been to this restaurant in seven different states. They have mastered the art of consistency. Service is great and the food is great, always."
Sarah B.,"Tulsa, OK",6,44,177,3.0,5/13/2015,"Been here more than once.. The atmosphere is great, love the dim lighting and big booths. I would say that Cheesecake Factory is just an overrated chain restaurant..Everytime we come here the service isn't that great, the food is just average which you pay too much for.. Tables sticky more than once already...I have a few favorite meals and cakes I like to get, but every time I order some items it seems they get worse with every try.. For example the last time I ordered the factory nachos they didn't have enough flavor..were too soggy and the chicken was too chewy and over cooked.. Too salty.. Won't be ordering that anymore. What our favorite thing to come here is for just coffee or tea with a cake or cheesecake."
Tania P.,"Tulsa, OK",27,18,20,5.0,6/7/2014,"We are pretty frequent guests here - it's close to the mall and so it's convenient to relax here with a glass of wine after long day of shopping :)) the menu is sooo big - you can try something new every time. But our favorite here is margarita pizza with a thin crust and amazing flavor, melts in your mouth!!! It's a perfect appetizer for 2-3 people or a lunch as a whole. Also Ahi Carpaccio is delicious. They are pretty busy usually, but thankfully we never had to wait for a table - they have plenty of seating. And service is pretty fast too."
Matt M.,"Stevens Point, WI",1,39,162,5.0,2/19/2014,"Banana cream cheesecake topped off our Asian chicken lettuce wraps and chicken quesadillas. The sauces with the wraps were a peanut ginger and very good, along with the sweet chili. The quesadillas had a generous portion of guacamole, picante and sour cream. Very good. Cheesecake Factory rarely gets it wrong!"
Mandy H.,"Tulsa, OK",9,1,,5.0,9/11/2015,"First time here! Absolutely love it! Our server, Barbara, is amazing! And the food is to die for. We'll be back very soon!"
Angela D.,"Rogers, AR",1,17,,4.0,4/29/2015,"I've been wanting to try this place for a while (Thanks, Big Bang Theory). There's not one close to where I live. My boyfriend and I had a date day (since Tulsa is only about 2 hours from where we live)and decided to stop here after walking around the zoo all day. It was wonderful. The menu is very diverse, the service is excellent and our food was perfect. The boyfriend got one of the Glamburgers and I got the grilled turkey burger. For dessert, we shared the Kahlua cheesecake, the apple crumble cheesecake (I can't remember the actual name) and a double shot of espresso. So glad we decided to try the place. Looking forward to a location in NW Arkansas. :)"
Jill H.,"Rogers, AR",9,3,4,2.0,8/15/2015,"So disappointed in the Factory. We get to Tulsa a couple times a year and always go to Cheesecake Factory.  The lunch menu items although nicely proportioned did not have the usual quality and taste.  My lettuce was actually wilted and water soaked.  Fries with burger also soggy.  Burger did not have its usual excellent flavor.   Ordered three different kinds of cheesecake, all tasted like they had been in the case for way too long.  Not sure what is happening here. As they are always busy. Quality control needs to be examined.  Wish I could rave here but not worthy."
Brian N.,"Castle Rock, CO",203,5,,5.0,6/9/2015,We love this place!!  It is our go-to pit stop in the Tulsa area.  Wait staff and food are always wonderful!
Dustin E.,"Tulsa, OK",130,183,528,4.0,3/23/2010,"This is definitely one of Tulsa's better dining establishments. The food is almost always delicious, and the portions are huge, so you have leftovers for lunch the next day. The mini corn dogs and corn fritters are great appetizers, both fried, both satisfying with light breading. I recently tried the Cajun jambalaya pasta for the first time, and I was very happy with it. The sauce had a little heat, but not too spicy. The veggies really complimented the dish, and the shrimp was the best part. If you're going for dessert, you should try the red velvet cheesecake with a cup of coffee. That's my favorite anyway. Their coffee is especially delicious, as they have the proper equipment for espresso and other barista specialties. The Sunday Brunch menu is also a real treat. Give it try if you get a chance. I recommend the breakfast monte cristo, lemon pancakes or crab hash. Some draw backs are the menu is HUGE. So much so, you'll find yourself picking out five or six things you could order. I also don't like that they take your food to the back to box it up to go. I don't know. I'm sure it's fine, I just like boxing my own food. Sometimes our services has been less than desirable. It just depends, but that can be said for any restaurant.  The seating can be a little weird, as they like to seat couples on a bench in between two families of four. Ask for a different table or set next to the bar."
Jamie D.,"Miami, OK",3,78,6,5.0,11/30/2013,"Haters be hatin'!  Best chain food in Tulsa, it is all delicious.  Love the small plates and unique appetizers. Great drinks too. Beautiful atmosphere."
Eric Y.,"Nevada, MO",73,64,,4.0,8/12/2013,"We stopped in for an early lunch on the way to our sales conference.  This location is right next to the mall and we picked up a few things while waiting for the restaurant to open at 11 am. We were one of the first groups to come into the restaurant for the day.  If you have never been to The Cheesecake Factory, be prepared--the menu is HUGE.  I don't know how they fit everything on there.  In my opinion, they should make the menu smaller and eliminate some of the items that are not as popular.  We took advantage of the lunch menu.  The size of the meal is smaller and so is the price. Our plan was to have a small lunch and finish with some cheesecake.  The lunch sized items were still large enough to fill us up and we were unable to eat another bite.  No cheesecake for us, unfortunately!  We would have taken some to go, but did not know if we would be able to check into our hotel to use the refrigerator in our room.  Split a meal with someone and then get the cheesecake.  That's what we will do next time!"
Samantha K.,"Owasso, OK",39,88,222,5.0,11/11/2014,"One word---cheesecake. I think even if they had terrible food I would come here just to eat cheesecake. It just so happens, the food is not terrible, it's pretty darn good. I usually steer clear of chain restaurants and I know this is one that gets a lot of criticism from foodies, but I just love it. It's always super busy, they have a novel for a menu and the servers dress in all white and wear ties. It's easy to criticize what looks like an overrated restaurant. First of all, there is always a wait. I went on a Saturday at 5pm and still had to wait, but it was only for 10 minutes. The wait is worth it though. The huge menu can be overwhelming for some. If I came here more often I would venture out and try new things, but I usually stick to my favorites-pasta or chicken. The crispy chicken costeletta is one of my faves! Crispy chicken with a lemon butter sauce served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It's a huge portion too. You can definitely take home half of it for another meal. My favorite appetizer is the chicken samosas. They have a large variety of small plates and appetizers. I plan on trying a few next time instead of one entree.  Now for the cheesecake. The pumpkin cheesecake is back for the season. It is amazing! It's creamy and spicy and the whipped cream on top is the perfect finish. I have to say I've never had a bad piece of cheesecake there. The white chocolate raspberry is delicious and fruity, but the Hershey's Chocolate Bar is one of the best. I can't eat a whole slice by myself because it is so rich, but it's nice to share with someone. My husband and I usually get a slice each and share. Now I'm craving cheesecake for lunch. Too bad it's so far away from me."
