Lee Nicole C.,"Fort Sill, OK",1,1,1,4.0,7/20/2014,Been here few times. One of our favorite restaurant.The foods is extremely good. Love the bread that they been served before your order. And the cakes are best cakes ever. Waiters had a good jobs.Expensive restaurant but it worth it.
Marlana N.,"Broken Arrow, OK",3,16,,4.0,4/12/2013,"Super good for the husband and I. Even took my dad for his birthday. The staff is charming, hardworking, and funny. The food was wonderful and service great. Only holding back on that last star due to a little  lack in up keep with drinks and the mishap of dirty silverware.  Great place. Great food. Great service."
Sheri W.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,15,2,4.0,2/21/2015,"I ate here with my husband, I ordered the New Orlean's pasta. No complaints it was a great pasta with a spicy kick. He ordered the chicken fettuccine. He said it was bland. I will be back for sure. I always get their fried macaroni and cheese balls which is very filling and that I love!"
Tony W.,"Tulsa, OK",5,21,2,4.0,9/6/2014,"I am not a ""chain"" eater. Not that I won't eat at chains, I just prefer to eat locally. I have not had anything that I did not like, never had bad service, have had to wait a little longer to be seated at times but will always be back. I had the pear something salad off of the ""Skinnylicious"" menu and it was quite tasty. Very light, very fresh!!! I would get it again for sure. My wife got the Chicken Madeira and I got a couple of bites of her food as well and of course, yummy. What I like about CF is that there is almost something new every time I go."
Peter H.,"Gallatin, TN",5,78,33,2.0,10/17/2014,21 page menu...? Seriously? Not impressed enough with the atmosphere to come back. Acoustics make it very loud. Unsweetened tea tastes like it was made with dirty water.
Sunshine I.,"Long Beach, CA",0,5,,3.0,11/7/2015,If I'm getting a cheesecake only to go order at 1030pm that probably means I want to eat it soon. What I got was a frozen piece of cheesecake that was impossible to eat. 3 stars is only because I like the food there in general. Come on people. If I ordered it at the restaurant would you have brought me a frozen piece? So disappointing.
Brittany B.,"Clarksville, TN",0,29,8,4.0,1/20/2015,"Not gonna lie, the decor is hideous.  Not sure if I just don't get it or what, but it's ugly. Now that I have that out of the way, the food is consistently good. The cheesecake is also pretty phenomenal.  You'll never settle for less after trying it out. The service was pretty good, too. All in all, what you'd expect from a chain place. Worth a visit or two, definitely."
Brent D.,"Tulsa, OK",38,189,105,3.0,5/6/2015,The dessert is great. That's obvious. The regular food is not so great. It is ridiculously costly for what you get. I can't recommend for dinner. But sure wouldn't turn down a pie of cheesecake for dessert.
Kevin S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",79,18,792,5.0,8/15/2011,Ate at Tulsa location yesterday for my friend's birthday celebration.  What a perfect experience.  Great service.  Excellent food. Decadent cheesecake.  Thanks!!!! I can't wait to return. She had caramel chicken which I sampled. Yum.  I had factory combination of Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi with healthy substitution of broccoli for mashed potatoes. Delish!!! Great pomegranate margaritas. And the cheesecakes are the bomb!!! She had Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake and it was very rich and had peanut butter in it. I had the Kahlua® Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake and it was perfection. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.
Alicia A.,"Saint Louis, MO",2,14,,1.0,6/4/2014,"My husband and I spent $80 one night for cold food. What my husband ordered was not available but he wasn't told until after we placed our order. The waiter came back and asked what he wanted instead but failed to provide a menu. In addition,  although small, they ran out of bread?!? They didn't offer to compensate for the less than satisfactory experience. I probably won't return."
Eric Q.,"Claremore, OK",0,18,,2.0,1/12/2015,"Been here a couple of different times and the food is below average and way, way overpriced!!! I wont make the mistake of giving it another chance. Just a way overated chain that doesnt live up to the hype."
Victoria S.,"Dallas, TX",36,48,25,2.0,6/5/2014,"We went on a Wednesday evening, didn't expect it to be busy but it was. Upon arriving we were offered a table/booth right away. We declined due to trying to be placed in between 2 large families w/ a lot of kids. I asked the hostess if we could wait for the booth that was being cleaned.. She said no that the family before us was waiting for a booth but she would put us next in line. She handed me a buzzer and we went on the wait 5-10min later after 3 families came in, our buzzer went off. We got to the counter and she told the person who walked us to our seats to hold off and the family after us was told to follow him and The booth in question that i had requested went to them.!! Once he came back from seating them he walked us to the very back of the restaurant and sat us in a booth meant for a family of 8-10 people. It was unnecessary for my family of 3. ""we didn't complain"" thats their loss of profitability. "" The waiter was mediocre to bad .. took forever to order or get things we requested (i.e. ranch & refills) My husband's order was incorrect and had to be sent back by the time we received his food back everyone else had already eaten.  Dessert, we were stuffed but of course could not say no to CheeseCake .. we got them to-go. Upon opening them. They were upside down in the container and smushed in the container. For spending 120$ on 3 people for dinner and having such crappy service is just unacceptable.!"
Ryan B.,"Joplin, MO",5,12,24,4.0,10/8/2014,"Great food, great service. Our bartender Byno and his manager gave a very personal experience. Thanks for starting our vacation out right. #lovinglife #cheesecakefactory"
Lai A.,"Sea Isle City, NJ",2,15,48,3.0,9/18/2013,"Food overall is moderate ... Had the meal was too big the portion ... Waitress did not really explain well of what the meals comes and portions ... Menu is TOO Big and complicated ... Pricing is not bad, cakes are tasty but that's the only positive ... Will be back again for cakes though ..."
DeWayne F.,"Bend, OR",2,176,43,3.0,12/5/2012,"No IPA or micro brews 1 star Food was OK, fish taco's,  3 star based on what I have eaten in other restaurants. Salsa 1 star out of the can and not spicy Just a run of the mill chain restaurant doing there best.  Not bad and not great"
Lauren D.,"Tulsa, OK",634,291,883,4.0,5/22/2012,"Yummiest cheesecake around, besides my moms of course. The atmosphere and service at this restaurant are great! The menu boasts 14 pages of tasty drinks and foods, but in my opinion it is like reading a mini novel. Not complaining about too many choices, but it makes it hard to decide what to order. We started with the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps, and looking back on it this was my favorite dish of the meal excluding the cheesecake. For our second appetizer we tried the tuna steak (cannot remember the exact name of the dish) and it was awesome too. I had the shrimp fettucini alfredo and my husband had the filet. Both were very yummy; I always make a point to try his dish too to get some variety. All in all, it is a great restaurant. I would warn that it is a bit on the pricey side and it is not an eat and run kind of place (we were there a total of 2 or 2 1/2 hours). It is also great to just stop in and grab some cheesecake to go though!"
Daniel W.,"Broken Arrow, OK",101,46,,3.0,8/14/2014,Food - meh. good from frozen food Desert - amazing cheese cakes. erhmergerd. I would maybe split a dish (because the portions are huge) and then split a cheese cake. There is no reason to get your own dish unless you REALLY wanna take home and reheat reheated food.
Mark B.,"Maumelle, AR",0,3,,5.0,7/14/2015,"Absolutely amazed.  Atmosphere, food, food selection, service...above top notch!  Being from Little Rock, we have a new reason to visit Tulsa. Will be back and will bring a group!"
Jay S.,"Orange Park, FL",75,216,466,4.0,3/30/2011,"We are HUGE fans of the Cheesecake factory and this was probably the best tasting meal I have ever had in a branch of this chain. Strong and potent long island iced tea for beginners, then moved onto  the BLT salad with big chucks of blue cheese and tasty bacon,beautifully split in two for Dane and I to share. Being from New Orleans I had to have the Louisiana Pasta that was perfect and just what I wanted this evening....a cajun inspired mildly spicy cream sauce and bow tie pasta served with about three breaded,hot and juicy chicken breast on top...absolutely delicious! Finished with their new Mango Macaroon Key Lime cheesecake that melted in our mouths. Fantastic meal all around and the best thing, the place is open till 11PM and we didn't even have to wait for a table! WOW, that is unheard of our in California where no matter what night you go, expect to wait at least an hour!"
Joyce D.,"Tulsa, OK",240,257,629,4.0,1/8/2009,"Finally a Cheesecake Factory in Tulsa.  I finally made the visit to Tulsa's Cheesecake Factory.  I had it in other parts of the country and always knew one would go over well here.  Cheesecake Factory has a colorful menu and I always have such a hard time deciding what to eat here.  I get something different every time and still get confused on what I want.   In the past I have got the lemonades they make here and they kick ass.  The meatloaf is fantastic.  The Chicken and Biscuits are good.  The pastas all rock and the Asian salad is great as well.  This time I ordered the Cuban Sandwich, my sister got some chopped salad, and my girlfriend ordered the Pasta Carbonara.  And of course I had to get some cheesecake.  I split a slice of Snickers Chunks and Cheese Cake. Cuban Sandwich-  This was all around pretty terrific other than the bottom of the sandwich being a bit soggy.  I have had better cuban sandwiches but this one hit the spot.  The fries here are out of this world. Pasta Carbonara-  This got better the deeper into the dish you got.  I think more of the flavors came out after the top was gone.  Very good though. Snickers Chunks and Cheesecake-  One thing you need to know about Cheesecake Factory is, they do cheesecake right!  And when you see the extensive list of cheesecakes to choose from your head might just explode.  The Snickers and cheesecake combo was sinful and made me cry.  DAMN GOOD!"
