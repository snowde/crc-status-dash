Robert T.,"Santa Barbara, CA",29,36,20,4.0,1/6/2018,"My wife and i have visited this location twice since it opened, once for lunch and once for dinner. The service and food for the lunch was fantastic, and although the food at dinner was great, the experience wasn't as good. We were prepared to wait an hour as we were preoccupied at a nearby store, and once seated we were pleased to see they didn't squeeze the 2 person tables so closely together like other locations. Steak tacos were fantastic, as were the fried mac and cheese. Unfortunately our entree's took a very long time to come, to the extend that the party next to us who hadn't sat much before us, had left as our entree's arrived. Also our server seemed under a lot of pressure, which led to it taking a long time for us to pay. Finally, we were never offered cheesecake at the end, as our server was rushed to have us pay. We'll be back, but perhaps not during peak hours."
Chris M.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,122,24,1.0,1/5/2018,"Slow service. Really loud atmosphere. Missing order. Since there was no parking right up front, I dropped my family off to get a table while I went and parked the car. To my surprise they were seated right away. It took me a little more than ten minutes to park the car and find where my family was seated. When I got to the table I told them that I was surprised they were seated at a table so soon and asked them if they got the drink order. They said no one has come around to take the drink orders. That is when I looked at my watch to see the time. It took the staff at least ten minutes after I sat down to take our drink order. This was more than 20 minutes from the time my family was first seated. We finally placed our order and tried to have a conversation, but the place is really loud and I had a hard time hearing. Needless to say we did not talk much. When the food came out, it came out at different times which usually is not a problem. My daughter ordered angel hair pasta and green beans, but only the green beans made it to our table in time for dinner. After waiting for five minutes for the pasta to come out, we just gave her some of our pasta from our plates so she could start eating. After some time they finally brought out the pasta, which was dry (an indication of sitting out too long before being brought to our table). We told them to forget about the pasta order as we were done eating and would like the check and some boxes. The server just left it on the table and walked away. Since I told them I did not wan the pasta because it was too late, I assumed that I would not have been bill for the item. It seemed like too much of a hassle to try to have the item removed, that I just paid the bill and left.  Side note, one thing I did notice was that some of the men preparing the food had beards, but they were not wearing the required beard nets."
Noemy G.,"Newhall, CA",0,9,1,1.0,12/28/2017,"*****will not be going back until someone fixes the service /manager at this location **** I would give it zero stars if i could, by far this is the worst cheesecake factory i've been to the service is terrible, the manager isn't great at all either and neither are the waiters here if you can dodge this bullet i suggest you do. We waited for a good while then after we got seated and got our food our waiter never checked on us again we had the busboy and other people ask us if we needed anything which was more drinks. Our waiter completely disregarded us and would check on everyone around us but us when we needed more water and soda, we were waiting on him about 30 minutes just so we could flag him down to come back and give us refills and bread or cheese but he never came, it got to the point where i just got myself up and walked up to see if anyone could refill our drinks because i was getting impatient. After we got our drinks and ate our food we had to flag him down for boxes and after he did he completely disappeared again and we just got up and went to the front for our check, apparently our server was all the way in the front chitty chatting with his co-workers and i presume that is the reason why this person couldn't do a good job so after we paid we wanted to speak to the manager and once we found him he completely disappeared we were waiting a good 15-20 minutes for him and he completely disappeared. The food was also okay nothing compared to Sherman oaks in my fettuccine i had pieces of burned fish tail which was odd because i had gotten the chicken not shrimp. Overall, i hope someone takes a look into this restaurant that actually cares and fixes the problem not only with the waiters but also the manager for not showing intreast in paying customers *******(keep in mind we went on December 27th  just in case anyone cares to have a talk with the staff or manager)***** ***************we have also gone to other cheesecake factories that are relatively more packed than this one and the service is amazing (really recommend the cheesecake factory in Sherman oaks its a drive but you'll actually be treated well and not regret it *****"
Peter H.,"Los Angeles, CA",513,527,3716,2.0,12/2/2017,As a shareholder of CAKE I periodically evaluate this investment by visiting a location. For this instance it was not so good but since the place was packed it's more important to see the business doing well. People love the Cheesecake Factory. It has a lot of mediocre menu items but the real revenue maker is the cheese cake. What a great margin on these slices of pure profit. Even though I had bad service and ok food I don't care. Everyone else seems to love it and that's the important thing.
Hannah R.,"Valencia, CA",3,61,67,2.0,11/15/2017,"I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory before where it takes 30+ minutes to get a drink and an hour to get food. The first time I was here, the drinks weren't a problem but it took forty five minutes to get my food (which was mediocre at best at the time). That was a year ago. Today, we had a party of five. Our waiter was training, which we were all cool with, but our biggest problem was waiting for our food again. It took an hour and it was busy enough that it wasn't empty but not enough to wait the hour. The food was all correct, which was great, but this location needs to work on it since it's a regular thing. It took half an hour to get my drink since it was coming from the bar and I had to ask three or four times for a drink in general. If you decide to go here, I would just expect that you're going to be here for a few hours. I think it's great that Santa Clarita has more options for restaurants now, but service kind of falls on the low end in general with a few exceptions. They are very kind at this location, but also very slow. I'd just pick your battles and weigh your options on whether on not you have that kind of time."
Emilee T.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",3,57,3,3.0,1/7/2018,"Having worked at the CCF in Sherman Oaks for years (where I happened to meet my husband!) I was sad to see this location carry the same name. After a full year open they seem to finally be getting things under control. (We had our food sent back and returned 5x before getting it right the first time we were there, in early 2017, but a recent visit shows that an upward trend may be on the horizon!) The food is what you should expect from CCF, as long as it comes out correctly!! So, if you are a fan, definitely give it a try!"
John D.,"Valencia, CA",18,16,,5.0,12/21/2017,"My brother and I came for a little post workout feeding at lunch the other day.  There was no wait even with the busy shopping season. The patio seating is beautiful and one of the best places in SCV for people watching.  I always get the same thing at CF, the spicy cashew chicken over broccoli, (no rice) but I was feeling a little saucy and opted for the breakfast burrito.   It was delicious. The whole experience was great.  Our server was Sarah Rose.  She was attentive, engaging and funny.  It was a pleasant surprise to have a server with such a winning personality.  She made the lunch even more perfect.  All in all, this CF is a winner."
Jake C.,"San Francisco, CA",65,3,,4.0,1/7/2018,"This place has amazing food and the service they provide great! I plan on returning in the near future, thanks."
Jenny P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,9,11,1.0,12/24/2017,Worst experience at a cheesecake EVERR. No wonder why they have such a bad rating. Such a waste of money and time on christmas eve. Serious let down. Horrible service. The manager doesn't know how to accommodate for terrible service and the terrible food. Server carlos was so rude and sighed in front of our faces when asked to remake the thai wrap that was over AND under cooked on the same plate. Carbonara was bland but oddly with too much pepper... mind boggling how they managed to do that. Then decided to order a steak diane instead which came out completely over cooked on one side like they forgot about it. Asked for medium and came out far from it.
Mike O.,"Santa Clarita, CA",611,616,1097,3.0,6/27/2017,"So we came in for Happy Hour at 5:50 and saw that it ends at 6:00...most places have Happy Hour until 7:00 so I wasn't happy with that, but our waitress, Lauren V, was really good about telling us she would make sure it was covered during the lower costs. We ordered items only from the Happy Hour menu, burgers and fries for me and my son and Vietnamese Spring Rolls for my wife plus an order of the cheesy bread, two beers (Sam Adams and Blue Moon) and then at the end my wife and son split a slice of cheesecake. Service with Lauren was great and she was friendly and attentive the whole time we were there which is good because I saw from most of the reviews that service was an issue. A bad item that I brought to her attention was that there were a couple (three total) utensils on the table that had food crud on them.  I took a picture of two, but she was not happy with it and was very apologetic.  Honestly the food and her service would bring me back."
Cathy G.,"Littlerock, CA",0,11,1,5.0,12/27/2017,So happy you're here.  We drive 96 miles round trip for the Renee Special.  Had lunch there today. See you soon  Another wonderful lunch. Thank you.
Alex A.,"Canyon Country, CA",151,6,,5.0,1/7/2018,"Although I'm not a fan of chains at all, Cheesecake Factory does a pretty good job being what they are. They have a giant menu, hats off to the BOH staff for their consistent execution on such a large menu. Service is always great. We have had Megan as our server a few times and she is great. Her attention to detail, friendliness and menu knowledge is above and beyond the basic job requirements and we felt she really went out of her way to make sure we enjoyed our experience. I would rather support small local businesses but it's a pretty good spot to go to when you can decide what you want since they have a little of everything."
Glen N.,"San Jose, CA",523,1302,1553,1.0,9/21/2017,Don't let them help you with your math homework.  The 20% tip suggestion is about 45%.  How guilty are they?  100%  (or 225% if you are Cheesecake Factory).
L M.,"Wilmington, DE",8,42,18,2.0,1/7/2018,I just ordered from Grub Hub which is an amazing service however the Cheesecake Factory cut corners on my order then lied and said that nothing was missing from my order! I ordered firecrackers salmon rolls which comes with red cabbage. They did not give me any cabbage even though I asked for extra. I have attached a picture they didn't even put it in the container they normally use I will never order from here again and I will make sure my neighbors don't either. What do I have to lie about it's food for gods sake! Totally irritated! They get two stars because everything else was in the order!
Monica F.,"Canyon Country, CA",66,6,2,1.0,1/1/2018,"Worst experience ever at a Cheesecake Factory. This place is horrible we were sitting over 10 minutes for a glass of water. Finally my husband walked up the bar to get me a cup of water. While waiting for our very slow server a couple sitting across from us after waiting too, just got up and left our server and a bus boy get the utensils and napkins just put them back in place after the other people touched them. They did not switch them out. My glass and knife were dirty. When I asked for a manager to request they change out the silverware and telling him I don't trust the cleanliness of the restaurant. He just got upset with me and said I assure you we are clean. I said you can not assure me of that so I decided to leave after 25 minutes are food had still not even come out. I will never go back to this place again"
Matt A.,"Pasadena, CA",49,218,161,5.0,7/7/2017,"Brandon was our waiter and he was a very entertaining as our waiter, knew the menu and it was a joy having him take care of the table. The food is always really good.  The most recent visit I tried the chicken reisling and it was a nice new addition."
Jazmine R.,"Palmdale, CA",60,4,6,5.0,10/13/2017,"Mohsen and Karen are very attentive   We sat at the bar and ordered food, drinks and dessert. They weren't annoying or pushy.  We ordered filet mignon, stuffed mushrooms and their pumpkin pie cheesecake (seasonal). First off the filet mignon was cooked exactly as ordered. I I wish the portion size for the veggies was a bit bigger but nevertheless it was the perfect portion to share. I honestly have never been a fan of mushrooms but am now! They were cheesy and garlicky. The pumpkin pie cheesecake was so tasty. It was the perfect combination of pie and cheesecake. Highly recommend it!!"
Maximus Decimus Meridius M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",12,92,1,1.0,8/28/2017,"Came here last night for dinner with family members visiting from out of town.   I put our name in at 5.15pm for a party of 6.  I was told the wait would be ""45 minutes."" After watching several parties come in 30 minutes after us who were seated before us i finally started haranguing the hostess.  At 6:26pm we were taken to our table but wait!! Not so fast starving exhausted customers!!  the table wasn't ready. so we had to stand there another 5 minutes while someone set the table.   But the most incredible part of this story is that there were THREE empty booths that could hold six people that were all empty right next to our designated table.  How long were they empty?  not sure but the odds of 3 empty large adjacent booths opening up at precisely the same time are non-existent.   Here's a helpful hint.  Whatever wait time the hostess quotes you multiply by 2. See other reviewers with similar wait time disasters (emily b review). what's the solution?? Another restaurant that also serves cheesecake for desert? Here's to hoping the Saddle Ranch serves tasty cheesecake and gives accurate wait time estimates."
Elizabeth R.,"Canyon Country, CA",77,57,409,5.0,11/24/2017,Thank you for being across the street from leaving from the Saddle ranch to the cheese cake  factory good food drinks and appetizers thank you for  being their... the food and drink were awesome.
Amir A.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",13,5,,1.0,12/27/2017,"I can't speak for other Cheesecake Factory restaurants or for other times of the week, but for this one in Valencia, CA, on a Wednesday evening, the service was painfully slow after a wait for a table that exceeded the 40-min estimate by at least 10 min. The food was ok, and the portions were decent, but there was a good 15 min between when three of us got our meals and when the other three got theirs. All in all, a pretty negative experience that seemed to be business-as-usual for this place.  Our waitress barely recognized the molasses-slow service, much less apologized or tried to make it right.  The food was decent but not good enough to justify ridiculously long waits for both the table and the food."
Kyle W.,"Placentia, CA",113,3,,4.0,12/23/2017,This place is very good. They provide great service and hospitality! I plan on coming back very soon!
Amy C.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,24,7,4.0,12/30/2017,The food was excellent!!! the cleanliness of the restaurant was a bit off my silverware was a little dirty.  The cheesecake bar area took along time to get my cheesecake I was kinda upset they need to be a bit more organize.
Jay B.,"Orange County, CA",585,77,748,4.0,1/7/2017,"Finally, the long awaited Cheesecake Factory has opened in SCV (11/8/16). It's definitely a great addition to this city and the nearby areas. Located near the Valencia Mall entrance and across Urban Home this particular restaurant is smaller than the rest of the other Cheesecakes but just right for the city.  I came here on a Wed with friends for a random visit and since it's still new there was of course a wait. We decided to just dine at the bar and sit at the bar top since all tables were full in the bar area. It took about 8 mins to be acknowledged by our server but I get it she was busy with the hustle and bustle of everything. Once recognized we were then accommodated with a friendly smile and a great attitude.  Dining at Cheesecake many times throughout the years at several locations you still find yourself looking at the menu to see what they have new and appetizing. Obviously there are a great selection of food items on their menu that are all reasonably priced and still to this day, if I cannot decide on anything else I always order one of my favorite dishes there which is the Spicy Cashew Chicken(16.95). This is actually the first item I ordered when I dined @ Cheesecake for the first time in the early 90s. This particular dish at this location  was good but very salty. The ratio of chicken vs rice was okay and everything else was smaller in portions than the other locations.  Aside from this I also opted for a fresh Kale salad w/ grilled chicken(14.45). This was actually very refreshing and satisfying considering the Spicy Chicken that I usually get was salty. So this salad was a good balance for my palate. And to wash this down of course you have to have a cold brew. Stella is my main choice (7.00). My friends ordered the California Cheesesteak sandwich(13.95). A good size sandwich that is not too greasy nor oily and very flavorful.  Of course you cannot leave Cheesecake without ordering desserts so we got the Godiva Chocolate and Dulce De Leche(7.95). The overall service was good and our server at the bar top was very friendly and attentive. I'm definitely sure if we decided to get a table our wait time would be long as well. Again, this is definitely a great addition to this location and hopefully it will continue to provide good service."
Josh S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,60,26,4.0,11/7/2017,I was in the mood for sweet wheat bread. I also decided to order appetizers.  One of my favorite places to dine. I ordered the calamari and the egg roll sampler. You can't go wrong visiting this place. I did not have room for cheesecake.  So I will definitely be coming back. My server was also very attentive. My experience was awesome.
Christian S.,"Fort Bragg, NC",55,19,,5.0,11/25/2017,"Idk if i've just been lucky every time I come here, but I've literally always had a pleasant experience. I've been here at LEAST 3 times. The staff has always been polite to me/my gf, on point with refilling drinks, the food arrives within 10-20 min (we've never had a ridiculously long wait, even when crowded), and the food always tastes good. Sure, I prefer some dishes over others, but I've still always found the food enjoyable. I don't think we've ever had a problem here. Maybe we have a much different experience because we come as a small party of 2? Anyways, I think the ONLY bad thing I can think of is that it gets crowded here. Sometimes the wait to get in is over 30 minutes. Sometimes there are so many people inside the restaurant, it gets noisy. But those seem to be good problems in my opinion lol So in summary:  I've always had a great time here with great service/food. Literally every time. Idk wtf happens to everyone else experiences."
Elie B.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,6,,5.0,1/7/2018,"I love The Cheesecake Factory at Valencia! I've been there a couple of times. I will admit, it is really crowded and you will have to wait a while before you get a table, but the service was really good. The waitress kept checking on us and they gave us free food for an inconvenience that did not even bother us. Besides, you get a lot of food! I love it!"
Jon L.,"National City, CA",0,2,,4.0,12/22/2017,This place is good. The service is great and same with the food. I plan on returning very soon! Thank you guys!
Betty H.,"Los Angeles, CA",230,310,1750,4.0,6/28/2017,"Stopped by during their happy hour for a quick snack.  HH seating is in the bar area.  There are high tables and regular tables, but no booths in this area.  Service was decent.. a little slow but no major complaints.  I tried the tex mex rolls and crab wontons.  The tex mex eggrolls were tasty.  The rolls were crispy and savory. They aren't very spicy, but occasionally you'll find a spicy chili. A small side of pico de gallo and guacamole complemented the dish well.  The crispy can wontons are a good choice if you like crab. You can taste the crab because there's actually a decent amount of crab in the wonton. The food arrived piping hot and freshly made. I only tried a couple of things during my visit, but I find the food to be prepared the same across their locations. I enjoyed my visit and I really like their bread (the brown one) and butter too!"
Ronald M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1904,533,1462,4.0,11/29/2016,"This place was highly anticipated in the SCV. And after just a few weeks since opening, apparently to mixed reviews, we thought it would be a nice outing for dinner. We weren't looking for anything too fancy tonight, although today marks our 35th Anniversary! We're saving the splurge for our trip to one of our very favorite destinations at the end of next week. But more on that in future posts. So after arriving around 6:15, we could see there would be a bit of a wait, as evidenced by those waiting outside. I love the look of this place, very nice decor. I've only been to one other Cheesecake Factory, the one in Marina Del Rey and that was quite some years ago.  We were given a wait time of 20 minutes, and after given a pager it wasn't long before a few seats were vacated in the lobby waiting area and we swiftly moved to grab them. Which was fortunate, our 20 minute wait turned out to be more like 35. Our server was Michael, and he seemed nice enough. A little forgetful with our bread though.  Our orders were as follows: RASPBERRY LEMONADE: My wife wanted to try this weird tasting concoction; think powdered drink mix in a straw popular during your childhood days. Don't do it! Don't order this bitter/sweet mess! She had Michael bring her a Sprite instead, I ordered a root beer. 1 Star PORTOBELLO, AVOCADO and ZUCCHINI FRIES: As an appetizer, these were really good. We could have done without the avocado fries though, they just weren't doing it for us. With two dipping sauces. The ranch sauce was all that was needed. 4.5 Stars BREAD: Decent, after reminding Michael that we didn't get any and finally having it brought to our table. The butter could have been less chilled, makes for better spreading. 3.5 Stars FILET MIGNON: Her entree, which came with mashed potatoes and green beans. Prepared well done, she was very pleased with her choice. 4.5 Stars SHEPHERDS PIE: My entree. Decent, but I probably wouldn't order it again. My wife makes one much better. The peas and carrots were there, topped with mashed potatoes of course. But I would have much preferred ground beef rather than the chunks of beef that came with this dish. 3 Stars SERVICE: No real complaints that a bit more time and experience couldn't correct no doubt. They all seem to be trying very hard to get it right. 3.5 Stars We'll be back. Have to order some cheesecake eventually! More on our real anniversary celebrations in about a week and a half. Shhhhh."
Frank R.,"Saugus, CA",11,369,198,2.0,9/25/2017,"Man, it's so sad to slam our local Cheesecake Factory but it's well deserved. I'm a believer in the low cumulative score that they got for this restaurant. My reviews are for restaurants only!  This last Sunday was my familys first time and  impression and my last straw and we'll never return for dining. I've been here many times with many different groups and we just get let down one time after another, simple failure from the hostesses to the server. There is a serious lack of good management, at least this last Sunday at 8pm, 9/24/2017. Looking around, there are a lot of people hustling about but clearly we never seem to be on the service end of that group. With probably fifteen people standing around in the kitchen that I can see, there is no reason why our food came out luke warm and not all at once, I'm not sure if it was the server or failure in the kitchen to make the food all together and stay hot and it was not busy! Over an hour of dining and not once, did we get a refill on water by anyone. It was bad enough to notify corporate but it's not worth it because I'm sure it's not their first similar complaint. Lastly, to all the real hard working employees there, I'm sorry for the sad but justified review. Good luck and continue to be attentive to the customers, they'll notice!"
Ken M.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",3,68,8,1.0,9/21/2017,"Ok nail in the coffin, first visit our unstable waitress kept running off during multiple panic attacks, the booth we were at kept getting battered by the buss boys on the other side I finally started kicking the wall to get them to stop. 2nd visit, my order was completely forgotten not once, not even twice but three times. I finally said I'm good and called it quits. 3rd visit I got my food order but now my drink order was MIA, along with our waitress who required an APB to find. Food is bland, services is horrible, staff less than favorable, no value as the selections are over priced. Nail in the coffin, just found a news report on this location that discovered they along with other locations have a practice of misleading the tip percentages. The corp response is its a mere suggestion and the responsibility of the consumer to check the math. Ok check the math on this...Deuces + boycott = $0 of our dollars"
Tyler M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/29/2017,I would first like to say that this review goes for not just one time of coming here but for multiple times.... so it wasn't just one isolated time.  Went here over the weekend after going a few times after it first opened and had horrible service and food was just ok. Definitely not up to standards of Cheesecake Factory.  We had to ask for water 3 times and still did not get them so I finally went up to the bar and ask again only to then be shorted two waters (which never arrived). Food came out at different times... I mean 5 mins between each set of plates bc our server only would bring two at a time(we had a party of 8). So people who got food first were almost done when last two got their food. We ordered drinks and the drink order got messed up severely both times (we had a $150 bar tab on 10 drinks so you would expect them to at least get drinks right). Just overall bad service every time we have been and it's so sad bc we were so happy to get a Cheesecake Factory where we live finally.  Overall I would suggest go to another restaurant. You won't get what you pay for.
Steve F.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,9,,1.0,9/15/2017,"Beware of Hairy Meals, poor service & lack of leadership. I have been a customer of Cheesecake Factory for many years and have eaten at many locations throughout California & In Las Vegas.  Having one in Santa Clarita was great news when it opened. During the first few weeks this location had a lot of issues but I let it go since most restaurants need time to work out the kinks. However, it is worse. Today one person in the party had a long hair in her meal. The staff said they would replace it only it took a long time. When correcting a problem the order should be expedited. Orders were wrong, took a long time, and the follow up made the multiple problems worse. The manager said he would take the HAIRY MEAL off the bill. Gee thanks!How about a deep discount and some cheesecake for the trouble given we were a large group celebrating two birthdays? Bottom line this location has very poor service, food   is not up to par with the Cheesecake Factory brand, food safety is not up to standards, and management had every opportunity to make things right and they missed the mark. Are other locations like this?  Corporate if your listening I recommend you take a real close look at this operation and maybe get a leader from one of your better locations to take over and save this location. Until such time my advice is to not waste your time, money or health."
Adriana A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/18/2017,This place is so good! The food is outstanding and same with the service! I try and come at least once. Every week!
Dr D.,"Victorville, CA",2,58,45,5.0,10/22/2017,"Great visit. Came strictly for the Cheesecake and got an awesome Celebration Cheesecake from our waitress, Deriana who was amazing!!! Built an excellent foundation by being prompt and friendly. She was excited and seemed genuinely happy to be at work. I appreciate the service and the food and experience was greatly enhanced by the service she provided. Thank you for making just another lunch a better experience."
Kayla M.,"Los Angeles, CA",155,2,,5.0,12/20/2017,Just ate at Cheesecake Factory and I couldn't be happier with their service. The food was outstanding and I will be back soon!
Lucky S.,"Los Angeles, CA",44,1154,3364,3.0,4/24/2017,"Let me start by saying I love me some Cheesecake Factory.  They have my favorite all time salad ever...a Chinese chicken salad, minus the chicken, add grilled salmon.  The dressing for it has the best mixture of tang and sweet. The lettuce is perfectly chopped, the sliver of almonds and wonton chips add crunch and it's a huge portion so I usually ask for dressing on the side and take half of it home so I have lunch leftovers the next day. This Cheesecake Factory served a great salad like all the others I've had, but when we arrived, the place was pretty dead (it was 4:30 so before the dinner rush).  There were plenty of sections open to seat us at, but took as to an empty row of tables.  Sitting down, I was fine with that since I'm anti-social at heart and I like my space.   BUT once I looked under the table to set my purse down, I noticed that the floor was disgusting.  There were crumbs all over and the next table over was the same with the addition of cheerios.  Looking around, there were plenty of staff chit chatting and such so it wasn't an issue of available staff.  Just no one cared enough to clean it.   Normally I would have asked to be moved, but it was already mid service once I noticed and not worth the hassle."
Emily B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",85,20,19,1.0,8/27/2017,"This location is nothing like any Cheesecake Factory I've been to before. Honestly, Cheese Mistake Factory might be a better name. I've been three times, and each time they've found some new and exiting way to spoil my meal.  First Visit: The debit card reader won't accept our card, so my husband had to walk down the street in the dark to get cash. Mind you, the card was working fine everywhere else, so it was clearly an error on the restaurant's part. I expected at least some of our meal to be comped for the trouble, but it wasn't. On the other hand, our waiter was great even though they were wildly understaffed so our food and drinks took a long time to get to the table.  Second Visit: I make a reservation for 12 people. When we arrive, we're told ""Sorry, we don't have you in the system."" I'd even double checked to make sure I was calling the right location, so this wasn't a mistake on my end.  Third / Final Visit: We arrive at 5:11; the wait is approximately 45 minutes. That's perfect because we have already bought movie tickets for 7:00. At 6:00, we double check to see how long it's going to be and the hostess explains that a few parties are ahead of us still, but that a ""bunch"" of tables are being cleaned off. For the next 20 minutes, we watched about four other parties get seated before us, some of who arrived after we did. At 6:25, I explained that we had movie tickets and the hostess said they'd seat us right away. At this point, we're just hoping to get to the movie before the previews end. Five minutes later, we still weren't seated so we told the hostess to pull our names from the list. This was close to twice the original wait time we were given. If they'd just given is a realistic expectation we could have gotten food elsewhere instead of going to our movie hungry."

We can not say enough about the wonderful new manager ""Fernando"" that is there now.  The professionalism he brings to the table is to be commended.  The knowledge regarding the menu was very impressive.  He is definitely an asset to our Cheesecake Factory. Oh, I can not leave out our server for the evening Ryan.  He always came to the table with a smile, delivered the food promptly and checked back often to see if we had any other needs. What more could you ask for!"
Robert W.,"Santa Clarita, CA",208,20,12,1.0,8/27/2017,"The hostess lied and said the wait was 45 minutes because they wanted our business. At the 45 minute mark we asked how much longer- the hostess said they were cleaning off a table for us right then, so we waited.  At the 1 hour and 20 minute mark we asked again, and we got the same rehearsed response ""they are cleaning off a table for you right now!"" Which wasn't true.   At the 1 hour and 30 mark we had to decide if we wanted to eat, or see the movie we already purchased tickets for. We chose the movie and left. If the hostess had been honest, we would have chosen a different restaurant and been able to enjoy dinner with our good friends. Evening ruined.  I have now been to Cheesecake Factory 3 times. Each time they have managed to make major mistakes. The last time I went, we didn't receive our drinks until after our meal. Unreal!  If you're trying to plan an evening, maybe don't go with Cheesecake as they have proven to be dishonest.  Very disappointing, Cheesecake Factory."
