Chuck G.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",9,8,1,4.0,7/6/2017,"I love this place... the menu is so good, so many options and reasonably priced... when it first opened, the service was just ok but that's understandable, it was new.. it seems they have stepped it up and figured it out. the last few times here the service has been just fine... plan on waiting a little bit for your food, its a big place with lots of tables... if you want fresh its going to take some time to cook it... wait time to sit is always pretty good here... they will tell you an hour wait but it always seems more like 20 minutes... and of corse the cheesecake is great!"
Breea B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,4.0,7/5/2017,This was a pretty good restaurant. It has a variety literally everything from pasta to Asian food. The portion sizes are really big and the food is good. I'd say that this restaurant is pretty worth it and in all honesty I don't really find anything wrong with it.
Chris D.,"Bakersfield, CA",166,244,342,5.0,12/2/2016,All right everybody knows the cheesecake factory what great cheesecake many to choose from let me tell you that Oreo cheesecake is the die for a nice thick Oreo crumble crust on the bottom and let's not forget the food I had the salmon which is just amazing and not very expensive as you would think all the cheesecake factory is I've visited have always been very busy so I suggest either do take out or make a reservation
Susan W.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/27/2017,The tuna tartare is a disappointment. A thin layer of tuna on top of a tiny ball of avocado. Not worth the $$
Kenny S.,"San Francisco, CA",7,8,,5.0,10/15/2017,"This place is a chain, AND it's delicious. The quantity and the quality you get for the price is unmatched in this valley. The variety is simply out of this world. Cheesecakes are amazon too. Do yourself a favor and go here. You'll want to return again and again."
Nikki S.,"Palmdale, CA",1,27,3,1.0,10/1/2017,"I don't know what is going on in the kitchen at this cheesecake but it is horrible! Wasn't even crowded on a Sunday morning and we waited about 40 min for our food just to have it arrive cold, the waffle wasn't cooked completely and the eggs were cold and doused in oil/butter???? I feel bad for the wait staff bc they are the ones who have to deal with unhappy patrons. Maybe you should look at your yelp reviews and try and figure out why they are so sad......."
Andrew M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",231,60,219,4.0,8/13/2017,"I'm so happy this place moved to Valencia, one of my favorites of all time! The ambience is awesome and the food.. omg divine! So many pasta dishes to choose from and my favorite the "" Pasta Carbonara"" you won't be disappointed. Tiny bits of bacon swimming in a white sauce that's to die for. The bread provided is a great warm up for the real meal so no need to get an appetizer unless your really hungry. If you do then try the Thai lettuce wraps...its full of color and flavor. You get about three sauces to try and chopped chicken to complete your protein needs. You can make tacos out of them and still not be full and spoil dinner. I don't have to even write about the desserts as they speak for themselves and leave you wanting more."
Omar B.,"Valencia, CA",0,12,3,4.0,7/31/2017,Great food! Great ambiance! Great service! I had the Cajun Jambalaya and it was spot on!
Allie B.,"Henderson, NV",0,11,1,5.0,7/14/2017,You can't go wrong with this place so many options very reasonable and the sky is the limit for is delish.
Kellie O.,"Valencia, CA",112,37,64,3.0,6/17/2017,My best friend and I went in for dessert to share milestone events that happened for us this week. We sat at a table for several minutes before anyone said hi! Our waitress was not professional as she was constantly interrupted by her co workers (who was leaving their shift ) and stopped to chat with them. She could have been more attentive and waited for the chit chat after she  took our beverage order.
J M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,2,2.0,3/16/2017,How would you like your cockroach sir? Accompanied by a nice glass of water with red lipstick on! At least the manager gave us a $20.00 gift card...that's why the second star. not using it in this location
Eddely A.,"Los Angeles, CA",68,20,1,5.0,5/27/2017,"We visited TCF IN VALENCIA... it was just as expected, food is always good, drinks are always on point, yes there is a wait, but it's expected as the location is in the mall!!!!  Any restaurant that doesn't have a wait time is probably not worth visiting.  Avocado egg rolls hit the spot every time. Salads are fresh... I must say... the staff was extra attentive. I found the new place may still be developing a rhythm... but it's just expected of a new restaurant. SCV residents are not accustomed to not being able to make a reservation, this will be a complaint point every time... they'll get over it if they want Cheesecake."
Jazmin C.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",6,38,7,5.0,4/11/2017,Great food. Great service. Location is perfect. Tons of vegan options! They close pretty late which is a huge plus because I'm a late night eater. My boyfriend is obsessed with their cheesecakes
Hannah C.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/6/2017,"The food is as any other Cheesecake Factory, but the wait times are ridiculous. Also every time I try to order ahead over the phone I'm always having to call back two or three times because I'm stuck on hold for 5-10 minutes each time."
Cheyenne D.,"Los Angeles, CA",156,13,3,2.0,3/28/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but the food at this location isn't anything like the others. The food prepared here is disappointing every time. This review is based on multiple visits."
Alexis M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",94,13,1,1.0,3/27/2017,Horrible service! We ordered cheesecakes and they left them out of out to go bags! They also did not replace them.
Rachel L.,"Los Angeles, CA",785,33,1,5.0,7/25/2017,Jason was a great server and gave quick service for us being on our lunch break!  He has manager written all over him and we hope to come back and have him take care of us again
Sarah W.,"Canyon Country, CA",151,8,,1.0,9/5/2017,"I am super patient about my experiences with food service as I use to be a server. However, today was the last straw. When they first opened, I went with my boyfriend. After getting our waters and putting in our order, it took us an hour to get our food. They tried to right the wrong, by having my boyfriends burger comped as they said ""they lost the burger."" We let it go and moved on. We tried again and came back another day after we got off work. The host suggested for us to sit at the bar area as it was moving faster than waiting for a table. We went with her suggestion. We had to literally grab a server as they were greeting every table but ours. I was dead set on getting my food there, but my boyfriend wanted to leave when our wait time reached 30 minutes.  This brings me to today. I went to order food for pick up for me and my co-workers, trying to eliminate the horrible wait staff. Ordering the food was quick and painless. However, I went to pick up my food. I paid at the register and grabbed everything as they were very clear that I had all my items. I got back to my car, and I'm missing the cheesecake! I go back in and I get the last of my items. I return to my work and I give the food to my co-workers. Luckily, they got the right food. However, I order a lunch pizza and salad. I am so irritated at how horrible this was. The cheese pizza was half cheese and half sauce. they didn't distribute the cheese. They threw it on one side and went from there. Then, my salad was literally romaine lettuce, a pinch of cheese, and 1 crouton- No Dressing. Now, if I had the time, I would have gone back and got my order corrected. However, I am at work, and I currently cannot go back just for my lunch. I am also 8 months pregnant and super irritated that the food I ordered is no where near what I expected. Especially with the experience being there. I tried to give this place a chance as they just opened at the time. It is now way more than enough time to work out the issues, and figure out who is a good sever/cook and who isn't. I am going to try and contact the restraunt myself when I get the moment because I am not pleased at all."
Priscilla M.,"Visalia, CA",1,34,6,1.0,3/14/2017,"Server was rude, didn't even greet with a smile or anything. We'd say thank you and she wouldn't even say anything back. Never coming back here. I believe her name was Brianna , or Bree, all I know is she had glasses on. Their customer service needs to definitely improve"
Sydny T.,"Castaic, CA",0,8,,4.0,7/20/2017,"The food here is always good as well as the cheese cake. Make sure to make a reservation for Friday nights and Weekend nights because it can get very busy. Good service. My favorite is the steak Diane and Oreo cheesecake, yum!"
