Eddely A.,"Los Angeles, CA",68,20,1,5.0,5/27/2017,"We visited TCF IN VALENCIA... it was just as expected, food is always good, drinks are always on point, yes there is a wait, but it's expected as the location is in the mall!!!!  Any restaurant that doesn't have a wait time is probably not worth visiting.    hit the spot every time. Salads are fresh... I must say... the staff was extra attentive. I found the new place may still be developing a rhythm... but it's just expected of a new restaurant. SCV residents are not accustomed to not being able to make a reservation, this will be a complaint point every time... they'll get over it if they want Cheesecake."
Ji K.,"Valencia, CA",2,39,77,3.0,12/15/2016,"Went for lunch on a weekday and was told there was a 40 minute wait. I don't mind waiting, but the fact that the line was closer to an hour fifteen irked me a bit. Family went inside, floor under the table was incredibly dirty (my sole felt weird, so I looked and saw a glob of something on it). Didn't have any problem with the service, food came out in a timely fashion. We got   (which I learned today can be requested to be a lunch portion), bistro shrimp pasta, and Cajun jambalaya pasta. The   were AMAZING, from the sauce to the warm crunchiness.  ...the pasta? Er-- bland. The bistro shrimp just tasted like noodles that were pathetically under seasoned. Cajun was better, but that one was lacking flavor as well. Personally just ate the top half because mixing the entire thing would have just made the flavor weaker. I would DEFINITELY return for more avocado rolls and try out the avocado toast. Would pass on the pasta."

This location is new to the SCV and I found it a bit challenging just finding the entrance, its on the side. There for early dinner with my son but the wait was still 30 minutes with many open tables visible and a bunch of other unhappy diners waiting as well. Dinner was good and service was very attentive with maybe a bit too much of the friendly banter, but I cannot hold that against them I guess. Prices are a bit high but this is a high end eatery, I will probably look elsewhere for an average dining experience unless I have a hankering for the  , Aloha."
