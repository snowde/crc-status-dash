Dora O.,"Canyon Country, CA",48,3,,4.0,10/18/2017,This place is very good I loved every thing about it. Being from Santa Clarita it has been a long time since we have had a resturant as exciting as Cheesecake Factory. Many places have opened up but out of all them this has been worth the wait. The wait to sit was long on a weekend night but the food made that time worth it. The wait for the food wasn't long which made it even better. Defiantly a great place to dine in on the weekends or during lunch with coworkers or close family. Coming back again can't get enough of their pasta
Vic J.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,4,1,5.0,10/18/2017,"Decided to stay local for lunch on Sunday instead of trekking to S.F. Valley with visiting in-law.  Glad we did as seating for 3 was immediate and an attentive, upbeat server Brandon checked in with us just enough to ensure a pleasant experience without hovering.  All meals were on point;  seared tuna tataki salad,  grilled salmon and the grilled turkey burger were all delish.  If I had to nitpick, the side of fries I had with the burger were skimpy and contained too many little shards instead of actual fries (which makes no sense since you can get a 3 lb. bag of potatoes for like a buck??)  but all in all, a cool dining experience."
Jill M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,17,3,3.0,9/20/2017,Love Cheesecake factory but happy is not been so happy. Our server Brandon has the entire bar area and working so hard. As managers are standing around socializing with various tables in the bar. Instead of helping Brandon or better yet split the bar area with 2 servers during happy hour. Just not managed well. Didn't help that my daughter spilled a glass of water. Food is really good.
Rhiannon F.,"San Fernando, Los Angeles, CA",49,5,1,2.0,11/26/2017,"This place is really just... meh. The food was salty, but hot I guess. Cheesecake was good. Service was just ok. I'm not sure if our server was new or what, but it was just awkward and it took longer for us to get our slices of cheesecake, than it took to get our dinner. Seating was good and fast. But overall, our experience was just so-so. I don't know that I'd come back with so many other options close by."
A C.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",1,46,4,5.0,5/10/2017,"We finally made our 1st visit out to our local Cheesecake Factory. We usually frequent the Americana location and contrary to what I read here we had an absolutely pleasant experience. We sat outside on that patio and were waited on by someone by the name, Carolyn. I cannot even begin to tell you what a wonderful experience we had with her. From checking on us every few minutes and continuously bringing us warm bread until our food came out, to making sure we had a refill even before we had to ask for one. She even was kind enough to bring our toddlers food out even before ours was ready so he wouldn't get too fussy and we could enjoy our meal in peace-LOL. We will definitely be back and honestly probably ask for her so we can get sat in her section. BTW food was delicious. Husband asked for a medium rare steak and it was cooked perfectly he said. Will most definitely be returning back to this location."
Tony L.,"Valencia, CA",6,127,31,2.0,3/25/2017,"Oh, where to begin... Pro: Great location, massive menu, interior is beautiful, friendly servers, my kids love it, food is better than average, and the cheesecake selection is amazing.  Cons: The 2-hour ""average"" wait. Friday, Saturday, holidays -over 3 hours  I refuse to go here again until they start accepting reservations. In this day and age, for a busy restaurant not to accept reservations is absurd."
So M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",7,3,,1.0,3/4/2017,"This is an individual incident and not a tear on the company itself, but this particular location has waitresses and management that don't care to make up for their mistakes.  We came for my girlfriends birthday and we can't order drinks without our waitress spilling an entire coke on the table and (you guessed it) the birthday girl.  Their response? Oops. Sorry. Night goes on ""business as usual."" They bring us towels, but we practically clean the table ourselves. The night goes on and they reach all over us and don't excuse themselves dropping utensils and baskets of bread. Just an all around great night.  They bring us the check. Everything is full-price. Nothing comped. Fine. No one complains, but wow. I thought servers worked for tips.  We're not looking for handouts here, but they could have at least comped the Bday girls Cheesecake. Nope. Almost forgot to mention, that they had a dead roach in the bathroom. Who knows how long it was there.  Food was good though. Service sucked completely."
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,3.0,2/17/2017,"Given that it is such a huge national chain restaurant, it is really a step above the rest. Don't get the hype about their cheesecake, I have tried several, none better than from the grocery store and priced way too high. The menu is overwhelming, you get tired of reading after awhile. Their veggie burger was OK, I liked the egg roll sampler as well. Service was fine, once you get past the long wait for a table it goes rather quickly. Nice addition to the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."
Rose J.,"Las Vegas, NV",30,1,1,1.0,4/12/2017,"Horrible wait time for a party of 8!!!! I see a party of 6 & 7 already called but after an hour wait, I asked if how much longer do we have to wait and the host said another 1-2 hours!!! It is absurd!!! Poor management!!! Ok update: Before my party left Cheesecake factory last night, I ordered a 10 inch layer of cheesecake that has chocolate mousse on top and chocolate at the bottom for my daughter's birthday yesterday that cost $53 before tax but when we got home and were super excited to open it, we were all disappointed to just have a plain cheesecake that is oreo flavored! What the heck is wrong with these people working at this restaurant??? I am so pissed!!!! If it's just not an hour drive from Airforce base going to Valencia, I could've returned the cake and yelled at this people!!!"
Jj R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",123,2,,5.0,10/19/2017,Everything was amazing. I loved the cheesecake! I will be back as soon as they open tomorrow with my family!
Rafael V.,"Valencia, Valencia, CA",0,31,,5.0,6/10/2017,"Great time!!! Great food and quality service, every time I have come to the Cheesecake Factory in Valencia I have been provided with excellent food, fair price and great service. I will continue to come and recommend this restaurant, TY for bringing such joy to the Santa Clarita Valley!!"
Krysteen M.,"Pacoima, Los Angeles, CA",38,1,,5.0,10/11/2017,"Favorite place to go with my family. Tyna is an excellent server, Fernando (the manager) super friendly. The staff is super friendly. The food is cooked to perfection. They even remove the feces line in the shrimp. 10/10 the food and service are so worth it !"
Brad P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",14,13,22,4.0,6/8/2017,"The meals I have had here have all been fine. My wife was not happy this last time with her salad. Service was phenomenal. The guy was really hip, and attentive to our dining needs. Of course the cheesecake was really good. If you like coffee you will like the newly modified coffee flavored one that they have been promoting."
Gef J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,56,66,1.0,3/7/2017,"I couldn't get a seat away from the door at the Cheesecake Factory Mini-Express.  It's a long stretch from the full size ones like San Francisco Sacramento San Diego Pleasanton Santa Monica Newport Beach, you get the idea"
Jennifer G.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",11,3,,2.0,11/18/2017,"Only positive was we got a table for two within 5 minutes on a Saturday. After that nothing good at all. We were walked over to a table that was still full of plates and not cleaned. Waited for that to be cleared up. They brought just forks and knives threw them on the table no napkins. Waitress was sweet, but seemed to have to much to do. Once ordered we waited close to 30-45 min for our food. Not being checked on in between at all. When our food arrived you could tell it had been sitting for a while and it was cold. Between then our waitress only returned once. Never removed any plates from our table even when they were visibly done with. After it all food was not good at all and just felt nasty. We then waited I don't know how long for her to return so we could get our check. Over all we won't be back to spend our money here."
Lucy M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,15,,5.0,10/7/2017,"Came here on busy Saturday night with my hubby and our server was Samantha M. The wait was not so bad for Saturday. I got shrimp bistro pasta which was delicious and my hubby got chicken piccata and he liked it. The food was very tasty, but what made it even better was Samantha. She is one of the best servers that I have ever seen. She was sweet and very attentive. This was the first time trying Cheesecake factory in Santa Clarita and based on other reviews I had some reservations, but I was pleasently surprised and that was mostly because of our server. Thank you Sam!!"
Rebecca B.,"Bakersfield, CA",4,60,101,3.0,8/6/2017,"I ordered the eggplant Parmesan. I would not order that again. It was WAY too sweet. I thought at first that it was the marinara sauce, but it was the egg plant. It tasted like they added sugar to it. The waiter was very attentive and we very much enjoyed the bread that was given."
Michael S.,"Ithaca, NY",6,7,,5.0,9/19/2017,"My friend and I had an incredible experience here the other night. Our waitress, Dina (or Deena, not sure how to spell her name), was excellent and very nice. But we were especially impressed by the manager, Fernando, who was very attentive to all the tables and personally ensured that we had a memorable experience. He was by far the most considerate and kind restaurant manager I have ever seen! I wish corporate would recognize him for his amazing work-- he truly is going far, far above and beyond expectations.  The food was also great. Shared the Eggroll sampler, the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, and the fish tacos. All were prepared perfectly and highly enjoyable.  Overall, this was the best service I've ever received and was one of the best overall restaurant experiences I've ever had. Out of all the Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to, this one was the best by far."
Cory G.,"Newhall, CA",6,46,4,4.0,5/29/2017,"Dude, this is false Advertising. I came here ya know expecting a full on factory powerhouse producing and manufacturing cheesecakes you know and I come here and what do I see? A variety of different foods and cheesecakes on the display! It was t even a factory. Here I am expecting to be at some kind of willy wonka chocolate factory where I see the magic behind them pushing out cheesecakes! But no, instead it's just a bunch of tables and people eating foods other than cheesecake! What the heck, so misled and tricked . This shouldn't be called a factory at all, More like cheesecake food diner, or cheese grub n chill, or dine and kick it. But nahhhh Factory!? Pfffft where?"
Sydney S.,"Shafter, CA",3,35,35,4.0,8/6/2017,"I got the Baja chicken tacos. They came with a side of rice and beans. The rice was not good but the beans were good. The tacos were filled with flavor and were delicious. My companions got the club sandwich and eggplant Parmesan. The club sandwich was good. The eggplant parmesan was good but the sauce was on the sweet side. Our waiter was nice and he made sure I had a refill when I needed one. Before your food comes, they give you complementary bread and I loved the wheat bread, it didn't even need butter and it was very soft and delicious!"
