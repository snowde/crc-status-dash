Ann P.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,32,,5.0,12/5/2017,"I've been to a lot of different Cheesecake Factories. I've been to This one several times and have to admit this one is excellent! The service has always been great. The food is always delicious and portions are large...enough for leftovers the next day, and the plethora of desserts are  of course amazing!!! Their happy hour is well worth it if you can find a spot at the bar. Be prepared for a super long wait on weekend nights. But well worth it!!"
Nichole A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/14/2017,"Worst Cheesecake Factory experience. Sarah L was our waitress, and not a very good one at that. From beginning to end, the service was less than satisfactory.  Once seated, we were approached and by two separate waitresses (after 10 minutes of waiting to give a drink order) and both waitresses were uncertain who's section our table belonged to. keeping in mind, we were one of 3 tables on the patio.  Once we received our waters, we ordered an appetizer salad and a burger to split. We specifically pointed to the burger we wanted on the menu. We received our salad around 10 minutes after placing the order and the salad was dry. Whilst waiting on our dressing and other drinks to come to table, in this 15 minute period we were brought a different burger than one we asked for initially and sent it back. Then, 45 minutes into waiting for a fixed meal, our waitress, Sarah L, was nowhere to be found. Once she came back to our table, we received nothing more than a bad attitude and non-apologetic tone. We asked for the burger to be taken off of our bill and left unsatisfied with an hour of our time gone and half a dry appetizer salad in our stomachs. we will not be returning."

Sarah S.,"Bonners Ferry, ID",53,10,,4.0,8/14/2017,We ate here for dinner and the best part of the evening was having Brandon as our waiter. He was very attentive and kept us laughing all night. 4 stars was for our Chicken Madeira which was burned in the bottom.
Kat K.,"Santa Clarita, CA",469,50,,4.0,3/6/2017,"I still have to stay with a 4 rating from my first review, but not for the reason I gave earlier. Today, Monday, I was with 15 other women for lunch. Our organizer had confirmed by phone with the restaurant on a couple of issues and we were pleased that they handled them well. Our servers, Sam and Andrew, took good care of us getting the orders taken quickly and serving us in a timely manner. I think most if not all of us enjoyed our meals, but what stood out was the entertaining ways our servers had...Andrew very funny and Sam very sweet and helpful. Both were exceptionally personable and made our visit ""more"" than just a lunch!  PS...really glad I decided on the ""30th Anniversary"" cheesecake to indulge in.  We will return, but, now, the lack of the 5th star...I paid a visit to the ladies room while there and was ""turned off"" by the ""cheap"" seat covers. Cc is beautiful inside...very classy, but its guests deserve that same class in the restrooms."
Vanessa I.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,53,1,5.0,8/23/2017,I've only eaten the cheese cake here and it's really good and there are so many different flavors.
Carolina A.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,10,3,1.0,1/29/2017,"The hostess was the only thing we liked about this Cheesecake Factory.  No utensils and we got some they were dirty. We had to ask for bread, but it was cold and hard. One order of appetizers were dropped. Then we were served COLD Wings..... there was nothing hot about them as if they never cooked them.  Our main course was much better than the rest of the food, but again the side dishes were barely warm enough. They definitely need someone to review the food before it goes out.  This was a disappointment. Will not be returning to this location anytime soon. Sticking to Glendale location which is awesome all around."
Danielle G.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,14,,5.0,9/29/2017,I always love the cheesecake factory! Great food and and clean and friendly5 stars all the way!
Eddy A.,"Bakersfield, CA",90,25,15,2.0,5/9/2017,Food was just OK.  Nothing to order again.   Chicken nuggets were mushy under cooked.    The girl behind the bar was really rude & to busy talking to the other girl working there to wait on us.    Blonde girl.  Brittany B was her name.          If you can avoid having her wait on you.  Do so     mark this place off as a return
Sandrita M.,"San Fernando, CA",78,32,87,1.0,8/27/2017,Came here on Sunday and let me tell you. Be ready to wait a long time for your food.  Should be better prepare for a busy day!!!
Lisa H.,"Santa Clarita, CA",41,1,,5.0,12/7/2017,"Just had dinner here! Very good and amazing service Brandon was our waiter super funny, personable, and sweet love him!!"
Jennifer G.,"Lancaster, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/9/2017,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would! When we got there we were told it would be 50 minutes which was fine, it was a Saturday night and we expected it to be busy. Half way through our wait we checked in to see how much longer, and we were told we were on track for our original wait time (yay!). After waiting 1 hour we asked how much longer and we're told there were a couple of groups ahead of us and that it should be within 15 minutes. After that 15 minutes had passed we checked in again and we're told we were next. After waiting 2 hours total we checked in again--were told there was 1 more group ahead of us. We explained to the hostess we had already heard that. She blamed it on someone else unapologetically. Since it was now 9:30pm we gave them back their pager and left. I will NEVER eat at another Cheesecake Factory again!! I can understand waiting about 15 minutes past the estimated time, but more than double the estimate and still not being seated is ridiculous!!"
Gloria A.,"Valencia, CA",1,1,,1.0,1/20/2017,"I went to cheesecake factory last night with my family to celebrate a birthday. We were dissatisfied with the entire experience from the service to the quality of the food.  First we had a long wait for a table, which is to be expected at a new place. Then we waited for almost an hour for our food. The pasta was chewy and cold. After asking for it to be fixed we received no apology from the staff.  To make matters worse the manager then came to our table with the bill and informed us they had a 2 drink per hour limit.  As successful restaurant owners and someone who has spent 40 years in the restaurant industry I am very understanding of minor mistakes. I was very disappointed by our dinning experience."
Shannon K.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",0,8,1,1.0,1/13/2017,"Update: The boyfriend really wanted me to give this place another shot... Bless his heart. I will leave you with this glorious video that is quite representative of our meal... Tonight I placed a phone order for curbside pickup as me and my tiny human are sick and didn't want to cook (obviously). Once I arrived at their designated pickup spots, I called the phone number and was on hold for 10 minutes, which is uncool, but not unbearable. Eventually, we just decided to go into the restaurant to pick it up as we were tired of waiting and missing crucial Zootopia viewing time.  Once inside, we're told that our order was nowhere to be found. It just vanished into thin air, apparently? The manager was completely unhelpful and discourteous with an ""oh well"" attitude.  0/10 stars. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200."
AD K.,"Canyon Country, CA",1,66,29,5.0,4/6/2017,"It's been a while since I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory. Came by during lunch today The lunch special was delicious! Victor, our server, recommended a salmon dish that's not on them menu. It was salmon with mushroom, capers, and lemon. The salmon was cooked to perfection. It also came with a side of mash potatoes and broccoli. It was such a perfect day to have lunch outside in the patio.  Thank you Victor for your superb service and recommendations!"
Christine L.,"Santa Clarita, CA",32,30,40,4.0,7/27/2017,Lauren V rocks! Great energy! Awesome server! Super fun! Ask for her! :) food great! Yummm! Drinks AMAZING!!!!
Denise B.,"Valencia, CA",0,10,,1.0,11/26/2017,"Other locations have been great, but not this one in Valencia.  They do a very poor job in handling takeout and have no quality control.  They don't stand behind the satisfaction of their customers in any way.  Very disappointing.  I was so excited when this came to our city but poorly managed."
Cory D.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,9,,4.0,11/26/2017,"This was a pleasant experience for me and two others. I was expecting really bad service because of all the reviews, but even when the restaurant was packed we had great service. All of the tables were completely full and Mackenzie still managed to always have our waters full and drinks and food were served in a good amount of time. Even when asking for simple things like Ranch and more bread, it was brought to us very quickly. I would say the service was a 5 considering how busy this place was, but honestly I thought the food was pretty average so I bumped it down to a 4. And this is an honest review of what I thought of the place, no one there asked us to leave one."
Robert W.,"Castaic, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/19/2017,"went to that cheesecake factory for the first time, plus that was my first time in one ever. IMO the food sucked bad.  the factory nacho appetizer was cheaply made and for the 16 plus$$ was WAY over priced! then add in my take out order it was put in a pizza box that was soggy by the time it got home??? But the fish and chips came in a plastic box with lid? So that means they did have them to use but did not? That is silly at best or bad planing??,  fish and chips was 'okay' .for the price needed WAY more fries The bread given me was tough too and since I did take out---ohh well NEVER AGAIN Then the cheesecake??? from all the raves I heard I expected far better!!!!  There are local  bake shops that blow that place out of the water at the same cost for 3 times better cakes!"
Mika B.,"Lambertville, NJ",0,4,,5.0,11/5/2017,My family and I went to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time and had a wonderful experience! The wait was not that long and we sat outside because the weather was so nice. Our server Jessica was very friendly and gave us great recommendations for the avocado rolls and the s'mores Cheesecake and it was AMAZING. Our server was very attentive and definitely made the whole experience a 10 in my book. We will be back for more :)
