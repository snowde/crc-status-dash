Elizabeth L.,"Fullerton, CA",95,7,,1.0,12/22/2016,"My family came here for my moms birthday. Just a party of 5 and the service here is horrendous. They take forever to take your order and bring your food and drinks to you. They not only took forever, they brought all 5 of our meals at different times - 10 to 15 minutes a part from each other. Most of our meals got cold before we started eating together. Then we had to flag someone down 20 minutes after receive our check to tell them we would like to pay. The wait staff was incredibly rude on top of everything as well.  The reason the wait is an hour or more for this place is because they work incredibly slow. Not because it's great.  Cherry on top was that there was no soap in the men's or women's restrooms.  In short, this place is overrated with horrible, horrible service. Be prepared to wait for the worst service and so-so food. I would go anywhere else if I were you."
Diana M.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",3,181,284,4.0,3/25/2017,So glad Cheesecake Factory is finally in SCV! Service was fabulous with very attentive wait staff. The food was great and their Grilled Fish Tacos are the best!! You get four street tacos with black beans and rice.
Dean P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",114,808,3351,3.0,1/7/2017,"Eh. We desperately need this restaurant in Santa Clarita and this chain is popular and busy in any city they open. I grew up with this chain living in Orange County so it is not my first time at a Cheesecake Factory. The place is decorated amazing as they always are. Party of 6 Got here at 4:40 on a Friday hoping to avoid the huge wait I have been hearing about...not a chance. The people working are doing their best but it's very hectic and loud at the check in desk. Here's another odd thing, some people get a transponder thing and some give their name. So as it gets busier and louder a hostess is going around trying to find Carmen party of 4 and walking through the crowd...why doesn't Carmen have a transponder? So we are told 30 min wait at roughly 5 pm., ok not too bad I guess. About 45 min later we inquire about our table. We are told our party was assigned a specific table and the people still sitting at that particular table have not left yet...@@..what? Really, is this how it's done? So in the meantime other people who came in after us are being seated.... hardly seems effective. After just about an hour we are seated. The booths are big and comfy but it's very dark in here. When the server comes to your table twice and says, "" I promise your food is coming out soon"", you know you are screwed. It takes way too long for the food but they are crazy busy by now because it's after 6pm. The food is amazing as they always do. Salmon and asparagus was delicious as well as the tuna tataki salad, it was all great, they never disappoint in that area. Total time in the restaurant was 2.5 hours, that's too long for me. This is my review so my opinion, great food but I would not return unless it was for lunch on a weekday."
Sann E.,"Valencia, CA",0,9,,2.0,9/17/2017,Would give five stars if they would accept reservations. Lines too long for a party of eight to wait. Hint-accept reservations for party of six or more. Minimum purchase per person. Those of us who want to go for a full lunch and dessert wouldn't have a problem with this.
Sleepy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",370,12,3,3.0,12/23/2016,"Okay. Let's establish the fact that this Cheesecake Factory is new. Coming in the beginning month was a little rough, because as with any team, you gotta get in sync. Today is my 7th visit since the opening in Nov. Every OTHER visit was horrible because I expected it to be just like all the others. I ordered my favorite, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and it had absolutely no flavor. It was cooked literally in stewed tomatoes. No garlic, no onions and awfully seasoned.  After two attempts, the third time was the charm. I understand that the new cooks and servers were training, so I wasn't too upset. I've meet some of the servers that were working here, but they were mostly trainers from other locations. Some of the regular faces around here now, need to lighten up. They are too stiff, dry and nervous. Relax and have a cool conversation. Just breathe, you'll be fine.  Two weeks later, I ordered the usual and it was again not good. I have been to a lot of different Cheesecake Factory's and it remains in one of my 10 places to eat. This particular location feels like it's going to take awhile to get the formula right, but I have faith.  We are here today 12/23/2016 and our server is Emma. She's young and new and is a ball of fun energy. Let's see if she gets it right. Stay tuned.... Emma was GREAT! She really took care of business. She attended to all the tables in her area and made sure everyone, including us were happy with the food and service. The best thing about Emma was that no matter how busy she got, she handled it with a smile. Emma made this experience worth coming back again."
Bob R.,"Castaic, CA",2,23,1,3.0,6/9/2017,"Very Slow service on an afternoon they were not busy, just after lunch rush. I would not complain but the other time I was there service was slow also. When you're paying above averages prices for meal you expect at least good service. The food is the same as all other Cheesecake Factories which I think is good, but not great. Although I will say the burgers are huge but you do pay for it."
Christina C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,11,2,1.0,7/20/2017,"We waited over one hour for food. We made a reservation for lunch at 11. No drink refills. Cold soup. Hard hard pasta. I believe the restaurant term is the food ""died in the window"" when some plates are done before others and it sits too long and gets cold. Shame we paid top dollar."
Anna O.,"Palmdale, CA",51,8,2,1.0,8/13/2017,"Horrible service. By the way it was my second time trying to give them another chance, however it was worst than the first time. Hated this experience at a Cheesecake Factory. I went for Sunday brunch and it was not even busy. The servers have no clue how to treat customers. We had to hunt down our server just to get a refill. When we received our check we waited for the server to return, she never came back. After waiting for 15 minutes, I decided to get up and ask for a manager. The manager apologized and comped half of our meal, however the experience still ruined it for us. I refuse to return and give them my business."
Gail M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",23,40,10,3.0,8/11/2017,Started out sitting in the restaurant but could not get happy hour drinks prices. A very nice waitress found us a table in the bar. Should be a good experience. Well food was delicious However can't give 5 stars as my husbands food was served and mine was 15 minutes later. Servers addressed the issue but here I sit with no food. Server stated manager is aware. We ordered a cheesecake slice to go wondering if they would comp us. Server was like for what?  Really !  I had to state for my long wait for Miso salmon. She checked with manager and they agreed. The server should have authority for such things or checked before coming  back to our table. The parking is horrible nothing convenient about this place. The salmon was delicious as well as the 4 cheese pasta if not craving this. I will stick with Claim Jumpers.
Arianne A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,6,6,1.0,1/17/2017,"I walked in on a Tuesday evening to reserve a table for 4 people. But after she told me the wait was going to be 40 minutes and I responded nicely... ""I'm ok"". She responded rudely and rolled her eyes.  I grew up in the valley and always went to the Cheesecake Factory in Woodland Hills and I was so excited to hear that they finally opened up in my neighborhood. I'm so disappointed with this location."
Victoria P.,"Canyon Country, Canyon Country, CA",0,2,,4.0,11/19/2017,thank you for the amazing service. i loved all the food. i will be back soon with my friends and famiky
Dolores E.,"Newhall, Newhall, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/19/2017,"I took my family to eat here last night and services was horrible. We had to ask for everything we needed: set of utensils, water(reminded waitress several times without luck). My husband asked for another beer and she forgot and remember until we ask for the bill (too late). I will never go there again to get mediocre service. Run away from this place."
Randi M.,"Canyon Country, CA",323,886,151,2.0,12/19/2016,"I came here for my birthday, maybe they are having difficulties because they are still so new.  However, some of the things that happened just make me shake my head.  I came with 3 big dudes and my wife.  They seated us at a a table for 4, which was ridicuously small.  The guys were cramped on one side and they pulled up a chair for the 3rd guy.  I went up to the front and asked why we couldnt have a table for 6, it was a Monday night btw.  Finally, they gave us another table.  Then, the server was so scatterbrained.  She brought 2 pats of butter for so much bread.  We asked for more butter, that took forever.  We thought she was out back churning it herself.  The food was fine, typical ""chain"" fare.  Portions are large.  We shared 2 types of cheesecake and everyone loved them( I'm not a real cheesecake fan).  It is what it is.  It will never be a destination restaurant for me."
Penelope S.,"Valencia, CA",48,10,,1.0,6/13/2017,Let me start by saying I learned a lesson from this experience. Do not go to Cheesecake Factory if you have a big party or you want to celebrate a special occasion.. Go somewhere more accommodating .. Somewhere that actually gives a shit your going to spend $400-$500 dollars on a family members Birthday. This place needs help in customer service. I'm so frustrated I can't think straight. Complete waste of time and money. We ended up being there for 5 hours ..  For large parties be prepared to wait a LONG time. Not sure where they expect you to wait. Had some drinks in the bar area and I think we had 2 servers cause 1 would ask if we wanted another than a few minutes later another person would ask us the same question and we told them the other person took the order already. Not only did this happen in the bar it also happened at the table as well .. once we sat it took 30-40 minutes to get a glass of wine. Once we ordered another 40 minutes to get the food out to the table. Servers ( I'm thinking we had 2 ) were so confused and could not keep up. Management never once seemed to care nor come out to apologize for anything. They must of been to all of what was going on during these hours we were there.  If it were not for a Birthday several people in the party would of complained. It took forever to get our checks although payment process went by pretty quick.  I'm sickened to think of the money we spent and what a complete waist of time waiting around for all of it. Please be warned. They do not care about their guests. Go somewhere else if you have a large party and want to enjoy your evening celebrating.
Renee K.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,24,1,1.0,7/8/2017,Horrible service! Took over 20 minute to get two waters and bread. Then another 5 minutes for our sons kids Apple juice. Food took way too long too. Waitresses never came to check on us. Sad because we love CF and eat at many of them. This location needs major help!
G L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,1.0,11/6/2017,"Had't been to Cheesecake Factory for years because there is none in my neighborhood. I remembered their extensive menu, large portions and variety of cheesecakes so I decided to drive 20 miles and celebrate my kid's birthday here on a Saturday afternoon. As I walked in, I discreetly told the hostess if they can bring out something for my kid as a surprise at the end and she wrote my kid's name on a piece of paper. Well, towards the end of our meal, the server came to tell us that a free birthday dessert is only a small scoop of ice cream and that if we want a slice of cheesecake, we need to order one. Also, she asked what my kid's name is and he is sitting right there! Ugh, so there goes our surprise. We ended up ordering a slice, and when the server brought it to our table, she and 3 other servers sang the most pathetic birthday song ever, as if they really hated what they are going through that moment. It was so sad and disappointing. Their menu is still extensive but the prices were a lot higher than what I remembered. The food was mediocre compared to their prices. The service... well, terrible."
Megan E.,"Valencia, CA",50,2,,1.0,6/19/2017,"I have never be motivated to provide negative yelp review on Yelp before but after our most recent family experience at the Cheesecake Factory in Valencia, I am leaving my first.  This past Thursday was my daughters graduation from 6th grade. We asked our daughter where she wanted to eat and she said, "" The Cheesecake Factory"".   I had called two weeks prior to the event as we were expecting a larger crowd along with other families from our school potentially looking to celebrate a lunch at the Cheesecake Factory-so I reached out on two separate occasions  make a reservation and was told, "" We clearly do not do reservations"".  Proactively, I was able to have sister go to the Cheese factory early and hold a position in-line at 10:40 to secure a table for my family.... as it was our understanding ""first come first serve"" to get a table.    Due to graduations the restaurant was extremely busy.  There was about 50 people waiting when the doors opened promptly at 1130 am.  We were the 2nd party to formally check-in with the hostess as we were a party of 11. We were asked if we had a reservation and I said, no.  The Hostess then handed us a pager and said, "" my manager will be right with you"".  We waited at least 10 minutes for the manager to come speak to us to tell us the wait is going to be an hour to an hour and 45 minutes wait due to reservations.  I explained to the manager that I had called last week and was told that "" we don't accept reservations"".  The manager then went on to explain, we were all booked for today last week and were not accepting any more reservations.""   When I called the person never said, "" we are booked and not accepting reservations"", if they did we would have gone somewhere else.   We finally sat down to eat at 11:51 after  we agreed to sit in the patio.  While our waitress was very friendly, it took 30 mins for 1/2 of our party to get their beverages as ordered and at least an hour after we sat down to get our food.  Once we got our food we were told that my husbands order was made wrong and they were remaking the meal-okay I get it.  Once my husbands received his meal, the order was still wrong and he had to wait an additional 15 minutes for his second meal to arrive.  When he did receive the fish tacos again prepared incorrectly with the special Cheesecake factory mayonnaise...  he ended up eating the meal as everyone else was almost finished and we clearly had already spent way too much time at the restaurant along with the fact that he did not wait anymore.   Clearly this lead to a horrible customer experience that clearly involved the management (general manager Troy Andrian and his assistant manager-name unknown) which BOTH failed to accept any responsibility or help mitigate the poor customer experience based on the action of management and it's staff's actions associated with this terrible review.   ""Completely disappointed with this location and the complete lack of accommodation from the General Manager Troy Andrian and his Assistant manager- what a disaster!!"
Ali R.,"Los Angeles, CA",281,6,1,1.0,6/5/2017,"Let me first say that this is my favorite restaurant and the only reason I chose to come here! This is where I always have my birthday dinners as a tradition and due to the experience I had, what a mistake.  Went there there yesterday for my 21st birthday and it was the worst service and experience that I have ever had at any Cheesecake Factory. The only good thing about the experience that I had was my server, Kenlee.  So at the beginning of the night we sat at the bar, figured get some drinks because I was turning 21, and the drinks were awful. I ordered the Long Island Iced Tea and it was basically like drinking Rum out of the bottle. There was no other taste to it. I had to wait for the ice to melt a bit to make it even semi what I ordered. On the other hand, my dad got the same thing and his was like drinking Lemonade. Clearly there is a discrepancy with the mixture of the drinks and definitely something that needs to be fixed. They should train their bartenders better. When we returned my dad's drink, a lady from the bar came over to question why we were returning it and told us, ""well could be because the ice melted..."" but the drink didn't even come in the same color as mine. His was a yellow-ish color, while mine was a brownish one. Finally they brought him a new one, and at that point, the drink was just as bad because they over did it with the Rum.  When it came time for the food, my mom ordered the Steak Diane medium well, which was great but the potatoes had little flavor, my brother ordered a burger medium well with extra fries, I ordered the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp, and my dad ordered the New York Strip Steak well done. My brother had mainly bread when it came to his burger because there was barely any meat and my dad got his New York Steak basically RAW, definitely not how he ordered it. We called the waitress over and told her the problem she took it back and apologized, but when it came back it was the exact same way. At that point we ordered something else for him and that took 45 mins to make, mind you me and my mom and brother were already done with our meal. It was a Sunday night and was not even busy so there should have been NO REASON as to why things were sloppy and took forever. The waitress even mentioned that a well done piece of meat should take approx. 20 mins to make. Eventually the manager came over spoke with us, and ended up going and cooking the new meal himself. At that point we explained the experience to the manager and the disappointment the experience was and he complimented 2 meals, and a cheesecake. That was nice of him, but for the experience that we had unacceptable. The waitress repeatedly apologized and was understanding, but this is the WORST experience I've ever had and have no intentions on returning. I also had to literally yell at the people at my table to talk because the music was so loud.  The manager could have been more accommodating to the situation, had a bit of a pompous attitude, and wanted to have little interaction and solve the problem so he wouldn't have to deal with us anymore.  The experience was horrific to the point where I didn't even want them to sing happy birthday or anything. I should have saved my money and gone somewhere else! I highly recommend if you plan on coming to this establishment go to the one in Glendale, you will be much happier even if having to do the extra drive. I regret coming here!!"
Veronica Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,10,1,2.0,8/19/2017,"We've been to many cheesecake factory locations and this one was a disappointment. Our dinner started off good the atmosphere was pleasant with it being not very busy or crowded. Our waitress and hostess were very nice. Our displeaaure started when our food took too long to come out and when it did my pasta dish was over cooked. Not just slightly over cooked but it was mushy and had hardened into a lump on the center of my plate. I hate to send food back and avoid it at all costs but I had to send it back there was no way i could eat it. Well after already waiting a while for our original order and now needing to wait for our replacement we ended up sharing the one dish that was okay and bagged the reorder. It was such a disappointment that our inconvenience was not addressed and after ordering $80.00 worth of food for two that something would have been said, even just an apology."
Kay W.,"Canyon Country, CA",32,14,,4.0,7/11/2017,"When our local Cheesecake Factory first opened, my friends and I went there for lunch. At that time the food was great but the service was terrible. We had not gone back for a long time, but decided we'd give it another try today. This time the service was fantastic! Our waitress, Annalit, was wonderful. She was friendly and very competent. She answered all of our questions and came by the table several times to see if there was anything we needed."
