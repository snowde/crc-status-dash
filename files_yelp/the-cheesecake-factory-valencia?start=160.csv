John G.,"Burbank, CA",0,121,13,2.0,7/24/2017,"Brought the family here for lunch, it was my first time eating at a Cheesecake Factory. It's a very nice establishment, and the menu is very vast with lots of options. Portions are large and prices seem about right for it. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive and it seemed like a nice experience. My only issue was with my food, I ordered the lunch special shepherds pie. It's had good taste but it was floating in a sea of grease and oil. I spooned some out but it was just too much. The ground meat they used had some raw chunks still in it. Not a little pink inside, but raw, cold and uncooked pieces. And lastly it was filled with mushrooms. I understand it's mushroom gravy, but I picked out about 18 oil slathered mushrooms. Menu didn't say it was a mushroom pie. First shepherds pie I've seen with sliced mushrooms in it. I could deal with removing some mushrooms and a chunk of raw hamburger but with the grease, it was not appetizing. The nice waiter took it away and was going to remove it. We ordered some awesome cheesecake, the key lime and snickers. The waiter said he was going to try to comp a cheesecake, which was nice but I really didn't care if he could. But when the bill came he said the manager wouldn't take anything off... including the horrible Shepard pie. I was surprised being that i only took a couple bites and the rest was scooped out on the side, but clearly was not eaten. I still tipped out the waiter more than suggested because he was very nice and attentive. But come on management... I guess the Cheesecake Factory would close if they didn't get their 14 bucks for the bowl of greasy mushrooms and raw meat. I didn't even mind that my food wasn't good. Because everyone else seemed happy, it was a decent experience and new and I ate some of the lady's salad and the cheesecake was great,, but to not remove a meal that was clearly poorly made and not eaten is pretty sad.  It's a good enough reason to not return or suggest to other folks."
Tracy B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",313,28,15,5.0,7/9/2017,This is my 2nd time to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. Both times the food was spectacular. The wait staff kept our drinks filled and asked if there was anything we needed. The place is clean both at the indoor tables and the outdoor table. In the record breaking heat the inside was cool! We had a great visit with family and friends and we could hear each other. I wish we had enough room for the cheesecake. We didn't. We all brought leftovers home.
Dot O.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,69,115,4.0,1/23/2017,Came in on Sunday for Brunch and doing a Monday Lunch curbside!! I will post my review after a few more visits!!!
Ernest S.,"Anthem, Las Vegas, NV",0,34,,5.0,12/1/2016,"First, for those who put 2 or 3 stars and mentioned they went during opening day or week, that's your fault. This is definitely a 5-star place. We purposely waited a month to come just to let the popularity die down a bit. Remember, SCV residents have been asking for this place for many, many years.  We went at 6 pm on a Thursday. (See, we didn't go at 12:00 pm on a weekday or 7:00 pm on a Friday night or 1:00 pm on a Sunday; avoid the stress of waiting for a table and come during ""off"" hours). Our wait for a booth was 5 minutes. Server's name was Deriana. Do yourself a favor and ask for her table. Great personality, food arrived within 10 minutes, she kept our drinks full, and checked on us throughout the evening. OUR ORDER Avocado Egg Rolls Fried Fish Tacos w/Cilantro Rice & Fries Louisiana Fried Chicken w/Bowtie Pasta Orange Chicken w/Rice Highly recommend all four dishes. Great place. We'll be back tomorrow."
Peggy S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",23,5,,5.0,8/31/2017,"My future daughter-in-law brought home two slices of cheese cake from the Valencia Cheese Cake Factory - Regular cheese cake with fresh strawberries and glaze and Coffee and Chocolate cheese cake, both were delicious and we really enjoyed them. We have been to the restaurant a couple of times now, they have a huge menu, every time I try to have something different. You can't go wrong. It's very busy there but the restaurant is large, we haven't had a wait yet. Worth going if you're hungry, too filling to eat dessert. Be sure to order a slice to take home."
Chris M.,"Sylmar, CA",179,375,1303,3.0,12/18/2016,"I have always liked the food here but the experience is always hit or miss. This location is new to the SCV and I found it a bit challenging just finding the entrance, its on the side. There for early dinner with my son but the wait was still 30 minutes with many open tables visible and a bunch of other unhappy diners waiting as well. Dinner was good and service was very attentive with maybe a bit too much of the friendly banter, but I cannot hold that against them I guess. Prices are a bit high but this is a high end eatery, I will probably look elsewhere for an average dining experience unless I have a hankering for the avocado egg rolls, Aloha."
Rafeed C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,10,3.0,2/16/2017,"Went here for Valentine's day with my gf. We went around 2:30.  We were seated right away and our waiter greeted us promptly and brought us complimentary bread as appetizers. We both ordered burgers with fries on the side.  I ordered a chicken sandwich, it was cooked properly and tasted awesome.  My gf ordered a burger and she wanted it cooked well done. However, when she bit into the burger the patty was very under cooked. The meat  was still pink inside and at best it was cooked to a medium.  We were disappointed, bit our hostess was very kind and offered us a refund for my gfs order and threw in a complimentary cheesecake.  Overall this cheesecake factory has very nice atmosphere and staff it just lacks in delivering quality food."
Candace M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",49,42,47,4.0,1/17/2017,"I love the food and atmosphere!  But I'm always bummed about the wait. They don't take reservations ahead of time so they said if You wanted to be seated at a certain time to show up 2 hours before and put  your name in.  I showed up right at 11:30am when they opened to let them know we had a party of 16 for 1:30pm.  I should tell you there was a line wrapped around the building of people doing a similar thing. Well everyone showed up at 1:30pm but we didn't actually didn't get seated for 45 mins after that.  The food is worth it though and we had 2 servers not 1 which was also nice for a party of our size. Of course I would go back, it's Cheesecake Factory!   Loved the outside patio.  I do wish they would take reservations."
Allison G.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,73,346,5.0,12/13/2016,"I would of loved this location outside far away from the mall and jerk folks that drive like A$$holes. Just happy to have Comfort Food that I am familiar with in this crazy area of whatever you call Santa Clarita. Anyway, awesome staff of New waiters that don't deserve your greedy hungry impatient attitude as a new place with a Big Menu! The food is the same at each location. Always great to know! Amazing manager in Troy! Wait and be Patient! Always leave w a slice of Cheesecake!! A+"
Toni C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2,5,,1.0,11/19/2016,Well we waited over 2 1/2 hours to get in the place with my girlfriend. We waited over 20 minutes for a coke and a mojito. Waited over 40 minutes for 2 sandwiches  I was very disappointed the waiter appeared to be high she couldn't look directly at us. I don't think I'll be coming back. All this hype for nothing.
Devida 2.,"El Cajon, CA",49,8,,2.0,4/15/2017,"Even though I LOVE Cheesecake Factory and I tried its food in several different locations, I was looking forward to trying the new location in Valencia where my parents live, but unfortunately I wasn't impressed at all! We waited foe 2 hours to get a table, lighting is too dim, took forever to get our food and when we got the food, it didn't taste good Kind of disappointing"
Alice A.,"Granada Hills, CA",539,143,31,3.0,11/12/2016,"My boyfriend and I were excited to check out the new Cheesecake Factory in this area. I guess you shouldn't come in with high expectations just because it's new. Ok, so we walk in and already walking up we knew it would be a wait to be seated. The hostess gets my name and advised wait time is 30 minutes. No problem we said and proceeded to wait. 1 HOUR later still waiting and at that point I noticed my boyfriend getting bothered but I being patient said 'it hasn't been that long' he looked at me like I was crazy.  Our buzzer goes off and to the front we go. The hostess that walked us over was very friendly and sat us in a good spot in our own little booth, perfect! Our waitress comes by and introduced herself, Martha. Great! We were on a roll since the wait was ridiculous but they were making up for it.  Martha takes our drink order right away. Boyfriend gets a coke and I discovered after many years that they have Arnold Palmer which is my all time favorite tea so I ordered it. Martha brings the coke, bread and advises my Arnold Palmer is almost ready. Sounds great! We knew what we wanted to order so she takes the order down. Boyfriend gets Fettuccine Alfredo and I get my favorite Chicken and Biscuits. At that point my drink had been brought and I was stoked. My boyfriend asked me to taste his coke because he was certain it was diet and it wasn't it was just flat. Our waitress was nowhere in sight and I'm not sure if it was because I was looking around but a higher up in the waitress/waiter area came up (we assumed he was their trainer) I told him about the drink and immediately took care of it. I pointed out I was scoping out for our waitress to take care of it. He was on top of it making sure his drink was up to par. My drink was sour and no Arnold Palmer but eh I let it go at this point. Our food arrived and the gentleman that was there assisting was watching our server place the plates on our table correctly because to him presentation was important and I loved that! Our food was delicious! It was fresh and we enjoyed every bite of it.  Oh and Martha was just there when our food was taken to us and we didn't see her until it was time to pay. On the other hand the gentleman that was the head guy in my book came back with another fresh coke to make sure it was right for my boyfriend. Honestly he was really going above and beyond for us just for that drink. He kept checking in with us.  The restaurant is very lovely and I wouldn't discard the suggestion of coming back. I feel like once this whole grand opening hype is over the wait won't be that bad.  Some waitresses/waiters need more training on customer service, to be more attentive and not give you the impression that they want you out once you've paid and ate your meal.  That's how I felt with another waitress roaming around our table. She gave the vibe of 'get up! Go! You already ate, we need the table' feeling.  Hopefully this all changes and if I do go back I'll update my review. Honestly the only reason it's a 3 star and not a 1 is because of the gentleman that assisted us tonight plus the delicious food."
Frank C.,"Los Angeles, CA",62,91,39,5.0,7/16/2017,"5 stars because...the place has a nice ambience to it, our waitress was prompt and friendly, and the food was great. No complaints here!"
S E.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,4,1,1.0,11/9/2017,Gross!!! Found a huge black pincher bug on the bread plate under napkin.  Nicely told the manager and his reply was.... You must have brought it in from outside
Ash M.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",7,202,134,4.0,1/15/2017,"This Cheesecake is close by our home, since normally we had to drive to Sherman's oaks or topanga to have cheesecake a life saver! Service isn't that great but for a quick casual dinner night I can't complain."
Bryant H.,"Valencia, CA",2,13,2,5.0,11/9/2016,"We went last night for the grand opening, and after arriving at 4:30pm, it took just over an hour to get a table for our party of 9. The restaurant space feels a little smaller than some other Cheesecake Factory locations but the interior design is unmistakable. It was nice to experience a brand new Cheesecake Factory with everything clean and new. I was expecting there to be a few hiccups being the first day open, but the food was spot on and our server was very courteous and responsive. The only issue I had was the speed of service, since we had to wait around 30 minutes for all of our dishes to arrive, which was difficult with a bunch of little kids. At least the tasty bread tided us over. Ordering a simple slice of cheesecake to go also took almost 10 minutes, which again could be because the team is still learning the ropes. My Smokehouse B.B.Q. Burger was one of the most delicious burgers I've ever had, with just the right combination of smokiness in the bacon, crispiness in the onion strings, juiciness in the patty, and sweetness in the sauce. I've never ordered that particular item before at other Cheesecake Factory locations, so I can't tell how this dish compares. We also had the Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake, which was a nice, decadent end to the meal, though next time I'd probably try something more unique, since even some fast food places now offer Oreo cheesecake. Overall, our experience was very pleasant, and I'm super excited to have such a high quality restaurant only minutes from home. We'll be back for sure, but probably only for special occasions since the prices are a bit higher than what we prefer to pay. I'm hoping this restaurant will do well here in SCV and especially help to revitalize the west side of the mall."
Lance T.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,4,2,5.0,11/6/2016,We were invited to there trial opening. Was so impressed with the menu. My only problem was deciding what to get. So many options. I need to go back. Prices were competitive.  Lower than expected. Food surpassed my expectations.  Great job Cheesecake.
Troy B.,"Laguna Beach, CA",52,2,,4.0,3/1/2017,"Tera, Our server was very professional and attentive of our party of 5. The food was above average. But the service was great."
C D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",5,49,67,5.0,11/19/2016,"So came back yesterday Friday for lunch to celebrate a very special day for my partner and I. Wow, line was up the yang yang but it went fast! We were seated after 10 minutes in line. Food was excellent! We had the mac cheese balls, tamale cakes, Cuban sandwich, clam chowder, avocado toasts, and the chicken grill avocado sandwich! Yummy to the tummy. Drinks were amazing! We had mai tai, passion fruit mojito and some kind of a mule cocktail. Our server Dioene was awesome! Right on point, real nice guy! Thanks Dioene!  You guys rock! Keep it up!!!!"
Kristin M.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,38,6,5.0,5/10/2017,"People who come to this location and complain that's your fault for coming here in the first place. Any Cheesecake Factory that's in a MALL is always going to be crowded NO MATTER WHAT and have 1 or more hour wait time especially with how crowded the Valencia Town Center is. Any Cheesecake Factory will have a pretty long wait at peak hours, but I feel like this one is crowded all the time unless you come at 9-10pm. And don't be pissed if you have 4++ people in your group and have a long wait, that's how it's always been at Cheesecake Factory no matter where you go and they don't take reservations!!! Everyone that's giving them bad reviews on here because it wait times it's your fault for choosing this location. Also to all the people complaining about the price of food, it's Cheesecake Factory they're prices are above average, but at least you're getting amazing food and a lot of it! Most restaurants in the same price will charge you the same or even more and you don't even get half the food that Cheesecake Factory gives you.  I've been here 2 times, around 9-10pm and haven't had a problem. The food is always amazing, the servers I've had were awesome and I love the new look and decorations they gave this Cheesecake Factory compared to the other ones I've been to. Give or take my favorite Cheesecake Factory is still in Sherman Oaks, but this one is good to.  JUST BE WARNED YOU WILL BE WAITING A LONG TIME TO BE SEATED because this location is at the mall & they take no reservations. So please stop complaining!"
