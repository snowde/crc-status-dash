Kathy C.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",52,185,401,5.0,11/9/2016,So glad to finally have a Cheesecake Factory in town! We went to the mall for lunch and were happy to see they were open. We arrived before noon and it was already very busy however we did get a nice booth next to the window right away. The service was friendly and fairly quick considering they just opened yesterday. I had my fav Vegan Cobb Salad and my hubby had the Thai Lettuce Wraps and a slice of pumpkin cheesecake.  Food and service was excellent. Of course the restaurant is brand new so the place is beautiful and clean. It is much larger than I expected with the option of a nice covered patio.  We will definitely return often.  I know it will be very busy during lunch and dinner times as all Cheesecake Factory locations are. They also blocked off a section of the parking garage for additional valet parking so just FYI.

Stacia M.,"Universal City, CA",10,16,8,3.0,12/29/2016,"We had a rare kidless evening so decided to try the New Cheesecake Factory. Seems like everyone else in the SCV had the same idea!  Based on our experience at other locations, we expected a wait. We were told it would be around 40 minutes so we took our beeper and strolled across the street to Urban Home. After about 30 minutes we were paged and when we got to the restaurant we were seated on the patio.  As there were two of us we were sat at their standard two seater table top which has barely enough room to put your plates on. Was a bit uncomfortable. In addition the lighting is very dim and even with glasses, our over 50 eyes had a hard time deciphering the menu. I need to read ingredients and that was difficult.  I have a lot of food allergies, including gluten, so it was nice that there were some gluten free options, but it would be easier to have those condensed onto one page rather than having to scour the entire menu looking for the symbols.  The food was good - very consistent with the other locations. My husband had the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta and I had a GF goat cheese and beet with arugula salad and a GF mushroom burger with no bun. Everything came to the table correctly and our server Elise was very personable. Wait time for food to arrive seemed a little long.  I was a little disappointed that the only GF cheesecake on the menu is chock full of chocolate as I can't eat Chocolate. Would be nice to have a plain GF alternative. But that's ok.  Overall a good experience - we will be back with a group but probably not as a date night."
Alice H.,"Bakersfield, CA",6,106,40,3.0,12/27/2016,Happy hour - just had the margaritas And It was a good margarita cheesecake - tried the chocolate Nutella cheesecake. Very good
Jenny A.,"Burbank, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/9/2017,"Worst service ever. 20 minutes. No one came by. Even in the bar area for happy hour. And four other tables hadn't been helped either One server came by to say she'll find our server. Why not help us yourself? Terrible, we're going to BJs down the street."
Raquel R.,"Canyon Country, Canyon Country, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/1/2017,First time here at the Cheese cake factory we had an awesome experience. The food was delicious and our waiter Brandon was great. Thanks for your kind attention Brandon.
Constance W.,"Tustin, CA",30,28,1,3.0,7/6/2017,"The food is phenomenal, or at least the Happy Hour is. The service on the other hand can use some help. We usually sit at the bar. The bartenders have always seemed rushed and curt. Tonight, the tap wasn't working and they still charged regular prices for bottled beer during Happy Hour. Very disappointing. The bartender seemed very annoyed when we asked her for anything, including how long the tap would be out of service. They messed up our order too and didn't even apologize for it. The food runner acted like it was an inconvenience to correct it and never did!"
Ron C.,"Newhall, CA",73,46,15,5.0,11/14/2016,"4 stars for the food & 5 stars for an Excellent service by Arnell T. We've been to other Cheesecake Factory locations and we were delightfully surprised at how different and Better the food, and definitely the Service is at this location!  Really hoping these qualities stay as the SCV is in need of more shops and restaurants."
Andrew V.,"Valencia, CA",6,20,4,5.0,7/2/2017,Enjoyed the monte cristo today. It was amazing. Recomended by our server Phil. His service was great and the recomendations were on point. Ask for phil when you come. We will be back
Traci E.,"Valencia, CA",43,11,2,5.0,7/28/2017,We had excellent customer service Jason was our waiter we had a party of nine a birthday oh and ended up being a party of 10 which was awesome and Jason was on top of everything he rocks.
Louie M.,"Oxnard, CA",5,47,1,4.0,7/1/2017,"I haven't been to cheesecake factory in a while and thought it was time to finally go to my hometown's location.  Friday night before 4th of July holiday and was able to get seated reasonably quick. Had the steak Diane and shrimp scampi combo along with the Vietnamese spring rolls for an appetizer and as I've always experienced with CF, it met my expectations and had a great dinner with my wife. Food tasted very good, service was done well and all-around excellent experience."
Michael L.,"Newhall, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/8/2016,"The service was great and the food was fantastic! Our first waiter, Victor, made great drink and starter recommendations, and was very friendly.  Our second waiter, Jon, made amazing food pointers. The food was sublime. I would highly recommend the Chipotle Chicken Pasta.  And being the cheesecake factory, of course I have something to say about the cheesecake itself. After trying a few different kinds, I would get the Kahlua Coffee or the Pumpkin cheesecake. Also, their coffee isn't standard restaurant coffee (way better than Starbucks).  I will definitely be coming back, for multiple reasons!"
Gary K.,"Valencia, CA",4,8,2,3.0,5/24/2017,"Went to The Cheesecake Factory last night for my daughter's birthday and was not impressed. We waited for almost an hour for a table and got seated at around 9;00pm. Granted it was a Tuesday evening and during graduation time but any good management would expect it to be busy during this time. We were informed that they were a bit short handed and caught off guard. It took a long time to get our food but at least the food was good. What really pissed me off was how cheap this company is. They brought out a TINY little sundae cup with a candle and we all laughed. Here we are at ""THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY"" and they can't even give you a small piece of cheesecake. WOW, this is the epitome of cheap! As I paid the $200+ bill, I vowed to never return."
Albert P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2,49,12,5.0,12/26/2016,"Wait wasn't bad. We had Jazmine H as our server and she was spectacular. Always checking on us, very attentive, efficient and friendly. My food was cold when it came and she took it back no questions asked. Once it does down the wait will be normal."
Cecilia L.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,111,163,1.0,5/16/2017,"Horrible horrible service. I think they forgot our order. My gals and I met up here since Valencia is central to all of us. The normal seating wait was about 40 minutes which is pretty average. Anyway once we sat down, we ordered some drinks and apps and a while later proceeded to order our dinner. The wait for our food was ridiculous! Our dinner took over an hour to arrive to our table. We had even asked our waiter twice about it and i think he forgot. No apologies or anything! We were the forgotten table and once our food arrived, we were ready to go home since we had filled up on bread and were annoyed with the mediocre service. Never coming to this location again!"
Phoenix T.,"Kirvin, TX",0,19,20,5.0,7/13/2017,"We go for the great atmosphere, service is good the last two times I've been there. We have gone late in the evening when we want to get out of the house to relax and scorching heat in the day so it was not too busy. The servers have been super friendly."
Lauren L.,"Valencia, CA",43,24,49,4.0,11/12/2016,"Kayla served us and she was great! we went around 245pm just in time to beat the rush on a Thursday. It got crowded quick, nxt time I'll ask for seating on the patio, seemed more quiet out there. The food was great and the oreo cheesecake was a perfect ending."
Debra D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",3,3,1,1.0,9/5/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory but there are some serious issues with this location. One thing you should be able to count on is consistency with food, but this location breaks the corporate mold. Where food is cooked fresh to order at other locations, this one seems to operate on the model: cook ahead and reheat when someone orders it. There's nothing like a pricey restaurant serving old food. I've experienced wilted, rotten lettuce to burned soup, to thick oil that has separated and floats on top of their mushroom appetizers, to just cold dishes. I've sat at a table for 45mins before the waitress realized that we were in her section. I've had to get my own beverage refills from the bar because they overload their waiters/waitress with too many tables. I have received wrong orders and waited 30 mins to receive the correct one, after friends have eaten. And finally, I've waited an hour over the hostess quote time of 45mins. That's an hour and 45 mins for a table... we eventually gave up and left. This has only been 4 separate occasions. Where I expect to receive the same blow off answer that my friends received, I think that this is a location that corporate should really look into. Look into the cooks. Look into food accuracy. Look into the hostesses. Do better."
Jim B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",24,87,9,4.0,1/4/2017,"The food is always superior here, and it was no different today. The staff is trained exceptionally well and everyone does a great job. We had the Chinese chicken salad and a child's spaghetti and everything was just terrific. The cheesecake portion seemed to be a little smaller than I remember.  The only critique and drawback is that they do not have Wi-Fi at this location. I was very surprised."
L R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/17/2017,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory in Valencia many times.  I have to say that this place is very very mismanaged and has been progressively slipping as time has gone on.  The servers are poorly trained and outright rude.  But today especially stood out more than ever.  First of all the server took my order and didnt even ask my wife if she would like anything.  After I placed my order the server closed her book and said it would be right out.  My wife had to stop her and tell her that she wanted food too.  We were blown away.  Second,  the pancakes came with no syrup at all.  When we asked the server for syrup she said ok Ill get you some.  Well about 10 minutes had gone by and then she finally returned with syrup in a plastic package.  She applogized and told us that they ran out of syrup.  Pancakes were ice cold by then.  I guess todays experience isnt the worst thing that could ever happen but I felt the need to write this review because we can tell that the service is slipping bigtime.  I love the food at Chessecake factory and do not want them to lose business as their reputation for quality has slipped.  FIX THE MANAGEMENT. !!!!"
