Joe J. F.,"Santa Clarita, CA",91,2,,1.0,3/16/2017,"Attempted to make a reservation for a party of 35 people two weeks in advance.  The guest of honor, my elderly handicap father didnt help.  They said no reservations.  It's too bad since this location is known for 2 hour wait times on weekends.  Must be nice to turn down guaranteed money."
Kris M.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",85,22,27,4.0,5/24/2017,"I absolutely LOVE Cheesecake Factory. The food and drinks are always on point! My favorite dish is the chicken dish with lemon sauce (Can't remember the name) but it is absolutely amazing. The service is usually very good and yes, there is a wait time to get a seat but it's not hard to see why. The only negative thing I've ever experienced is one night my family and I went to dinner here and afterwards ordered a medium sized cheesecake AND paid for it with the dinner check. We waited 30 minutes for it only to find out they didn't have the size we ordered. They only had a large. So after waiting that long only to find out that they didn't have what we ordered, they refused to just give us the large for the same price (which in my opinion would have been the right thing to do), and then wait another 25 minutes to get the refund on my card."
Francisco G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",838,32,2,5.0,3/28/2017,Excellent place to go. Can't beat their happy Hour 4pm to 6.00pm. Family loves it too...
Emily N.,"Palmdale, CA",53,105,4,2.0,5/7/2017,"Overpriced , too many menu options very confusing, 9$ for a slice of cheesecake wow! No brunch menu on Saturday"
Loreal G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",3,13,1,4.0,5/23/2017,"The service was very slow, and it wasn't too crowded because it was a Monday night, however, it was still a very pleasant experience. I ordered the Steak Medallions off the Skinnylicious menu and they were fantastic! The sauce and the potatoes were seasoned perfectly. Along with the meat. It also was cooked exactly the way I like it! It was a very small amount of food considering the price point, but it was the low calorie menu and the food was delicious. Definitely a special occasion type of venue. It did take about 45 minutes for our food to come out though, but we weren't really in a rush so it was okay."
Puttkammer7 ..,"Lancaster, CA",0,11,,1.0,6/18/2017,"The service was VERY slow. When the food did arrive we had to ask for forks, they were not on the table.  My wife's order was for well done and it was rare. My mashed potatoes were cold. When I spoke to the manager he started out as being nice and offered to remove the cost of my wife's meal. But when I questioned other items he became indignant toward me.  The manager needs to remember that he is in the service field and to treat customers nicely no matter how he feels. I some have read the reviews on this particular Cheesecake Factory, there are some poor ratings given to this place. My advice, Go to In and Out."
Jasmine S.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",1,38,10,5.0,3/25/2017,"Came for my first time on a Friday. Of course the wait was long, it was Friday and prime time. Luckily the mall is right there to kill some time. Once seated, our experience was really amazing. We had the BEST, most attentive server named Carol. I mean, she was literally amazing at what she did. Her customer service was exceptional and she was so helpful with suggestions when asked. She went above and beyond and it truly made our experience that great. Once the food came, EVERYTHING was delicious. Between the four of us, we had chicken bang bang and shrimp, miso salmon, steak Diane, and I can't remember what the other was called but it was chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus and damn! It was alllll soooooooo amazing! I would highly recommend this Cheesecake Factory and if you want your experience that much more great, ask for carol to serve you. Seriously, she was that good !"
Milly V.,"Los Angeles County, CA",2,105,51,4.0,5/4/2017,I am so happy we have a Cheesecake Factory in SCV!!!Love this place! The wait time sucked when they had just opened but it has gotten better!  I enjoy going there for their lunch portions and some cocktails..
Michele D.,"Valencia, CA",1,26,77,4.0,11/12/2016,"The food is great, that's for sure. Since the restaurant is new there definitely were some service issues (things coming out at the wrong time, forgotten items, etc) but I will be coming back because the food is great. We tried some of the new/seasonal items too. I would recommend the pumpkin cheesecake, it is delicious. The chocolate hazelnut cheesecake was a little too sweet for me but it has Nutella, so yum."
Camille S.,"Los Angeles, CA",313,6,,5.0,6/5/2017,"Came to cheesecake factory on a break, in between work meetings and say at the bar. Victoria was so sweet and attentive. She went out of her way and offered some great happy hour good selections. One of the best experiences that I've had at a cheesecake factory ever. I will definitely be back to this location."
Randi-Simone E.,"Houston, TX",0,5,2,5.0,4/30/2017,"Today I came in to pick up my favorite vegetable salad and the young lady who helped me was soooo polite and smiley!! It was a vast improvement from my prior experiences here. She's beautiful and has a very welcoming and pleasant demeanor. I'm an extremely happy customer!  I can't forget to mention the young man working alongside her, who was also super cute, attentive and polite!!  I was prepared to have ""resting bitch face, try me if you'd like"" attitude going, but I totally didn't need it!! Haha.  Way to step it up Cheesecake!! *****4th Update!!!***** Ok so tonight, like usual I head over to cheesecake to get Sunday soup and a salad. But here's where it gets real and also amazing.... as I mentioned I come here minimum 3 times a week and always ""to go"", I also have a pretty specific order which is also the same every time, so when I get to the counter, the cutest helper actually remembered my order even though she wasn't the one I placed with over the phone - here comes the reason they got 5 stars, she knew I request not to have specific ingredients even though I failed to mention it to the guy who took my order. I was so impressed and thankful. It's things like that that make a good experience exceptional instead. I was so appreciative to her for her attentiveness that I would've bought her a drink, except she was at work and I don't want to contribute to anyone else's delinquency - mine is pricey enough hahaha  Cheesecake, all thumbs all the way up!! Soooo glad you guys switched around the helpers in the to-go area, this new crew is 5 star!!"
Chelsea C.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",80,102,15,4.0,4/8/2017,Always packed. But food and drinks are pretty consistent. There's always a ton of hosts at the counter which gets kind of confusing. Otherwise it's what to be expected of a CF
Jenn R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,13,,2.0,2/10/2017,Not sure what is up with our new Cheesecake Factory but the waiters are always  so bland.  It was my daughter's birthday (we where a party of 4) and she wanted to have lunch at the CF.  Well there was a taste test going on at the table next to us and they where demonstrating drinks (liquor) to the employees and a bunch of dishes that where coming to their table. In the mean time we had to wait a long time to be served..maybe the managers had the chef busy with their own orders. I know that showing the waiters what the food taste like and what's in the dishes is important but couldn't' they have done it while the restaurant was closed or towards the back of the restaurant where customers where not looking at every plate that would pass their way while waiting anxiously to be fed.  (they had about 17 employees that where in this tasting).  I thought it was tacky and the other waiters that where tending the regular customers would be so distracted by the employees having a good o time tasting the dishes and drinking the liquor.  Oh well...we are good we won't be going back. It's the cheesecake factory they only really good thing is the cheesecake.
Tanya A.,"Valencia, CA",47,50,42,5.0,2/14/2017,"I have no freaking idea why this place only has 3 stars. Every time I come here I have been seated in a timely manner , had great service and amazing food of course. Sooooo happy we got a location in scv :) right next to the mall! Love my Cheesecake Factory !!!"
Lynda F.,"Santa Clarita, CA",3,35,3,4.0,4/11/2017,"Waiter was great, food was great, cocktails were yummy. Love the decor. It was a bit loud and busy but I guess that's expected of a busy restaraunt!"
Christy H.,"Acton, CA",3,30,,3.0,4/10/2017,TOO loud inside if you want to chat with your family or friends. Menu was huge and hard to choose just one item! Most items were pricey for the portion size. I will definitely try it again but wouldn't be one of my must haves.
Trevor W.,"Fullerton, CA",134,4,,1.0,5/21/2017,"To celebrate  a college graduation, we decided that Cheesecake Factory would be a great place to eat. Was told the wait for a table would be an hour, then at the hour mark were told to wait another half hour. After that half hour, we were told the table we were going to sit at was being bussed, then told by the manager that we were given the wrong information and would have to wait an ADDITIONAL 30 mins. The manager, Brian, refused to work with us, and as compensation for our additional hour of waiting, we were offered complimentary bread. After voicing our displeasure, Brian became hostile and accused us of lying about what we were told, which is when we realized this was not the place for us to eat. This restaurant, and especially the manager Brian, ruined a special day for us."
gina l.,"Valencia, CA",113,10,25,1.0,4/22/2017,New place in Valencia. Excited to try it out...i won't go back to this location. I waited 3 hrs before seated with children. We were placed in the corner with horrible service. When I asked to speak to the manager she was sarcastic and unprofessional. The whole experience was so disappointing. The restaurant is very small inside too.
Delon B.,"Los Angeles, CA",224,5,1,1.0,5/18/2017,Left my credit card in check book.. came back the next day asked for manager and took him 15min of phone calls to grab my credit card in back after showing him my I.D. Busy or is to lazy to run to the back for a min. Hmmm.
Brian S.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",7,1,,1.0,2/15/2017,"I tried to call in a pick-up order 3 different times on separate days and each time was placed on hold long enough for me to give up and hang-up, and I'm  a chef that understands delays might happen at the front of the house. This last time was on a Wednesday night. Tisk tisk."
