J N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,30,4.0,12/18/2016,"Late review. I went here on friday at 7:30pm of course during the dinner rush. I was in no rush and expected to wait a hr til about hr and a half. There was alot of people inside and a crowd outside. The hostess advised it was a 75 min wait for 1st available seating like I said I didnt mind I knew what to expect. Well let me til you i waited bout 30 minz before my pager went off ... then 2 mins for the hostess to show us our table ... our waitress was Maddison(maddie) great waitress we really liked her. She was prompt, courteous, down to earth and still professional. We already knew what were going to get since we always went to the sherman oaks galleria CF. So we had ordered our drinks and appetizer. Since it was so busy she would come and let us know that our drinks and appetizer were on its way. She gave us more bread and refilled our drinks when she saw we were low ... now our food took a little longer to come out but we didnt mind as we had appetizers and bread to hold us over. The main reason for the 4 stars is because we were given filthy silverware the forks still had previous owners lunch or dinner on it like a salad particles... but we showed maddie she apologized and brought us new clean silverware. My recommendation is they wrap their silverware in napkins and not just have it sitting on the table uncovered. Overall my experience was great maddie also made sure we got our cheesecakes to go and packaged everything nicely so it wasnt all over.  The quality of the food was excellent as well. I recommend checking them out and getting maddie as ur waitress."
Cindy R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,9,,5.0,3/14/2017,"Went there with my family for an early lunch. I felt like breakfast so I ordered the huevos rancheros with eggs over medium. Our meals came out and my eggs were sunny side up and really runny. The server said ""weird I specifically wrote over-medium."" No problem, we'll remake them. My family was just about done with their meal when my meal came back out to me.. eggs sunny side up..runny.. Wow. The server apologized again and offered  to take them back but by this time my family was done with their meal so I told him to forget it I would deal with it. So I had a couple of bites around the eggs which was basically black beans and salsa and the manager (I guess) brought me 3 eggs over medium. No apologies, no nothing. So they do know what over-medium means yeah! However 3 eggs on a side plate next to runny sunny side eggs ranchero style didn't make any sense to me. So I placed my napkin over the plates and asked for the check thinking at the very least I wouldn't be charged for the huevos rancheros. I was.  I think for now, if I feel like Cheesecake Factory, which I don't very often, I'll drive to Glendale or Sherman Oaks. Five stars for improved customer service! On our last couple of visits had a great dining experience with Brandon as our server on one visit and Shannon on our last.  Both were friendly and super efficient. Keep up the amazing work Brandon and Shannon! It's service like this that will keep us going back!"
Fatin S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",92,14,8,5.0,2/20/2017,"Brandon is a great waiter. Food is great! Kids menu is wonderful. We ate a wonderful meal, and even had some cheesecake. We had a small problem with our meal, but the waiter promptly fixed the issue. I LOVED IT!!!!!!!"
Aubrey T.,"Quartz Hill, CA",10,8,,1.0,1/25/2017,Tonight was our second time to try this location and we ended up just walking out because we could not get served or acknowledged. I approached the manager on the way out to tell them what had happened and they did not seem to really care and were very arrogant. I will never return to this particular cheesecake factory. I would give a zero stars rating if it were possible.
Valerie M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",15,11,,4.0,8/27/2017,"Always great service. Amazing food. Love this place! I go here ever year for my birthday it is my place of choice. I only ever had one problem with this restaurant. Which was a hair in the food, But once I expressed my dissatisfaction it was fixed hasn't happen again."
Saree B.,"Shelton, WA",5,1,,1.0,7/5/2017,This Cheesecake Factory didn't put much effort into their food I've had better from other cheesecake factories. The waitress we had was not good. She didn't seem happy to be there and did not do very well at serving us.
Nadia A.,"Valencia, CA",4,38,4,1.0,1/22/2017,We went on a Sunday at 1 pm when it was raining heavily so it was less crowded than usual. Still waited half an hour for a table but this review has nothing to do with that. The service took forever even at the slower hours. No requests to refill water. Did not provide additional utensils with cheesecake. Food was extremely salty. And on top of that we feel sick. We won't be back
Timmy B.,"Granada Hills, CA",0,38,8,3.0,5/4/2017,"Food was great! Service was okay, but the cleanliness was another story. Sitting down on a table with crumbs all over wasn't something I expected. But the server was wonderful and made the experience great."
Karyn C.,"Canyon Country, CA",159,7,,1.0,6/8/2017,I had the worst shrimp salad possible. I wish I had not even ordered it. If a manager wants to contact me I would be more than happy to discuss my suggestions regarding the terrible service I received  as well. I know we all have a bad day now and then so I must have landed there on the day of poor food and service. A very disappointed customer Karyn Crawford
Samantha S.,"Valencia, CA",142,2,6,5.0,2/16/2017,Tonight my husband and I dined here and Jason I was our server . Not only was he very understanding and patient with my calorie questions. He was very attentive and polite. Never had an empty glass. He provided excellent service and is an asset to this company . Thank you for making tonight a good experience
Tyler B.,"Castaic, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/22/2017,"Enjoyed a perfectly cooked order of carne asada medallions and a chocolate martini.  Carly was the bartender today, and her bar was impressively clean.  She had a warm smile, friendly attitude, and was very attentive.  I hope everybody enjoys their meal like I did."
Jenn J.,"Valencia, CA",0,10,,2.0,9/21/2017,"Mediocre at best. I keep returning thinking that this Cheesecake factory is going to get their act together since they are newly opened, but every time I invest my money and time they continue to disappoint.  Last time I took a piece of cheesecake home it looked like the last itty bitty piece that was left in the refridgerator for 3 days to soak up the fridges flavors. I was disappointed with my wimpy and dated slice and asked for another slice but was denied. The most recent visit I ordered the Ahi tartar and it came out with some mayonaise- like nasty sauce that covered everything. I was going to put it on my salad, that had so much dressing it was like soup, but the tuna was so slimy from the tuna. I was hungry, so I picked it apart and ate the pieces that weren't drenched in the sauce. I complained to the waiter, who was very nice and he tried to comp it for me but his manager denied it because I ""ate"" it..  Well, note to manger... I did not come into your very average restaurant with the intent of getting a free $7.95 appetizer. I came in to have a good meal with my family and celebrate a birthday but instead I received a crappy meal and ate it with a smile on my face.  Im not wasting anymore time or money here in hopes that the quality of food and customer service improves.  I could recommend better restaurants in the area."
turd f.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,44,3,2.0,6/24/2017,"Waited an hour for undercooked steak and ""breaded"" shrimp scampi. Wtf who breads and fries shrimp scampi. ‍anyways. Loud environment can't hear person sitting next to you. Waiter was so scattered I swear he was super coked up. I gave two stars because everyone was polite and helpful but other than that a total waste of two hours and $125"
Robert M.,"Granada Hills, CA",3,11,,5.0,2/5/2017,"We went on a Friday night and the place was fully committed. We expected delays and long wait times. After being seated our server Kendall was on point with drinks, taking our order, bringing bread, refilling our drinks, dessert, clean up, etc. and brought an overall enjoyment to our experience with her kindness and professional attitude. I appreciated her ability to multi-task in such a stressful environment. We will definitely ask for her when we return again."
Paul M.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,31,,2.0,5/28/2017,"I just left The Cheesecake Factory and had a mediocre experience.  Our server started to walk away from the table while my wife was ordering and then stopped and listened.  He asked her if she wanted the Lunch Size or Full Size salad.  When it came it was the Full Size even though she ordered the smaller one.  The person who brought the food to the table was going to bring it back and get her the smaller one when our waiter intercepted it, returned it to the table and told my wife that this was the only size.  Why was the smaller plate offered in the first place by the waiter if it was not available? I ordered the Buffalo Wings as part of my meal.  I ate a few of the flats and they were good.  When I bit into a drum the meat near the bone was raw.  I flagged down a hostess and asked for a manager.  When our waiter came back, I showed him the raw chicken.  He apologized and offered to get a manager.   The manager showed up and when I explained the issue and showed him the raw chicken he apologized and offered to replace the dish, which I declined.   He said he would talk to the kitchen manager, took my plate and walked away.  I never saw him again.  He never came back to see if everything else was OK or to let me know the situation was handled.  He was not rude in anyway, but his lack of caring about the customer was evident. When the bill came the wings were not on it and nothing else was said or done.  It was an, ""Oh well, it happens"" type of experience.  I have had good experiences at other Cheesecake Factories in the past.  This one today left a raw taste in my mouth.  I gave Two Stars because our salads were good.  From a Care About The Customer point of view it would be zero."
J.W. K.,"Valencia, CA",1,27,,3.0,3/11/2017,I love the cheesecake factory but they really need to figure out what to do about all the noise. My husband and I had to practically shout to each other just to be heard.
M G.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",3,12,,5.0,2/14/2017,"Its Valentine's Day and the Cheesecake Factory exceeded all expectations despite the high volume crowd from start to finish! We were seated 20 minutes earlier than expected, our servers were so attentive and professional, the food was cooked perfectly and tasted  great. Annalit O was so friendly, attentive, remembered every request, and checked on us consistently despite her many tables. It was the total antithesis to Sisley, where service is a huge fail. I'm so glad they staffed the Cheesecake Factory with servers that know their trade, and managers that feel invested in the success of the restaurant."
Claudia G.,"Santa Ana, CA",35,2,2,5.0,5/19/2017,"Great, fast service. Jason was great and made sure we had everything we needed. I didn't have to ask for a refill once."
Gonzalo G.,"Tarzana, CA",0,8,1,1.0,1/22/2017,"Nothing new really!! Long waits...over booked...over worked staff...over stressed line supervisors...over blown....menu is not really that ""worth-the-wait"" type of menu ...over priced...over rated... a very good plan C given all options around the corner....or is it around the Patios...check it out for yourselves....maybe your experience will be different ...."
Natalie Q.,"Santa Clarita, CA",6,2,,5.0,2/12/2017,"Best dinner experience in a very long time!. My husband and I went for an early dinner after a movie at the mall, not sure of what to expect. All I can say is WOW!! Food was incredible, service fabulous! The atmosphere was great too. Not too noisy, just right. The sun started to go down during our dinner, and one of the waiters brought everyone candles for their tables. All of the servers, waiters, waitresses, and hostesses went above and beyond the norm. We were so impressed after all the negative reviews I've read on here. Not sure how it's possible they're talking about the same restaurant! Wait was 45 minutes, which is normal for a restaurant like this, in this location. Worth every minute...We were attended to quite regularly. Every little detail was covered, never had to ask for anything. We are coming back for sure, as soon as possible...."
