Taylor H.,"Valencia, CA",1,2,,1.0,8/26/2017,"I ordered two meals for a friend and I and when I went to pick them up was completely scammed out of my order. We left with nothing but two bags full of bread and when I called them and asked to speak to the manager and they said that I was to blame and that my order was waiting here for me and I forgot to pick it up. I double checked with the person that gave me the order and asked if both orders of salmon were in the bag they said yes and guaranteed me that I was receiving both of my orders. Once I got home I realized I had been duped. This place is a complete scam, if you want your worth of money go somewhere else or if you want decent food at all, go somewhere else."
Margo C.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,23,11,4.0,11/11/2016,Food was so good! I ordered the ribeye and it was perfect. Staff was so nice. Only thing was the wait for a table but I completely understand since it is opening week and Veterans Day. Other than that I would definitely come back.
Sarah S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,2,4.0,5/13/2017,"We had a lovely experience. We had a long wait - 75 min - but it was Mothers Day weekend.  Our server, Jason I, was amazing. Very helpful and always available for refills despite how busy the restaurant was. He made our dining experience very pleasant."
Lisa P.,"Newhall, Newhall, CA",0,4,,2.0,5/12/2017,"Came here last night, Thursday, around 5:30. Party of 4, no wait to be seated. Staff was friendly. Food was really good. Service was very, very slow...didn't even have time to wait for dessert which was disappointing. We ended up ordering our food at the same time as our drinks since we had enough time to look at the menu by the time the server came by. He was friendly. Maybe just had too may tables? Our whole section just looked like everyone was waiting...my advice, go if you have at least 2 hours to spend."
Shawndrell L.,"Culver City, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/22/2017,Curbside service sucks! 5 cars out here and only 1 server. Been waiting 15 minutes. Called the order in 45 minutes ago. Said it would be ready in 25 minutes. Very disappointed.
Vishav A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,3,,2.0,4/5/2017,Cheesecake served are cold (like not thawed properly from the freezer...) sadly even the frozen cheesecakes (of Cheesecake Factory) you get from local grocery store are better. The food from menu is good.
Benny G.,"Canyon Country, CA",63,11,16,5.0,3/9/2017,"Stopped in for a quick lunch and ran into a problem with the length of time we waited for our food(over 25 minutes), spoke with the Manager (Brian) and he went above and beyond to provide excellent customer service. Because of his excellent customer service we will be back to dine again. Thank you Brian, keep up the great job"
Lina B.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",81,11,,2.0,9/9/2017,I have been there a handful of times at the Santa Clarita location and had issue with the service every single time. Too slow is my general comment. They forgot our drinks etc. Food is not as good as other locations. Not sure why the Santa Clarita crew can't get their act together??
Erin K.,"Santa Clarita, CA",151,38,35,4.0,2/8/2017,"My hubby and I have been a couple of times now and have enjoyed it each time.  While it's typically pretty busy no matter when you go, the staff is great about making your wait as painless as possible.  The food, as at most Cheesecake Factories is yummy and always has a wife selection to choose from each meal.  I am also very impressed with the staff here.  Everyone is VERY helpful and accommodating to any needs you may have during your visit.  It's definitely a lovely addition to the SCV."
Lily G.,"Newhall, CA",0,15,5,2.0,1/8/2017,"Went in on Thursday night around 5pm ..was told a hour wait...about an hour and 25 min pass and people who came in after us were being seated. I decided to go up to the teenage host and ask him how much longer..he asked my name, keep in mind he is the one who took my name and gave me the little pager. He starts to look at the list and my name isn't on it ...yet he gave me a pager???? He then realizes what he did and said oh your next...I will never come here again. How incompetent are the employees that they forget to write down a name and give a pager out and leave them to sit outside for over a hour in the cold. The food was good..but the lack of common sense ruined it..I rather drive to the Pasadena location and get great service."
Sarah F.,"Valencia, Santa Clarita, CA",18,1,,5.0,5/5/2017,I love this place. I come here often and no matter what I order it's always great. I really love the staff they are amazing. This last visit I had Jason as my server and he was truely exceptional.
Christine K.,"Reseda, CA",0,19,,5.0,4/27/2017,"Our server Derek was absolutely amazing. Very attentive, smiley and professional. Food was excellent! Will be going there again very soon."
Alejandra A.,"Fillmore, CA",0,2,1,5.0,12/17/2016,Be prepared to wait!!!!!!! The wait was about 2 hours! Coming in with a bunch of friends for a gift exchange dinner. Although the wait was soooo long it was way worth it due to our waitress. Dee made everything way better! She was very attentive and very kind!! Dee made this experience very satisfying! I totally forgot about how long I waited once I got great service! She was only shift cover but I wish she could of stayed till the end! I would love to come again just for Dee!
Allison S.,"Valencia, CA",0,125,,4.0,9/2/2017,Always a great and beautiful spot. This new location has a lovely patio with fans for the heat. The service out there was a little slow but the food was great as always and the portions generous. I would definitely go back since there are about 800 other items to try on that huge menu. Something for every taste. Good for family or getting together with friends.
K M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2,42,6,2.0,1/29/2017,"I've never had a bad experience at Cheesecake Factory until they opened in Valencia. This location needs some serious upper management attention! I've been three times since it opened and all 3 were terrible experiences. The wait is forever, food is not hot, and servers are overwhelmed so they don't pay much attention to refills or checking on the table.  Please, corporate office... I beg you to turn this place around. We have waited forever for you to open up in our city!"
Melissa A.,"Mission Hills, Los Angeles, CA",61,19,12,5.0,3/19/2017,"Decided to go on a date with my husband to this place. It was a very busy, but we were seated right away and our server was very polite. The foods a little pricey. Of course I've never eaten at cheese cake factory before and I'm a huge fan of cheese cake. So when I took my first bite of the raspberry lemon cheesecake we'll I've gotta say this place blew my socks off and I was wearing sandals. Never have I ever had a cheese cake so delicious and fluffy and decadent in all my life. This place is absolutely grade A. I will definitely be returning for the rest of my life. Extremely satisfied with this place. Bravo for sure!"
Elizabeth R.,"Canyon Country, CA",40,50,16,4.0,1/9/2017,"My husband and I recently went here for a nice enjoyable afternoon away from our children since it was my birthday. Upon arrival we were greeted promptly by a hostess and got our info taken down. The wait was 20 mins. Not bad for a Sunday afternoon. So we walked around Town Center killing some time. Our buzzer went off. We went inside and were seated outside. The outdoor space was beautiful with a great ambiance. Lots of people watching, fresh air and beautiful weather. Our server came and greeted herself bringing bread and water. Her name was Samantha and she was hands down... AMAZING. We were checked on so quickly, constantly she was refilling my water like nobody's business and knew the menu really well. She was extremely pleasing to have as our server. We enjoyed her tremendously, we even left a 50% tip because of how awesome she was.  I ordered the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, my husband ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta.  My husband LOVED his dish, I liked mine as well, but it wasn't spicy. It was very mild than anything. Samantha could tell I wasn't pleased and offered to go back to the cooks so I could add some more spice/flavor to my pasta. Which was so appreciated. She came back with a little side bowl of it. If the pasta was spicy from the beginning, I would have left the full 5 stars. We will be returning! And asking to sit in Samantha's section for now on."
Sharon T.,"Palmdale, CA",3,24,1,2.0,12/31/2016,"First of all, I love Cheesecake Factory!! I usually go to the one in Thousand Oaks or Topanga, but we tried the Valencia location yesterday. Not impressed! It's so loud in this one, we had to almost yell at each other the entire time we were there. Secondly, I ordered the Chicken Tosdada Salad, which I have ordered at several other locations and it was delicious. The one I had yesterday at this location was a disappointment. There was barely any chicken in there at all!!! For $15.50, I expect at least one breast worth of chicken. I did not get that. My friend ordered the Santa Fe salad, and hers, for the same price, was full of chicken.  We have been to this location twice but won't return."
Cris C.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,48,,4.0,1/3/2017,"The wait was on the longer side (50 minutes) but the food was excellent! Our server was way cool too. He served in the Marines from what I remember. This place doesn't deserve the 3 star rating they currently have. C'mon folks they're trying their best and it's a brand new heavily anticipated restaurant! Also, it does seem like it's a bit on the smaller side for a Cheesecake Factory, no?"
Mohan K.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,14,,1.0,2/12/2017,"Waited for 40 min to get seat and no complains on that, but after getting. The seat takes 10 min for waitress to show up, then drinks does not shown up for 15 min and an appetizer comes before drinks. She forgets my kids juice to order, and the appetizer was oily and no taste. Beer was flat and looks like no good reason to come in again. The main course, don't waste your money. Last time I had in Kansas City was good and also in DC, but this place good lord."
