Nina C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2,25,10,1.0,12/3/2016,"Overpriced, near to none vegan options AND our waiter pretty much looked at us like we were aliens when we asked if there were any vegan friendly items. Would not have gone here if it wasn't my moms 60th birthday choice. I looked around me and the entire place was practically filled with morbidly obese people. This place is contributing to the demise of America"
Stephanie V.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",1,46,27,1.0,2/10/2017,I called to place an order on a whole cheesecake for a birthday party and was placed on hold 3 times (because I had to call back after being hung up on multiple times)consecutively spanning between 20-30 minutes. Very aggravating
I D.,"Canyon Country, CA",6,29,3,1.0,7/3/2017,"I am a big fan of this restaurant chain. However, I couldn't believe the lack of quality of food and poor service. I understand it is a fairly new location for this chain. But, regardless of that fact, their quality and service should be 110% not 5%.  I had a party of 3, ordered our favorite:calamari, cesar salas, and pasta. Prior to the order, the server brought bread and it was old. We asked for fresh bread and it took her time to bring it. We ordered ice tea and that too took some time to get to our table. I want to point out that we went on Sunday where the place was fairly empty. We got calamari and it was over fried. When we received the salad the crutons were old, and the dressing was ranch. I asked twice for the server to bring their signature dressing and twice she brought ranch. The server kept telling me that it is their cesar dressing, except it was white and tasted like ranch. Ugh, the pasta was too salty and had little chicken. Overall, I know that this chain will be avoide in Valencia....Id rather go to  Woodland Hills since Cheesecake at that location is very good."
Kendra L.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,7,5,3.0,3/7/2017,"Came here for lunch on a weekday. Place wasn't too packed wait time was under ten minutes and we got a nice big table. Waitress was friendly and served us drinks and complimentary bread right away. We got the nachos as an appetizer it is definitely a sharing size for more than two people They were good and would recommend. Had a spicy chicken sandwich on brioche bun and it was okay there was something missing in the flavor of it. The kids menu is nice and their kids cups are plastic with lid and straw. If you are here for cheesecake it will take you a while to read the whole selection! Ended up going with the hazelnut Crunch it is a big slice and was okay at this point we were just so stuffed to really even indulge in it. Had two huge blobs of whipped cream which for me, is too much sweetness going on. Definitely save your water for dessert. Overall typical visit at  and I would come here again another time down the road."
Andrea T.,"Palmdale, CA",129,8,4,4.0,3/5/2017,"Date night on a Saturday night. So of course we already know there was gonna be a wait when we got there. We usually do open seating at the bar, but this was the first time I've gone to a restaurant and there was a line for open seating at the bar too. waited almost an hour. It was crazy busy.  Got a table at the bar top and returned the buzzer so we don't get regular seating. Besides that. We already knew what to order (since we waited), so it made our server Jennifer's job easier. She was great. Food came out in a timely order. Greek salad and Thai lettuce wraps were surprisingly Delicious. We'll be back =]"
Sage H.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,11,8,1.0,12/27/2016,"I called in for the current walk in time and the over the phone service was horrible, the girl on the other line responded with 10 minutes to an hour. I told her that doesn't necessarily give a time frame...she then put me hold on without notice and a man answered and he said ""the wait is two hours, thanks"" and proceeded to hang up on me. I am disappointed in the over the phone service and it turned me off from going there because I'm afraid the service may be worse."
Serenity B.,"Bakersfield, CA",93,42,12,4.0,3/3/2017,"Although it's not completely their fault, the smell of the cigar shop smoke from next door was too overwhelming for me as I dined in their outdoor patio. Gave both me and my 5 yr old daughter a headache. My food was good, but not as spectacular as the several times I've dined at other Cheesecake Factories. Fries even seemed old. However, both of our cheesecake slices were outstanding as usual."
Lyn M.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,10,,1.0,11/10/2016,I went dinner with my fiancé on the first day opening. My server was Grace.  She just came twice to our table. First was when she greeted our table and 2nd was when we were still eating and she wanted to take my plate while I was still eating. Really?? How rude!!!  She didn't take our orders (foods and cocktails) and our needs. We had to waive to other servers and bussers even to the manager to grab us a check. Never coming back. Sorry! I know this place is just opened but with the service? No way!! Sorry!! I rather go to the Glendale. They have a good customer service.
Bernadette April M.,"Irving Park, Chicago, IL",5,2,1,1.0,11/15/2016,"Horrible service! This place sucks! We were so excited that finally there's a Cheesecake Factory in Santa Clarita. The food was terrible. Pasta was so freakin' hard, the side dish corn was not cooked as well. The luau salad tasted like a dessert because it was so sweet. The Southern Fried Tilapia was soggy because of too much oil. We had to ask 4 times just to get a straw. Even my 6 year old daughter did not even eat her mac n cheese, which was her favorite because according to her it tasted weird. The only good part here was the wheat bread. Not worth our 2 hours of waiting. I give this place 1 star for the bread!"
Kiwon O.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,82,7,3.0,1/12/2017,Took 10 minutes for someone to come take our order another 25 minutes for our food to arrive...total wait to receive actual food 35 minutes. Don't come here too hungry or you'll fill yourself on free bread and take your order in a doggie bag. Also the bang bang chicken and shrimp was way too sweet and not worth paying nearly $20.  I love Cheesecake Factory but this one needs a little work. Also the fried cheese appetizer was not good and my kids' spaghetti and corn dogs were awful. I don't know how they managed to eat most of it.  Food managers please taste what your cooks are putting out.
Andrew R.,"Lancaster, CA",0,11,,5.0,4/5/2017,"I enjoyed my experience here with my family ! We came for my sisters birthday, and the server, Fabulous,  was very prompt with his service. He was friendly and enjoyable. We sat outside and the weather was great. The lighting for the outside deck is pretty dim, it's good for the mood but I couldn't see my food very we'll luckily it tasted great so looks were not the selling point here. I ordered the southern fried catfish and it was delightful ! The asparagus, mashed potatoes, and corn were also a good compliment to the dish. I tried the banana cheese cake for dessert and it was definitely the highlight ! I would come back again definitely."
Shawn R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/4/2017,"They currently have a bad fruit fly problem. We ordered drinks and then we asked to move but it was still bad. I'm sure they are working to solve the problem but none the less we ended up leaving because of it. They did comp us our drinks that we ordered. Also for late afternoon the booths were very dirty, I'm sure that's not helping the problem with the fruit flys."
Jeff W.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,3,4,4.0,4/4/2017,Cheesecake factory: good food and nice atmosphere. Glad to have it in the SCV!
Kassie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,1,2.0,11/12/2016,"Went last night and waited 2.5 hours which was fully expected. The service however was less than par. One would have thought that their cooperate trainers would have been on site to make sure all was going well. It was as if they were just going through the motions. No service really at all, just a bunch of people bringing things places. The management seemed very unaware of their surroundings as well. They were so focused on other things I think they forgot about the customers. Weird ambiance for sure. Hopefully they get some things ironed out. Food was great!"
Dave M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,6,,5.0,12/13/2016,Was happy to see that they've finally located here in the SCV...arrived at 5:00 and was told there would be a 20 minute wait--told my wife we would leave i it was more than 30 minutes and 7 minutes later we were seated.  Great service--with Brianna--food came quickly. We were happy that we were near the back of the restaurant as it was very noisy and would have been more so if we had be in the middle.   Food was great--enough left over for dinner tomorrow.  We'll be back.
Cody Leigh O.,"Canyon Country, CA",9,17,,4.0,3/30/2017,Food is good and the staff is friendly and not too overpriced either. It takes a bit to get your food but at least you know it's fresh :) This location seems to be very small as far as the overall interior goes. It could defiantly be larger to accommodate their customers. The restaurant is beautiful and very clean.
Anne D.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,10,,5.0,3/27/2017,"I visit this location regularly with my 91 year old mother.  We have developed a regular routine of having lunch at this Cheesecake Factory location, and sharing a piece of delicious cheesecake.  Then we go on and do a few other things, before she gets tired and I bring her home.  The hostesses and servers are unerringly friendly, courteous, and kind.  They will even accommodate Mom, substituting different sides for her that may be softer and easier for her to eat than what actually comes with her meal.  Today we were treated to a lovely server named Analit, who was just terrific.  Not only was she quick, and attentive, she spent some extra time talking with Mom, and making her feel special.  She is wonderful! The food is always delicious, and I like that they have smaller lunch portions, which are great for us.  They open for lunch at 11:30, which is also good for Mom.  The place is very nicely decorated, and the ladies lounge is always clean and tidy (Mom notices). Great place to eat!   I highly recommend."
Shannan L.,"Destin, FL",21,50,1,2.0,11/11/2016,"I came today to enjoy a wonderful lunch, which it was. However, with today being Veteran's Day I asked if they were doing anything special for Veterans. I was told they have nothing going for vets. I asked if I could maybe get the free birthday dessert. I was told not unless it was in fact my birthday. Ordinarily I am not snooty about this type of stuff, but then it dawned on me that if I said it was my birthday I could get a treat. However, I get nothing for serving two tours in Iraq and coming to cheesecake on a day our country honors those who have served our nation."
Maria J.,"Valencia, CA",0,11,,5.0,8/2/2017,"We've been to this restaurant approx 6 times with our family of 6! Each time, we had a great experience. The food was delicious and the staff was amazing.  It amazed me to see people waiting an hour for a table and food and then complain about the wait.  If you see it's a long wait, go at another time! I witnessed one person yelling at the manager because the prices are so high! Is it pricey? Yes! Doesn't anyone know the cost of eating out these days? Only in Valencia! Enjoy your family time people.....we sure did!"
Gail R.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",0,6,1,1.0,12/17/2016,"Was really excited when they opened here in scv as this is the family's fave place!  First stop: we came in as they were just 20mins into opening for the day and told that there is a 40 minute wait despite the place looking half empty, so we decided to wait. A few minutes later some people came in and got seated right away. Minutes later a group of people started streaming in and they all got seated right away. I told the girl in front why we weren't seated yet and was told because we were a ""large"" party. There was only me, my husband and our 3 kids. A party of 5. I pointed out to the girl that the group she seated just minutes before consisted of 4 adults and she spoke to someone and all of a sudden we were seated. The moment we got our orders, we knew right away that the quality is bad. It looked like a take out food that they just reheated. My hubby ordered a rib eye cooked medium rare and it came out burned. I ordered the combo of steak diane and scampi with the side of mashed potatoes and my potatoes were cold like salad and the shrimp looked like cooked shrimp that was microwaved for a very long time. Everything was overcooked and hard to chew on. Very disappointing since this restaurant os my kids' favorite."
