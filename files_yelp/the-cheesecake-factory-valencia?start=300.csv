Susan F.,"Tehachapi, CA",28,15,1,5.0,1/22/2017,"I took my sister to The Cheesecake Factory, I had such a fantastic meal, and excellent service. Diego served us along with Victor bringing us our meals.  They made us feel like a guest and very comfortable. We understand that this is a new restaurant setting up and I think it was very impressive for a first month of new employees learning the way of Cheesecake service, food etc.  Thank you for the beautiful Happy Birthday, it had her name Alice written all beautifully on her plate along with Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. My family and I give many compliments to all of you. We know a new business has a lot to deal with along with some people that don't realize the challenges that come with a heavy load of customers. Bravo to you. I cannot wait to come again, this was my very first experience at Cheesecake Factory and look forward to seeing you soon.  Everyone should understand it takes a period of time to build a perfect establishment, especially with all new employees. My experience was absolutely perfect in every way, thank you again Cheesecake Factory.   I went on 1/15/17. I bought shepherds pie. EXCELLENT!  A little wait but you know it was worth it. I also enjoyed the salted caramel cheesecake. Yum. Great service, kind employees.  My sister really enjoyed the pork chop dinner. Delicious"
Leah C.,"Bakersfield, CA",59,26,9,5.0,3/23/2017,We had Kate as our server and she was amazing! Prompt and our food was delicious! Second time here and we were delighted with exceptional service! Thank you Cheesecake for addressing our past experience.
Mom A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",37,182,35,2.0,12/9/2016,Food at Cheesecake Factory wasn't as tasty this time? Fries at lunch were a bit too greasy and one of the birthday singers looked liked he wasn't enthused about having to sing and be there (he even rolled his eyes up and left before she blew the single candle!) so it gave it a bad juju feeling and made the birthday girl feel bad! Our server guy was nice and professional hence the 2 stars. The slice of cheesecake was way overpriced!  It was just as much some of the lunch items!
Elena M.,"Valencia, CA",4,39,30,2.0,1/18/2017,"So disappointed! The two stars are because the place is lovely, and the staff was kind and sweet. Ugh...the food was not good. Ordered an Antioxidant Salad, and it was mostly tough kale, with very little of the ""goodies"" listed in the menu. A couple of teeny little pieces of avocado and even less teeny pieces of pear, with a couple of halved grapes and a few blueberries. We left most of it on the plate, which was thick, tough kale. Next came the Jamaican Chicken and Shrimp. But it came without the chicken, the shrimp was overcooked and it was a large pile of slop on the plate. We asked to have the beans on the side, but it came in one big mess, and was very unappealing. One of us liked the sauce, the other didn't. They brought the chicken separately once they realized it was missing, but the chicken was a tasteless afterthought, with no flavor whatsoever. Oh, and the wait for a seat while standing up was a real drag. There was one bench which was occupied, with a lobby full of people standing. All in all, a really sad disappointment. I thought it was because maybe they were getting the kinks out of being newly opened, but found out they've been open for 2 1/2 months already. We won't go back. We really wanted to like it, but it just wasn't the wonderful experience we had hoped for."
Ignacio V.,"Newhall, CA",1,5,,3.0,12/12/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory but the waiting time is awful more than 1 hour to go in. The food was excellent and the waiters were polite and good, they do look as beginners but they were giving the best."
Irene E.,"Valencia, CA",0,15,,5.0,3/19/2017,"I tried our new Cheesecake Factory in Valencia for a Sunday morning breakfast, and to my surprise there was no wait.  i was seated, order bacon and eggs and had a very attentive Server that introduced herself.  I ordered and the breakfast was great, well priced and beside the beautiful restaurant, i had goo food and service.  I was expecting a not so good experience, but am glad i tried it out, really enjoy myself."
Kip L.,"Fillmore, CA",39,2,,5.0,11/8/2016,"Cheesecake factory opened tonight, the service was amazing especially from Jonathan and Victor. The food was fantastic the pumpkin cheesecake; divine! This place is a definite hit!!"
Riva G.,"Canyon Country, CA",4,1,,2.0,11/26/2016,"The wait staff was friendly and their service was great. The front of house people though were incompetent and rude. We had a large party, and it took 2+ hours to get seated, but that was  only because we finally complained. They have no common sense when it comes to seating more than  5 people in a group. Unless you plan to spend  4 - 5 hours just trying to have lunch like we did, I wouldn't recommended going here."
Freddy O.,"Granada Hills, CA",117,7,,5.0,2/11/2017,Jason was the most polite server. He made us very comfortable and made sure everything was fine. Thanks for the great service!
Jeff B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",8,16,5,1.0,2/10/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory seems to have been very popular since its fairly recent opening. We were put off by long wait times, until we checked midweek when it was only about 15 minutes. Still busy, a full restaurant, but no long queue. So, off to the bar while we waited for our table. The one bartender was rushed off her feet, so it took a while to grab a drink. Why only one bartender? Now there's a question. Our table was in a chilly location. You really shouldn't need to wear a jacket in So. Cal, but it's yet another place with crazy air conditioning. Looking through the extensive menu, we notice that there's no nutritional info except for some ""lite"" menu items. Listing calorie counts and other nutritional info is the law in CA for restaurants with 20 or more locations, so where is this information? A helpful waiter explained that there are some vegetarian entrees, and some pasta dishes can be made vegetarian. So, I order a veggie burger, my partner orders a veggie pasta dish.  Warm bread is supposed to be served while waiting. Cold bread arrives. We ask for it to be warmed up, ""no problem"". 15 minutes and multiple requests later, it still hasn't arrived. We wait. And wait. Eventually, my partner's pasta dish arrives. Apparently mine was taken by some other server, so they need to start a replacement from scratch. So, I still wait. My partner tries some pasta. Not too bad, but.... what's this? Bits of something we don't recognize at first, then realize they've put BACON bits in a VEGETARIAN pasta dish!!! Major league screw up. We decide to leave, enough is enough. The manager apologizes and offers us cheesecake to go, which is a nice gesture. I almost bumped this rating up to 2 stars because of that, but the cheesecake was way too rich and had a ""soggy bottom"", so was really not worth eating. With all the screw-ups and law-breaking menus, one star it is."
Jessica B.,"Los Angeles, CA",62,5,7,2.0,12/13/2016,"So the food is great and we got seated almost as soon as we walked it. Unfortunately there are a few kinks and one is a MAJOR flaw. There service SUCKS. The first time I came there was only TWO of us and the server took our order and didn't come back for 45 minutes. Now this is our second experience here, there are THREE of us this time but it took 25 minutes and I had to find someone to get our waiter. They claim it was a shift change and a miscommunication. I don't care who's fault it was but you don't just leave a table looking bored out of there minds and hungry with NO DRINKS. We may be coming back for a 3rd time but if it happens again we will NOT BE BACK.  *this happened around happy hour*"
Bitsy B.,"Palmdale, CA",13,2,,5.0,1/13/2017,"Great experience! My husband and I came in for dinner, and even though it was a very busy time, we were seated quickly, and served quickly and with a smile from Jason! Excited to go again! Food and service were both worth the wait."
Jeffrey E.,"Valencia, CA",301,53,2,5.0,12/16/2016,"Just went to the one in Santa Clarita for the first time, wow it looks nice inside and outside.   They did a great job.....The food was fantastic as always....I had the Kobe Beef burger, gluten free bun and sweet potato fries....Yum...The food took a little long to get to us, but the manager came over and was so generous that she gave us the meal for free.  Totally not necessary but it made a great impression on me....I will be back.....I wanted their cheesecake, but was too full after my meal...I saw our neighbors getting the cheesecake and wow, did it look delicious.....So glad to have them here in the SCV...."
Christian E.,"Canyon Country, CA",118,25,2,2.0,2/4/2017,"Been here a few times and thoroughly enjoy their food and usually receive great service. Today on the other hand, our service has been absolutely disgusting. Our waitress has been nothing but rude with us from the moment we sat in her area. When taking the order, she would roll her eyes, interrupt anyone putting their order in, cut them off and walk away, and when asked for kids menus, she just walked away and had to be asked twice more for them. Once the drinks were brought out, which took 35 mons to get, the order was completely wrong. Coffees were so cold and she had to be asked for sugar a few times. Had to get the management involved in order to fix things. Thankfully the manager was real nice and helped make sure things went smoothly afterward."
A C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,5.0,1/6/2017,"Has anyone else noticed that The Cheesecake Factory cheesecake slices are getting smaller but still expensive...??? Yes, my husband and I said that exact same thing!  They are indeed getting smaller no matter what management is denying."
Jonathan C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,7,,2.0,2/2/2017,Service was good brittany was really nice did a great job. Service is not my issue the food is my issue. I got a bacon bacon cheeseburger and not long after eating said cheeseburger did i start getting stomach cramps and feel ill. The appetizzer i got the chicken slidders were awesome. Qhen it came to the burger however i couldnt eat more then half it started to taste off the more i ate. Well this being my first time there that isnt really a good start to me. I hope they can change that in the future.
S. A.,"Northridge, CA",0,30,7,3.0,3/7/2017,"Food was good. Service was very slow and lacking in general. Was almost 10 minutes after we were seated before any one came to take our drink order. Took a long time to get our appetizer. Meal came out shortly after and was good. But they forgot our side of ranch and I wasn't asked what kind of cheese I wanted on my sandwich (the menu says your choice of cheese), so it ended up coming out with Swiss on it. Yuck.. Also left off pickles on the burger yet it came with tomato after asking for no tomato... we asked for the bill to be split down the middle and they charged $36 to one card and $11 to the other.... the waiter asked if we wanted her to get the manager to fix it but we just wanted out by then. Should have been fixed before bringing the bill to the table..."
H. D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,30,6,1.0,6/21/2017,Called ahead to advise we were a party of 8 coming in. We were told there was little to no wait due disclosing within the hour and half to walk in and see no one in the lobby other than the house. Never once did she look up and acknowledge us or say hello or welcome. A party of 2 walked in after us about 2 minutes after we did and she popped her head up welcomed them and took them right back to be seated STILL without acknowledgment. Then our server was super than ever and never came back to refill bread since we only received two baskets of half slices to feed 8 people. Our appetizers were up before we even got our drinks after being sat for 30 minutes to look and see our server standing there talking. Horrible service.
Jacquie O.,"Duarte, CA",8,5,,1.0,1/30/2017,"This restaurant is impossible - left the first time we went because the wait was so long - 2nd time the wait was long but we stayed.  They took several people ahead of us that walked in after us.  I ordered the skinnylicious white chile and said ""please be sure it's hot"" - waited another 1/2 hr for food and of course it was warm at best.  I will never give them another dime of my money. On the otherhand - Arcadia Cheesecake Factory is great!"
Evan H.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,158,17,4.0,1/2/2017,"Food is exactly what you would expect very good.  But, you can not go on a school night.  they don't take reservations or call aheads.  We have tried to eat here 6 times.  Only once the wait was under an hour.  It was still 35 minutes.  I like it here but they don't make it easy for families with kids ( I thought it was a family restaurant).  It is real tough to sit for an hour plus and wait for a table.  I will continue to call and if the wait isn't crazy I will go."
