Ryan P.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",43,46,31,1.0,12/9/2016,Terrible service. Longest wait I have ever experienced. Servers forget your orders and never come back.
Armen K.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,110,110,5.0,12/5/2016,Anelisse was our server by the bar. Her service was amazing. I've visited plenty of Cheesecake Factory's in my day - and have always lacked good service. Anelisse was beyond 5 stars. Just a great enthusiasm and energy in such a crowded and crazy atmosphere. Definitely should check out the new location.
Jason P.,"Valencia, CA",0,5,1,4.0,1/26/2017,Really enjoyed the food here! I'm so glad they opened up here finally get to have good cheesecake without the drive. Our waiter Fabulous was awesome! His name pretty much describes him . He always made sure we were okay while he still had plenty of other tables to look after. Thanks for the good experience!
Ken N.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,12,,1.0,2/28/2017,On a Tuesday Evening..Horrible Service!  Very simple order.. Pasta and Salad.  My Credit Card was temporarily lost.  Management was kind though.   Disappointing!
Marcelo A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2,37,9,4.0,12/13/2016,"Great food, awesome service but the inside is a bit loud. the patio is perfect for family and easy to hear the other person your with. The Bacon Burger is my favorite and the Cheesecake is, as always, out of this world."
Ilan J.,"Santa Clarita, CA",51,207,4,5.0,12/6/2016,wonderful food despite being a HUGE chain.  Had the tuna carpaccio.  OMFG so damn good.  Could have ordered 3x.  Had the tempura shrimp  and very non Japanese but yummo.  Wife's quesadilla was wonderful.  Didn;t try daughter's pasta only cuz she brings leftovers all the time and I know how good it is.  Son and wife had brunch egg stuff and that was tasty too.  Glad they opened one out in SCV.  Other restaurants will be having lower customer visits for sure.
Laurel T.,"Lancaster, CA",11,7,,2.0,8/5/2017,"Tipsy Diner at the Cheesecake Factory My first experience with this Cheesecake Factory at this location!! Normally I love Cheesecake Factory, and expect nothing but the best as I usually do from this chain. First off... the bar is very accommodating as well as the reservation desk. All started off very lovely until we were seated.  Christine S seated us... thus leading us into this journey of lies, deception, and turmoil! Christine appeared nervous... forgot the bread... took off with the drink cups and failed to routinely appear as any skilled waiter/waitress would. Naturally we theorized she was new considering the faux pas we encountered. It was at the point after grief of no bread and thirsting for a lengthy period that we decided to journey into more favorable locations. Sisely's across the street caught our eye where we then decided to depart on our journey next door. As we prepped to depart (grab my purse and stand up without staggering) the server appeared with food. I was feeling a tad sassy and was ready to take off until we looked at the food where the server was able to coax us off the ledge with a sweet card for Cheesecake! We sat down and were impressed with this servers skills.... we felt truly special with said server. Like we mattered at this Cheesecake Factory, and our happiness truly mattered.  During our service we rarely seen Christine S. and she was brief without really caring as we had seen with other wait staff, including the guy that lied about the card. Oh, the card you ask? Yes the server we were impressed with coaxed us back to the CF by stating he had a card for our distress for free Cheesecake but wasn't completely up front that all customers were receiving this same card.   At the end of our meal we went to get the cheesecake from the front desk fully expecting to use the card. As we get to the order desk, the young waitress then advised us it could be only used on certain days. My fiancée who had taken me out for my birthday dinner was perturbed and requested the manager. Sarah the Manager arrives not looking impressed, and not in the mood to deal! O get busy night but isn't this why you are here?... to ensure all runs smoothly? We told Sarah the Manager what happened with our table and the table next to ours who were also dissatisfied with poor service just as we were. She then proceeded to lie saying they didn't have a problem. I know it was a lie as I watched and heard the table as it was in my line of sight. Unfortunately nothing came from our requests and explanation of our dissatisfaction. This ultimately left us with a bad taste overall for this establishment. I mean it's a piece of cheesecake Sarah! Make your customers happy!  End result? Don't go to Christine S, the Manager Sarah doesn't truly care about her customers much less making them repeat customers. We won't be going back after this service sad to say. I understand you have the monopoly in this location so maybe that is why you don't care. Either way this lets others know I care about their enjoyment and service."
Rebekah R.,"West Hills, CA",48,82,22,4.0,5/30/2017,"My family went here on Memorial Day after we went to Red Robin . Red Robin left us sitting in waiting area and just ignored us. Worst customer service I have experienced there but we left and came to Cheesecake Factory since we have not been to this new location yet. We got seated right away which was very nice. Hostess and waitress was very nice. Food was good.... the food at Cheesecake Factory I have always thought was not spectacular but it is also far from being bad. I got the bang bang chicken and shrimp. It had a pretty good flavor and a few shrimp. I was surprised on the lack of chicken though especially since the chicken is cheaper then shrimp. There wasn't such a huge lack of meat so I didn't say anything. It came with a LOT of rice though, could have toned down a little there. What's the most disappointing thing is that you guys put the calories right next to everything. Even the cheesecakes and my favorite Cheesecake is the red velvet. I knew it wasn't a diet food but 1590 calories!!! Seeing those calorie numbers right next to the names definitely changed my mind about eating dessert again. lol  I know you have to provide that info but maybe do it on a separate paper. Just a suggestion. So it's a good and bad thing, good because I watched more what I was eating but bad because it really took all the fun out of eating a slice of your delicious cheesecake. Overall I was happy with this customer service over the pervious restaurant we were just at. Spent more money then we would have at other place.... but who leaves customers waiting with a 2 yr old?   They sat everyone else but us , even people of the same party size that came after us. Shame on you Red Robin but good for you Cheesecake Factory. You know how to treat your customers!"
Yessy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,1.0,11/23/2016,"I had high expectations for the Cheesecake Factory. It's one of my favorite places and I figured since it was new, they would have excellent service. I was so WRONG! First time I went, we were there about 3 and a half hours if not more, an hour waiting to be seated and the rest pretty much waiting for a waiter to come. At first it didn't take long to get someone to get our drinks and then our order but once we were done, we wanted to order dessert but our waiter was nowhere to be seen. Yet there were 3 waiters in front of our table just talking and laughing while we were trying to get the attention of at least one. I didn't think much of it though since the food was delicious and we had great company among friends.  It was the second experience that really bothered me. We had gotten lunch at the office and when they brought our food, my order was wrong. I had specifically asked for a pasta with no mushrooms, which they repeated when placing the order over the phone, yet my pasta was full of mushrooms. Second, we were missing a Cheesecake, mine specifically. So I called the restaurant, I spoke to two people before being transferred to a male manager who seriously had no intention of helping. I told him we were missing a cheesecake and he asked whose name the order was under and what had been ordered other than cheesecake. I gave him the info but he insisted that all three cheesecakes we ordered had been bagged and that the order didn't even have the cheesecake I had requested. I assured him we were missing the cheesecake but he insisted in basically calling me a liar as I'm telling him only two were in our bags. Then he placed me on hold and said he'd see what he could do about reimbursing one cheesecake to the credit card but all I wanted was my cheesecake. Then the call was gone. I called again. Asked to speak to a manager and Nicole was able to help and said I could pick up the slice I missed, something the other guy couldn't help me with. He obviously did not have any intention of pleasing a customer."
Lindsey G.,"Valencia, CA",0,15,1,1.0,6/5/2017,"Food is good, that's the only reason for one star. But service is horrendous. Besides the fact of long wait times, at the mall in Valencia on a weekend that's to be expected, the service truly sucks. Waited 30 minutes for our table which wasn't bad at all and wasn't even bothered by it, ordered our food as a party of four and my husbands food came first after about a 35 minute wait from ordering. My toddlers food, myself and father in law's came out 30 minutes after my husbands- so he was already finished and we are still waiting to eat, the waitress was sweet but continuously forgot to bring things or even come by for refills, we asked her to box the rest of the food we were waiting on to go since it was so late at this point and she forgot to do that as well. Didn't even send a manager over to speak with - which I would imagine management is just as bad as the service being that multiple reviews have said this. I was so excited for a great restaurant to open in our town but sadly after two experiences like this at this location I will not return. And the fact that they still don't accept reservations is ridiculous to me! Unfortunately, they will never last here."
Wendy E.,"Bowie, MD",0,7,3,1.0,1/19/2017,"Greeter can't seem to get things right, waited over an hr after she had said 50 mins after the hour was up I asked her how much longer and she said tables needed to get clean 15 mins later I asked again and once again she said tables needed to get clean once we finally get the table they sat our family in the outside area which we specifically had asked not to be seated since we had small children.  For myself it was my first time at TCCF and let's just say I won't be coming back. They need to get their act together. I guess you need to start drinking at the bar in order not to notice how bad they are."
Sarah B.,"Ventura, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/15/2017,First time at this cheesecake location and our server Jason made it a great experience. He was extremely attentive to our bread and butter needs as well as making sure our drinks were always filled. Thank you for making our dining experience one to remember!! We will be back!!
Ross B.,"Canyon Country, CA",2,3,,2.0,1/14/2017,"Wow, I have loved the Cheesecake Factory and a little over two weeks ago had an enjoyable experience at the location in Santa Monica. Then last night happened in Santa Clarita.  First of all we had asked for a table for 5, we ended up getting squished into a booth that really is for four people with a chair added on the end, the result was a cramped dining experience. Next up was the attempt to read the menu, needed to use my cell phone light to do so. I did not have that problem in Santa Monica, I get that they have an intended ambiance but it is too dark. Next I tried to order a drink with Roses Lime in it, I have been going to the Cheesecake Factory for 20 years and this is the first and only location that has no Roses Lime juice. I then ordered a Diet Coke at the same time that my son ordered a Root Beer, the server bought back the root beer and I asked where the Diet Coke was, he said the bar is very busy and rushed off, he then returned about 5 minutes later with a Rum and Diet Coke, not what I had ordered.  Time for the Santa Clarita location to get its act together...oh and by the way, time for the chain to change up their mashed potatoes, the chunky and cold mashed potatoes they serve are horrible!"
Jared B.,"Palmdale, CA",0,9,,5.0,1/13/2017,"Great experience! Jason was a great help and very friendly! Busy, but worth it! For being at the Valencia mall, they still seated is quite quickly!"
Jazmyn W.,"Rockford, IL",5,10,4,5.0,12/18/2016,Love love love it!! Food is always delicious! I have gone four times already! The service just keeps getting better! The wait stinks but it's soooo worth it!
Daniel M.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,104,23,3.0,5/24/2017,"I got a breakfast omelet at Cheesecake Factory I know I know not the best choice but I thought I would give it a try.  It came out and let me tell you it was the worst tasting omelet I have ever had in my life.  Never again will I get an omelet at Cheesecake Factory.  I am giving three stars cause the service was just ok and not the best I have ever had at any Cheesecake Factory.  Also, they tried sitting us at a half table instead of a booth so i shot that table down and demanded a booth instead."
Tina S.,"Valencia, CA",0,6,,5.0,7/31/2017,Last week had lunch with my toddler and niece.  Amazing service from Jason.  He was fabulous and super accommodating!!!
Christopher I.,"Canyon Country, CA",1,71,,4.0,3/6/2017,"The food was good.  The cheesecake is delicious.  My only complaint is that this restaurant gets super busy, but I would eat here again.  :)"
Bernie O.,"Tucson, AZ",0,43,2,4.0,7/11/2017,"My wife and I stopped by to have lunch with my sister, her husband and their daughters.  I'm a simple man; I ordered cheese pizza and a salad.  The pizza was great.  The rest of our group had a little more imagination and ordered different things.  Bottom line is everyone enjoyed their lunch and our waiter, Jacob did a great job."
Nicole M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,4.0,2/10/2017,"I used to go to Cheesecake Factory in Sherman Oaks ALL the time. I love it. I went to this one on Superbowl sunday and there was no wait to be seated. The host and waiter were great. I've never had a host be as helpful as this one was. The food was awesome and the outside patio was really nice. The only reason I cant give 5 stars is because there was a group of employees sitting near me (off the clock) and they were talking about customers they hate and co workers that annoy them. That was really off putting! Not the company's fault, but maybe have management improve the employee culture?"
