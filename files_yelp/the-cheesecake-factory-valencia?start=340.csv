Hillary C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,15,3,2.0,12/10/2016,"The TO-GO service needs a drastic improvement on communication between employees, the CakePay app is an interesting touch, odd a company that large doesn't have an app you can order in & avoid calling. They often forget items and there is an increased long wait because of the walking distance to & from the actual restaurant & where you park in the structure. Hopefully after some time we will see improvement."
Collin H.,"Los Angeles, CA",196,3,,5.0,2/5/2017,"The French toast was great and my family's food was amazing as well. Everything you expect at a Cheesecake Factory. Besides the food, Jason was a great server today...he was entertaining, great in spirit, and just an all around fantastic server. He went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect coming out and did more than most servers I have 10/10"
Rodel R.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",6,13,4,5.0,11/19/2016,"First time here since it opened in Valencia mall. Very busy and since it's Saturday night, it's even busier. Waited about 45 minutes to get a seat ,which we expected. Once seated the s4aff was on ot and got out orders going. Served our dinners fairly quickly, for how busy they were. Our waiters were really friendly and outgoing. Great atmosphere especially since we sat at the outside patio. We were able to interact with our party of 8 and friends who happen to be passing by. Overall, great experience and would definitely come back again."
Laurie H.,"Canyon Country, CA",47,5,2,1.0,4/20/2017,"Very, very disappointed! We went last night for our 13 year anniversary. The wait time was not long at all and we were seated at a small booth by some windows. The waitress was extremely nice. We placed our order and while we were waiting, little gnats were flying all around us, on the table and on the window. We both kept having to kill them with our drink napkins. The next time the waitress came by, we told her about the gnats and she said the people in the booth behind us had just complained about the same thing. She went to get the manager and when she arrived she said that we would be moved to a different booth. The manager also said that she was aware of the problem and they have had their pest control company coming every day. While we were waiting to be moved, we continued killing the gnats and one actually ended up in my coffee. There was another guy, who must have worked there because he was using the flashlight on his phone to try and see where the bugs were getting in. By this time, we were both itching and kind of grossed out. They moved all of the people, in the three or four booths that were effected, and said they weren't seating anyone else in that area. Once we were moved, we only saw about one more gnat flying around. We finally received our food and it was cold. While we were waiting to tell the waitress, the gnat landed right in the mashed potatoes! By this time, another waiter came over and asked if we wanted them to re-make our food or package the meals ""to go"". Very strange. We asked them to re-make our meals and as we waited, the waitress brought us both bowls of soup to eat. Once we received our hot meals, the food was very good. We both saved room and shared a piece of cheesecake for dessert. We weren't really impressed with the cheesecake. Once we were done, the waitress said that she was going to take our bill to the manager as she wanted to do something for us for all of the problems. When we got it back, they covered our dessert and took 25% off the rest of our bill. Whenever a problem has ever happened anywhere else, they have usually been very apologetic and taken care of the whole bill. The manager here never apologized or even came by again after she moved us. She really didn't seem to care much at all. Additionally, as we got up to leave, we noticed that they had seated more people in the same booths that had all the bugs!"
Monica S.,"Newhall, CA",0,31,6,1.0,6/4/2017,"While our waitress was kind, the kitchen to this particular Cheesecake Factory did not have it together.  To start, 2 out of 4 of our silverware settings were dirty.  Secondly, it took over 20 minutes to get our food.  When we did receive our food only 1 of 4 dishes came out satisfactory.  Both dishes which contained pasta were cold, further the fish taco dish was cold and was evident had sat for awhile.  After informing the runner of this, they stated they'd bring a new dish out.  After waiting another long 20 minutes or so and my family having finished their meals I stood up to find someone to cancel my order.  Adding insult to injury, when I walked in from the patio most restaurant personnel were in the kitchen celebrating something clapping and cheering.  No on duty manager bothered to approach our table to offer an apology or at least to show any empathy for the circumstances.  Other than our waitress stating the manager removed the dish from our bill, which is something I'd expect considering I didn't eat anything.  Needless to say since our family visit to this location today fell short from our expectation we will not be back.  Fortunately, there are other options in the area."
N S.,"Valencia, CA",0,16,,5.0,7/24/2017,"I have never had a meal I didn't thoroughly enjoy at the Cheesecake Factory. Yet during my visit today, the service from our server, Sterling was every bit as great. She was not only incredibly nice and funny, she refilled our drinks before they were empty and was very attentive. Even though I was there just outside of the ""lunch hours"" she checked with the kitchen to see if the chef would be willing to make me a lunch sized crusted chicken romano (which he did and it was amazing) With the influx of excellent restaurants in the Santa Clarita valley over the past 10 years, the one thing that can separate one from the other is the level of service provided to your customers. Clearly you have someone in Sterling who understands this."
Ryan C.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",146,21,7,5.0,12/17/2016,"Came here with my mom for a cup of coffee after seeing a movie right down the way. Ended up getting the avocado rolls and Mac n cheese appetizers as well! Both were nice and hot and tasted amazing! Michael, our server, was super friendly and on top of everything! I honestly couldn't think of something to make him a better server..he made the whole experience of SCV's new Cheesecake Factory THAT much better! The inside of this place is really nice and fancy..the prices were reasonable and the music was great! Overall it was an amazing experience! We will be back for the awesome food, nice experience, and great service!  thanks again Michael!"
Katie L.,"Valencia, CA",2,2,,5.0,5/23/2017,i don't understand the negative reviews. the servers are always so nice here and everything always comes out quickly. i'm literally posting this review as i'm sitting in another cheesecake factory where the bread is cold and it took our waitress 20 minutes to get us water. Also shout out to Nic Politi for bussing my table to pristine condition
Jeff Y.,"Glendale, CA",0,17,1,1.0,3/10/2017,"I decided to give them three chances before writing this review. Food is not very good. The wait time is insane, and they do not take reservations. Staff was incredibly rude and demeaning on one of my trips. On another trip we called ahead and asked if they allow pets on the outside patio. We were told that they did, we drove down there and waited over an hour for an outside table. When we sat down the very rude manager demanded we leave immediately because of our dog. PLACE IS NOT PET FRIENDLY!!!   It's ok, there's a great Italian place next door that allows pets that was able to seat us immediately. No problems!"
Elesia H.,"Palmdale, CA",32,8,2,1.0,1/17/2017,I was so dissatisfied  with the shrimp scampi it was tasteless and the dessert the somores cheese cake they ran out of gram crackers.Really lol I will never visit again.
Chelsea B.,"Littleton, CO",0,3,,5.0,1/15/2017,"Jason was the best service I've had at a cheesecake factory in a long time! As soon as he saw our bread was low, he refilled it immediately. As soon as our drinks were hallway gone, he refilled them immediately. He was attentive and checked on us often! When we asked him for ranch he got in immediately, unlike service I'm used to where it takes an additional 5 minutes to get! He made this cheesecake experience phenomenal and we will return to see him!"
Lorie Z.,"Newhall, CA",4,5,,1.0,1/15/2017,We had to wait for over 2 hours for a table. We were told they wear cleaning a table for are party of 4 and 20 minutes later we were still waiting. Management was no help. Are server was very nice and we'll trained. It took 45 minutes to get are food after we ordered. I belive the cooks might need help. We will not be going back for a long time
Sunny D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,,1.0,1/14/2017,"My husband and I recently moved to SCV and were very excited to receive a $25 Cheesecake Factory gift card from friends. Last night we put our gift card to use and, unfortunately, were extremely disappointed with our visit to the SCV Cheesecake Factory.  My husband previously worked at Cheesecake Factory for years, and thus has personal experience to the expected quality standards. Our server took our drink orders, and then later came back for our food hours. It took approximately 30 minutes to produce 2 glasses of wine, and a further 50 minutes to produce our entrees. After we had waited 40 minutes, our server came to explain to us that there had been a mix up with the kitchens, but failed to do anything to compensate us, such as bring us a second bread basket or offer a complementary glass of wine. It was extremely obvious that he hadn't put in our orders with the kitchen, which is fine, but just say that. Don't tell me that some other server took our dishes by mistake, because if that were true the manager would have come to speak with us and make sure we were comfortable.  The food was fine. Not great, but fine. After spending nearly 2 and a half hours at the restaurant, by the time the food arrived I just wanted to go home.  We were extremely disappointed in our visit. It was a complete waste of a gift card. Even with the gift card we paid over $80 on the tab for a very sub-par meal."
Lou E.,"Valencia, CA",0,3,1,4.0,11/13/2016,Went in for brunch today. They said it was going to be a 40 minute wait but it turned out to be more like an hour. It was okay through because they gave us a great table. Super busy as to be expected but our servers were great. Food was very awesome. Egg roll appetizer was amazing and the margaritas were so good. Can't wait to come back and try more off of the massive menu!!!
Shirley L.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",217,15,,5.0,2/2/2017,Went for lunch with my sister and a friend.  Michael our waiter was adorable.  The food was excellent.  I had the Chicken Romano with the white sauce...Fantastic.  Will be going there again.
Adam N.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,9,,5.0,12/6/2016,"Had our first meal at our new Cheesecake Factory last night. It was a great meal!  Highly recommend this place. Our server, Jason, was terrific. We were a high-maintenance table and Jason took great care of us throughout our meal."
Russ S.,"Fillmore, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/8/2016,"Opening night - rocked it! Food exceptional, wait staff and others spot on; they nailed it. Kudos to our server Jon! A bit pricey, but worth worth every penny. Superb!"
Jessica O.,"CA, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/8/2017,Had the friendliest server ever ! Her name was Analit O. Will definitely request her the next time l go ! She was fast and made sure my sister and I had everything we needed. Excellent service !  The wait time to get seated was not too bad and the food was good as well.
Amanda S.,"Dublin, CA",208,8,,1.0,1/29/2017,"Just left this place for the second time. It's absolutely, hands down the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. The service is slow and lacks hospitality. Management isn't much better. We waited over 45 minutes for our food and there seemed to be confusion among the waiters and runners over what our table ordered and if our food had come out or not. In addition, the tuna carpaccio (which I have ordered 5,000 times from higher quality cheesecake factories) was clearly old and chewy. We explained our grievances to the manager and he was nice enough to comp the bill 25% but when we received the bill they had charged us for items we didn't order. My family and I will not be coming back. I hope this location gets it act together."
Chris E.,"Canyon Country, Canyon Country, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/2/2017,"I wish I would have listened to the reviews. Awful service, save your time and money. I took my family on Thursday June 1st, arrived at 745, wait time was reasonable and accurate. 20 min wait to be seated. No Problem, once seated we were greeted by our waitress, She was nice but clearly in way over her head. we heard the table behind us complaining and asking to speak to a manager, I thought uh oh not gonna be our night, Our server Taylor then left the area for several minutes, clearly looking to avoid the table behind us. After they left she finally came to our table, took drink and appetizer order. Both came in a timely manor. However when we placed our dinner orders, classic burger, popcorn shrimp and w kids meals, spaghetti and meatballs and a chicken tender order it all went to hell. my burger arrived first. 11 min after ordering, then a few minutes later the shrimp. No kids meals, we waited, and waited, and looked for Taylor, no where to be found, another table was also clearly distraught and seeking assistants. 22 min later she returned to ask how dinner was, I said not good as our children's food is still not here, She said oh no, I thought you just ate it fast. I said if it is not cooked then just please remove from my check. another 11 min pass, the food comes put, mind you 33 min since my burger was placed on table, I told her this was unacceptable, She apologized and hurried away. my kids began to finally eat, the food was COLD, are you kidding me? again we looked for our server and began asking for a manager, another waitress said she would send a manager our way. Never happened. Taylor came by again and dropped the check and left. I was charged the fill amount with nothing taken off, when I questioned this she said she couldn't remove as the food had been eaten. Really 2 bites on one Cold chicken tender. Unreal, She then again disappeared, I considered walking out and not paying a dime, but did not. paid the $67.00 Bill, and left. won't ever return. Just an awful experience. Either the servers need more training or the managers need more help, but at this rate it won't stay open long."
