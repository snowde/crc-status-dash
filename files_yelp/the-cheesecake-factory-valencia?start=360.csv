Andy B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,7,,5.0,3/18/2017,Seems to have corrected its new location teething troubles - food excellent and service excellent - overall a great experience compared to earlier visits. This is what we expect from the Cheesecake Factory.
Mike G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,29,,1.0,5/27/2017,"I'm a loyal Cheesecake Factory customer, that's been going to their restaurant for over 15 years. I celebrate my Anniversary with my wife at the Sherman Oaks Location. So I was very disappointed when I went to the Valencia location. The front desk was not friendly with me and sent me to a table for two, when it's obvious that 2 adults and a baby in a stroller would not physically fit. When I asked for another table, I was given an attitude. Then they end up sending me to another table for two (but at least this one was in the corner. The waitress was nice, but then my problem was with the food. I asked for the steak medallions to be medium rare. They brought it rare and not enough sauce. I mentioned it to the waitress and she took it back to the kitchen. When the waitress brought the plate back, it had less meat. I was very disappointed, because this was a late Mother's Day dinner, and the restaurant did not meet my expectations to what I am used to at Sherman Oaks. The obvious thing is to keep complaining and talk to a manager. I had already talked to three different employees.Had I talked to a manager, that would been the fourth person I would be talked to.  I would've ruined the night, as this was a late Mother's Day dinner."
Keeks S.,"Valencia, Valencia, CA",160,2,2,3.0,1/14/2017,"The first time i came was simply amazing! The second time i ordered take out, i walked what 30 feet to the food court and my fried chicken sandwiches were warm! Not hot like the first time i dined there! So that's a total NO for takeout, i went last night with a friend at 11 pm by that point it was slowing down and tables were leaving, our food didn't arrive till 15-20 minutes till closing  forgot my fries and my tomatoes were missing from the appetizer, only pickles! I want this place to flourish here in scv so much! Who knows what it would take to make it work"
Andrea P.,"Sunland-Tujunga, CA",0,89,19,2.0,3/7/2017,"I don't know what it is about the cultural wasteland that is Santa Clarita, but they can destroy any restaurant that is great at other locations.  Cheesecake Factory is so good everywhere else, I was really hesitant to eat here because truly, the food in SCV is nearly always abysmal with only a few teensy exceptions, unfortunately, this was not one of them.   My waitress however, was very sweet and attentive.  I ate here on Saturday afternoon and it wasn't busy yet at all.  I sat in the bar and ordered the margherita pizza/green salad lunch.  They should've just called the salad a radicchio salad because literally, that's almost all that was in it, along with an underripe, flavorless, quartered tomato.  I tried not to gobble up all the bread so I wouldn't be too full. so I set aside half of it.  My pizza came and it absolutely sucked!  It was horrid.  Pizza should be cheesy and packed with flavor - this was neither.  The crust should be flavorful and have a great texture - it had neither.  I ate only the topping off of two pieces, gave up and just finished the bread basket instead.   I told my waitress the pizza sucked...bad.  She offered to bring me something else but I already knew that would simply bring greater disappointment.  I wanted to get two pieces of cheesecake to go - those are baked offsite in Agoura Hills, so I knew they'd be perfect!  My hubby and I go nuts for our fave flavor - Kahlua Coffee Chocolate Cheesecake.  The waitress told me they discontinued that flavor.  Um yeah, we are so done here.  This was $22 I'll never see again.  I can't believe they 86'ed the best cheesecake EVER!  Like nearly everything else in Santa Clarita, this place is just a poseur.  There is no substance.   CF corporate hesitated for years to open a store here because their market research said it wouldn't sell enough or do enough business.  Their fears will be realized, it is already a mediocre chain restaurant.  It's not Cheesecake Factory though, it's just the SCV curse.  It's a poseur town and everything there is mediocre, they just can't help it."
Gene S.,"Lancaster, CA",0,11,4,2.0,6/18/2017,"I guess I was expecting too much considering all the hype I'd heard about the place.  When we got there the line was long and the wait was about 30 minutes.  As far as the food, well, I've had just as good food at many truck stops. I was not impressed at all and the prices were higher than a lot of other places.  Overall, great hype but lacks the extra one would expect in the food, service and dining experience."
Carol D.,"Valencia, CA",0,10,,2.0,6/15/2017,"I want to begin by saying I am not a fan of ""chain"" restaurants.  I also have to qualify myself by saying I began eating at the Cheesecake Factory many many years ago long before it was a ""chain"" restaurant at the location in Beverly Hills (which no longer exist), so I will admit I am a bit spoiled.  Unfortunately, now it's just a fast food restaurant with waiters and linen napkins.  Many of the items are often OVER cooked, RE-HEATED or RE-COOKED and it is just horrible.  When you order asparagus and you pick it up on your fork and it becomes U shaped, well need I say more.   When you order something on the ""new"" menu TWICE in a two week period and you are told they just ran out, that screams poor management.  The only reason to go to a ""chain"" restaurant is consistency in the food.  However, this Cheesecake Factory location does not even provide that."
Suzanne W.,"Castaic, CA",43,6,,5.0,6/12/2017,"I love coming to eat here at this location. There is always great service and the food is exceptional! I'm a regular customer and although there is usually a wait to be seated because of the restaurant being so new, it's always worth the wait and I am pleased every time."
Christine A.,"Newhall, CA",7,1,,4.0,6/11/2017,This is a great place! My husband & I enjoyed the food & great service. Josh was very nice & attentive server. We will be back:)
John J.,"Valencia, CA",1,11,,1.0,6/11/2017,Horrible service and so-so food. Have given this location three tries; there will not be a fourth. Would rather go out of way to visit one of the other locations all with an hour drive.
Omar A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/22/2017,I love the food at the Cheesecake Factory. Multiple times that I have dined at this specific Cheesecake Factory they have gotten by order wrong. I was there yesterday and they made a mistake on everyone's order. The two salads did not have dressing. The steak was way to salty. They brought out the wrong pasta. The manager that was working that day (Sunday) came up to us to address the issue. He was very rude. They have messed up the order in the past but this time it was all of our meals. This is not the first time a manager was rude as well. It happened once before with a female manager. Like I said I love the food at the Cheesecake Factory but they need to make changes so the guests can have an enjoyable experience.
Sofia G.,"Mission Hills, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/11/2017,I love this Cheesecake Factory !!! There's never a wait and the service was excellent! Jason the server was amazing and super attentive! Definitely coming back here !!
Carmen S.,"Pomona, CA",0,8,3,5.0,5/19/2017,This was my first time at the cheese cake factory and had such a great experience thanks to Jason.  He was very attentive and had a great attitude all around.  I live two hours away but thanks to Jason's professionalism I will be sure to stop by when I am in the area.
Lukas C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",23,1,,4.0,11/15/2016,Not enough toilets. Needs more bathroom space. Only 1 sink for the male restroom. Food as always is good. Its the cheesecake factory.
Mike B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,28,,5.0,9/13/2017,"i have been here numerous times, with no problems at all. the food and service are always great!!! i try something different each time. it does get crowded, but you cant complain on a saturday night. keep up the good work !!!"
Sandi S.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,6,,5.0,11/13/2016,I thought it was great. I had the miso salmon and we had the grilled artichoke for the appetizer (the kids loved it). I also had a blueberry mojito. Everything was really good. And of course the cheesecake is good too.
J L.,"Valencia, CA",3,106,,4.0,3/14/2017,"I came here on a weekday night, around 8:30 p.m. to be exact. I was seated within five minutes. Every employee that came in contact with me was very friendly. The wheat bread is delicious! My food was fresh and tasty. The portions here are large, so expect to have leftovers. And who can forget the cheesecake?! I ordered the fresh strawberry one and it was amazing! I would not suggest coming here on weekends or during lunch time because I have heard horror stories about long waiting times."
Monica B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,17,4,5.0,1/3/2017,"We had visited other Cheesecake Factory locations multiple times and we decided to check out the new Valencia location yesterday for the 1st time. We went around noon and were quoted 40 -60 mins wait time. It ended up being about 25 mins. The hostess that sat us was extremely welcoming. Then our waitress Analit came to the table. She was incredibly warm, friendly, and very knowledgeable. She was by far the best waitress we have had at any restaurant in a very long time. She knew exactly when to check on us, was very timely with drink refills and removing dirty/empty plates from the table. She was incredibly attentive without being hovering or annoying. Our food was outstanding and my daughter especially loved the caramelized onion soup. My husband was raving over his chicken and biscuits. We ordered a slice of key lime cheesecake to go and that was also very good. I made it a point to stop and tell the manager how wonderful our service was on the way out. We will definitely be back and will request to sit in her section as well."
Angela B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,8,,3.0,5/9/2017,"I usually enjoy the Cheesecake Factory but this particular location leaves a lot to be desired. I have been twice since they opened and both times I had the same problems - mixed up orders, missing side items, random people brining out single dishes and then asking who ordered it, empty drinks, and lukewarm food.  The food overall is still pretty good but the other issues make me think they need a couple months of practice before I go back."
Anthony A.,"Castaic, CA",0,5,1,2.0,12/31/2016,"First time to the SCV location.  We were seated within 20 mins for a party of 4. Food was brought out quickly except for my sons mini pizza which I'm assuming they forgot to place in the oven, which wasn't really a big deal. The surprise was when my Chicken & Shrimp  jambalaya dinner plate was missing the shrimp. ($18 plate and missing the shrimp??) Our server was notified and was apologetic for the mishap.  The manager responded to our table, apologized then made a not to funny remark regarding the missing shrimp. However, she did comp a slice of cheese cake."
Aj G.,"Palmdale, CA",0,7,3,2.0,3/4/2017,"I was so excited when this restaurant came to Valencia but since it opened, I have only been able to eat there three times due to the long wait times. Even when we have eaten here it came with an 80 min wait. There services is also slow. They need to adapt and restructure the flow according to the demand. Ending up being a disappointment for the SCV"
