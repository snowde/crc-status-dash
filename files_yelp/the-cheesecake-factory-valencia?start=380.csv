Daelin H.,"Canyon Country, CA",78,5,,2.0,12/28/2016,"I dined at this new Cheesecake Factory location about a month ago, closer to when it first opened up. The service was super slow; I've definitely experienced better. But I tried to be patient and understanding, as I realize this restaurant is fairly new and there are a handful of new waitresses/ waiters getting used to their new job (not to mention it was during the dinner rush and it was crazy busy). So I decided to give it another try and went last night in hopes that the service would have improved, as they've been open for a little bit of time now. I was so wrong. The service was even worse. We sat down and waited over 10 minutes for our waitress to even come by and even acknowledge us to take our drink order. My boyfriend and I were awkwardly looking around to try and catch an eye of one of the employees to try and hint that we had not been helped yet. Our waitress finally came and took our drink order, and about 15 minutes later, she comes by and tells us she forgot what we ordered to drink, and asked us to repeat our order! By the time our drinks actually came we had been sitting there for over 30 minutes. I understand that it was super busy and crowded, and I'm sure she was working a lot of tables, but not once did she even acknowledge or apologize for the ridiculously long wait for our drinks, or just the slow and poor service in general. My boyfriend and I sat down at around 7pm and did not leave until around 8:45pm. We had plans to see a movie at 8:25 thinking we would have more than enough time to eat and catch a movie that within walking distance of the restaurant, but we missed our movie because we were stuck there for so long due to the poor service. The food was wonderful, as always, and I loved what I ordered, but the service at this location definitely needs some improvement!"
Robert C.,"Lancaster, CA",71,19,,1.0,12/24/2016,Over the top wait times for overpriced mediocre food.  Avoid this establishment if you like good food.
Esoteric X.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,23,,1.0,12/22/2016,"Went to this location for the first time and we had a horrible experience. First, we went in the girl in the front said there is a 45 min wait, so we said okay and took the buzzer. Right when we walked outside they buzzed us in saying that there was a misunderstanding and that they have a table available right now. Second, we attempted to order 3 plates and the waiter and manager notified us that the plates we ordered are not available because they do not have the items in the kitchen.  That is the first time in my life that a restaurant has said that they are out of an item. Anyhow, we tried different items but they were cooked very very badly. This experience makes me not want to go to Cheesecake Factory anymore. They were very unprofessional and unorganized. Our waiter was not that knowledgeable either."
Isidro L.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,6,19,4.0,3/24/2017,Food is delicious but service need to improve . I went there last Friday night with friends. It took almost 40 min to wait my meal.
Liz E.,"Castaic, CA",58,20,,1.0,3/24/2017,"So second time coming here. Excited that Valencia finally decided to put one in! The food was great both times we came and loved the stuffed mushrooms!! Cheesecake, everything u hoped for and more! BUT the service? Horrible!!! Both times the servers we had were extremely rude and inconsiderate. The second time we came and were trying to order, I think we got halfway through it and she literally just walked away. My husband and I looked at each other like, what just happened? Smh. We had to wait for her return with our drinks before we could order our other appetizer like we had wanted. It doesn't seem these servers care about tips or even making an effort at all. I always felt customer service, especially in the food industry should be honored. Sad to say it seems this establishment doesn't seem to take that into consideration when hiring because the food won't be enough to have customers return. I see a to-go order in my future from here, not so much a sit down meal as I would've hoped."
Destiny C.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,3,1,2.0,12/18/2016,"So as an avid foodie. I was excited that my favorite guilty pleasure was opening a location closer to my house. There had been an hour drive to the nearest location. Well we decided to do a double date last night and I was thoroughly disappointed. From the wait which was a little near an hour, to the lackluster service our waitress gave us and then the killer HORRIBLE ENTREE. I decided to go for the Chicken Madeira/ Steak Diane combo with the steak well done. After my corn cakes to start my food arrived and the portion was not what I feel I've received at other locations but that wasn't the problem it was the rare steak I was served. After notifying the waitress she took the plate then returned with a small plate on which she had transferred my mashed potatoes and chicken then informed me that they were making my steak....I did mention this was a combo....right. The redeeming value was the manager who came table looked strangely at the small plate of food and comp'd my entree and had them remake the entire order. My biggest problem was the food and the lack of enthusiasm and knowledge shown by the service staff. I don't know if I'll be doing an evening dinner here anytime soon but I'll definitely be stopping for my salted carmel cheesecake. I hope the experience at Saddle Ranch is better."
Scott M.,"Valencia, Valencia, CA",0,8,,4.0,4/24/2017,"Food and service are what you would expect in and any Cheesecake Factory and the ambiance is on par as well.  Better leave some extra time for the wait since its still new, although I'm sure that will calm down after awhile, and the service and quality will probably come up a bit when they aren't slammed at all times of the day."
Ryan O.,"Valencia, CA",75,32,51,5.0,11/16/2016,An absolutely amazing experience with my Susan on my birthday. She had the White Chicken Chili and I had the Louisiana Pasta. The food tasted great. Our orders were perfect and our waiter was very nice. The interior and the exterior is incredible. It is such a beautiful building and blows all restaurants away in the near by area. We will be visiting here very frequently.
Elaine B.,"Castaic, CA",62,52,3,5.0,2/19/2017,I'm a sucker for this chain and it's been my favorite for years so imagine my excitement when we finally got one in SCV. I've been 3 times so far. Each time food has been executed beautifully by cooking staff. Also wait staff has been courteous and helpful. I will say that I visited the restaurant more than 3 times but on some occasions the wait was way more than an hour and we just couldn't wait that long to be seated. All in all very positive experience thus far.
Doris c.,"Valencia, CA",8,141,95,1.0,12/24/2016,Horrible horrible server Roxanna. The reason why the servers are so bad is MANAGEMENT
Tom N.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/13/2017,"For years I waited for the Cheesecake Factory to come to Santa Clarita. Well, since it finally came I have been there twice. Both experiences have been horrible. The service is incredibly slow, the food borders on uneatable, and the wait times are ridiculous. I went there last night with family from out of town. Even though it was ""happy hour"" they charged full price for drinks. My Bloody Mary tasted like my wife's water. Another person in the party had a draft beer that tasted and smelled like chemicals. Even when busy, the staff stand around in groups gossiping about who knows what. Needless to say we will never go there again."
m r.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",0,15,,1.0,1/7/2017,"So a friend and I decided to check out Happy Hour at the new Cheesecake Factory.. last week on a WEEKDAY... thinking we would get a seat no problem. WRONG. The bar was Full, EVEN AT 4pm... so we saw a TABLE that was IN the Bar ... OH! wait! You cannot SIT there.. that is REGULAR seating!.. WTHeck? seriously Oh sooo ONLY the 5 tables that sit 4 people are available and a few seats at the bar.... GOOD JOB Cheesecake Factory. Even having Happy Hour for 2 HOURS from 4-6 there is NO way we could've gotten a table or a seat for that matter. Who designed this ?! Other restaurant Bars have PLENTY of ROOM for happy hour guests. Cheesecake Factory Major Fail. We went to Lazy Dog instead .. Plenty of space and great Food. NOT IMPRESSED."
Robert G.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,4,,2.0,4/9/2017,"My wife and I dropped by from the Bakersfield area.  We try and make this a fun stop at least once a month.  For some reason today we had no knives and had to use our spoons to butter the bread (this was because our server was almost non existent or we would have asked for knives). It seemed like it took forever to get our drinks.  We ordered and it took almost 35 minutes to get our food,  and it was maybe luke warm.  I ordered the steak tacos and to my surprise they were miniature tacos,  like off a kids menu. Definitely NOT like the photograph displayed. If hungry,  DO NOT order the tacos. So,  food was not hot,  took 35 minutes to get it,  no knives and had to wait for a refill on our water.  Not a good experience at all."
Oscar C.,"Valencia, CA",3,42,20,1.0,11/27/2016,"Don't waste your time going. It's not worth the 2 hour wait. I went last night and it was a mess. Staff were not on the same page. I waited 30 minutes just to buy a cheesecake to go and was told I was in the wrong line. I was instructed by 2 staff members where the to go line was then a third told me and other people we were in the wrong end. That's total BS. When I told him I was told to stand here he just said ""sorry but line starts over there"" I will never ever go there again. I'd rather drive to the Glendale location. Rude and understaffed."
Alex G.,"Sylmar, CA",0,11,,1.0,12/16/2016,Absolutely horrible service. Flat out lied to about wait time (by triple) when I called. Ruined a plan birthday outing for which I had purchased a substantial amount in gift cards. Will be selling my gift cards at a loss rather than returning. Would leave 0 stars if possible.
Jay D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,37,3,5.0,4/7/2017,"This is a follow up on a two star review I wrote. I was contacted by Pat O'Neill, who responded to a small issue I had with my food. Thank you so much for looking into my issue and responding so quickly and going over and beyond the call of duty. I will continue to eat good food and enjoy the service provided by great employees. Thanks all!"
Maverick M.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",1,2,,1.0,2/3/2017,"70 minute wait for a table for four.  Another 20 minutes waiting for someone to take our drink order.  While waiting for a waiter to take our drink order,  someone brings a kids icecream?!?!?!.  Wow,  this has been opened  since November and still don't deliver - at a minimum - mediocre service."
D W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/12/2016,I called to place a take out order and was greeted by a very friendly host who transferred me to the bakery. The phone rang 8-10 times with no answer. I hung up called again and was helped by the host again who offered to make sure someone was in the bakery. Take out answered and put me on hold for 6 minutes. Picked up and asked for my order. Never once saying thanks for holding were really busy or sorry for the long wait. Placed my order and was never thanked by this person. She literally just hung up. Disappointed by this lack of customer service I did not even pick up the order. I'm in the service business and expect more. Bad customer service. Not many places are open late but I couldn't believe the lack of customer service. Please train people to answer the phone and put people on hold kindly and to thank customers for their order
Laura L.,"Castaic, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/31/2016,"Our first experience, it took an hour and a half to seat a party of 3, took 30 minutes once seated to get our drinks, and took another 40 minutes to get our food. Our second experience, we called the day before and had a hostess make our reservations only to find out when we got there that they do not take reservations. So we had 10 hungry people and no accommodations were made; management made no effort but to just say we can expedite it and have you seated in 3 hours. Will not be visiting the Valencia location again."
Calvin F.,"Canyon Country, Canyon Country, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/2/2017,"This my third visit to this location, the same wait 45 minutes to an hour to be seated.  Another hour to get your food, then and only then you find they really can't cook anything on the menu with any great proficiency.  They can't cook Gumbo very well, not spicy enough and served cold, like their Cream Chicken Soup, served cold.  Their cooks fall short on their ability even cook a burger right.  The managers are inept,  and seem to be there as the apology crew.  These people don't know what they are doing."
