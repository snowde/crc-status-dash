Kayla S.,"Lancaster, CA",7,17,8,1.0,4/22/2017,"It was rather mediocre. I've had better at another location. The atmosphere was nice and our server was great but the food lacked season. I ordered the Jambalaya pasta, my hubby ordered the Bacon Bacon Burger & I got sliders for my 20 month old. My  1yr old took a bite and wouldn't eat anymore he only ate fruit & fries. My husband's burger was bland & so was my pasta. I could have saved $81."
Luis F.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,2,,5.0,12/17/2017,Amazing food and amazing service! I come near atleast 3 times a month and I love the pizza and lemonade! I will be back very soon
Emily W.,"Canyon Country, Canyon Country, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/14/2017,This place is so good I come once a week and get the same meal! I always leave with Cheesecake because it is so amazing! I'll be back soon!
Keith P.,"Ventura, CA",5,15,11,2.0,8/23/2017,"Waiting is always long, but thats good, its a sign for good food. We waited for 45 mins, the hostess quoted 15 mins. Order jambalaya, shrimp scampy pasta, steak diane and hibachi. Only shrimp scampy that make a cut  (even the sauce its too thick). The jambalaya sauce is too thick to the point where you have to dig the surface to get to ingredient below (heavy on cornstarch). Hibachi steak is horrible. Both steak were heavily crusted burn in the outside even we order medium. Total dissapointment. They should hire real cook and chef to bear the name cheeaecake factory. Not coming back for a while"
Isabela F.,"Auburn Hills, MI",23,4,,5.0,12/7/2017,"This place is so good i love it so much, i come here once a month with my family and we always get desset. I will be here soon thanks for amaZing food and service!"
Helen K.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,14,1,5.0,12/31/2017,"The food was good but the service was outstanding. Brandon was our server, he was attentive and very entertaining. He is why I'm giving a 5 Star review. the chicken bellago was excellent. The chocolate shake was delicious."
Em H.,"Sun Valley, CA",203,386,151,5.0,8/9/2017,"Great place.  Cool atmosphere (though kind of cold inside), nice wait staff, and ginormous portions for the most part.  My mom's mango avocado salad with fried chicken (instead of grilled) was literallyy enough for 2 people.  The chicken strips with fries, also huge.  Everything was seriously big.  The most ""average"" sized was my honey-truffle chicken, but it was still seriously a large amount of food.  Everything was pretty tasty, also.  Located in a cute place.  I would definitely go again if I were in the area.  Fair pricing as well."
Giselle G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/24/2017,Super cool place! I live for the cheesecake!! Super family friendly! Great for children and adults. Customer friendly
Zoey W.,"Valencia, CA",63,209,554,2.0,2/25/2017,"Oh, what a difference a couple of months makes... We came back to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch today and was really disappointed at the horrendously long wait times for service and food.  We arrived right at opening (11:30 am) and there was already a line to get in.  Once we were seated, it took our server about 15 minutes to take our drink orders.  Granted, she also had a large group of 10 people to deal with, but that is when a competent manager should have taken charge. Although our server was apologetic about the long wait, that did not make the wait any more bearable.  We waited 45 minutes for our appetizer of Chicken Pot Stickers and another 20 minutes for our entrees of Miso Salmon and Steak Diane.  While the Miso Salmon was cooked perfectly, they charged an additional $2 for a ""side"" of asparagus, which consisted of four tiny thin asparagus spears.  Really??? We finally managed to get out of there at 1:10 pm.  That's 1 hour and 40 minutes for lunch!!  I can understand the long wait times if we went on a Friday or weekend, but we went on a Thursday. I think someone at the Cheesecake Factory Corporate Office needs to visit this Valencia location and audit their staffing and performance standards.  They also need to discuss this ongoing problem with the General Manager and, if needed, replace him or her with someone who is competent and knows how to manage a high-volume restaurant."
Julie C.,"Canyon Country, CA",29,3,,5.0,12/11/2017,"Had our Holiday lunch today at the cheesecake factory. We had the absolute best server I have ever had at any restaurant!! Her name is Analit O. She was fantastic! She was so nice, attentive to our needs, efficient, knew, the menu and the best service ever! Can't say enough!! We had the best time!"
Kris L.,"Palmdale, CA",0,4,,5.0,9/26/2017,"Hadn't been to this particular location before, and haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a few years. Came here for birthday dinner for our friend on Sunday evening. Wait was about 10 min for a party of 7. Server was a bit slow, but with great attitude. Food was as good as I remembered!  Had seared ahi salad, and tried my friend's bang bang chicken. Both were yummy! The hazelnut cheesecake was divine!! Can't say the same for the strawberry shortcake though.  Overall, good food, good cheesecake!"
Kathryn P.,"Castaic, CA",50,50,35,1.0,11/2/2017,Sure the cheesecake is good but the service stinks.   Went in at 5pm w my family saw plenty of empty tables but was told it would be a 10 minute wait.  That's dumb so we left.
Justin F.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2,35,,2.0,11/19/2017,"$16 salad overpriced. I had to ask for more chicken since only a few tiny pieces were located. Kids sliders were undercooked.  Kids fruit side was soaked in liquid....not appealing to look at. $61 out the door including tip for 2 adult entrees, two kid plates and 4 waters. Not worth it!"
Jessica C.,"Los Angeles, CA",58,59,270,5.0,8/16/2017,"Love this place ! The food and service at this location in fantastic. I've had an experience here where the food came out cold and the management went above and beyond to make sure I got a hot plate. They even took it off the check. But today for lunch everything was fantastic. I had the crispy herb chicken and the pear flatbread with a pina colado. Everything was perfect. The appetizer was brought out before the main course with enough time to digest, which is always nice. The main course was large and filling. I even had enough to bring home! I love the Cheesecake Factory and I will be returning. I recommend anyone in the area to try this new location!"
John S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2,27,,2.0,12/5/2017,I waited well over an hour for a take-out order. The girl at the counter lied to me twice about the waiting time. Almost no consideration was given customer service. Well below the standard of other cheesecake factories. I recommend avoiding.
Jeff C.,"Valencia, CA",26,33,2,5.0,8/10/2017,"Came here for the first time with the family and had an amazing dinner.  Brandon, our server, was AMAZING!  It was like having dinner and a comedy show at the same time.  Our drinks were all ways full, our food came quickly and we laughed throughout.   I wish we had come here sooner, we definitely will be back.  Thank you Brandon for a great night."
Samantha G.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,11,12,5.0,9/6/2017,"Every time I visit la , I come to the cheese cake factory it's only a simple explanation because the food is amazing ! I'm never disappointed ,"
Marina R.,"Simi Valley, CA",5,89,374,5.0,8/3/2017,"My go to spot, how can you go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory? Always a helpful bartender/waiter food is always fresh and delicious! The strawberry shortcake dessert is amazing and enough to feed 4 people!"
Samantha J.,"Valencia, CA",1,27,5,2.0,11/8/2017,"This location lacks customer service. Their food for 2 took almost an hour to get to us. Of course it was cold & we had to ask the first employee we saw to find our waitress. Honestly, I can't say if I'd be back especially being a local."
Javed L.,"Orange, CA",0,15,,2.0,10/25/2017,I found it impossible to get anyone to do a curbside order on Sunday afternoon. I ended up not being able to eat lunch.
