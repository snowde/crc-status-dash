Rich M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,3,1,1.0,1/29/2017,"Thsi review is really more about the curbside pickup then the food. I have currently been waiting curbside for my food for 36 minutes. I called when I arrived and then had to call 20 minutes later because nobody had come out. I finally received my food 37 minutes after getting here. They offered a free loaf of bread, which I think is free anyways. The kid who brought out the food was nice enough but this was an awful experience."
Kristine S.,"Valencia, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/12/2016,"We knew there would be a wait and we were fine with that. We waited an hour, which wasn't bad. The service was just awful. Others picked up the slack for our waitress. We still were patient knowing it's opening week. Then, two of our 4 dishes were not good. Cheesecake's standard cashew chicken had a black, over cooked sauce. We still were patient and had no complaints as they were all so busy. Then, we get the waitress to pay our bill and have now been there for 2 and a half hours now. She comes back and says the AE didn't go through so we gave her another card. This morning we checked our cards and she charged both. We went back to the Cheesecake and talked to a manager named Nicole. She wasn't concerned about the charge, quality of service or food. She just brushed us off and so that is why I am posting for the first time on yelp."
Don S.,"Canyon Country, CA",1,43,2,1.0,7/31/2017,"First experience at the Cheesecake Factory and it was not good.  We were seated and the waiter was very nice.  My wife ordered coffee which took 15 minutes to get.  After 30 minutes my sons French toast came out without his side of bacon. Then ten minutes later 2 more meals came out. Then ten minutes later 2 more meals came out.  I went and talked to the manager told him all the problems. No apology.  Sons bacon still not out.  Couldn't get syrup for the French toast which was now cold.  Other sons pancakes were cold.  My omelette was rubbery and greasy.  The waiter admitted the runners were not bringing out the food fast enough.  When finished my favorite was the busser.  He collected one plate at a time. Plates were stacked all over and he came by twice and collected one plate at a time.  Lol.  After an hour and a half we ordered 3 cheese cakes during their half off sale. So the manager took off two of the three half off cheese cakes.  I had to laugh.  They took off two cheese cakes that were already half off.  The party next to us, ordered, ate, ordered cheese cake ate it, paid and left before we got our food. Beautiful restaurant but service and food were very marginal."
Cindy S.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,8,,3.0,3/18/2017,"I have frequented this locations three times since the opening.  Sat in bar area first 2 times as we were only party of twos. Once at 4pm and once at 11:45.  I was very disappointed in the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp. Nothing Bang Bang about it.  Luke warm and I think the shrimp should have been cooked a bit more. Seemed off.  Measly portion of rice spread thinly across the oval plate to look as if the plate was full. Would never order it again.  Service was acceptable. Waiter very nice.  Another visit was just appetizers. Sliders, Vietnamese spring rolls and drinks. Great service. And apps very acceptable.  Last visit took my family for my birthday in February.  Around  5ish. Server was just ok. She wasn't as friendly as my last 2 waiters. Food was ok. Nothing out of the ballpark. I think instead of such a large menu you could minimize it and make the dishes you offer spectacular.  Fresh and hot when served.  Cheesecake by far is the best thing about the night. We ordered one Salted Carmel and one Hershey's to split amongst the 5 of us.  And as seen in other reviews my dessert (would expect one at least) to have been complementary. After spending couple hundred dollars.  (Apps, drinks (bar) and sodas, 5 entrees n dessert.   Ya would think they would want you to patronize their business for birthdays at least they could comp a dessert for the guest of honor.  Asking too much?"
Patrick L.,"Palmdale, CA",0,11,,1.0,2/10/2017,"Service was terrible, food was cold, orders were forgotten. This experience was worse than 1 star. No surprise to see some of the negative reviews for this location. Will never be back!"
Thomas S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,9,,5.0,11/12/2016,The food was delicious and our server Kendall was phenomenal. They were so incredibly busy being so new but Kendall was fantastic and treated us so well. We will definitely come back.
CJ G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,5.0,11/27/2016,"Ok, so I would've given my review 3 stars...but Brandon my server saved the day. I pre-ordered (2) Thanksgiving cheesecakes.  I went Wednesday and waited outside in line (Opens at 11:30am)  planned on eating lunch too. I asked the hostess at the door if my server could pick-up my pre-ordered cheesecakes. She said, no, I would have to wait in the bakery line and pick them up myself.  Once my son and I were seated, I then went back to the bakery and waited in line to ""pick-up"" my cheesecakes. I waited for 30+ minutes with about 5 people ahead of me. The line did not move, not one single person had received their ""pre-ordered"" cheesecakes. While waiting in the bakery line from hell, I hear someone call my name. It was Brandon my server, who had been waiting for me to return to my dining table. He was able to get my pre-ordered cheesecakes for me while I enjoyed my lunch with my son.  I would recommend asking for Brandon as your server if you dine here, he totally turned my experience around into a great one!"
Steve E.,"Santa Clarita, CA",266,8,6,1.0,11/19/2016,"We were told it would be an hour wait to be seated, literally an hour and 40 minutes later our pager buzzed. So i told the manager we were frustrated by the discrepancy between the quoted wait time and the actual time. He assured me we would have great service for the rest of our meal. Ummmm right. It's been another 15 minutes and we still haven't ordered our food. I get they are new in Santa Clarita but you would think they would have their act together better than this...we are still waiting and I expect a lot more from Cheesecake Factory. Very unhappy. It has literally been two hours of waiting. On a happy note, bread just arrived"
Kayla Q.,"Valencia, CA",0,3,,3.0,11/19/2016,"When I heard that there was going to be a cheesecake factory in valencia I was so excited!! I had to go there immediately but then the wait came in... the front desk said it would take 15 min so my family and I waited and waited. It took an hour for us to get a table, thinking it was only 15 min!! Also, While my family and I were eating we had a cup that had FULLY PIGMENTED lipstick on the rim like it wasn't even washed!! I wasn't even sure if my cup was washed or my utensils! I love cheesecake too much though, I thought I would just share my first experience."
Alex S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/30/2017,"Worst Cheescake factory I have eaten in. The servers are undertrained and subpar. Even worse all the chefs in their kitchen run around like their heads were cut off, resulting in cold, undercooked, or burnt food. After leaving very unhappy, ( food took 45 minutes to come out), I was even more pissed  to see HALF of their staff taking a ""break"" on the side of the restaurant."
roger h.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,2.0,11/26/2016,Service was good but the chicken in my jambalaya was nothing but big pieces of fat!! Troy the manager came by to say sorry in a canned answer response.. they did give me extra shrimp to make up for gross chicken
Kristi R.,"SYLMAR, CA",46,14,,2.0,1/22/2017,"Let me start by saying that I wanted to rate this 1 star but some servers and staff were so friendly, I just couldn't do it. That being said, I would have to say this is one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant. We called to see if we could make reservations being that we were a group of 24. They explained it wasn't possible and what we had to put our name 2 hours before, so we did. After waiting over 2 hours we ask for an update and the person seating at the front was rude to every one in my party that asked her. Then come to find out they had our table but she sat a party of 2 at the end of it so we had to wait till they were done. Um... Excuse me you sat a party of 2 at a table set up for 24? And then told is it would be another hour and a half (we put our name in at 5:30, got there at 7, it was now 8:40). We got a manager involved and they asked the ladies to relocate and we were finally able to be seated. They get our drinks and take our orders and food took a while to come out but it looked like a busy night so that was to be expected. Then the power goes out, so no drinks, no water to wash your hands in the restroom, and no heaters (we were seated on the patio). You could tell they were scrambling to figure it out. One odd thing is one waitress would tell us they couldn't do any drinks and then another would come out, say yes and bring them to us. We didn't get why that happened. It also started getting super cold. Luckily we had already gotten food but who wants to eat in the dark? So we're all sitting there with jackets and the flashlights on our cell phones. Then we talk to the manager and happen to have electricians in our party so they go in and fix the issue, lights come up and YEA! We saved the day. They compensated ""us"" by taking their meals off the bill but at the same time, the rest of us had to sit in the cold for I believe it was over half an hour and weren't offered anything. I even asked the server, is there going to be anything done since we've all sat in the dark for this long and they said yea that we'd just have to see what the manager said. We figured at least a free piece of cheesecake or something but nope. They said they would take off 10 line items as a thank you for ""saving the night"" which covered the checks of the few who helped out with the power situation. The rest of us paid full price and nothing was done for the inconvenience. Then, we figuring out the check took FOREVER!! I would have been better for them to set up who was going on which check when they were taking orders but they waited till people were leaving and then printed out copies and people had to circle what was theirs. I think figuring out the check took about 30-40 minutes. From beginning to end, there was issue after issue and to at the end to still pay full price for an experience like this? I would honestly not recommend this place to anyone which is unfortunate because this location would have been more convenient than going to the one in the Sherman Oaks Galleria but I'd rather make the trip."
Phill H.,"Santa Clarita, CA",21,10,,3.0,1/17/2017,"Barely a 3, went there because we love cheese cake factory but this one was not at all like other ones I've been to. Very long wait, service rudimentary and poor, I had to wave down different servers to get basic items for the meal, dinner coming was super slow, and was only average tasting. I asked for water from the waitress after I could flag her down and she said ""uhm let me check on that"" she then started to walk away and I said it's just water, then she said ok and went to get it. The place has only been open a few months so maybe growing pains, we may give it one more try, but in the Uber competitive restaurant market in scv, they better get their act together"
Margie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,28,,5.0,2/21/2017,Great as always and glad they decided to come to Santa Clarita!
Joshua C.,"Sylmar, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/15/2017,"Emily is hands down one of the best servers I've ever had, she was very knowledgable when it came to the menu and very attentive to my table, 10/10 will come back"
L S.,"Saugus, CA",2,33,9,1.0,1/14/2017,"So we thought we would try this again. Came in at 2:00 and was told it would be a 20 minute wait. It has now been an hour wait. We have asked at the hostess desk twice for an update. First answer was there is one party ahead of you. Second answer was you're next. Meanwhile we have seen a steady stream of people in and out but our buzzer didn't beep. It got so bad the people in lobby are now joking ""20 minutes"" is just a standard answer but it means nothing. So management train you're people to be truthful about the wait and don't respond to this post telling me we should tell management if there is a problem because the problem is obvious. Just stand in the lobby and you will see and hear the frustration all around."
Aly R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",197,6,,1.0,12/13/2016,Bread was super hard compared to last time and the portions here are not as big as the other cheesecakes in LA (weird because they have the same prices?) it was still very yummy and service was mediocre but understandable since it's new. Hopefully they weed out the bad and enhance it by next spring
Abbey Z.,"Valencia, CA",1,15,,1.0,1/7/2017,They really need to get their act together.  They seem like they are all overwhelmed in a busy restaurant.  They are clueless in customer service .  Did you hire everyone with NO food service experience ????   You guys really need to start over and retrain staff from point A to the finish line.
Eddie M.,"Frazier Park, CA",0,11,,5.0,1/5/2017,Great food and service. Our server was eva and she was awesome and made sure we got exactly what we wanted !
Talor T.,"Rosamond, CA",0,26,13,1.0,1/4/2017,Just went there tonight for dinner and service was awful! Ordered an avocado salad (not guacamole) which was brought to our table after waiting 50mins for a salad then waited another 15mins to receive the salad even though they had brought our other dish out and we had already finished that since we had to share and my boyfriends salad was not brought out yet . Also they re-served the guacamole that was given to us TO ANOTHER TABLE ! We even ate off of that too!!! So pretty much we understood it is still new but if your going to open at least be trained enough to know salad from guacamole ...... never going back
