Ineria S.,"Canyon Country, Canyon Country, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/7/2017,"Myself , my husband and four of our friends went to try the new Cheese Cake Factory in Santa Clarita  the wait was long but that was expected.  The service was terrible, the food was not good at all.   We asked for the manager he never came. Very disappointed.  Other cheese cake factories I have been to have been wonderful  The one in Santa Clarita was BAD  I do not recommend  The prices for what you got was also very high  The recipes need to be looked at.  I got shrimp and chicken gumbo terrible. Very upset that the manager would not even take the time to talk to us.  What does that say for the organization?"
Jeff H.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,3,,5.0,2/5/2017,"Had breakfast Sunday morning, food was great. Our server Jason was friendly, helpful and very attentive. Can't wait to come back next Sunday."
Christine S.,"Burbank, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/1/2017,"This was my first visit to the Santa Clarita Cheesecake Factory and I was very pleased.  My server Jason I was fantastic.  He was always nearby checking on me, but was not intrusive.  I was never without water or coffee.  Thank you Jason!"
Lana S.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,23,5,2.0,12/1/2016,"Went here last night around 8:30 pm for a late dinner and dessert. There were 6 of us and we had to wait 30 minutes for a table (it was kindof crowded). The first thing I noticed is that there were a LOT of workers - waitresses/waiters/busboys/bartenders, so I thought ""Great, we'll get good service."" WRONG Our first waitress couldn't seem to mentally process our orders and repeated them back incorrectly (we corrected her, of course). We had to wait 10 minutes for water and then another 10 minutes for linen napkins (when she brought them, she only gave us 5 - when we grabbed a busboy and told him we needed another, he gave us a paper cocktail napkin [really?] so we corrected him as well).  We watched about 10 workers hanging out by the order computer chatting and goofing off. While we...waited 20 minutes for our drinks; received an apology from our ""new"" waitress (they apparently changed shifts at 9:30). Drinks were good. Fried mushroom/zucchini appetizer was super salty - couldn't taste the veggies at all. Although portions of the meals were very large, they were not very tasty (this included a salad, steak [which was mostly mashed potatoes instead of steak], and club sandwich). A flatbread pizza was tiny and looked like it was cooked on saltines. So then we thought, well, at LEAST the cheesecake will be good.... WRONG. Tiny portion of cheesecake with about 1-2 cups of whipped cream. For the price, not worth it. I can't recommend this place, which is a disappointment. Maybe because it's new, but they will have to start all over again with their staff and cooks."
Peter B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,2,1.0,12/1/2016,"Love the Cheesecake Factory and their food, however the service at this one is horrible.  It took over an hour to get our food .....I know that they are new to Valencia, so hopefully this gets better!"
Miss F.,"Northridge, CA",0,27,1,5.0,12/1/2016,"Im so happy they finally opened this restaurant.  I have not had a chance to dine inside because it's hard with a baby and toddler. We have ordered take out dinner twice and the food was delicious. Cheesecake food never disappoints! As far as the wait time issue I see from previous reviews. There is always a wait time for any Cheesecake, especially at dinner time. I personally would not wait more then 1/2 hour at any restaurant."
George A.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,10,,5.0,1/21/2017,Great vibe and great cheesecake! The waiter was great and the food was okay. But the drinks were great too. Awesome spot for a weekend dinner. But wished the alcohol was happy hour price.
Michael J.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,17,,2.0,1/21/2017,"Ordered takeout for dinner and the food sat on a shelf by the window. It being the evening in the winter, my food was cold. And I was early just in case. Invest in a warming oven, guys."
Greg B.,"Valencia, CA",135,18,4,1.0,2/11/2017,"I hope corporate reads this and Yes will be calling them first thing Monday AM. 2nd time and LAST. First time wait was 2 hours and decided to bring food home. Order was not right and food was not up standards with  The CHEESE CAKE restaurants that I have been to. 2nd time waited less that 50 minutes and was fine with that. Kate was a server was great, very nice and explained the menu and was happy to hear it was out first time inside. Again I say Kate was great. She took our order and brought our wine right away. 5 minutes later she needed to go on break and introduced us to another server.( name skips me and you will know why). I was fine with this, everyone needs a great . Again thank you Kate for starting our table and being so nice. Then another persons brings up our soup and dinner at the same time, not great but lived with it. The soup was cold and there was a problem with my wife's dinner. The big reason I am writing this is the next line. NO ONE CAME BACK TO CHECK ON US AT ALL.AGAIN I SAY NO ONE CAME BACK TO SEE IF EVERYTHING WAS FINE...NEVER....It was like we were ignored. 15 minutes went by and I asked a someone  for our server. 1o minutes later found some one and asked for a manager. Spoke to Nicole after dinner who was very busy and she said sorry and seemed not caring and said In her exact words '"" I am sorry I've got alot going on in the back of the kitchen. Asked a host for another manager and Troy the Gm came out and spoke to me . He said sorry and seemed not caring either, asked for a card to call corporate. This Cheesecake factory needs to Re-train there staff and mangers and GM. The can handle a crowed restaurant and should all train. I've live in Valencia for over 30 years and eat out alot. I will not be going back and can not recommend anyone going here. I can not feel good bringing clients and guest here. Please Re-train Nicole the Manager and have Troy the GM  be a little  more caring. Please let Kate know she was a great server, but its a shame I wont be go back..Your lost... Greg"
Angela M.,"Acton, CA",0,1,,5.0,1/15/2017,"We have made 3 trips from Acton to Valencia to eat at this restaurant.  Our server has been Jason on all 3 occasions.  He did such a good job of taking care of our table we asked for him on our repeated visits.  I love the menu, food quality and exceptional service.   We will be visiting often.  Our visits have been during the week so the wait has not been too disappointing.  Angela M 1-15-17"
Wendy A.,"Arvin, CA",0,3,,3.0,12/10/2016,"The wait was 50 minutes, not surprising but the food wasn't as good as other cheese factories I've been to. I got the chicken shrimp jambalaya and it wasn't well seasoned and a bit undercooked, my mom got the Louisiana chicken pasta and hers was pretty decent"
Kathleen F.,"Lancaster, CA",0,10,,5.0,1/12/2017,"This was my first visit ever to a Cheesecake Factory. I had the Grilled Steak Medallions off the SkinnyLicious menu. It was so delicious that I scraped my plate clean! The service was most excellent, and Jason our waiter was diligent in refilling our drinks, attentive and responsive to any requests we had, and he did all this with a sense of humor but without being intrusive. For dessert I had the Salted Caramel Cheesecake. OMG! If you want to go to heaven while still being alive, this is the cheesecake to order! All in all my experience was a 10 out of 10. Excellent food and service!"
Beth H.,"Castaic, CA",0,18,7,3.0,1/3/2017,"Nice ambiance on the patio and we were seated fairly quickly for a Tuesday evening. The service was great except the one salad ordered came 5 minutes after the three burgers. The salad only had 4 small strips of chicken and did not have the macadamia nuts, peanuts, or seeds that were supposed to be on there. The three burgers were more done than expected for medium and were a bit dry. The two that were supposed to have brioche buns had regular sesame rolls. Not near as nice. Other than the food being less than expected it was a nice evening with the fam."
Jeremy L.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,7,,5.0,11/27/2016,"It's new, and it's gonna be busy for a while, and sure the small problems will be smoothed over. Went in on a Saturday night with some co workers around 11:00. Sat at the bar, justin was awesome, the steak Diane and shrimp scampi was awesome. Took some cheesecake to go; awesome as well. Thanks Justin! I'll be back soon for sure!"
Roxann P.,"Valencia, CA",20,5,,5.0,11/26/2016,The food was awesome and our server Jason was the best! He was helpful and polite. Looking forward to our next visit.
Jose G.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/26/2016,Wait really sucked. No common sense as to what to do when a table takes too long to leave. If you have a big party. Forget it. Because they will forget you. Never coming back.
Teresa C.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/18/2017,"Since this place is always pack, we decided to celebrate Father's day early and yesterday was the first time we visited this branch for Father's Day celebration and the server named Victor B came over as our server.  Although it took him a long time to come over on our table, we did not mind since we are still going through the menu selections.  It's been a long time my family had been to cheesecake factory, not familiar with the menus.  When time to order we realized that the Fetuccine Alfredo on the lunch menu does not come with Chicken so we are deliberating whether to order the full menu or lunch menu considering $3 to add chicken.  To our surprice, Victor said that if we are not ready yet he has a lot of other work to do and left.  SO INCREDIBLY RUDE!!! For a high priced and well respected food chain, we expected better service and attitude.  It's not as if we took a very long time but probably less than five minutes to discuss considering how expensive the menu selections.  All of my family members heard him said this, first time they heard someone verbally and loudly commented having a lot of work and cannot wait for us to place the order. After that statement my kids did not want to ask for anything else, afraid he will make more rude comments.  The food is ok but lost the appetite for this place. I was having second thoughts to give him a tip but realized tip is shared with other staff who probably  needed it more, gave him even more than 15% tip.  I hope the company reiterates the importance of good customer service with their staff."
Liv E.,"Castaic, CA",0,21,,2.0,4/30/2017,"Every time I leave Cheesecake Factory I wonder why I continue to bother. It was my first time at this location but my experience were the exact same as all the other times I've been to a Cheesecake Factory; crowded, long wait (on table, on getting your orders taken, on food, on more bread, water etc.), bland food, questionable service and a lot of noise. I was with a company of 7. We all waited a while for our food and when it finally came, 1 order had been forgotten/lost in translation(?). The waiter apologized and tried to explain that it was some other waiters fault. Unfortunately the order forgotten was to our 94 y/o grandfather. As for the food, it was bland at best and it seemed like the rest of my party came to the same conclusion. Our waiter was nice enough however very busy and therefore a little forgetful/neglectful. The only reason why this review gets 2 stars is because management were nice enough to give us a discount b/c of the ""forgotten dish""."
Cheyenne S.,"Lancaster, CA",0,3,,5.0,11/29/2016,Had the best experience! Everyone was so friendly. Had Sterling and Brittany as waitresses and they were so friendly and my food was cooked exactly how I wanted it. I will definitely be coming back. Nothing negative to say at all! :)
G L.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2,88,13,3.0,4/18/2017,"It has been a log time and looking forward to trying cheesecake factory.  It will be even longer till next time. Given 3 separate menu's for dinner seemed 2 to many. Yep, was tired of seeing headers of lighter, snack, small plate that . I handed back the 2 smaller menus and had to ask where are the drinks listed . Thought i would have a white wine but when the house and other wines start at 9 dollars ? I settled for a IPA  with no price mentioned . The waitress and i was referring to the novel of a menu and I  soon gave them all back and told her what i was looking for . Artichokes appetizer was not in season , but the union soup was a not listed item of the day which was good ! No wedge salad so i went for the seared tuna salad , please remember it's blackened or Cajun and the menu didn't say.I did enjoy this salad .The fried appetizer of triangle artichokes somethings were just OK, but the dipping sauce was to die for. wife ordered the chicken lettuces wrap's and she said they were good . The service was excellent ! menu's dated and too many  Oh don't forget Happy hour is at the Bar only  : ("
