Sarah H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,2.0,4/8/2017,"I wasn't sure if I should give 2 or 3 stars, but I decided on 2 as a comparison to other Cheesecake factories. The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants to indulge at when I feel like eating a ridiculous amount of calories. I've been eating at them since they opened and have been to restaurants in several states. This is the by far the worst one I've been to. I've been here 4 times and was disappointed with the food each time. The bread is usually always hard and seems like it's been sitting out for a long time. The pasta dishes have been watered down. My 2 year old loves pasta and meatballs and wouldn't even eat the pasta because it was so dry and this is at a place known for putting a ridiculous amount of sauce and flavor in the food. My husband's mashed potatoes were not mashed. There were two fist sized barely cooked potatoes inside the mashed potatoes. I've also noticed the dishes are smaller portion sizes than the other restaurants, but don't know If this is a new thing they are doing. My point is everything seems like half the effort was put in. I think they either have inexperienced chefs or chefs that hate their jobs. All joking aside, I really think their chefs need more training. The staff has always been great, but really sad that the food is not up to par with the other Cheesecake factories."
Jason M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",177,8,,2.0,11/10/2016,"I haven't had a chance to eat inside yet but my experience with the curbside take out was bad. From the time I called it took about 15 minutes for the runner to come out for my card. I waited about 30 min in total for my first attempt at picking up my order. Additionally, parking for curbside is in the Macy's parking structure and the spots are always taken. Also, when you call, get ready to scream. It's extremely loud and they can't hear you- they need to have a quiet place where their employees can take curbside orders. Long story short, my order was wrong and I didn't realize it until I got home. I called to tell them, they said it would be 30 minutes until they could have a new one for me. I was stern with them and told them I didn't want to wait a long time when I got there again. I am writing this review as I sit here. It's been at least 10 min. I get that they're new and working out kinks but somethings you just need to have worked out before you open up shop. My wife ordered out food a little before 6 and I'm about to eat my burger (8pm). I plan to dine here Saturday so I will consider changing my rating if things go well."
Addy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,2.0,12/28/2016,"Had dinner here yesterday for my sister's birthday with a party of 9. My sister's arrived first, gave our name and were told because we were a ""large"" party that the wait was about 45 minutes and that we would have to speak to a manager. Understandable and not a problem, they probably want to know what kind of table or what our options were. 15-20 minutes later and we have yet to speak to a manager. When we approached the host he stated that he had advised us of the 45 minute wait, which was not the issue. We were told to speak to a manager by their own staff and we were still waiting for that. Time passed slowly and we even saw a party of 6 get taken back before us which I'm slightly confused about. After we waited for an hour we were told our table was ready, lined up to get shown our table only to see the female hostess escort other people before us. After 5 minutes of her taking back other guests and slowly getting our menus ready we were finally taken back. From here the experience was much better. Our server was very kind and attentive and she made up for the wait time. Food was great, everyone enjoyed their varieties of orders. I did not finish my meal and another server offered to box it for me, which was very nice but I had a sandwich with a lot of fries leftover. I was excited to eat my leftovers for lunch today only to discover no fries, just my sandwich. Besides the unfriendly hosts, wait time, and lack of fries, I'll probably be back. Although not anytime soon."
Niki T.,"Canyon Country, CA",65,16,2,3.0,11/26/2016,"We decided to go to Cheesecake Factory after making a phone call and learning the wait was 20-30 mins.  We arrived no later than 10 mins later and the wait had jumped to 1 hour & 20 minutes.  Their explaination...""oh things can change in 5 mins or less"".  We said ok and took a buzzer.  The wait was shorter than that, about 25-30 mins.  We were sat at a table hardly large enough for 1 person comfortably, let alone 2.  Okay, we will make do.  After getting water, bread and our entrees we never saw another server come our way until we stopped someone for refills on water.  The entire  staff that walked by looked at our table, saw empty water cups and saw that we stopped eating, but no one came with refills and boxes until we asked.  When I ordered dessert, I guess it was too difficult for our server to handle because it was wrong.  All the servers smiled at each other, but we noticed they didn't smile at the guests.  Even the bussers walked by without acknowledgement.  Very disappointing and it's going to be a while before I go back, that's for sure."
Brittney A.,"Canyon Country, Canyon Country, CA",0,2,,2.0,3/3/2017,"You know what I looooove The Cheescake Factory but the Valencia location has turned me off. I work a few buildings away from CF and was extremely happy when they started building it. I've been there 4 times already and 3 out of the 4 occasions I was disappointed. My first time being there it was a long wait to get our food and our lunch break is only 45 minutes. But I wrote that off to it being a new restaurant. Anytime a new restaurant opens in the area the wait times are extremely long but I've learned to expect it for the first couple of months as staff learn to get it together. My second and fourth visit was where my frustration lies. I understand service being slow because its new but completely ignoring your guest is not okay. We had to flag down servers to ask who was going to wait our table. We had been sitting there for over 30 minutes without any acknowledgement. Because we were engaged in conversation the wait didnt seem so bad but once we looked at the time we couldn't believe it. And this last time we sat at the bar and we were ignored once again. We arrived at 5:34pm and sat at the end of the bar. The bartender finally approached us at about 5:54pm. We were there for the last bit of happy hour drinks but we were annoyed that we didnt even get a simple ""I'll be with you in a moment"" We almost walked out to Sisley's right before we got acknowledged. Then we had to grab the bartenders attention once again to see who we could order food from. We were brought over the wrong food items twice. We could have ate really well on someone else's dime, but were not like that! Our food didnt come for another half hour. The restaurant isnt as big as other CF locations so it frustrates me even more when the wait is so long without any acknowledgement. The front host are great though! They recognize me and my friend and always say ""hey your back!"""
Brittany D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/13/2017,"I was very disappointed with this place. I have been to a couple Cheesecake Factories prior to this experience... it took us a while to be greeted by our server and come to find out she was covering for someone on her break which would explain her negative attitude. She didn't offer us bread which is a complimentary thing. So we ordered her server suggestion appetizer and it was the ahi tar tar and it was literally hardly enough for one person to enjoy. Anyway, we order and she tells me that they're out of the chicken parm so my boyfriend picks something else. Then comes back and tells me they're out of the shrimp scampi which is what I ordered. Had we known they were out of both of what we wanted to begin with we would have gone somewhere else. However I ordered the fettuccine instead. The server wasn't aware of what they were out of which is a manager issue. So when our food comes they delivered to me a shrimp dish and called it the shrimp scampi when it clearly was not. Oh and they charge 12.50 for one cosmo. Enter at your own risk!"
