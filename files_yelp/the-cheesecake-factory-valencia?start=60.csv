Valentina R.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,30,2,4.0,11/26/2017,"We have been there twice and the food was great but the service was just OK. Had to wait for our desert, so we just decided not to have it."
Daniel E.,"Canyon Country, CA",2,36,13,5.0,8/8/2017,"Overall 5 stars. I'm giving this review on behalf of our whole table of 10 people, because even though we didn't initially have a good experience at first, the general manager came over and resolved it.  We were waiting for 45 minutes, (understandable under very busy circumstances) and some of the food was cold. The food was replaced quickly and the manager reimbursed is with some of the best cheesecake. They don't usually do that at all, but they did the right thing. Thank you! It helped make out best friends birthday more enjoyable!"
Honest A.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,31,1,3.0,11/11/2017,It's been a while since I've eaten at the cheesecake factory. The wait was pretty long but the service was great. The main dish I had was not bad but the appetizers were great. My guest ordered the shrimp platter and it was definitely not good (I had a taste) which is why she didn't eat it after a few bites. My plate was rather small and lacking in the flavor department given the price tag but it was healthy. I'd be willing to give ccf another try but definitely order something else.
Marty Y.,"Valencia, CA",5,27,24,5.0,10/30/2017,My last time here I had grilled salmon with capers and mash potatoes on the side. It was delicious! I definitely recommend to fish lovers. Of course their cheesecake is awesome!
Tiffany H.,"Calabasas, CA",171,188,366,2.0,6/5/2017,"I am SO utterly disappointed with this location! First off, I mainly had an issue with the food here. The service was not bad, but I felt like the manager could have been more accommodating.  I came here expecting to have an amazing dinner but turned out to be a bit of a disaster. We sat outside on the patio which was great. Our waitress was pretty attentive so no problems there. I ordered the four cheese pasta because that is my go-to-dish. I've never had a four cheese pasta go wrong. BOY was I wrong about that decision. The pasta got to me and was the saltiest thing I've ever eaten. Imagine ocean water in your pasta. That's what it felt like when my tongue was stinging from the salt. I normally don't like to complain because I feel bad, but I had to say something. Our server kindly apologized and asked me to choose another menu item because the sauces are all pre seasoned and made. I figured I would try the fettuccine alfredo because it wasn't a tomato based sauce. OH MAN then this dish came out earlier than the prior! It was also almost the consistency of soup. The minute I saw it sloshing around in the plate I had a bad feeling. I don't know who is testing their sauces but this was about 70% saltier than my four cheese pasta. I flagged our server over again and she asked the manager to come by. He asked me then choose one more dish and didn't really give an apparent answer to the sauce being way too salty. I ended up asking for the salmon with no salt. I was very disappointed by the manager who did less than the server to rectify the situation. She offered me a soup or salad while waiting for my food to be remade but I felt he could've really stepped up and offered us a complimentary cheesecake, or removed the dish from the bill for all our troubles and waiting around for the food to be fixed. It completely ruined the pace of our meal with me having to change three entrees. My fiancé and mother in law to be were already done with their entrees and I was still waiting on my food to be fixed without salt. I would've liked to see the manager take more initiative and come back again to make sure everything was okay. Super bummed... don't know if I would ever come back to this location again."
Cassie K.,"Canyon Country, CA",6,29,15,1.0,6/25/2017,"I just have to say, after spending $75 here for two people, the food was definitely not worth it. The only thing that is worth the money (maybe) is their cheesecakes.  This time around I had purchased to-go, instead of eating in, and the salad I got was like a quarter of the size it was last time. Why do I get less if I order to-go? That does not make sense to me.  The crab bites were also very small and only came with a few. And my boyfriend got the BBQ burger, which he said was ok for the price, and he was also super upset to find a hair in his fries.  I do not think I will be returning here any time soon. It was definitely not worth the money. I thought the Cheesecake Factory was supposed to be so much better than this!"
Adrian P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,,1.0,11/17/2017,"It's very easy for me to write bad reviews because I have been in the restaurant industry for 15 years. I am currently 31. I've done everything from busing tables, hosting, bartending, Sous chef etc. that being said, let's get started Is the wait staff here having pre shift meetings? If so, why are your servers telling your customers that they indeed do have certain menu items when 30 min later we are told they no longer have the ingredients? We ordered some flat bread with sausage that they had on their menu when they first opened. The server assured us that they could still make it. Great! He came back 15 min later to tell us it would taste slightly different because they don't have all the ingredients. 30 min later he told us they no longer have any of the ingredients to make the flat bread. Don't let your servers sell something that isn't available. You will avoid upsets like this one my family and I had to go through.  I asked our server how long he had worked at this Cheesecake Factory. He said since they opened. Great. I asked him to recommend something to me. He recommended the habachi steak with wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. Let me tell you something about this dish or two or three or four or 5.  Ho wow. Salty as the Black Sea. That sauce on the steak was way over reduced. I ordered the steak medium. It was far from it. Well done and burnt and dry. The wasabi mashed potatoes tasted like regular potatoes. When I told our server he said he would get me new potatoes. He came back with wasabi butter and told me that it's what they put in the potatoes. Wonderful. Maybe your chef should taste everything going out of his kitchen so that I or anyone else doesn't have to get a side of wasabi butter and make their own wasabi mashed potatoes.  I really didn't want to come eat here but it was my sister in laws birthday. The reason why I didn't want to eat here is because the last time I came to eat here was with my wife and her 85 year old grandmother who had to wait over 2 hrs for our meal. They said they couldn't find the order 3 times. That brigade system seems to be keeping Cheesecake Factory at 3 stars at any location.  The worst part of all of this people is that nothing was offered to be compensated. Having worked at multiple restaurants I have always taken pride in any position I had. I can tell you that if there was ever a complaint the mangers would take care of a bill especially if you had to wait over 2 hours to get food. It's a nice environment but servers lack of knowledge, slow service, and under seasoned/over seasoned food shows lack of leadership from the executive chef and the GM. It's that food that screams to me ""I don't give a damn about you"" kinda food."
Danielle G.,"Valencia, CA",446,662,275,3.0,11/29/2016,"They are definitely still working out their kinks. In the land of chain restaurants, I've always wondered why a Cheesecake factory didn't come to SCV sooner. They have a prime location  within Valencia Town Center and have a popular following so I think they will stick around for some time. Compared to other Cheesecake locations, this one is relatively small inside, and they tried to make up for it with the patio area. Long wait times are going to be a given for the next few months here.  We came late on a week night and were able to snag a seat at the bar. Shout out to our bartender that night (should've gotten her name) because she was holding it down for the entire bar.  If you've been to other locations, you know to expect large portions and a diverse menu. It is the same here. Our flatbread was good. Our drinks were made well.  A couple of hiccups we observed:  -Tell me why it took the longest time to just get some bread.  -The party next to us complained about the wait time on their food and then one of the dishes came out completely wrong.  ...like I said, they are working out the kinks. Since we were sitting at the bar, we observed the bartenders and servers, and we could see they were definitely trying their best. I may stop by for some takeout cheesecake, but I'll probably avoid dining here unless it happens to be non-peak hours/days. In any case, welcome to Awesometown, Cheesecake Factory!"
Lucky U.,"Lancaster, CA",101,19,2,5.0,7/27/2017,"I ordered the green spearmint tea with the tomato basil pasta.  It was delicious!  Restroom was clean and the staff was excellent, our waiters name was Derek.  My family had a great dinner.  Thank you."
Guadalupe L.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,4,,5.0,8/5/2017,Welcome to SCV! For the people who have never been to the Cheesecake Factory ... well it is great and can't go wrong with all the options you have! The wait will be long as allllllll the locations in Southern California are! I am pleased with the quality and space compared to the others in Los Angeles! The complimentary bread and butter yes please! Cheesecakes yummy!  If you don't want to wait call ahead and order your food to go! I always order my Lunch To go and have never had a an issue! Plus the lunch portions are huge!
Aubrie M.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,6,2,5.0,11/15/2017,"Had a wonderful time here for my Dad's birthday. Our server, Brandon, was hilarious and really made the meal enjoyable. Once again, the Cheesecake was amazing! I highly recommend the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake."
Suzanne A.,"Deer Park, NY",34,1,,5.0,10/15/2017,Brandon was an amazing waiter he was quick and had a great personality and the food was amazing
James H.,"Valencia, CA",38,61,,1.0,5/28/2017,"The food is fine, the cheesecake is good, but wow the service. 1 hour after ordering, my enchiladas arrived, you know the things most restaurants kick out in 10 minutes. They were decent, ate them in 5 minutes, have had better elsewhere. About another 30 minutes of downtime waiting for the server to stop by so we could ask for refills and some cheesecake, and another 15 minutes for the cheesecake to arrive (it was the only good part of the ""experience""). I recommend you come for the cheesecake and take it home. That would probably be a 5-star experience."
Thomas J.,"Santa Clarita, CA",23,16,1,4.0,8/13/2017,"Had Sunday brunch and the food was as expected, but the service was excellent. A special mention for Lauren our server was exceptional making sure we did not need anything. The wait time was reasonable on a Sunday morning and would recommend anytime"
Harry M.,"Newhall, CA",25,43,72,4.0,11/23/2016,"This location just opened, and they are really busy now. They open at 11:30 a.m. For lunch during the week and there is a line of people waiting to get in every day. I went to order some take-out food today. While I was waiting in line, I noticed the bar was empty. I asked one of the workers if they serve lunch at the bar... *yess* no wait! I ordered Bang Bang Chicken. I believe you can also get this dish prepared with shrimp. I have had this dish at the San Francisco, California location. They cut up pieces of chicken,  mix in curry sauce, and put in sliced carrots, and green peas. In the middle of the plate is a mound of rice. You can choose from white or brown rice. Every cheesecake factory has like 250 menu items, so everybody should be able to find something they like on the menu. When you look at the menu, you will see pizza, sandwiches, hamburgers, salads, soups, asian dishes, fish items...  That's a tall order for most restaurants. But that is the Cheesecake factory secret sauce - somehow they manage to satisfy their customers. They open for brunch at 10:00 a.m. On Sunday."
Shannon L.,"Downtown Berkeley, Berkeley, CA",325,265,357,3.0,12/27/2016,"I came here on an off hour (3 pm) with my family and was able to be seated right away on the heated patio.  It was nice and cozy there so I'd suggest sitting there if there's a longer wait for indoor seating.   I had major regrets getting the Chinese Chicken Salad after seeing and tasting my brother's wonderful Smokehouse BBQ Burger.  Just go for the burger... the salad was pretty meh.  We also got the Eggroll Sampler.  It was tasty, but expensive ($13 for only 4 eggrolls).   To top things off, we got the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake and the Oreo Cheesecake.  My favorite is definitely the strawberry because it isn't as ridiculously sweet. Overall, it was a nice meal and service was fine.  I've been to other Cheesecake Factories and this one didn't seem any better or worse than the others."
Lola S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,136,7,1.0,9/16/2017,"Also don't like that they put the clean silverwear on the dirty tables. I see employees wiping the seats where people's butts go, then wipe the tables with the same rag, then they put the clean silverwear on the tables. Don't put the clean forks and stuff on the dirty tables without a napkin underneath! Nasty!"
Andre M.,"Canyon Country, Canyon Country, CA",0,2,,5.0,10/8/2017,"The family and I enjoy the Factory! Our server was Brandon. He lightens the mood by responding with ""No"" to resonable request. Good when an individual acts as though they get some degree of joy in their job. Dont let Cali change you Boss!!! God bless!!!"
Josh R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",119,52,4,3.0,9/9/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory.  I have never, ever had even a slightly negative experience at any location.  I don't go very often because they don't take reservations, but when I get a chance to eat there, I know I can always count on phenomenal food. I'm so disappointed to say, that after working so hard to get one in our town, I have never been more disappointed with the food in any restaurant in this town.  I sent a text to my brother right after I ordered my appetizer, so I had a time stamp.  15 minutes later I ordered my entrée.  I normally get the 4 cheese pasta, but I was craving a steak so I ordered a ribeye.  The manager came out and apologized that something went wrong with their entire batch of mashed potatoes, so I told him that I'm happy to eat French fries instead.  Then 30 minutes in we also put our dessert order in.  Soon after I received my ribeye, but no appetizer.  I asked about the appetizer and was trying to decide if I even wanted it at this point.  They said they would take my steak and put it back under the heat lamp as opposed to offering to make me a new one like a high end restaurant would have.  I'm so glad I kept the appetizer because it really was good.  Then they brought me the steak back out, but without the ketchup I ordered for the fries and without a knife to cut the steak.  Eventually I got both.  The fries were cold and the steak was very similar to cardboard.  Our server was great and kept trying to make it better.  He immediately replaced my cold fries with hot soggy fries.  Saw that I couldn't take a bite of the steak without gagging so he offered to replace it as well.  I didn't want to be a complainer, so I just had him take it away.  Finally I agreed to order my usual, the 4 cheese pasta, because it is so consistent.  In the meantime our dessert got there and it was pretty good.  Then my pasta got there several minutes later.  It was like tomato soup because there was so much sauce and the noodles were so overcooked, they were like mush.  I was embarrassed that I had complained, so I really wanted to just pay and leave, so I could go get dinner somewhere.   To be honest it was a 1 star experience at most.  I gave another star because our server was so good and the manager was also so polite and helpful during a terrible dining experience.  The 3rd star is because they did make it as right as they could.  I wasn't charged for the appetizer that took nearly 40 minutes to come out, or either of my terrible entrées.  Other than that, I'm going to give them at least a year before I return to give it a second try, if I ever go to any Cheesecake Factory again.  If such a phenomenal company would let their kitchen be so undertrained and mismanaged, it makes me wonder if the other locations have lowered their standards as well. Honestly the mixture of different foods in a random order has left me sick to my stomach."
Jason V.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,11,1,3.0,10/28/2017,"Went with a group of 12 and waited an hours to be seated. They don't take reservations, not even for large groups.  Waitress was nice enough but we had to catch her in order to get refills on drinks. I ordered the guacamole salad and got a small scoop of guacamole on top. Why call it a guacamole salad if it does not have much on it.  They forgot to add the chicken I ordered so I waited. Then I noticed that there was no dressing or very little dressing. I could not tell. Of course we ordered cheesecake and the new celebration one was very good. Overall the wait time, the lack of attention with refills, lack of flavor on the dressing and the prices makes this not a place I will hurry back to visit. I might go and order a cheesecake piece to go."
