Silvia D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",57,154,142,3.0,11/13/2016,"THE SITUATION: 2 stars Just opened on Wednesday...not even a week ago...and already out of wings (both traditional bone in and boneless, so we were offered chicken strips with the buffalo sauce as an alternative-GROSS)....on a SATURDAY NIGHT! How?!?!?  The service: 4.5 stars Liz was our server and she was great! The water and bread took a bit longer than usual to come out, but in her defense, it was super busy. THE FOOD:??? Well...I'd be able to better rate them if they actually HAD what I wanted to ordered. The first strike, they were out of bone in buffalo wings. Strike two; out of boneless buffalo wings ( hence, the offering of chicken strips with sauce). Strike 3; THE RASPBERRY CHEESECAKE WAS TOO FROZEN TO SERVE!!!!! My dear friends...Let's get it together...sigh. In conclusion: STRIKE OUT! The only nice thing was the manager was nice enough to comp me a free cheesecake of my choice... PARKING: Got there at about 9:30 p.m  so it was busy. This place is located in an outdoor shopping center connected to a mall so it is always busy.   Suggestions:  The wait time is pretty long so don't wait to go until you're already super hungry. We waited an hour! THREE stars for my first trip, BUT I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK to give this place another try."
Carey-Ann L.,"Lancaster, CA",6,18,64,5.0,10/1/2017,Brandon was our waiter & he was the  ! Took very good care of our group! Thank u so much!
Bree K.,"Santa Clarita, CA",11,61,10,4.0,11/28/2016,"Came to this location while it was busy twice since opening and there was no wait both times.  The first time Samuel was our server. He was very friendly and attentive. The food took a while to come out but it was expected for all the tables.  The second time Tyna took care of us. She was super friendly and helpful throughout our meal.  The avocado toast and grilled salmon were delicious! My mom loved her gumbo as well.  Removing a star because the Herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus had a very bitter, unpleasant sauce at the bottom of the plate that the Glendale location does not have."
Nicole T.,"Canyon Country, CA",48,7,1,1.0,11/5/2017,My husband and I love going to the Cheese and Factory in Sherman Oaks but Valencia needs some help! They could learn a few things from the Sherman Oaks location. Super disappointed in the atmosphere and service. The music was so loud my husband and I felt like we were in a club. The service was horrible. At least our waiter was. We won't be going back.
Esmeralda R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",90,2,,5.0,9/20/2017,"Brandon (H) was the greatest! Professional, kind, funny, and fast. Food was amazing. I had the chicken piccata."
William M.,"Tujunga, CA",113,10,2,4.0,9/21/2017,"Attention vegetarians, vegans and salad lovers! The Vegan Cobb salad at the Cheesecake Factory is fantastic and very consistent. Give it a whirl.  We were there at 9pm Wednesday Night. Our waiter Brandon was pretty over-the-top including his fabulous spoon trick which I'm sure he will demonstrate. We will be back. I would have given five stars, had it not been for the very loud busboy next to my table complaining loudly to his coworkers throughout the dinner."
Katelyn L.,"Glendale, CA",5,6,2,5.0,9/20/2017,Brandon was fantastic! He was very personable and went above and beyond with his service. He was super attentive and had great suggestions for the entres and dessert. Definitely made our anniversary all the more fun and enjoyable!
Desiree C.,"Canyon Country, CA",1,24,,1.0,9/11/2017,"I'm extremely disappointed with the cheesecake factory. I went to dinner on Friday evening and after we were seated the server got lost or something cuz after our drinks she got lost. Then she finally comes back and takes our order after over an order I ask an other server if I can have my salad and she says I'm sorry we never took ur order . I said yes the other server did if she didn't how did we get our appetizer . She said let me send the manager over I'm sorry , he comes over very nonchalant and says there was a mix up sorry ill see what we can do to rush this. I can give u a free dessert for waiting . he was so smug like it wasn't a big deal at all that we had been waiting over an hour . he didn't offer to take off our appetizer or anything else ... Not a good way to keep customers . I won't go back and I will encourage other to go else where ."
angela P.,"Newhall, CA",27,21,,1.0,1/4/2018,"Okay so no matter what I post it will probabally not affect Cheesecake factory, especially since santa clarita is hurting for good restaurants... But here goes.... Service was beyond terrible...We had ""Carlos"" as our server he was so rude. I actually had to put him on check and tell him whats the deal???After that he at least lost his cocky little attitude after I asked if we could please change servers. He said ""No""...What could I do???It was my daughters birthday...Any other occasion I would have insisted with the manager, but I had to just deal with this guy for the sake of my daughters occasion. He was slow as heck and just totally rude! Food was Cheesecake factory, but if your looking for good service...You won't get it here... This location has hired people who don't have a clue about service. Wait was 45 min. dining from time of sit down to receiving our bill was 2 1/2 hours...In that time, he never came to check on us to ask how our food was. Never got that extra dressing I could have used on my extremely dry salad etc, etc. We just wanted to get out of there by the time we got our bill...Terrible service. If you get ""Carlos"" as your server...Don't walk away....Run!"
Ivan P.,"Valencia, CA",45,102,4,3.0,4/19/2017,"Hey! A Cheesecake Factory opened near us in Valencia... I wonder why they never had one in this town sooner... It seems like it's such a perfect fit for this town... Yet we got a Tilted Kilt before...  It's Cheesecake Factory. You've been to one before. They have a novel for a menu and tons of cheesecakes (SURPRISE!). Their food is actually good compared to other chain restaurants, but the prices are slightly higher.  Yes, the wait is long at times... It's Cheesecake Factory. You're going to wait 1+ hours to get seated at peak hours. Deal with it. I've come at this location twice since they opened. First time, we came at around dinner time and waited over an hour to be seated. No complaints... We just window-shopped all around the stores near the place. The second time we went, we came at around 11am on Saturday and there was no wait. So yes, plan ahead and know that you will wait during peak hours (common sense).  Yes, the lighting sucks at night. Most restaurants have crap lighting. Why? It camouflages the food when it gets served to you. Is it a trick? Yep. Does it bother you? Come here during the day when there's natural light coming through the gigantic windows or bring a flash light.  The service was normal. Friendly staff and the service was quick the two times we came here. It's your run of the mill Cheesecake Factory. No more, no less."
Kasey L.,"Santa Clarita, CA",320,4,1,1.0,9/3/2017,"I'll start this by saying I am soooo disappointed. I LOVED Cheesecake Factory until this visit. I came here for my friends 21st birthday with a few other friends, 7 of us total. I get it was busy and there are a few of us, I'm a server myself so I understand how it goes. I've never had bad service like this before. Hear me out. The server that originally greeted us was short and rude, she asked us if we were splitting checks and how we were doing so, we explained we would be splitting it a couple of ways then she passed us over to another server with a small introduction. We had another friend join us which we had notified the server of prior. The first server explained rudely that we messed up her rotation for splitting the checks. OK? I would never tell a table that by adding another guest, they messed up ""my rotation"" I wouldn't make them feel bad for celebrating a birthday. Anyways. Our food came out but half of it was cold and didn't taste good. One of the girls asked for the pasta taken off the bill because she didn't like it. She didn't even touch it because it was so cold. The new server stated she would get a manager to come over. To be fair, the new server was very sweet. The birthday girl ordered a fried appetizer and the server mentioned the fryer wasn't frying but other people had gotten their fried apps at our table so she said she'd check. Never updated us, just brought out the app way later. We continued to wait. Drinks were hardly refilled and our server came out to us maybe two times total, we waited SO long for everything. Like I said, I get it's busy but come on. Luckily Lauren and Justin, two servers that weren't ours stepped in to take care of us. Saving grace. The server advised she didn't know how we split the check when she finally came back out so we shrugged it off and explained; no problem. The friend that needed the pasta taken off the bill saw that it was still on the bill, the manager had never come out. The server explains he'll come out and leaves. He comes out way later and simply says, ""what's up?"" Like.. what's up? Seriously? My friend explains the situation, he says he took it off the bill and leaves. He seemed peeved and clearly did not care. We had to flag down so many other people to help us, it was literally upsetting. All our silverware was dirty and we never got to order more drinks. I ordered a piece of cheesecake and didn't receive it until way later. We've been here since 7pm and now it's 10:05pm because of how long everything has been taking. Very sad that my friend's 21st birthday was spent at a restaurant that couldn't care less about servicing us. UPDATE: My friend that had the pasta issue asked for a different manager to explain the situation, the same manager came out and shrugged her off again. Told her ""okay we'll try to do better next time"" had to add that in because I just can't believe it."
Kathleen C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",51,4,7,1.0,9/9/2017,So bad. Stale chips. Long wait. Terrible food. My friend took home a piece of cheesecake. He called me the next day and said it had a long hair attached to it. My first and last visit. Never again.
Sarah H.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,32,,1.0,3/28/2017,I was super excited that this was opening in our town. Unfortunately I think they need to close for awhile to get themselves organized then reopen when they have their stuff together.  30 min wait turned into a hour then when we finally were called we waited another 10 min in a crowded area with other angry customers. You need a better system!!! After we were seated we ordered I drinks and mine took 10 min to get annoying !!! Food was good the put the wrong dressing on my salad but she made up for that. Took so long to get a refill and my boyfriend pasta was cold and they gave him the lunch size portion instead of dinner. I really hope you work on these issues cause we do really like eating there  The manager later has reached out to us and made us feel better about coming back and trying them again  Even though the manager tried the service is horrible along with the take out window being very slow. I am thinking the need better management very frustrating. I will be driving a extra 20 min to go to the one further away l
Jessica Hazel A.,"Newhall, CA",53,32,65,5.0,6/5/2017,"Came during happy hour on a Monday, not a lot of people, so really enjoyed my time there. Got about 4 HH appetizers and they were absolutely delicious!  Can't beat the portion size and the deal of their happy hour! Loved it!"
Mary S.,"Yuma, AZ",27,55,31,3.0,4/19/2017,"Nice interior, but the food wasn't worth the money!  It seemed quite average and I have to say my pasta was super greasy... :(  But I have to say, their drinks are pretty amazing! So I give them 3 stars for interior and tasty cocktails...  The food... nah, not that remarkable - sorry!"
Ji K.,"Valencia, CA",2,39,77,3.0,12/15/2016,"Went for lunch on a weekday and was told there was a 40 minute wait. I don't mind waiting, but the fact that the line was closer to an hour fifteen irked me a bit. Family went inside, floor under the table was incredibly dirty (my sole felt weird, so I looked and saw a glob of something on it). Didn't have any problem with the service, food came out in a timely fashion. We got avocado egg rolls (which I learned today can be requested to be a lunch portion), bistro shrimp pasta, and Cajun jambalaya pasta. The avocado egg rolls were AMAZING, from the sauce to the warm crunchiness.  ...the pasta? Er-- bland. The bistro shrimp just tasted like noodles that were pathetically under seasoned. Cajun was better, but that one was lacking flavor as well. Personally just ate the top half because mixing the entire thing would have just made the flavor weaker. I would DEFINITELY return for more avocado rolls and try out the avocado toast. Would pass on the pasta."
Lucy R.,"Pacoima, Los Angeles, CA",3,2,,5.0,10/11/2017,"Tyna was our server tonight, she was very attentive and made sure our drinks never ran low. The food was great, and the staff was very nice and friendly. I was happy to see that they had a good selection of food that was gluten free, and the menu clearly stated what was GF and what wasn't."
Missi H.,"CA, CA",121,71,15,3.0,5/25/2017,"I've always been a big fan of CF, but the restaurant in Santa Clarita has taken quite a few hits on wait times and service. I've noticed during the lunch hour, that the attentiveness is better when the place is quieter; however, I have had to grab other passing servers to get refills, to-go bags, etc.  It's not so inconvenient that I won't go back, but I have to say the most disappointing thing about CF is their menu changes. Some of my old favorites are gone, including some of the cheesecakes."
Geoffrey E.,"Santa Clarita, CA",340,17,,4.0,4/16/2017,So  contrary to all the negative bs mixed reviews we actually had a delightful experience.  Initially gun shy  about making reservations for our large party we still wanted to give them a shot.   Delightfully  surprised that they accommodated all 17  of us  promptly and had our tables ready  for us when we arrived.   We had multiple servers  monitor our waters and special requests.   Bread was always restocked too!   Aside from a few minor mishaps on our meals (missing bacon) of which they quickly rectified - we all were well taken care of!  Maybe we'll be frequenting this location more often as service seems to have really improved.
Yitong L.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,4,5,1.0,3/11/2017,"Fufufufu....  Noice noice So, I got my pasta. The shrimp with angle hair one. And I had a bite , then decided to kill myself a bit earlier than planned.  Ok, I have never consumed so much salt in one freaking meal in my entire life. So that was nice.  Then I tried my sister's pizza, and I think we're just gonna commit double suicide.  ""Woah, that was salt. "" Then we tried our mom's meal, and I think u won't be able to see us in town ever in the future.  Now whenever I looked at the table, everything looks like a chunk of salt instead of actually food.  I just wanna ask one question:"" did the chef, simply dip our food into freaking Dead Sea and then bring them to our table????(that explains why it took so long.)"" Our mom ordered brown rice and of course she got white rice.  We didn't finish our meal. And we were like:"" Hey this place probably has nice cheesecake!"" So we got some cheesecakes and those were bomb.  Too sweet, so we ordered coffee.  I wanna say ""Thank you"" to Cheesecake Factory for giving me the chance to try a cup of room-temperature coffee!! That was great! It didn't take long for my coffee to get as cold as my soul.  So that was nice. And yeah I'm gonna go kill myself.  ((((Drinks were nice btw"
