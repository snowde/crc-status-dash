Jenn H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",1,32,88,5.0,12/26/2017,Love this place.   We came here Christmas Eve.  We ordered the warm crab and artichoke dip appetizer which came with baked sourdough bread. Delish.  For dessert we ordered a slice of strawberry cheesecake. Yummy!!
Scott D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",5,5,15,3.0,12/19/2017,"Well my wife and I love to come here and chill. Everyone knows their menu is fantastic, and we always get extra cheesecake to take home. But don't come here expecting quick or ""the best"" service when during any of their busy times.  I'm actually pretty irritated that the last two times I've wanted food from them, I've had to wait more than 10 minutes on hold to place a pick up order. I figured I'd do a small, two-item to go order, and give plenty of time before getting there. And then on top of the long hold, I still waited another 20 minutes for my meal after getting there. ...that was the last time I placed a pick up order. Today I figured I'd give it a try again, and after being on the long hold while driving from work, I'm told it'll be another 25 mins for my to go appetizer and that they don't have the avocado for it.  So today I didn't even place the order. I don't hate them or anything. I just wish they were better staffed. The food is still awesome. The service we get from the servers when we do go in is always decent/good at least. But I just don't make a habit out of this place because I don't have the time most days to wait for their overall service. My wife and I will only go in if we have a night to ourselves and a couple hours to spend."
Alecia D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,4.0,12/18/2017,"I have been to the Town Center location several times and while the food is consistently good I have had several issues with seating.  During my most previous visit we had a large group as well as a high chair and were seated at a booth.  Due to safety concerns with a high chair being in the aisle I requested we be moved to a seating with chairs.  After speaking with a manager we were able to be accommodated with this request.  Our server, Amanda R, was fantastic and the food came out exactly as ordered.   My only recommendation is that the host/hostess inform guests that a booth is possible even when the party includes a high chair."
Melanie C.,"Norfolk, VA",206,159,366,4.0,12/15/2017,"Birthday celebration at The Cheesecake Factory was a success! I have been to this particular location on numerous occasions with no issues. The food always tastes delicious and the service is usually pretty good.  My husband and I stopped in on a Tuesday night around 6ish. It was not very busy, so we were seated immediately. If you visit this location over the weekend, plan to have a wait. It can get VERY busy Friday & Saturday night.  We were greeted by our waiter and bread was served not too long after (I love the brown bread-it's so soft & yummy). I decided to order the Chicken Taquitos (2 full size taquitos cut in half) off of their ""small plate"" menu and they were delicious! They were light & crispy.  For my entree, I ordered the Santa Fe salad. I'm not usually a huge fan of salads, but this one gets me every time! The mix of grilled chicken, black beans, and lime is a fantastic combo. The salad is very filling and I usually end up taking half of it home.  For dessert, my husband and I split the S'mores Galore cheesecake. If you are a fan of melted marshmallow and rich chocolate (like me!), then this is the choice for you!  The only issue we had during our visit was the disappearance of our waiter towards the end of the meal. We had to ask several other wait staff for boxes and refills of our drinks. Other than that, we had no issues!"
Tyler M.,"Norfolk, VA",276,182,610,4.0,12/6/2017,"WARNING: The lighting in The Cheesecake Factory does not make for good pictures, so this is more of a ""put your phone away and enjoy real conversation"" type of restaurant (something we should all do more often). My wife and I always visit The Cheesecake Factory on special occasions, and this visit was no exception. It was my wife's birthday and we were looking forward to the visit all week! We were NOT disappointed. It was a Tuesday night around 6pm, and we were immediately seated when we walked in. There's usually a long wait, so this was a pleasant surprise. We ordered the Chicken Taquitos appetizer and were not let down. From the presentation on the plate to the taste, they were a hit with us. They were crunchy, yet soft on the inside. The green sauce drizzled over the top made for a unique spin on your regular taquito. For my entrée, I ordered the Orange Chicken with Brown Rice and Mixed Vegetables. You can choose white or brown rice, and I definitely should have chosen white. The brown was a bit dry and wasn't cooked too well in my opinion. The chicken was AMAZING. The orange was not overpowering, and the white meat chicken was very tender with a light crunch on the outside. The vegetables consisted of sugar snap peas and small strings of carrot (?), which proved to be less of a side and more of a small treat. We finished up our night with the Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore cheesecake to share (which we barely ate half of since we were so stuffed from our entrées). It tasted amazing! I highly recommend giving it a try. The melted marshmallow on top made it for me. Our waiter was great at first, and a bit preoccupied when we were trying to order cheesecake and ask for the check. I wish he was a bit more attentive, but it did seem like he had a lot of tables. Other than that, our experience was a great one!"
Shameika H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",444,88,120,5.0,1/7/2018,"I haven't gone to Cheesecake Factory in YEAAAAARS, however we went because my family was gifted a gift card. We walked in and we were greeted as soon as we walked in. We were placed at a booth and our waiter was great. We ended up coming in on a random Tuesday in the evening and it was not crowded. My family celebrated a birthday and the waitstaff sang to us. They had great energy. The food was great also. We tried things we never heard of and we were amazed at the Chicken Parm Pizza. We will be back."
Marilyn S.,"Chesapeake, VA",48,74,299,4.0,11/7/2017,"My colleague and I decided to go here for a business meeting. One of the things I like about The Cheesecake Factory (in addition to the yummy desserts) is that the menu offers a lot of options. I'm currently not eating any gluten, soy, dairy or sugar but I managed to find something that met my dietary restrictions. I had the super antioxidant salad with grilled chicken. This salad was full of yummy goodness- lettuce, spinach, kale, blueberries, almonds, grapes, broccoli, roasted pears. Although I didn't see many pears. The salad was delicious without any dressing. I also ordered a side of fries which I never received but totally forgot about it.  I love that this restaurant also has a skinnylicious menu which offers menu options on the lighter side. Don't worry, if you don't like cheesecake (who doesn't like cheesecake?!), they offer other types of desserts."
Meredith S.,"Norfolk, VA",126,162,377,4.0,10/28/2017,"Met some friends here for lunch last week and luckily, it was not crowded. This place can get packed at night. It's a beautiful space, though it can get loud when crowded.  Warning - the menu here is HUGE. And by huge, I mean extensive. Seriously, you could spend an hour trying to decide. I wish they had more lunch size choices and more than one soup a day, though. With a menu that size, you'd think they would do more than one soup choice.  I ordered the bacon bacon burger with a side salad (blue cheese dressing, of course!).  My companions had a chicken pasta Alfredo dish, a regular burger and one of the salads (wish I could remember the name - it was beautiful!). My burger was cooked perfectly mid-rare, as ordered, as was my compainion's. I loved the two different types of bacon on top. The salad (while small - mostly just greens and a tomato) was tossed in the dressing. It was a very nice blue cheese. I would order it on the side next time. My friend with the pasta dish LOVED it, though it was huge, so guess what she took home for dinner! All in all, a very nice lunch experience and I will be back (as long as it isn't jam packed)."
Kym B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",55,68,83,5.0,10/10/2017,"My server was Brandy. Really nice, friendly, made great eye contact and a good personality! Very attentive to our needs. Brought bread out right away, always aware of her table. My food was served in a prompt manner, nice temperature and it was delicious! I suggest the Chicken Piccata on the lunch menu $ 12.95. I asked for extra sauce on the side. This came out quickly, made the meal even more good! Also suggest the fish and chips $13.95. I will definitely be back. After paying she also asked if we would like refills to go. Nice!  I hope I get Brandy- I liked her : )"
James H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",67,37,138,4.0,12/19/2017,"Had a great time in the ""bat cave"" !!  Didn't really see what I ordered, but it was amazing!  It is girly's birthday!  I got the Chicken Madeira and Bang Bang Chicken and Rice.  Everything was super delicious and the service was amazing.  I haven't been in years, probably because it's a tad pricey, but girly gets what girly wants to eat on her big day! HA."
Jennifer C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",72,53,94,3.0,10/27/2017,"Maybe it was just the night I went but I used to love Cheesecake Factory food. It also looked so appealing to eat and tasted amazing. Tonight, the food was okay. Maybe had too much expectation. Had the Chicken Madeira and it wasn't the greatest. But the cheesecake was amazing as always! Yum!"
Mystery H.,"Henrico, VA",1,8,6,5.0,11/11/2017,Had heard a lot about the place and it lives up to its expectations. Great food and excellent service.The staff was very courteous and gave recommendations that I loved. I highly recommend this place to all.  Food 5+ Service 5( out of the world) Ambience 5+
Tokunbo A.,"Chesapeake, VA",133,103,245,2.0,10/8/2017,We had a terrible experience during a friend's birthday at the Cheesecake Factory. The greeter gave us a wait time.. we waited double that!! It was a big party and most people had a problem with their food.  The one positive was the Cheesecake... it was amazing as always
Barbara W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",139,123,234,2.0,6/29/2017,"I cannot seem to win here at the Cheesecake Factory. I've been waiting to write a review because everyone I know seems to love it and I keep giving chances. Needless to say every time I have come there's an issue with the food. Issues are either overcooked, under cooked, not what I ordered and the list goes on. Last night I decided to try their Chicken Pot Pie, big mistake I should've went with my gut and order the Chicken Alfredo. Well, all that was tasted in the pot pie was something sour. I made sure to have someone taste behind me to make sure my taste buds weren't off, but seems vinegar or something else was poured graciously into the pot pie.  I will say that the appetizers I had were amazing, we had some Chicken Samosas with Cilantro dressing and it was mouth watering. I will be back for desserts and appetizers only."
Pei-Ju H.,"Hampton, VA",27,89,169,4.0,9/21/2017,"First time dining here which happened to be on a Saturday evening. My family only waited about 5 minutes which was great. The menu is overwhelmingly expansive, but in a good way. I love that there is so many options available. The waitress recommended I try the Santa Fe salad. It was a great choice! The portion size was huge. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his steak as well. The menu price for the portion size you are getting is amazing. I thought it would be a lot more pricey. Little to no wait, great service, huge portion and food was delicious - can't wait to return and try more. Next time with cheesecake hopefully"
Alicia W.,"Hampton Roads, VA",401,95,231,2.0,3/19/2017,"Unfortunately, I cannot give any more than two stars even though my hopes we to go in and walk out with five. It took ten minutes after sitting down for anyone to come over and even ask us about out drink order. At this point it was also the second time asking for a high chair. About ten minutes later our drinks come yet still no high chair so we ask again. Faintly about another 10-15 minutes passed and someone brought us one. We were checked on once to see how our meals looked a couple minutes after they were all brought out and not spoken to again until we were finished and asked if we wanted to order cheesecake.  We decided on going to Cheesecake Factory for the brunch this time around. We ordered and the appetizer came very quickly. We then waited almost 45 minutes or more for our meals to come. We had two children, one of which was getting a bit restless, and when the meals came both adult meals came out 5-10 minutes sooner than the kids meals. I just think at the very least if the meals are not going to come out together bring the kids meals out first.  The chicken and waffles sounded delicious but it was lacking in all aspects. The chicken was nothing more than fried chicken strips that come pre-frozen out of a bag. I don't even think I'd order these off the kids meal for my children. The poached eggs were overcooked and the waffles were very soggy. The potatoes that came with it had no flavor. I'm very disappointed all around with both of these meals (the adults ordered).  Children's meals were fine although a little on the expensive side for a kids meal. We ordered cheesecake to go and other than the bacon and the mimosas this was more than likely the best part of the meal. Cheesecake Factory I had much higher expectations and left disappointed."
Bobby M.,"Chesterfield, VA",0,16,,2.0,12/7/2017,This was one of the worst lunches I have ever had !     Watered down lettuce .. drowning in dressing.. chicken salad all I tasted was mayo.. and the bread was grilled .. soup was left over chicken vegetables.. loaded with rice .. unable to eat the crap!!! Now I know why I never go there ... maybe they should stick to desserts .. waitress was good .. I ordered a drink on the rocks and it came straight up !!!     WT world no prices on drinks anywhere!!! Don't get a drink ..
Cathrine C.,"Newport News, VA",389,343,506,5.0,8/30/2017,"I haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory in about a year (Maryland), but no matter where the restaurant is located I am NEVER disappointed. I met with a friend here for dinner on a Saturday night, and although it was a bit busy, he managed to snag a table and I found some parking in the garage across the street.  The waitress was super attentive and we got our drinks, bread, appetizer and main course in a short time. I appreciate the speediness of how they keep the restaurant since they get pretty busy. Per usual, I ordered the Chicken Bellagio and my tummy (and wallet) was super satisfied. The portion was so large that I ate a bit for dinner and had it for lunch and dinner the next day (STILL DELICIOUS). Also per usual, I didn't have room left for dessert, so no cheesecake :( Maybe next time!"
Kia R.,"Charlotte, NC",46,46,376,4.0,2/12/2017,"Location:  on the corner, across from mall, in a complex with a lot of other shops and restaurants  Parking:  parking deck, let those that can not walk far out on the corner  Visited while on vacation, This is a smaller version location, had to wait about 10 minutes, great service and food."
Stacy M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",21,50,44,3.0,8/20/2017,"As soon as we walked in we were not welcomed at the door and had to go to the counter until anyone spoke to us. We then requested to sit outside and due some staffing issue they were unwilling to work with us. When we were seated our server was very nice however, there was no bread per low stock in the kitchen ...? Once all of the initial hiccups were worked out, we enjoyed our brunch. My husband got the spinach mushroom bacon and cheese omelet and I got the chicken piccata lunch special. Enough food for a second meal even so we took the rest back for later."
Dallas E.,"Atlanta, GA",363,103,218,3.0,12/29/2016,"I came here with my mom and aunt on a Wednesday evening, to be surprised with a 50 minute wait to be seated, no big deal. Once we were finally seated, our server was very prompt and getting our drinks out to us. So, I'll cut to the chase on that major highlights of the dinner: 1. It took our food way to long to come out. For a party of 3, a nearly 45 minute wait for food is just unacceptable. Our server blamed the untimeliness on the fact of a big party being present. It's 2016, kitchens should be able to work around that.  2. My mother ordered the chicken medeira, and her food was lukewarm/cold. She had to request more asparagus as what came with her meal was simply cold. As far as taste goes, her food tasted ok. My aunt ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta, which she allowed me to sample. It lacked that flavor, and punch you'd expect to find in a jambalaya pasta.  It wasn't the worse I've ever had but it certainly could have been better. However, it was chocked full of shrimp, chicken, and sausage, and was definitely a great portion size. Lastly, I ordered the chicken teriyaki. It came with a pineapple salsa and grilled banana. My food came out excellent, a personal rating of 4 stars. The chicken was charbroiled and glazed with the teriyaki sauce and it tasted great. I was left very full and satisfied. 3. Everyone's silverware was dirty. I'm not sure if the dishwasher had took the night off, or was rushing to get silverware out. But there should never be food particles on silverware.  Overall, this was not the best dining experience I've had at Cheesecake Factory, by my personal meal did make it ok. *As a tip, this is the only Cheesecake Factory in the 757. You might want to call ahead and ask for seating times based upon your party size before coming in. It can definitely get packed in here."
Latrell P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",40,5,3,5.0,11/27/2017,"One of my fave restaurants. The servers are always friendly, restaurant always clean, and the food always delicious.  Absolutely fave dishes are the meatloaf and the chops."
Chris-Jana P.,"Hampton, VA",31,9,14,1.0,11/18/2017,"pissed off!!!! First of all, When do restaurants bring you a bowl of lettuce with a slice of tomato in it.Second, we ordered the salmon an it tasted like tuna... was gross.. thirdly, when someone orders the bang bang chicken and shrimp make sure you tell them it's really sweet. Daughter a boyfriend could not eat it.. the tea was diabetic coma.... nothing was good tonight. I told the waitress that it was my daughters birthday. She DID NOT even say a word.. had to bring manager to table about bad food coming from the kitchen. Was a very bad experience night.The only thing that was good was the coffee and cheese cake...That's a picture of white chili that was runny..."
Timmy T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",272,559,,3.0,7/12/2017,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in several years (probably close to 5). Their food offerings don't appeal to me and the quality is just okay, especially for their prices. This location is a prime location right in Town Center off of Central Park ave. I would recommend parking in one of the decks and walking over.  Since I had a gift card we decided to come here. Came here in a group of four with two of our out of town friends and we wanted to go somewhere that had an extensive dessert selection; it's almost two pages and had about maybe 30-40 plus different options for cheesecakes, shakes, and a few baked goods. We came on a Sunday night around 9PM and this place was PACKED. Apparently this location is always this busy and it caught me off guard. Luckily we were able to score a table with no wait.  The lighting is very dim which I wasn't a huge fan of, especially since our table didn't have a candle either. Our waitress was absolutely fantastic; she was friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable of the menu. She even (jokingly) said I could go with her into the fridge where they kept all the cheesecakes! I got some sort of mango key lime cheesecake that had a macaroon crust. It was just okay for me and a bit too sweet for my liking. One of our friends got strawberry shortcake and it was gigantic and fairly tasty.  If I didn't have a gift card our other option was to go to the Melting Pot."
Monica O.,"Richmond, VA",4,100,148,5.0,7/30/2017,"Delicious, satisfactory food! I ordered the margherita pizza!! It was absolutely perfect! I'm so stuffed and completely happy with my order. The service was exceptional and each person was nice. I will return."
Vania C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",13,118,221,4.0,2/7/2017,"I discovered Cheesecake Factory about a decade or so ago when I lived in Houston, TX, and it became a regular spot for me. What a Treat!  We are so lucky to have one here. It's a major asset to the area and gives us a leg up toward Metropolitan. We dined for dinner on a Monday night 2/6/17. Ordered two appetizers. The buffalo blast which is a meal and 1/2. Shredded  buffalo chicken wrapped in a crispy breaded wanton style exterior that you can dip in their no-kidding blue cheese (chunks of blue cheese and a little sauce awesome) or buffalo sauce. Arrives piping hot, crispy. Tonight, it was overly salty. Still a winner. The second appetizer/dinner was the avocado eggrolls. Oh My. These are to die for...perfectly ripe chucks of avocado and sundried tomatoes tucked in egg rolls served with a sweet yet tangy cilantro honey dip. I can eat these until I pop. Utterly addicting. A MUST TRY if you love avocado like I do. We typically opt for appetizers and skip entrees as we needed to save room for the grande finale: cheesecake! Tiramisu and Hazelnut were our choices this evening. My husband declared he we leaving me for the hazelnut cheesecake then proceeded to have his eyes roll back into his head and said not another utterance until he had licked that plate errrrr ummmm I mean...until he gracefully finished every last bite. A good time around with good food every time. **Prices have slowly and readily crept up over the years as expected. Seems like, lately, every time I go what was once $10-$12 is now $13-$16 and most entrees even more. Going up more quickly."
Wesley D.,"Norfolk, VA",43,39,19,5.0,11/18/2017,This place has never failed me yet. The portions on their food are very generous and flavored very well. I like the vast menu so you can choose something for whatever mood you are in. The only thing I didn't care too much for was the shepherds pie and that is because the amount of grease. I always look forward to visiting and eating at this establishment.
Jason P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",5,128,1,4.0,10/4/2017,"Better than I remember. Very diverse menu with many low calorie options. I normally hate restaurants with large menus because that's a tell-tale sign their food is frozen and it takes an hour to decide what you want to order - but, they actually did a good job this time around. All of the food served was better than average and the service was good. Is this some place I'd frequent often? Probably not because I enjoy supporting local businesses more so than large corporations, but I would go back with no hesitations."
Steffie A.,"Chesapeake, VA",145,115,259,4.0,12/20/2016,"Who doesn't love going to a restaurant where there is something for everyone? This place has such a large menu! It's unbelievable.  I pre ordered a cheesecake for my husband for his birthday. It was a size small. Worthy it serves 8 people. No longer that's totally wrong... Is more like 15! Their cheese cake is so huge even for a small. Before I picked up the cake I decided to treat myself and my son for lunch. Everyone was very helpful. They took my stroller, got me a high chair, and brought out bread and bananas for my  little one.  The restart was very clean. It was lunch time and it was very quiet at the time. Our waitress was very polite and made sure she gave me enough time to figure out what we wanted and even carried a conversation with me.  I ordered the American cheeseburger with fries. I love their burgers it was so good and juicy. The fries were hot and fresh, and I shared my meal with my baby and he loved it! Baby approved! However the prices here are very high. If they lowered the price by a couple dollars it would be perfect."
Rob H.,"Norfolk, VA",102,508,296,2.0,6/22/2017,"The review is excluding all the cheesecake flavors which are decadent and ABSOLUTELY phenomenal. We had the Red Velvet, Chocolate Tuxedo and Salted Caramel.  Unfortunately, the food has much to be desired. If you are in search of a chef created meal that has layers of taste and flavor just get your cheesecake to go and dine elsewhere.  The biggest tip off should be the fact that there are literally 100 or more items in the extensive menu. There are Italian pasta dishes, Mexican inspired, Thai etc. how can any one kitchen possibly create so many dishes? By precooking items like chicken which is used in many recipes leaving the chicken dried out and flavorless. One member of our group order thin spaghetti with Mariana from the special summer menu. It was absolutely disgusting. How can one mess up spaghetti? The pasta was obviously Pre cooked and the sauce was flavorless. Everything we had was below average. However, because we waited so long and we're starving we ate it...."
Tess Y.,"San Diego, CA",44,37,129,4.0,7/20/2017,"Their food are usually good or satisfying. The ambience is franchise fancy. You could go in casual or dress up for special occasions. But when it's for dinner esp on weekend, maybe dress a bit nicer than plain t-shirt, but overall nobody really cares.  I love the convenience of take out order cheesecake.  Their cheesecakes are unmistakably the best cheesecake I have tasted so far (I know it's franchise, to me it's still the best). Almost tried all their flavors in the menu. It's satisfying when you're craving for cheesecakes, might have to pay more but it is worth it if you are craving for sweets and already see yourself heading down the path of sweet indulgence accompanied by consuming tons of calories. In situations like this, you might as well eat the good ones as it is worth it.  Advice: Due to different flavors, If some that may be too sweet for the taste, Usually taking little bites at a time with milk helps. Never gobble a cheesecake. I used to eat the ones they sell as a platter at the grocery stores. Ever since I have been eating Cheesecake Factory's cheesecakes, I don't eat the grocery ones anymore. I also tried a few bakeshop and other fancy restaurant cheesecakes so far Cheesecake factory is still the best place to go. Not that I'm being snob, but I try to choose and eat my calories wisely.  I've been to this location several times and will go back again."
Belle A.,"Virginia Beach, VA",46,161,1818,4.0,3/9/2017,"This place is great for celebrating any special occasion! They can accommodate small and large groups. However, no reservations after 4pm during the week days. Great atmosphere and great for kids as well! They furnish a kids menu and it's loud, so no one is going to be staring at your kids if they get loud. Very nice atmosphere minus the noise volume at times. Overall, great for family and friends. If you want a quiet, intimate dinner, you'd be better served elsewhere at some frou frou restaurant. I love the fact that they have dishes for everyone! And best part of all, desserts galore! It's heaven on earth when it comes to their desserts!!"
Jason P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",211,98,168,4.0,4/5/2017,"This is the only Cheesecake Factory in the area I believe and it's always a little busy. We go here for birthday celebrations usually but not often. It's still a good place to eat for the most part. The menu for this place is huge! It's essentially a book. If you ever been to Cheesecake Factory, the menu varies a lot. It varies from breakfast food to pastas to steaks and seafood. I got the Thai Coconut-Lime Chicken dish and it was pretty good. Compared to an actual Thai restaurant though, it's not as good. My fiancé got the skinnylicious tacos and it was good nothing special though. Inside is very pretty with an Italian theme, pretty consistent with a restaurant in Town Center.  Negative things are that a lot of things in the menu have insanely high calorie counts which may turn some people off. It might be good but it's definitely bad for your health . Some people won't care though. But would go here again only for birthdays and other celebrations though as I tend to stay away from chain restaurants."
Randy B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",9,3,1,4.0,10/10/2017,"Food is delicious! Prices are a little high, but considering the atmosphere is so great, it's worth it. My wife and I come here at lunch time all the time and the small lunch special menu they have is much less expensive. There is not much of a selection on the lunch menu, but what they have is very good! Our waitress today was Brandy, and she was one of the best waitresses we've had in a long time."
Darrell W.,"Wilmington, DE",1,25,11,5.0,8/24/2017,"I've long admired the Apple Martini; I'm not a big drinker by any stretch of the imagination. Just popped in to the Cheesecake Factory here in VA Beach, Stephanie did not disappoint. Only one word for a grown man to use to describe this drink.. YUMMY"
Tracey H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",48,60,161,5.0,7/6/2017,"Decided to have Cheesecake after drinking beer at Gordon Biersch.  We were able to get a small table for two quickly.  Our Server,  April was very friendly, outgoing and helped pair wine with our Cheesecake selection.   We shared a slice of Snicker Bar Cheesecake and a glass of Chardonnay.  So many incredible cheesecake flavors, it's hard to make a decision."
Mia O.,"Portsmouth, VA",53,63,65,4.0,12/21/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is my husband and I favorite restaurant. We only eat there once or maybe twice a year. Today we celebrated 8 years of being together and decided to go for an early lunch. We find that if you go during the day you don't have to wait as long compared to going at night. Our waiter was very nice and very attentive.  My husband and I always order the same thing.  My husband ordered the Cuban sandwich. It was layered in meat and he described it as very filling. On the other hand I ordered the steak Diane, shrimp scampi and mash potatoes. My steak was cooked to perfection. The only thing I would complain about is that my food was not as hot as I would have liked it to be. It was warm but not hot.  For dessert my husband ordered the snickers bar cheesecake. It's his absolute favorite, he said it's like diabetes in your mouth because it's so sweet.  I ventured out and ordered the New Peppermint bark cheesecake, OMG! It was so amazing. The flavors just come altogether in one bite. Overall we had such a great experience and we will definitely be back. I would of given 5 stars but let's work on serving hot food not warm."
Stacey A.,"Chesapeake, VA",323,204,839,4.0,5/17/2016,"Recently came here for my Birthday Dinner and a Graduation dinner. Interior is beautiful,  high ceilings, gorgeous columns,  lighting is a bit dim,  but sets a mood.    You start off with their complimentary bread and butter (refillable, just ask). Tried the Fried Macaroni appetizer,  that was really yummy! I had ordered the hibachi steak,  Medium, I like my meat tender and juicy. Accompanied with Mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was delicious! I recommend! My boyfriend ordered the Kobe burger with Sweet potatoe fries, yumm! My sister ordered the Chicken Madeira, that tasted real good too! Mom,  ordered the Orange chicken with white rice,  it wasn't too bad. Chicken tasted like it was battered in tempura batter than cornstarch/flour. Pops, ordered the Thai Salmon with Brown rice. That tasted very nice. Salmon was cooked on point. Dessert: ordered my Favorite: Red Velvet Cheesecake!!! Omgggg, I'm craving it again.   Been here several times before,  service was great,  food was awesome.  I recommend this place for celebrations,  date nights, etc."
Ciara B.,"Dayton, OH",28,27,1,5.0,7/5/2017,Good food. Our server was great! Close by our hotel. It was nice to have a familiar restaurant nearby on vacation. The wait was not too bad for 2 people. Highly recommend it!
Tiffany S.,"Hampton, VA",0,23,3,5.0,7/31/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite nicer restaurant!  Their menu overwhelms you with choices, but everything I've tried has been delicious! Whether it's a grilled cheese sandwich for lunch or one of the many dinner choices, my meal has always been amazing.  I like to try a different cheesecake each time I go. So far, the red velvet is my absolute favorite! Only complaint is that they don't take reservations and tend to be really crowded at dinner time on fridays and saturdays. This pretty much makes going with a group impossible! Otherwise, everything is amazing!"
