Steven T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",14,6,1,5.0,10/16/2015,"A classic for thw wife and I. Try to get up here every chance we can. Fair prices for what you get. We've tried several things on the menu such as: farfali with chicken, chicken belagio, steak diane, Louisiana pasta and more. Everything is delicious!!! Drinks are expensive but we save our money for the cheesecake!!!"
Christian G.,"New York, NY",57,23,22,5.0,2/6/2016,We came here for our 4 year anniversary  and First I have to start with our waitress Ana!! She was amazing. Very friendly told us about all the specials even recommended a few things for us. She was on top of keeping our drinks filled and making sure they never got low. I had the filet mignon and man oh man was it good was well done but still had a lot of juice and flavor to go with it. My wife had the shrimp scampi and she loved it. Then the cheesecake to top it off. Man ok love this place it was great. Definitely recommend if you come to ask for Ana because she was great and I tell you one thing I will ask for her again.
Maria J.,"Columbia, MO",12,84,12,5.0,8/9/2015,"We have ate here a couple times in the past month or so. Of course the menu is huge so anyone & everyone can find something they like. My teenage stepdaughters were in the area to visit so this was one of the places we took them to try. They were amazed at how pretty the inside was, lol. We've had an amazing experience every time we've been here. And of course the cheesecake is AMAZING!! One of my stepdaughters asked her daddy to pick up some cheesecake the night before they left."
Meranda F.,"Virginia Beach, VA",72,44,,5.0,8/11/2015,I always get incredible service and food! The prices are a bit high but it is definitely a favorite of mine for special occasions! The restaurant has a beautiful interior and can be very romantic!
Mely N.,"Norfolk, VA",6,6,391,5.0,10/26/2014,"I love Cheesecake Factory, they have good selections of my favorite food, salmon, also I always feel welcome every time I come here. I love to bring my friends here to celebrate their birthdays, I often have a outstanding meal and enjoyable service experience."
Janet T.,"Norfolk, VA",0,6,,3.0,1/17/2016,"Service was outstanding, server was Amanda.  Huge portions.  I had the eggplant, it was delicious with one drawback....the breading was VERY salty.  Any more so I would've had to send it back or not eaten it at all.   The rest of my party was very well satisfied....they had.....parm crusted chicken....steak diane, eggroll appetizer, grilled salmon, and bacon burger.  I think the bill was about $115...not bad for 6 people.  Portions so large that one couple split the salmon, the rest were either stuffed to the gills or had take home meal for tomorrow.  All in all, I would go back."
Kimberly A.,"Virginia Beach, VA",105,133,40,4.0,9/21/2014,"Huge restaurant. Massive menu. Decent food for a chain restaurant. Best place you can find in the Tidewater area to serve up some off-the-chain cheese cake. Choice of flavors is HUGE. Banana and pumpkin are two of my favorite cheesecakes. If I'm feeling like some regular straight-up New York Cheesecake, I'll order plain with cheeries on top. Yummmmm! Best thing on their menu! Many customers come just for their cheesecake and coffee! We never leave here without cheesecake to go! My second favorite thing on their menu would be their salads. Several great choices of salads (1/2 or whole)."
Tiffany F.,"Virginia Beach, VA",26,7,1,4.0,12/1/2015,Ive been here several times & everything is great. Reasonable prices for bigger portions. They have many choices in cheesecakes which are delightful. The weekends are pretty busy so u may have to wait but worth it. Service is wonderful also.
Lauren L.,"Norfolk, VA",106,5,4,2.0,7/16/2016,"We went for a quick bite to eat and chose Cheesecake Factory even though there are many good restaurants in the area, this was our first mistake. The food was mediocre at best and the HAIR IN MY PIZZA was met with a visit from the manager who had a salty disposition. The pizza wasn't even discounted. Yes, we had to pay full price for this experience even though my family was done before the replacement pizza came. We will not be returning since there are other great places within a block."
Shanel B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",21,17,15,1.0,3/21/2015,"Just left here outraged. My daughter and I got seated after the usual long wait. We sat for 10 min waiting for a waitress to acknowledge us to get our drink orders. Then we said ok maybe they are busy. We wait another 10 min and see the manager come to address an issue at the table next to us. While this is going on, two people get seated at the table beside us and a minute later a waitress comes to THEIR TABLE and takes their drink order. I could not get out of there fast enough to avoid having an outburst. I am so insulted and will not visit cheesecake factory again. DISGUSTINGLY POOR SERVICE!!"
J E.,"Englewood, CO",82,105,11,4.0,9/6/2015,We only went here to order dessert for takeout. It was very delicious! It was a Friday night so of course it was super busy. I will just call ahead next time.
Laura L.,"Christiansburg, VA",4,49,113,4.0,6/11/2015,"Came to The Cheesecake Factory for for a late lunch! It was not too busy and we were seated immediately! Our waitress was super nice and remained nice even after my son accidentally spilled his drink all over the floor! I ordered the fish tacos for my meal and my son ordered the corn dogs and fruit! I have never had fish tacos before, they were not bad but we're not quite what I was expecting, there was very little avocado on them... Had there of been more they might have been tastier! My sons corn dogs were unique.... Three big but mini corn dogs each on a separate stick. The fruit which came as a mixture of pineapple oranges and apples was ok... The pineapple and oranges were good but the apples were way too sour! The honey wheat bread was to die for! I love the bread! For dessert I got the Oreo cheesecake and the carrot cake cheesecake! Both were very delicious! The cheesecake is the only reason I came to the The Cheesecake Factory and the cheesecake definitely did not disappoint!"
Alicia D.,"Pearl City, HI",3,41,4,2.0,10/13/2014,"My recent visit to the Cheesecake Factory was not the best. I went around 10 pm, walked right in, and was seated within minutes. As I sat I felt something on my shoes. I looked down there was cheesecake crumbs on the floor. Clearly the table was wiped, ready to seat people, but the floor itself had never been touched. I looked over to the table across from me and I saw food as well. I addressed a manager at the time, he didn't take the time to fix the situation, nor did he ask the server to fix it. I was not very happy with the cleaniess of the restaurant.  Outside of that my entree and dessert were great!"
Susan O.,"Chesapeake, VA",36,43,3,3.0,1/17/2016,"I've been here several times; my kids love it, especially their Mac and cheese. I ordered chicken bites with two sides. They were the most bland tasting chicken I've had in a long time. The two generic dipping sauces didn't help much. The three pieces of cheesecake, while good, is just so overpriced. The restaurant is much too dimly lit at night. We had to break out the flashlight on our phones to see. The waitress was friendly enough. I won't be back any time soon."
Pat G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",105,312,581,3.0,1/27/2013,"We were cruising the Town Center area looking for a new place to have Sunday Breakfast and noticed heads inside The Cheesecake Factory.  Cruised into one of the free parking structures (love that) and headed in.  The reception area is nice but loud and we were quickly seated at a lovely booth.  He ordered coffee and I got a Bloody Mary.   The breakfast menu is actually quite extensive with simple egg/meat options, omelets and decadent rich choices.  Hubs ordered the decadent Napoleon Bruleed French Toast with a side of ham.  I ordered the Crab Hash ""poach the eggs medium with no runny egg, please"" with an english muffin. My meal came first and it had two eggs upside down fried hard, brown, uh, oops.  I pointed the error out to the young lady who brought it from the kitchen (not our server) and she immediately returned it to the kitchen for a correction leaving my english muffin on the table to get cold.  Hubs meal quickly followed and it was delicious.  I picked at it while waiting for my meal, strawberries, pecans, fluffy french toast, yum.   My plate was returned to me with two perfectly poached eggs on top however everything else on the plate, like my english muffins, were no longer hot, luke at best.  The hollandaise sauce was still in the little metal container and it was also cool and congealed.  I mentioned the sauce to our server and he said it's supposed to be like that, room temperature. It wouldn't pour from the container (I did not ask for it 'on the side')!  Seriously?  I pulled some out with my fork and the tong marks remained in it. The eggs were served over crab hash. The crab was sweet and abundant but the potatoes in it were like mini soggy french fries however everything was very well seasoned with three colors of bell peppers. If my dish had come out with the proper eggs the first time, my meal would have been much much better.  I was extremely clear with my eggs, poached is the method listed on the menu, how could they get that so wrong?   With tax: $45.14     (7.50 for the bloody mary)"
Mariam M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,2,,5.0,12/27/2016,"i went here for lunch today and every time i go i always get the tex mex  egg rolls. amanda was my waitress when it was time to order she stated that their out of that but she would go check to see if it's ready. it wasn't being prepared yet. i was getting ready to leave b/c they didn't have it.  she then stated ""i'm gona check with my executive chef"", she came back and said she had placed the order and they will be ready. i enjoyed my tex mex egg rolls, she went above and beyond and made sure they were made. thank u again for an exceptional customer service."
Jim S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,9,4,4.0,12/10/2015,Went to the cheesecake factory at town center last night. The inside was very clean and nice. The hostess was not very nice and made us feel like we would bothering her.  After that everything changed. Our waitress was very attentive and took good care of us. They give you some French bread and brown bread. The brown bread was really good but would have been much better warm. My wife ordered the fried shrimp dinner and I ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta. It was great. It had the right amount of kick and favor. Me and my wife ended sharing most of that. I would order that again no problem. We will be back!
Michelle B.,"Norfolk, VA",1,86,,5.0,2/11/2015,"I haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in ages until last week, to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  I was hesitant because the last time we went we had a very poor experience.  But what the birthday girl want the birthday girl gets, so there we went. Everything--and I do mean everything--was absolutely stellar.  We had a very short wait since we did not have a reservation, but were seated fairly promptly.  We ordered drinks, munched on some relatively tasty bread, and waited for our dinner to arrive.  Both of us ordered combination plates, and between them we had steak diane, chicken madeira, herb crusted salmon, and some kind of tasty shrimp (I can't remember what it was called). We both had mashed potatoes as a side.  Every last bite of that meal was delicious.  Everything was well prepared, attractively plated, and appealing.  That chicken dish was superb and I would highly recommend it to anyone.  We ordered dessert to take home, and both were superb.   Our server was friendly, prompt, and polite without being overbearing.  She kept our drinks full, checked in regularly, and even arranged for some folks to sing Happy Birthday to my daughter. All in all it was an excellent visit and I am looking forward to going again!"
Corinne B.,"Newport News, VA",9,102,,5.0,8/19/2014,"I really don't have anything bad to say about this place... Every time I come here, the food is outstanding...and very plentiful.  I had the chicken tostada salad and it was superb.  My husband and I each got a piece of cheesecake to take home and they were fabulous.  I had the Oreo dream supreme and he had the white chocolate macadamia nut. I know there can be a wait at times, but we came in for a late lunch and were seated right away.   If I had anything less than awesome to say, it would be that there are so many choices on the menu that sometimes it can be hard to narrow down your choice!"
