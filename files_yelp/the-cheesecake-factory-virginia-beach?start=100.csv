Ali L.,"Norfolk, VA",184,128,356,3.0,12/31/2016,"Came here with my lady friends for holiday dinner. (Y'all know who you are ;) ) I love the ambience of Cheesecake, I do. But I find their food doesn't ever measure up to my expectations. I ordered the Chicken Di Pana and was so let down. There was next to NO sauce on the chicken which left it overly dry. I actually couldn't even eat more than a few bites because it was just that unappetizing to me. The broccoli was unflavorful and about the only thing I liked was the mashed potatoes which I originally planned on skipping eating because...well...carbs and me don't get along these days. I brought the chicken home for my dog. He liked it much more than I. I also ordered a piece of tiramisu cake which I did enjoy. Lots of red sangria flowed through my glass but it felt like it was mostly fruit and ice so even after three- no buzz. Boo. I arranged a DD for this very occasion... Well, and because my husband needed to borrow my car while his was in shop. Still though...  Overall, cheesecake isn't one of those places I ever yearn to go to. But it's fun once in a while. The better part of the evening was just spending time with mah ladies."
Mimi L.,"London, United Kingdom",9,34,8,3.0,8/19/2016,"I love the cheesecakes, I have only ever had take away desserts. However every time I have gone to the takeaway counter the staff there come across a bit rude and impatient. I kind of dread going in there because of that to be honest.  Anyway the cheesecakes are nice, but I don't think I'll be back to that branch, I found another company that has the best cheesecakes I've ever tasted for half the price."
Nikia R.,"Portsmouth, VA",34,47,125,5.0,9/10/2016,"Too bad 5 starts was the most I could give!!! Hands down!!!! One of the best places I've eaten!

Nicole T.,"Portsmouth, VA",23,58,32,4.0,5/30/2017,Food was the bomb. I swear it was the best burger I have had in a while. Cheesecakes were good and the crab bites were small but decent. Went around noon on a Sunday to avoid the rush. Pancakes were were not fluffy and buttermilk but my daughter said she enjoyed them. Much better than experience than the last time I visited!
Mike B.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,14,10,5.0,2/11/2017,"Great time celebrating daughter's Sweet 16. Although they don't take reservations on Saturdays,  we had no wait time for our party of 15 when we arrived at noon. Everyone loved the food and cheesecake. The service was the best. Our waiter Josh was fantastic."
Marina A.,"Newport News, VA",24,118,306,4.0,9/4/2016,"I was recommended the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. We arrived pre-crazy dinner rush. Our table still had the last guests check on it. No silverware. We ordered drinks, had coffee, cream & sugar but no spoon. Our waitress was kind enough to snag some from another table. We started with the avocado eggrolls, if you don't dip, it's useless ordering them. Kiddo ate the white styrofoam pieces. The bread came & was gone in no time. I tried something new & deviated from my usual Louisiana Chicken Pasta. The fact that I love roasted garlic & my dish contained whole pieces brought my stars to 4.  Other than that, it was good. I like spicy food, so once I added red chile pepper flakes it kicked it up a notch. I I still love my Loiusiana Pasta. I got the 30 year anniversary cheesecake, kiddo got the Tuxedo. Both good. Hers was creamy, mine had cake layered between the cheesecake, yum."
sherri s.,"Newtown, PA",29,261,24,5.0,3/17/2017,This Cheesecake Factory Restaurant was made extra special due to Britney and Vincent.  I was traveling to this area on business.  My Hubby was with me on this trip.  We had lunch two days in a row here as it was conveniently located near the HGI.  Britney was our server on day one and Vincent on day two.  All servers in any restaurant should be exactly like them.  Both made their jobs seem like it was effortless and still fun.  Their high energy and wanting to please rubbed off on us and we left feeling happier than when we arrived.  Then on day two we found out they are a couple...totally made our travels very special.  Thank you Britney and Vincent.
Katie S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,3,,5.0,5/13/2017,"Our server,  Nikolai, was amazing! Made the experience even better! He Knew the menu so well and helped my indecisive self find a great dinner :) I've always loved eating here, but the service tonight, definitely needed to be mentioned."
James D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",9,4,,5.0,5/6/2017,"Our server Vince is great (Sat. 4:47pm). Funny & professional. The acoustics are bad as usual, very very loud. Food review still to come"
Vadney's D.,"Newport News, VA",17,40,112,1.0,8/3/2016,"An hour and a half on a Wednesday night. That's how long it's been and our food is just getting here. A party of three. No appetizers , no bar tab. Just a burger, a chicken salad, and a steak dinner. The salad went back as it was brought out 15 minutes after the other two dishes were.  The manager came out to apologize once we complained to another server. But Diana P who was our server took her time with the check as well. She still got a 10% tip but it was not earned."
Eliana R.,"New Port Richey, FL",8,16,5,1.0,6/18/2017,If I could give this place zero stars I would. We had one person from our party arrive at 10:30am to reserve a party for 7. We arrived at 11:45am because there was over an hour wait. We were not seated until 12:30pm. We waited 40 min for food. Every plate we received was ice cold except one. Which is the one that they were waiting on to bring us everyone else's plates. I ordered the eggs Benedict with spinach and bacon. The hollandaise sauce on top was not runny instead clumpy and cold. I have been here multiple times and never has my food came out like this. There were 5 of us who sent our food back because it was freezing cold. We then waited another 30 minutes for our new plates to come out it's now 1:55pm and we still not have eaten. 3 out of the 5 who received their new plates were still cold. I don't know if the cooks in the back were playing some sort of sick joke on us but freezing cold eggs are DISGUSTING!!! They also gypped us on the amount of breakfast potatoes that were on our new plates. And one person only got one egg on their chicken and waffles Benedict. This is the WORST experience I have ever had at any restaurant. I barely even touched the second plate they brought out to me. I'd have better luck getting a bacon egg and cheese biscuit from MCDONALDS!! I will NEVER AGAIN come here nor will I recommend this Cheesecake Factory to anyone. Save your hard earned money and spend it somewhere where customer service comes first!!
Justyna M.,"Newport News, VA",0,5,,1.0,7/11/2017,We went there on Friday. We were sat outside upon request and greeted by our waiter. We ordered ribeye cooked medium with veggies and shrimp tacos. Food came relatively quickly but I wondered what happened to the bread they always serve. I was told that they don't do it outside unless requested. It took me by surprise because we were there couple times before outside as well and we had bread offered . So right there I knew our waiter had big imagination. He brought bread after all after our food was already on the table. So here comes the fun part. The steak came out well done. Literally no pink whatsoever. We sent it back and after waiting some time the new one  arrived ... well done as well. At that time the manager came by and she looked at the steak and agreed that it was well done . But because we didn't want to wait longer we kept it this time.  My shrimps in tacos were over cooked but not too bad so I kept my food.  So in the end we payed 30 dollars for steak cooked not to our liking ... manager didn't do anything with our check. And the biggest kick was when our waiter told us that our medium is not what they consider  medium. So pink inside considered everywhere as medium is not their medium...  so there you have it.  Not going there anymore. Not worth to waste time on crappy food and service. You decide for yourself .
Raul R.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,39,31,2.0,6/4/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory was a disappointment.  My wife and I, along with our 3 kids, came here to meet up with her sister and her family (husband and 2 kids).  First, it took an hour and 10 minutes to seat us, luckily we had to wait for my sister-in-law and her family to arrive, so we waited. Secondly, if we hadn't asked for our free bread, I don't think the waitress would've brought any.  Third, I think their menu is too busy.  There is absolutely too much going on in their menus that had me overwhelmed about what I wanted. Fourth thing, they got my sister-in-law's drink wrong twice.  She eventually just drank the second drink but didn't finish it.  Fifth thing, in my daughter's alfredo dish, she found two long strands of dark hair.  She got a new dish but they still charged us for it. Sixth thing, my wife and I ordered two completely different drinks and for some odd reason they both came tasting EXACTLY alike.  She had the mango mix drink (I forgot the actual name) and I had a tropical mango drink.  Granted they both had mango in it, but I don't think they should've tasted the same.  I think the tropical one should've had a pineapple or coconut type of flavor in it.  Lastly, the bill came out to $102 for 5 dishes, 2 chocolate milks, a soda, and two non-alcoholic drinks.  A bit steep, even for a chain restaurant that has mediocre decor and prides itself on their cheesecake (which we didn't eat because we were so bummed at our entire experience) and ""experience"".  You want some real cheesecake, go to Brooklyn, NYC and have a slice at Juniors ... at least there your bill won't be over $100."
Clarissa L.,"UT, UT",94,47,573,3.0,1/19/2016,"Came here on Saturday night around 630-7. That was a mistake. My friends arrived first and were quoted a wait time of 1 hour and 30-45 minutes. With not a lot of extra space inside due to the large crowd, we waited outside.  I don't know if you recall this particular saturday (just think January winter in Virginia) but it was freezing. After the FIRST hour my friend and I were too cold and hungry to wait outside any longer. We rushed in to feel the warm air wash over our mostly numb bodies and scrambled up to the hostest. Now I was once a hostest and understand the job often sucks, but seriously she had so much attitude and it was absolutely unnecessary.  We asked how much longer our wait was and gave her our name, she scrolled through her computer and found us saying "" you were quoted an hour and a half-forty five minutes, and it's only been..... an hour. You still have to wait"" she wasn't in the least bit polite. I wish I had taken down her name.  So, upset and not ready to go back outside we got in line for cheesecake to have something to hold us over. I got a slice of snickers cheesecake and my friend got a banana, since the man was kind enough to understand my friends lack of appeal towards sugar and allowed him to buy a banana. The line was non existent, but it made it evident that the majority of the crowd was waiting for their ""to-go"" cheesecake as we ended up waiting another 5-10 minutes for it to come out.  Once we got it we dragged ourselves back ourside to the rest of our group informing them of the rudeness from the hostess and showing them the spoils of our journey to the inside. We encouraged our party of seven to go inside to wait hoping the crowded presence would encourage others to eat faster and leave.  Finally our name was called (another forty five minutes later and a second chat with the hostest with the mostest) and were ushered to stand to the side of the host stand. We waited another few minutes for someone to seat us and once arriving at our table the experience was fantastic. Our server apologized for the wait and said all Saturdays are very busy and she brought us bread. Lots of bread. Everyone who ordered the beverages of the alcohol type seemed pleased and we all ordered quickly as we were tired of waiting.  The food came out pretty fast for our semi large group and it all came out pretty close in time to each other even due to the broad assortment of food that was ordered. It was all delicious. At the end, we had been there for a solid four hours. That's right, all other evening plans were spoiled. Why did you stay?  You may be thinking to yourself. Trust me, I tried to convince every one to leave, but their determination prevailed me.  As we waited for our checks we were informed that the point of sales system was experiencing a glitch causing us to wait longer.  Overall the experience was okay and I suppose I'll go back since it is the closest place to get cheesecake."
Shea B.,"Chesapeake, VA",14,124,71,5.0,10/28/2015,Attended this place with 21 other friends. We had Bree as our waitress and she provided AMAZING service. Her attitude was exceptional and she even made some great recommendations.  Has the mac and cheese burger and it was so damn good.
Christina N.,"Chesapeake, VA",133,11,8,4.0,6/11/2016,I typically have very nice experiences at the Cheesecake Factory chain. The menu has a wide selection so everyone should find something they like. The staff is well dressed and the decor is classic.  I went last night to this location and our waitress did not pay much attention to us. She walked by our table numerous times without checking on us and took awhile to get us waters and refills throughout the meal. We went early on a Friday night for dinner. There were a lot CF staff and a lot of open tables so I was confused as to why everything took long and we weren't payed attention to.  I will still come back because of the many times that we have enjoyed our visit. Love the food and dessert. I usually get the pasta with shrimp and sausage or the factory burrito grande and for dessert I love the Oreo cheesecake
Shareisha H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",307,43,334,4.0,4/9/2017,"I met up here for a date night. The decor and setting is always pleasant every time I have visited. There is normally a long wait time, but we only waited for about 5 minutes. The hostess was sweet and immediately greeted us upon arrival. The energy was very high, there were several birthdays being celebrated, so there was good vibes in the air. Our waiter Chris was very attentive and sat us in a couples booth. They are always so busy and the table was clean, but I didn't feel the need to complain about the crunchy crumbs I had sat on. Chris brought our drinks with water in a timely manner. He mentioned several items on the menu and answered our questions about several entrees in a friendly manner. He did not seem bothered or annoyed. He kept the conversation light, crisp, and assuring. He was sure to check on us throughout the evening, and was very patient with my indecisive partner. We didn't get dessert, but he offered to box our food and get anything else we needed. The food was hot and fresh, and the pineapple and passion fruit mojito were a treat to try. We had the Thai coconut chicken, dynamite shrimp, and the pineapple chicken and shrimp. They were all a great mix of texture and taste. I'm sure I'll be returning again."
Marina E.,"Virginia Beach, VA",67,532,1676,4.0,7/14/2015,"One of my favorite food is undoubtably the miso butterfish.  It's widely popular in Hawaii but almost unheard of anywhere else on the mainland.  Imagine my surprise to find miso salmon on their menu.  It's salmon not butterfish but what the hell, I'll give it a shot.  I'll even get freaky and swap out the white rice with the brown rice.   I haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory in almost 5 years and didn't expect much BUT the dish is fantastic. I did not expect this from a chain restaurant. Our waiter was named Aaron and was fantastic.  I would go back for that dish anytime."
Eric C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",97,30,55,1.0,7/30/2015,"I've been to this location several times before, but this experience was definitely the worst. It's National Cheesecake Day and they advertise the slices of cheesecake are half off. Unfortunately, they fail to mention that it's only 1 half off cheesecake per person that is present. So the cheesecakes I bought for me and my wife, only one could be half off. Boo!  Anyway, I also decided to order some dynamite shrimp since I haven't had dinner yet. What I didn't expect was to wait 30 min for a kid's sized portion of shrimp. I was disappointed that my cheesecakes were bigger than the entire order of shrimp. And I already had my cheesecakes for 15 min, but it was so hot and crowded that my cheesecakes were starting to melt.   The flavor of the sauce for the dynamite shrimp was good, but not enough to rave about it. Also the size of the shrimp was sad. I've had popcorn shrimp from Wal-Mart bigger than the shrimp they used.  I didn't get to eat my cheesecake because it was on the verge of turning to mush, so I had to stick it in the fridge as soon as I got home.  I would've understood if there was a backup on cheesecake orders, but I thought the wait for my food order was ridiculous. I spoke to another customer that ordered food before me, she said she's been waiting over 45 min for 2 entrees and an order of the dynamite shrimp. Our orders came out the same time, but I was seconds away from canceling the order of shrimp and asking for a refund.  Not to mention, the cashier that took my order rolled her eyes when she heard me voicing my displeasure to the other customer about the wait.  I would come back to order cheesecakes, but never order food to go."
Vedek D.,"Norfolk, VA",23,40,65,4.0,7/23/2015,"Thank you Kim for some really excellent customer service!  The food....I had the Steak Diane with the mashed potatoes, with gravy, mushrooms and onions. The meat was cooked per request...well done. It was well done, but not stringy.  The mushrooms and onions were grilled just enough to soften, but not enough to make them ""mushy.""  I also had the mixed green salad with the balsamic vinaigrette dressing which was just ""balsamic-y"" enough without being overwhelming. (If that makes sense) One can't visit The Cheesecake Factory and not have a piece of.....cheesecake. (Well one can, but.....) Lemon Meringue Cheesecake .... Lemon Meringue Cheesecake .... Lemon Meringue Cheesecake; it was/is (because there is a bit left in the fridge) the tastiest, creamiest...it was a delight.  Service by Kim! She was a delight. She knew her menu and was attentive and courteous without being a pest. Only one suggestion. I've no idea how the cost would affect the bottom line.  However, could there be some other type of spread served with the bread other than or in addition to the pads of butter? I'm not in that part of town often ""Downtown Virginia Beach"" but when I am, I will definitely return."
