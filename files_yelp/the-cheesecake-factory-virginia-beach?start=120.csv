Cassie T.,"Pocono Summit, PA",37,6,,4.0,7/21/2017,"I love their mojitos!! It was good as always. I can't remember our servers name. maybe Nate but he was wonderful! Clean, yummy, and more importantly yummy drinks!"
Sunhae M.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,4,6,1.0,1/22/2017,Get the togo box and put your leftovers by yourself. Our server put the togo box for us and we just find out later we get home that there's way less much of food in the box. It's just too obvious so I don't evknow what to say. It supposed be half of plate but it's only quarter. So weird..
H. W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",1,95,183,4.0,5/12/2015,"I've always been a fan of this place. They always meet the mark for me. Some say they are pricey but that just means they can't afford it. Yeah you may have to wait for a little while but good things come to those who wait. So it is what it is.  Food is always fresh and hot. No frozen mess. This is my go-to place always.  If something isn't broke, don't fix it!"
T V.,"Key West, FL",0,15,,1.0,6/3/2017,Please note the name. We had to wait over 20 minutes for two slices of Cheesecake. By the way this was at 11:00 PM. On top of that the server was visibly miffed that we weren't there to drop a couple of Bengies on a late dinner- and the service reflected it. Get it together folks. You can do better.
Yuki J.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,9,1,5.0,7/3/2016,I had a wonderful birthday dinner for my daughter and  all waitress were very nice and helpful!! Birthday cake was cut in peaces already and came with the ice cream for her with her name on the plate which was very cute!!
Art D.,"Chesapeake, VA",1,17,1,1.0,9/18/2016,"Went there during brunch/lunch time before a concert with my kids. I ordered my usual orange chicken and the chicken was soggy and mushy, the snap peas were salty and hard, the rice was dry. My daughter ordered cheese pizza and it had too much cheese and the crust was burnt. She didn't finish it, which is rare because she loves pizza. My son ordered fried chicken sliders and the chicken was overcooked and hard. When I got home I felt like I had food poisoning and horrible heartburn. Had to take medicine and felt like vomiting.   Their quality has went down dramatically and clearly there is no quality control in place. I blame the management, the head chef, and his staff for producing such poor quality food.   I used to love this place."
Lindsay W.,"Newport News, VA",23,66,97,3.0,10/28/2016,"My husband & I came from Newport News to eat dinner & see a haunted house. Unfortunately with a small delay at the tunnel & a 20 min wait we weren't seated until just before 9pm. We had looked at the menu while waited so we'd be ready to order. We were greeted by a very pleasant Louis.  While waiting for drinks my husband noticed silverware on the floor under our table that hadn't been cleaned before we were seated. My water was in a plastic mug without lemon that I requested & my husbands tea was in a glass with a straw. After bringing our drinks, he brought whole grain bread & some French. It was nice & hot. My husband had Evelyn's favorite & I had steak Diane & shrimp scampi combo. His rigatoni had penne mixed in which isn't a big deal.  When a different waitress delivered his plate she said the plate was really hot.  Unfortunately mine was not and my food was lukewarm at best. The flavor was delicious though. The shrimp scampi was creamy & not oily and had full cloves of roasted garlic. The mashes potatoes weren't very mashes. Twice I got a large potato of my fork which I had to take off and cut with the side of my fork. They were good redskins but almost too buttery for my liking overpowering the yummy potato.  The steak medallions were a perfect medium.  The sauce was very rich.  Unfortunately Louis didn't check on us until we were 3/4 done with our meal and apologized when I let him know my food was cold. He was busy with a 20 top next to us.  We got our key lime cheesecake to go which I'm sure will be great. Very nice setting and our waiter was very pleasant.  Not perfect but still tasty."
Nicole A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,6,5.0,7/7/2016,"Just started to use yelp lol, food was great as always, great to see that the food standards at cheesecake are the same everywhere, The service though, it could have been much better just to say, but once again overall great as always."
Jonezey B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,6,,5.0,6/19/2017,"Great Apps & Spirits on Happy Hour !!!  Our Waitress Lisa was a gem, 5 Star Service. Nice to have a pleasant dining experience, I'll be requesting Lisa when we return."
Lora W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",41,31,91,4.0,1/20/2015,"I have to say I'm not a huge fan of their dinner offerings but I love their brunch.  Brunch is only served on Sundays starting at  10am. We arrived around 10:15am and there were already several tables occupied.  We were warmly greeted and our waitress was very quick with our drinks. The coffee comes in clear glass mugs. Small loaves of warm bread were provided while we waited for our food. This is my second time ordering the crab hash. I love it. It's a bed of finely chopped potatoes, green and red peppers, and onions, topped with 3 poached eggs, lump crab meat and hollandaise sauce. It comes with a side of home fries or fruit. Delicious! Others at my table got French toast and something Mexican with carnitas. They really liked their food too.  Service was excellent."
Joe D.,"Chesapeake, VA",415,677,3414,4.0,11/16/2013,"Let me tell ya about an excellent lunch here recently. The family was in town and they had an errand to run down at Pembroke so after we were finished at the mall we walked across the VB Blvd and had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. The place was pretty packed for a Saturday afternoon as there were a couple of party's going on. We sat next to one of them however they pretty much done and weren't noisy. There were 5 of us, 3 adults and 2 children and even though they were busy our server was still timely and attentive, checking with us regally and keeping the drinks topped off, etc. Kudo's to her. We started off lunch with an order of Tex Mex Eggrolls. Six of those came in the portion along with sides of guacamole and salsa. These were good but I've had better at other places.  I opted for a Cuban Sandwich for my lunch. My brother had a Chicken Parmesan Sandwich with a side of Mac & Cheese and his wife had a Club Sandwhich. Let me just say the Cuban and Chicken Parmesan sandwiches were big enough to be 2 meals each. The Club sandwich was no slouch either, however it wasn't as big as the other two. This was hands down the best Cuban Sandwich I've had in recent memory. The Cuban included roasted pork, Swiss cheese, Ham, Pickles, Mustard and Mayo on a grilled and pressed Cuban style roll. The kids had kids meals which included a mini chicken sandwich with fries and a quesadilla.  Were we done yet? Sorta. I was Thanksgiving full, however my brother and his son opted to split a gigantic slice of chocolate cake. I sipped on some Cappuccino while I waited for both of them to explode. This was a super delicious lunch and I look forward to visiting again."
Jordan B.,"Norfolk, VA",595,359,1855,5.0,12/14/2014,"I really enjoyed my graduation lunch with my family here. I didn't want to go somewhere too casual or too formal, and this place was a happy median.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in and there wasn't a long wait despite the lunch rush. Our waitress was very friendly and was quick with the drink refills.  I initially ordered the white chicken chili with rice, it smelled good but it didnt look as filling as I had hoped. I hate sending door back, but I asked politely, and the waitress was very friendly and nice about it. I then ordered the fried macaroni and cheese burger with fries and ranch, and it was perfection. The whole restaurant was also immaculate including the bathrooms. Overall my expierence here was awesome as well as the waitress (her name was Megan). I would definately recommend this location! Two thumbs up."
Matt I.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,21,,4.0,4/29/2017,"Very good food and a huge menu. Friendly staff and a great location. It's a Cheesecake Factory, so you know what to expect if you have been to one."
Maruko X.,"Los Angeles, CA",1151,1704,12610,3.0,1/17/2014,"Ambiance 4/5: high ceilings, colorful decorations, spacious and comfortable seats  Service 2/5: a bit slow and impatient, our waiter made a few oral mistakes when introducing some cuisines   Food 3/5:  standard food selections   Ham and Cheese ""Cordon Bleu "" Omelette - *** omelette itself tasted pretty good, but the whole wheat toast was cold   Pineapple Cheesecake - **** seasonally supply, tasted fresh and flavorful, recommend   Price 3/5: generous portions, standard cheesecake factory price, reasonable"
Becky V.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,16,,1.0,8/14/2016,"Overpriced, nothing special food, so noisy you can't hear your waiter. If you crave cheesecake, order it to go. Been 3 times, service was awful. 3 strikes and you're out!"
Mary Ann R.,"Virginia Beach, VA",36,65,189,4.0,1/14/2015,"Hundreds of menu items but only one will ever do, our favorite Cajun Chicken Littles!  Comes with mash potatoes and corn succotash, but we sub the corn for fries. The portion size is huge...definitely meant for sharing! (request extra dipping sauce).  Now for dessert...no debating whether to have one or not..after all, we are at The Cheesecake Factory. Our all-time fave is the Red Velvet Cheesecake. Perfect ending to a great meal!"
Ban Ana C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",14,20,24,3.0,9/24/2015,"Usually I would just order cheesecakes because they are really good. The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is very rich, and it's not sweet like other cheesecakes, a little bitter, which is perfect for a dark chocolate fan like me. The Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake is rich too. It has a good balance between coffee and chocolate. Those cheesecake are HUGE and rich, and it's not cheap, so I recommend you to share with someone.  This time my mom and I wanted to try their food so we ordered a Shrimp With Angel Hair and Steak Diane And Shrimp Scampi. We've waited for 15-20 minutes for the food maybe it was because the other day was a holiday so the restaurant was full of people, which I was ok with it. Also, they provided us free breads with butter while we waiting.  Anyways, the Steak Diane And Shrimp Scampi is 4/5. The steak was cooked as what we asked for (medium-ware); the shrimps are big; I assume the mashed potato is made with fresh potato since there are some skins with it; the sauce on the shrimp is creamy and it was good. Now the Shrimp With Angel Hair. It's 1/5. I have never paid $17 for such a simple dish. It's dry and no taste at all. The tomato sauce looked AND tasted like canned diced tomatoes, and it doesn't even have sauce. Even the waiter added some cheese on the top, It's still no taste. The angle hair was too dry that I have to use a knife to separate them. Also, it's warm when it came to our table, so it actually turned cold while we were eating it. Honestly I can cook something better that this crap lol. Overall, I recommend the cheesecake and the ambience of the store but not the food. You can definitely find somewhere else to have better food."
Jesse C.,"Newport News, VA",75,217,19,4.0,11/19/2015,Cheesecake! Glorious cheesecake! Welcome to the most fattening place ever. It's sooo worth it. Get the dynamite shrimp as your appetizer. It's great. Try any entree you want. I have enjoyed the Louisiana pasta and the Chicken Piccata. Both solid options.  Finish off with a coffee and cheesecake. My favorite all time cheesecake is the lemon meringue. Also the seasonal stuff is great. I suggest the pumpkin pecan cheesecake. It's the perfect nostalgia for thanksgiving. Especially if you can't decide over pumpkin pie or pecan.  Now try to walk to your car. Remember.. The meal isn't over until you hate yourself.   I've always had awesome service here. The bathrooms are super nice and clean. You can also just come for cheesecake!!
Jamie M.,"Remsen Village, Brooklyn, NY",0,4,1,3.0,9/18/2016,"Usually I enjoy this restaurant, the staff are always pleasant and their food is always good, but last night after waiting 20mins to be seated (I understand that it was Saturday and it was busy) my friend and I sat and waited over 45mins and our food never came. This was by far the worst service I've gotten since going to the Cheesecake Factory."
Phung H.,"Miami, FL",47,253,976,4.0,3/10/2015,"I usually only come here for special occasions. I spend way too much money here between appetizer, entrée, non alcoholic beverage, and of course cheesecake!! The food is pretty good and the service is unpredictable, and it can be quite expensive! They have such a large menu that it's hard to choose one thing to eat!! I haven't had a bad dish here, but I have had terrible service before (that's why I kicked off 1 star). My favorites here are their salads, turkey burger, tuna tartar, mango smoothie, and of course cherry cheesecake! Worth a try for a special occasion :)"
