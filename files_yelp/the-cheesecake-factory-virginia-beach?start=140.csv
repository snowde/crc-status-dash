Ron C.,"Sterling Heights, MI",44,1072,3959,5.0,8/8/2013,"We were in Norfolk visiting my sailor son, and anted to treat him on his recent promotion,and since he has never ever ate at The Cheesecake Factory, today wouold be that day. First of all I have ate at about 9-11 TCF's around the USA, they are consistently good & we love the atmosphere, my bride says she feels like it is a vacation resort. Agreed! Walked in & were promptly greeted & seated, Brittany popped on the scene & was  the perfect gal for our evening, even offering some recommendations we may not have normally tried, as my son was overwhelmed with the 21 page/200 item menu. My son was torn between the 4 cheese pasta & the Hibachi Steak, So I suggested order both & we will split them. Four Cheese Pasta Penne Pasta, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Romano and Parmesan Cheeses, Marinara Sauce and Fresh Basil. Also served with Chicken.  Was an A+ dish & we had leftovers Hibachi Steak Certified Angus Hanger Steak with Shiitake Mushrooms, Onions, Bean Sprouts, Wasabi Mashed Potatoes and Tempura Asparagus. A++  I cannot even put into words how good & tender this  was & the veggies were excellent. The Bride ordered : Chicken Madeira Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes.  The look on her face after the 1st bite was priceless, her new all time fave! We did not get any cheesecake, as we all had leftovers. I consider that great restraint! Cannot wait for the new one in Michigan...but will wait until the initial rush dies down, if ever"
Caitlin R.,"Newport News, VA",1,16,57,4.0,3/21/2016,"So many different options to pick from for food and obviously dessert  The lemon raspberry cheesecake is to die for if you like more of a fruity dessert rather than chocolate! For my chocolate lovers, get the 30th anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake...it is so dreamy. As for dinner, the chicken and biscuits is my go to. Love the food here and have always had good waiters. The front end of this location can be a little hectic though since the waiting area isn't huge for the amount of people who go here. Overall, highly recommend!"
Grace P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",56,45,45,5.0,6/26/2016,"Incredible variety of entrées and desserts, and service has always been courteous. It's always a treat to come here! If cheesecake isn't your thing, try the lemoncello torte cake."
Torstein L.,"Long Beach, CA",37,49,8,5.0,10/16/2015,"Love this place! Best interior design ever! Feel like I'm in a palace. Lighting is perfectly dimmed. Great for special occasions! Now for the food, this place has top of the line ingredients for their dishes! I absolutely love the Kobe burger (medium rare), I was in heaven the entire time I was eating it.  Customer Service is always great here, sometimes there can be a wait due to The popularity of this place but they always make sure we are comfortable while we wait. Even offering discounts if our dishes take a little while longer to come out. And the only reason our meals took so long to come out was because they were trying to perfect a new dish that my wife ordered. Quality food is what they aim for. One of my favorite places to eat. Price is reasonable :)"
Cris T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",250,239,1659,5.0,11/11/2014,"This is one of those restaurant that once you try them you've always make a point to come back. Yes, I'm absolutely aware that its a chain however the deserved to be graded a high ratings because the food the service here is extremely superb. Cheesecake Factory widely known as the distributor of cheesecakes but its also a restaurant that offers a wide and extensive diverse menu. This particular branch is busy all the time. I suggest to booked your table ahead of time. Don't assume that once you get in you'll immediately be served and seated. My favourite spot to dine in is the outside deck. Family section and bar area is available too. In recent visit, I came here for lunch with friend whom I haven't seen for such quite sometime. I didn't order appetizer because I'm saving it for the dessert so I directly ordered the main course which is herb crusted filet of salmon over mashed potato and asparagus on the side. Thought the fish was cooked to perfection. It was seasoned well and lots of flavor. The mashed potato was soft and creamy and the asparagus was exemplary delectable and crunchy just like the way I want it. As for dessert, I had the red velvet cheesecake. Oh my god, it was moist, smooth and rich.The cream cheese frosting just makes it more even delicious and elevate the texture of the flavor of the cake. Overall, the food presentation was just visually stunning and the flavor profile was simply exquisite. Hell yeah...no doubt I will come back."
James I.,"Virginia Beach, VA",75,2,,5.0,12/24/2016,"Tonight my husband and myself found ourselves at Cheesecake Factory for the first time together. We had outstanding service from beginning to end. We were greeted and sat in a timely manner. Amanda H our waitress didnt just give us outstanding service she provided us with an experience, a Christmas memory that will last a lifetime. My husband and myself both ordered a Bacon-Bacon burger.(his medium rare mine well done.) They both come out phenomenal loaded with just the perfect amount of bacon and melted cheese. I love macaroni and cheese more than anything, hands down that was the best. It was cooked al dente loaded with creamy cheese and baked to perfection. Props to the kitchen staff for that thanks guys/girls. I didn't have to want for anything Amanda H was right there with everything I needed, whether it was getting me a refill or answering questions about the menu. I don't know about you ladies and gentlemen, but I've worked for the customer service industry for years and this is what you call exceptional customer service with some hospitality. Thanks again Amanda H."
Kevin J.,"Waverly, VA",17,13,28,1.0,3/23/2016,"This was my first time visiting this restaurant. I have on several occasions, visited one in NY while I was a resident. I am extremely disappointed in the service that I experienced on Thursday, March 17, 2016 at this location.  My son had just gotten married and decided to have the wedding lunch here. When we (3 in our party) entered the restaurant we were directed to our tables. Our waitress took our drink orders. Twenty minutes later the rest of the party joined us. A total of 14 to the party graced our section. Ten minutes later the waitress took their drink orders. An 1-1/2 hours has passed since entering the restaurant and my food order has not been taken. Finally, two waitresses started taking food orders. I was the first to order a Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger w/ fries (that is no typo, the name is correct). The people who came in after us, ""the first 3,"" got their orders within 20 minutes. I am still awaiting my food. Everyone was served and still no food for me. The waitress came and brought me my fries and said, ""Here are the fries, sorry for the delay, but at least you have something to eat on until your burger comes up."" A total of 2 hours 10 minutes, my burger arrives. The waitress said, ""You're a saint."" I asked the waitress for a carry-out tray to take it with me, because everyone else was just about finished with their food. I was so upset and irritated that I didn't want to eat when the food finally arrived. Mind you, the restaurant was not crowded for that time of day. I literally walked the restaurant to see just how crowded it was. The rest of the wedding party made comments about how I ordered first and got mine after theirs. I would never visit this establishment again. Kevin Jones - Waverly, Va."
Paul T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",157,368,163,4.0,9/15/2014,"So, the Cheesecake Factory.   As with all chains, it gets the cursory three stars to start, because, you know, it's A-Okay.   So, what pushes this one up over the top.  Well, there's a few things.  First, it's one of the few places in the Virigina Beach town center area wehre you can get a dessert, late, on a Sunday.  This might not sound like a big deal, but for me, it matters.  Some times, I just gotta have my cake, AND eat it too.  Did you know the make cake?  It's seriously amazing.  Like 19' high cake (please note, slight hyperbole here). The other thing that makes this place great is the ambiance.  It's just a cool restaurant.  Like eating in a cathedral almost.  Massive chandeliers, vaulted cielings, plenty to look at.  It reminds me a little of Union Station.   Now, the drawback, non-adventorous types that are looking for a high-class, middle tier restaurant will flock to here and the PF Changs across the street.  Which is cool, I get it, but be prepared for a lengthy wait.  Well, unless you just want some cake, you can sidle up to the cake ""Bar"" as I call it and order it to go."
Lorie F.,"Norfolk, VA",340,268,2285,4.0,3/10/2013,"I was teetering between 3.5 & 4 stars.  Daughter loves this place. It's a chain so, I don't get too excited BUT, there are a few good items on the menu. I love that they have a separate kids menu and ""Skinnylicious"" menu.  Ordered the Vietnamese Pork Buns! Yummmm! They tasted fresh & savory. There were cucumbers, sesame seeds, carrots, some marinated pork..  Delicious. I think anything on those puffy white buns (GWA PAO) are good!  BTW, these were NOT on Skinnylicious menu.  Daughter got the Bow Tie Alfredo.. Always buttery rich & they seem to always cook the pasta al dente'. She also ordered her fave, Red Velvet Cheesecake.  Service was good.. Glad I tried something new & not too heavy or fried."
Frank B.,"Pensacola, FL",233,9,9,4.0,7/29/2016,This place is on par with what you would expect from a Cheesecake Factory. The food tastes great and the location is clean. The one objection I have to this location is based on the time and day in which you visit parking could be a bit of a challenge. But is available via parking garages (pay to park). Being from California I'm not a fan of paying for parking but I'm told this is typical on the east coast.
J W.,"Hampton, VA",0,21,3,3.0,8/9/2016,I've always enjoyed the experience at the Cheesecake Factory. I've driven over 30 miles to eat there. This occasion was average as it compares to other visits.
Matt W.,"Sulphur, OK",26,80,206,4.0,7/22/2016,I've always loved the cheese cake factory.  You can always count on consistency in food and great service.
Marisa E.,"Norfolk, VA",16,22,10,3.0,5/9/2016,"Overall experience wasn't terrible. Server brought my kids bananas while we waited for food! Nachos were good. DO NOT get the fish tacos. Zero flavor. Dry tacos (there was a little sauce UNDER the fish but that's it). Rice was dry and had no flavor. I got broccoli instead of beans and it wasn't cooked enough and again, had no flavor. Strawberry shortcake was HUGE and delicious, though! And definitely get the Ruby Red Crush."
Chris B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",69,2,,2.0,3/13/2017,"I've been here 3 times now, giving it 3 chances. Two times I went were relatively slow, but still had to wait one time 15 min just for waters and no exaggeration 22 min just for water. I am a waiter and I could see the server was not busy, and if she was she showed no sense of urgency. The other time that took the server 15 min for waters she straight up told us she forgot about us. And then proceeded to forget about us (my girlfriend and I) one more time, again, wasn't busy. When it was busy we had the best service out of the 3 times we went, but still was very slow, understandably busy though. Food is good, Although a little over priced."
Kay C.,"New Orleans, LA",3,14,10,2.0,7/31/2016,Not so good lately...I've had much better food from them which is why I'm more disappointed than anything
Jasmine G.,"Norfolk, VA",343,79,39,5.0,7/30/2015,Cheesecake Factory is good. The food does not disappoint neither does the dessert. My favorite cheesecakes starting from the top. Red velvet. Must try! Lemon cello torte. Not really cheesecake but is has a marscapone filling. This one is sometimes my favorite. S'mores. If u like smores you will like this one. Oreo blast...gives you that chocolate fix. Dulce de leche. Yum yum. So sweet!!. 30th anniversary. Very good I don't get it as often as I should!! I'm a sweets addict.
Christina C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",209,215,88,5.0,6/24/2016,"love this place every single time i come. i know it's a chain restaurant, but the service at town center is always on point. came here for brunch. wish i took pictures of the avocado toast, but i got too hungry and greedy and gobbled it all up. also got the alcoholic strawberry milkshake. OMG best decision of my life. had two of those, sat outside, and enjoyed the rest of my day. the portions are always plentiful, the service is speedy, their bread and butter is always delicious, and the cheesecakes are always AMAZEBALLS."
Amy R.,"Virginia Beach, VA",19,8,16,3.0,2/7/2016,"I've  been here twice now for dinner and once for carry out dessert.  Their menu is huge; almost too big to make a decision on what to eat - it all looks and sounds so good.  I got the CHICKEN DI PANA - Lightly Breaded Sauteed Chicken Breast Served over a White Wine Butter Sauce with Mashed Potatoes and Broccoli.  This was very good.   My mom got the PIT BEEF DIP - A Baltimore Classic with Char-Roasted Beef, Melted Fontina Cheese, Caramelized Onions, Au Jus and Horseradish Sauce on a Grilled Bun.  This is the second time she ordered this dish, and this time she was a little disappointed because the bun was not a baggett this time but just a regular bun.  Otherwise, it was good."
Tami C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",476,235,1815,4.0,10/21/2015,"Having been to The Cheesecake Factory numerous times, I am always impressed and kind of in awe of their decor upon walking in. I just love their ambiance and openness of the establishment. There's never a time during the various hours I've been that there wasn't a wait or a gaggle of people waiting in the lobby for a table. Never. This time was no different. Although it was just me and my boyfriend, the host told us it was a 10 minute wait (wait, what?!) but we opted to sit at the bar where it was fairly empty with only a few other patrons enjoying the last of their brunch. Brunch is until 2 PM and it was 2:10 so sadly we just missed it!  Not to be disappointed we perused through their vast menu and decide to try a Mediterranean salad, their Hibachi steak and mashed potatoes, and their Chicken and Biscuit. My boyfriend is not a big foodie and he mainly eats to survive. Me? I eat for sport. It was my first time ever hearing him make a sound after taking his first bite. He was super impressed and dare I say it, practically in LOVE with his hibachi steak. I giggle when he let me try it. It was definitely tender but the marinate was something so similar and familiar to what we Asians use for our ""barbecue.""  I told him to enjoy it and that I will make him the same dish again soon. My chicken and biscuit was served with mashed potatoes and I was a happy bunny. It hit the spot and was so comforting. One thing I realized when we left was that I didn't have their signature Strawberry Lemonade this time. Kinda made me sad but a quick zip to the nearest Starbucks drive thru made up for it!"
Jovaughn W.,"Norfolk, VA",83,41,4,3.0,7/22/2016,"I came to this restaurant with high hopes but left disappointed. We waited over an hour to be seated (party of 2) and then once we order our appetizers the nachos with spicy chicken, it came out burnt with a horrible taste. My food the orange chicken with white rice and Mac and cheese on the side however was pretty good. I had to take it home tho due to the face that the portion size was pretty big. Lastly, the cheesecake. I ordered the orero supreme cheesecake if that's the name and it was a letdown. It was super sweet, way to much icing making you not being able to enjoy it at all.like it was about 70% icing and topping and about 30% cheesecake."
