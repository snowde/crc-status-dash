Drea L S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,6,1,5.0,2/23/2017,"Perfect place for a date. Be prepared that it can get busy, but if you come at the right time you can get a table immediately. A lot of folks come here for special occasions- I have heard ""Happy Birthday"" sung countless times and have even seen a proposal. Therefore, you should dress nice. I love how the cheesecakes are on display right when you walk in so if you're having to wait for a table you can at least browse the cheesecakes to get an idea of what you want for when dessert rolls around. We're very fortunate to have this restaurant in such a centralized location. Also, just because this is a cheesecake place do NOT skip on food: it is seriously to die for. My favorite of their cheesecakes is the red velvet (omg so delicious) and my favorite for their food are the stuffed chicken tortillas and the chicken piccata. Honestly, I never would have ordered the chicken tortillas were it not for a recommendation on how mouth-watering they are. I figured ""why not?"" and now they have become my main go-to on the menu."
Jennifer S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",156,77,101,5.0,5/29/2016,"Last year, I decided that I wanted to enjoy a cheesecake for my birthday, so I picked up a cheesecake from the grocery store and regretted it.  This year, I decided that I can ONLY get a cheesecake for my birthday from The Cheesecake Factory ~ I was not disappointed.  Not only was I not disappointed but I chose the Lemoncello Cheesecake with its oh so tangy taste and beautiful texture.  I thoroughly enjoyed my journey on my piece of cheesecake and is SO WORTH every penny I spent on this Cheesecake.  I shared the cheesecake of course, but we still have half of it leftover, yay!  I'm so glad I chose to get my birthday cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory this year ~ it is wonderful & made my birthday that much sweeter this year!  I do enjoy this restaurant too, the staff is friendly & accommodating and the food here is most excellent!"
Jessica M.,"Chesapeake, VA",34,70,53,4.0,11/2/2014,"From my last experience, I knew I could not expect my next experience any better. However, everything went great when I ate there last night!  Wait was only 30 minutes, and our waitress was really nice (gave me a straw without hesitating). We order the chicken nachos as an app and it was great. I'm usually iffy about getting nachos anywhere due to my Mexican roots, but their nachos were pretty good and like the fact they cook their own tortilla chips.  For my entree I got the chicken and shrimp jambalaya pasta- it tasted yum! Was not disappointed. Couldn't finish it so I brought it home. We also got cheesecake to go, and it was good as expected as well.  I wasn't happy with Cheesecake Factory cause of what happened last time, but I'm glad I went ahead and gave it another chance."
Laura H.,"Winston-Salem, NC",3,5,,4.0,8/8/2015,"First time eating at a Cheesecake Factory & it was AMAZING. The menu is immense, which is a slight problem, as there was TOO MUCH to chose from. I settled on the Louisiana Pasta & it was delicious, twice over-there was enough food for lunch the next day, so it's worth the money too!!! Oh, & they serve Cheesecake, like a hundred varieties!!! I'm sure they're all good, but I settled on the Kahlua, Mocha, Coffee one, & it was DIVINE-this DID NOT last til the following day, because it was CHEESECAKE!!!"
Abby L.,"Aurora, CO",87,4,,1.0,4/26/2016,I came here for dinner with friends tonight and ordered the fish and chips.  While eating the Cole slow I bit down on a bread tie! I handed it to the waitress and she offered me another bowl of Cole slaw.. I declined.. The manager came out and apologized and said it came from the king Hawaiian rolls. He offered to brig me something else. I declined as well. I didn't try to cause a scene or anything and was shocked to see my meal still on my bill when we left. I recommend checking your food before eating!!
Malou S.,"Mira de Aire, Portugal",599,130,2911,3.0,7/27/2016,"I know the reasoning for coming here today, but I did not order the cheesecake...I ordered my ole time fave Carrot Cake. I definitely had better carrot cakes, this was a humongous slice, but it was a bit dry and heavy. As I cut into pieces to eat it, it just felt hard not soft nor light. I know I went straight to the desert with this luncheon experience. I definitely don't come here to often, I do like to once in a while. We all ordered the lunch specials pasta, pasta, pasta and salmon. Boy they definitely aren't skimpy on the entree. I can only imagine the dinner sizes (jeez). My mom had the salmon and she really didn't like it, she said it tasted old not fresh, overbooked and hard. She had me taste it and she was right. I had better salmon and not their specialty, steamed broccoli was cooked to perfection, but asparagus was also overcooked. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs, which I hardly do, but it was tasty our waitress recommendation.  It was very tasty as she said it would, but I couldn't eat the meatballs since I'm allergic and it had Italian sausage mixed into it. So she offered to get me grilled chicken in replacement of it. That was reality sweet of her, but the chicken did not have any flavors on them. So I just took it home so I can at least alter it to my taste. (Lol). Both my girls had pasta as well. They ended up not finishing it either. We also tried the flavored lemonades which was very good, I had the Hibiscus lemonade and my mother had the Cucumbers and Mint lemonade very tasty. We also had appetizers Tuna Tar Tar, which she loved, Crabcake Bites, a bit wet and Calamari to salty. Out waitress was very attentive and very helpful so we left her a hefty tip over 20%, she deserved it."
Yuniel D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",40,4,,2.0,4/20/2016,"Let me start by saying that my first experience at this Cheesecake Factory was about a year ago when I took my wife for our anniversary.  Never cared much for going to this place, but she wanted to go, so there we went.  After an hour of waiting, not having my sweet tea glass filled even once, and my dinner getting cold while waiting for my wife's food, that never arrived, and the waitresses walking by as if we were not there, I finally had to complain.  Without saying a word back to me, the waitress walked away and showed up with the manager, who was extremely apologetic for the ""misunderstanding"" on their behalf.  Offered to pay for our food (like I was going to pay for it after all that), and gave it to us in a box to take home with us anyways. Fast-forward a little over a year, my daughter received a very distinguished award in school, and against by better judgment I listened to her and took her to dinner here to celebrate for her great accomplishment.  It was Tuesday evening, so I figured how bad could it be?  The waitress was extremely nice and attentive, and provided great customer service.  The place was not that packed, and the appetizer came fairly fast.  However, like my first visit the main course took nearly an hour before the food showed up.  My meal?  A club sandwich.  It's not like I was asking for anything extraordinary, and neither did my daughter and wife. The food was good, but I would rate it ""average"" at best, certainly not worth the wait. So, needless to say, I will not be returning to this place.  As a matter of the fact, I think after this experience it will be extremely difficult for me to ever want to visit another Cheesecake Factory again.  I am a super patient man (sometimes too patient), but my business has to be appreciated with good customer service and some type of timeliness.  I don't care to pay for good food, but not at the expense of an hour wait on ""average"" food. Good luck."
Charlton B.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",1,9,1,4.0,1/21/2017,"Busy place around all hours. If you order the fried chicken sandwich, you better be hungry. It is huge and one of the better I've had in recent memory. Of course, their cheesecake is damn good."
Linda K.,"Stockholm, Sweden",96,237,79,5.0,6/17/2015,"In Hawaii this seems like THE place to eat at. Always a looong wait. I never really got it. Went for lunch there once, didn't think much of it. Then again I didn't try their cheesecake.  Then I met my hubby and was introduced to the cheesecake and yeah, i get it now.  Never had one from there until now that i moved close to the virginia beach location and yummy in my tummy. My husband warned me that there would be plenty of food, did i listen?  Noo.  I had chicken pasta and it was deeelish. But when i tried hubby's meat loaf i could have easily had that instead. They have a rather large menu and it takes some time to browse thru and i could have picked more than one item of food to devour. Same goes for their cheesecakes. I was told they don't have all of the ones on the list there (what kind of bs is that?) But was glad when they did have the one i wanted. A turtle pecan caramel something something goodness get in my tummy now kind of thing. Hubby had pineapple upside down cheesecake and it was equally good (naah, mine was better)  Overall. Good location, good food, awesome cheesecake, good waitress ... good good good. Everything was good. And i now see why is such a popular place in waikiki .. next time we visit hawaii I might even go."
Shawn H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",437,286,402,4.0,6/14/2014,I'm not a big fan of reviewing chain restaurants but Cheesecake Factory is special.  They are ALWAYS busy and a waiting line is to be expected but even with a wait the service is first class and the food never misses.  I had the chicken di pana and my friend had herb crusted salmon. Both dishes came with some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  The chicken was perfectly crusted and fried. The salmon was moist and tender.  I usually get an appetizer but for this place I save room for dessert. We had a piece of lemon raspberry cheesecake and a piece of red velvet cheesecake. Both were terrific.  Even though I know I'll stand in line I can't wait to come back. Where comfy pants....
Pickles M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,19,3,4.0,11/4/2015,"Everything I have tried here has been very good. Great burgers and entrees. The only thing that I didn't care for was the calamari- gummy, way too much breading and a very small portion. I am also disappointed that they did away with the pineapple upside down cheesecake- it was seriously heavenly. But overall a great place to eat.  Our waiter last time was awesome. I believe her name was Rachel, attentive and professional, especially during the utter chaos that is a Saturday night in this place."
Cassandra P.,"Hampton, VA",6,25,12,1.0,6/14/2016,I have been here once or twice but was displeased last night. I ordered a bacon bacon cheeseburger which had some weird sauce on it. A burger is a simple thing and they messed it up. Hubby had a pasta dish which was overcooked for a nice chain restaurant they should be able to cook pasta. The blood orange margarita was good though. Also the server focused on my husband and not the table.
Shanae S.,"Suffolk, VA",149,134,250,3.0,8/3/2015,Food is consistently good but the crowds are what keep me from going as often as I'd like.
Emily O.,"Virginia Beach, VA",726,86,517,5.0,12/29/2014,"Ah, The Cheesecake Factory.  Always a solid, non-argumentative ""date night"" go-to.  With your complex menu, poor choice in all-white server attire (I mean, seriously, WHYYYY?!!!), and luxury-casual approach; who wouldn't love you?  Nobody.  That's who. For the longest of long times, I had real issues with you, Oh Cheesecake Factory.  But you, m'dear, have really changed my tune. See, what I've realized about this place is that you must follow one, very simple yet golden rule: FIND WHAT YOU LIKE, GET IT AND GET OUT. Many times I have followed the advice of servers who, while direct and honest are somewhat biased.  Why?  Because they have verrrrrry different tastes buds than I do.  I have tried many things here, including but not limited to:  Factory Meatloaf, Steak Diane, and Chicken Madiera.  None of them fancying my palette. I felt as if, for the longest time, I was constantly being cornered into going here and choosing menu options that were just not for me.  Boring, lackluster foods that left my beady, little heart desiring a fourth meal. That was until I met David.  What a game changer that was. David is a veteran server at Cheesecake Factory that somehow can seamlessly match up your mood/taste buds to the perfect concoction.  He is amazing, splendid, bold, all of the good things that you look for in a server. He matched me up to the Chicken Farfalle but subbed out the chicken for four large, succulent, monstrous shrimp.  Dear lord, it's good.  REAL GOOD. But honestly, what really sent my magic carpet a'riding was the soy-glazed edamame.  It's glorious; simply glorious.  Get it, drown your sorrows in it, propose to it, marry it, have five (beautiful) children with it, and spend your life with it.  It's just THAT good. Make sure you ask for David, your Cheesecake Factory woes will never go unanswered again.  May God bless you on your journey."
David D.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,25,8,3.0,5/6/2016,"Kobe burger was great. So was the chicken Bellagio was okay. Waiter was semi busy but to be expected on a Friday , but was telling us a bunch of nonsense that wasn't needed. I got my birthday cheesecake but did not receive a  happy birthday song. Overall great simple spot that has good food, but a little overpriced for the service and quality."
Jonathan M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",5,119,38,2.0,5/3/2015,"The dinner actually tasted pretty good. Otherwise, not much great about this place.   We arrived a little before 6 and there were a lot of people already waiting in the lobby. There was no sense of organization at the ""hostess"" or check-in table. Lots of people standing around it and it took us a minute to figure out who was in line and not in line. I think part of the problem is just the setup. It's right next to the cheesecake line and everything just kind of blends in to one. And the hostess didn't care enough to create a traffic flow.   I went ahead and grabbed a menu while we were waiting, because we had some place to be. I'm glad I did, because their menu is WAY too vast. Seemingly hundreds of items, and it even had an insert with more, lower calorie, options. Overwhelming. But, while we were waiting, i found something that sounded good.   At about 6:30 we were seated. Standard vibrating pager to notify you. Really can't complain about the time it took to get seated based on the number of people that were there waiting.    I hate the seating. We were put in a section that is basically one long booth on one side with tables every two feet and each table is supposed to seat a pair of people. I understand they are trying to cram as many people as possible into their space, but this was a bit excessive. No sense of privacy or intimacy. Will never go back for a romantic meal again because it can't be done.    Our server took a long time to come to the table and acted shocked when we told her we were already ready to order. My girlfriend ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta and I ordered the Parmesan herb crusted chicken w/vegetables. Server warned us that the jambalaya was incredibly spicy and made sure that's what she wanted.    Drinks took another 5 minutes or so to come out. I ordered water and it came in what looked like a mock beer mug with a giant handle. And no straw. Looked around and realized that's just their practice with water is to put it in that mug and not give you a straw. Straws at least give the illusion of a cleaner drinking experience, so I would prefer to have one. But, I don't think this place cares about stuff like that, otherwise they'd have more of an illusion of privacy in the seating too.   The food took FOR. EVER. To come. We didn't get our food for about 40 minutes. The server kept coming back and saying she was going to check on the food and that this was ridiculous, but it wasn't until about the 3rd time she said that that she told us the chicken was the hold up. What?? Ok... Chicken doesn't take 40 minutes to cook.   The food finally came. The ""vegetables"" looked and tasted like food lion canned green beans. I like canned green beans, but not on a 17 dollar plate. The chicken tasted good. The jambalaya wasn't remotely spicy. Granted I have a high threshold for spicy food, but when the server gives you a warning, I expect it to be HOT. My girlfriend does not have a high tolerance for heat, and she ate it no problem.    We didn't see our server again for a while... When we finally did we flagged her over and said we wanted to order a piece of cheesecake and get our check. We were still eating our dinner, so she asked if we had somewhere to be. I suppose that means she was at least somewhat intuitive, but I was really just starting to get impatient.    It took another 20 minutes to get our check. At this point it's about 740 and we have tickets to a show at the sandler center at 8. For some reason the server kept coming back to our section... She would take other tables orders and come over to our table and give a lengthy apology and tell us how bad sheet about how long everything was taking. This happened 3 or 4 times. Finally my girlfriend just said ""you ARE bringing us our check now, right?"" And she finally did. This wasn't just a problem with us, the people on both sides of us (whose dinner we saw intimately since they were 2 feet away) both were staring off into space, already with to go bags, irritated waiting for their check. We also had to remind her about our cheesecake, which we had to get ""to go"" at this point.    Short, sweet, and to the point. Their cheesecake kind of sucks. You do get a very large piece, which is nice, but I wasn't impressed with either of our pieces. Cheesecake is my favorite dessert and I get it all the time, and this place's cheesecake is incredibly mediocre. Maybe even less than average, which is insane since that's what the place is called. They do have a lot of varieties, which is nice, but they need to taste better.   I had the same impression of this place the last time I went to a Cheesecake Factory, which was about 8 years ago. Way too much to choose from, way too pricy for a chain, food portions are too big (give smaller portions and drop the price!), and the cheesecake is not good.    It'll very likely be another 8 years before I go back."
Rachel D.,"Chesapeake, VA",114,201,66,4.0,5/31/2015,"Although this place is a chain, I often come here with friends on Friday for their happy hour. They have a limited drink menu where the drinks are $5.50 and appetizers are also around that price range. Long islands are always the way to go! I can't say enough about the fried macaroni and cheese balls. Heavenly. They do a great job accommodating large groups and keeping your drinks filled. Love this location."
June T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",206,116,832,4.0,5/13/2014,Bang bang chicken and shrimp is my favorite dish. I highly recommend this place for dinner and of course the best cheesecake in Hampton Roads.
Bryan J.,"Hawaii Kai, Honolulu, HI",0,4,1,2.0,11/23/2016,"Let me start by saying Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant. However, tonight while I was eating my dish (I bit down on a chard of sharp plastic). We informed the busser and they remade my meal. We waited another 20 mins while my boyfriend just sat there. After eating and ordering dessert we got the bill and were very disappointed to have nothing taken off the bill. You would think with finding a huge chunk of plastic in the food they would take better care of you. I expected better hospitality from a place like this. Will be sticking to my restaurants at the beach. Very disappointed!"
Dakotah A.,"Jasper, IN",13,55,47,3.0,1/24/2015,"Good food, good drinks. Less-than satisfactory service, though. I understand it is a Saturday evening but our complimentary bread didn't come until our entrees arrived, we waited over twenty minutes for our cheesecake to come after we finished our meal, and we had to have another server flag down our waitress because we couldn't find her in our section for over fifteen minutes. She was very friendly and I wonder if maybe this was more of an issue of other staff slacking off causing her to have to do their work. Still tipped her well. Not impressed for a $70 tab for two people, though."
