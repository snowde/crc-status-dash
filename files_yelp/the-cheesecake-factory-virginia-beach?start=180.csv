Michele D.,"Ruckersville, VA",100,88,82,5.0,3/20/2016,"You can never, ever go wrong at TCF. This location was fast & the food was cooked to perfection."
Alex M.,"Hampton, VA",0,3,,2.0,9/26/2015,"Only reason this gets a 2 star instead of a 1 star is because the wait staff were great. The food, on the other hand, was bland and sub-par. Girlfriend had the Kobe burger and couldn't even taste the meat for all the sauce they slathered on it. I had Farfalle pasta. Barely any chicken in it, it was all covered in a very bland sauce which was vaguely garlic flavored but had zero salt and, thus, was essentially flavorless.  We also had the egg roll sampler at the start. It was good, except for the avocado egg roll, which was literally 100% avocado. I thought it would have something else in it as well, my mistake I suppose. The cheesecake was good, however. I'd probably have flipped the table over by that point if it was like everything else. For the price, you can do much better. I've honestly had better food at fast food places. Might have been an off night for them, I don't know. This was my first and last visit to Cheesecake Factory. Walking in, I didn't know what to expect. What I found was a menu of Mexican, Italian, and American dishes which seemed like a mess to me. The menu was also full of literal advertisements for clothing retailers and websites. Very unprofessional, in my opinion. Don't let the ambiance fool you."
Nico C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",8,22,46,5.0,2/20/2015,Had a wonderful night at the Cheesecake Factory. I tried something new with the California cheesesteak. It was really good. I'm not comparing it to a Philly cheesesteak. But the service was awesome. And the place was clam and relax. Definitely a 5 star place. The atmosphere and the people are great. If your looking for a place to eat on Friday night's this is always a great choice.  Great job Cheesecake Factory.
Tristan N.,"Norfolk, VA",52,25,67,5.0,12/31/2014,Fantastic vanilla bean cheese cake for the successful splurge day!
Darcie Z.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,2,,1.0,11/10/2016,I was served a huge piece of raw chicken. It was so gross I will never be able to come back again
Tyi C.,"Rockville, MD",70,6,19,5.0,2/8/2014,"I came here on a double date last night (Friday 8pm), the wait for the four of us was about 20-30 minutes. We were sat at our table on time and the evening was great! Our server was outstanding. He made us feel like celebrities! haha. Everyone ordered an Entrée and enjoyed it. I ordered the Moroccan Chicken Delish! We all shared a dessert and then after that we heading over to Funny Bone. Fun night!! I normally come to The Cheesecake Factory for Happy Hour on Fridays to take advantage of there generous Happy hour menu. You can get full size mojitos, Long islands, Margaritas, Cosmos, and my ultimate favorite the J.W Pink Lemonade. That's what keeps me coming back. The J.W lemonade is what I look forward to by the end of the workweek, haha. They also have the usually well drinks, wine, and beer on special as well. When you walk in just seat yourself in the bar area and you might have to wave down a server to start taking your order. The only thing I don't like about the Happy hour is that you can't sit outside and enjoy the specials. Bummer on a nice sunny day. But the interior is very upscale and inviting. I recommend getting to happy hour a little bit early (between 4pm and 5pm) since their happy hour is only for 2 hours (4pm-6pm). You need to allow enough time to look over the extensive menu and order as many drinks as you need. Because at 6:00pm on the DOT, you can not order from the Happy Hour menu anymore. Their computers won't even let the servers ring in the specials after 6pm. .  When I say the menu is extensive I mean it! It takes about a good 10 minutes to read the darn thing. My groups favorites are the Nachos, Tex Mex eggrolls, and any of the sliders. The menu definitely has something for everyone in your crowd. You will not be disappointed. 5 stars!"
Josh V.,"Chesapeake, VA",51,58,221,3.0,11/19/2014,"I have been here 3 times and have not once been impressed.  The atmosphere is definitely nice and the ambiance is very appealing, but if you ever try to go during dinner time, be prepared to wait....a long time! This of course isn't their fault but it is a reality.  It's located in the heart of the Virginia Beach town center and so traffic is always pretty high. They do have a nice bar area and everytime I've been it has been packed. i definitely wouldn't recommend trying to bring the kids with you as seating with high chairs is almost an impossible task, and even longer wait. The service, however has always been fine so that is a bright side of this restaurant. I've never been impressed with the food as it's just been ok.  That might be fine if I'm at a restaurant that has a quicker wait time and cheaper price tag, but this is a place that is more upscale. For the price, the food is comparable to any mid level chain restaurant like Ruby Tuesdays. Portion sizes are good but I feel like the menu is all over the place where they do several things ok, but don't particularly shine in any one area except of course....the cheesecakes! Now thankfully, they do live up to their name.  Their cheesecakes are, for lack of a better word, the bomb! The nice thing too is that you can simply go to the cheesecake service counter and get your cheesecakes to go if you don't really want to eat a meal there. I've had a various assortment of their cheesecakes but my favorite is definitely their toasted marshmallow smore.   It's a hefty price ($7 per slice) but it definitely takes me 2 sittings to finish the slice because it's rich, creamy and my stomach can only handle so much goodness at one time. If you have a group and can agree on the same flavor, the whole pie is a MUCH better value.  The only downside is that all their whole pies are frozen so it takes about 2 hours for it to defrost.  Don't expect to be eating it right away if you're looking for a quick fix. As a restaurant, I will definitely not be dining here.  But as a cheesecake place, it definitely does not disappoint!"
Abbie C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",575,392,624,2.0,11/8/2014,"Came here with my big sis to enjoy a night to ourselves sans work and (her) kids. With just the two of us, we thought we would get seated immediately. The guy manning the hostess desk was new so it took a while for us to get situated. No worries... been in that boat before. He was very nice about it and led us to our table personally. Once seated, my sis and I took a look over the menu. There really was no need since we just ordered what we usually get. After a post massage, we were starving and thirsty. Our waitress gave us the famous bread and some mugs of water. I don't really get why she did not give us any straws, but we asked for them and they got delivered to us eventually. Our food was delivered and both of us had made substitutions. I opted the asparagus instead of broccoli. They were some thick stalks of asparagus. Kinda difficult to eat instead of the thin stalks that they serve at other places. Another disappointment was my entrée of Chicken di Pana  as I did not feel like it was served fresh. It was not as crispy as I have had it before so either it sat in the warming tray for too long or was not cooked right is my guess. Still, it was what I wanted and the flavor was at least there. Both my sis and I were done with our meal and chose to have our leftovers be put away in to go containers while we waited on our cheesecake desserts. In the whole time we had been eating dinner - not one time was our water mugs refilled. Annoying since we were trying to stay hydrated post massage... I can get over that, but it took forever to get our check. Once I got home, I was expecting to eat my leftovers come to find out she had mistakenly given me my sister's entrée instead. Definitely had better service in the past. Quite a disappointing visit this time."
Calvin B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",71,166,73,4.0,3/8/2015,Food is good. Large menu. Happy Hour is pretty decent. Be careful of large crowds and long wait times especially on the weekends.
Lashunda P.,"Newport News, VA",161,9,15,5.0,5/3/2015,The atmosphere is nice and dim. Some people think its too dark but i like it! We sat at the bar waiting for a table. We ordered our drinks and decided to stay at the bar. The bartender was wonderful! Plenty of nice stiff drinks. He kept giving me the remainder of the drinks he was making for people. At one point i had like 4 different samples in front of me. I ordered the meatloaf dinner. When i tasted the meatloaf it was good but had a sweetness to it. So back it went. I ordered the blackened salmon dinner which was WONDERFUL!!! My man got the chicken/shrimp gumbo. He said it was ok( he is from Louisiana) so you know he don't play about his gumbo! We also ordered the cheesecake and chocolate cake to go. They were delicious. I definitely recommend this place.
Tiffany H.,"Chesapeake, VA",3,89,1,5.0,2/20/2016,Cheesecake Factory is great . I've been on some very busy days and I'm not disappointed . The service and great and they have a great upbeat staff . They have a happy hour between 4-6pm Monday thru Thursday I know for sure . I don't know about Friday but it's half off appetizers and drinks . I'm not a fan of cheese nor do I eat it . But I do order their fired Mac n cheese . Weird right ? I tried it one time and I'm addicted . For $5 bucks I get 4 fried mac n cheese balls they hold me over for some hours . Not to mention one of their specialty drinks on the side . I normally order a mojito of some sort . Their cheesecake slices are quite expensive but it's the Cheesecake Factory itself what do you expect . I normally just order an original cheesecake slice to go and it's runs me about $8 .
Maria C.,"Chesapeake, VA",425,563,9149,2.0,9/20/2013,"I think this is my last time eating here.  I have only had 1/4 great dining experiences here.  And they one time it was great was last year.  That one time I had the salmon blackened and it was great!!!  This last time I tried the spicy buffalo chicken sandwich...just ok!  I prefer Wendy's :/ this how great it was not!  The waitress she STARTED off great, bubbly personality, attentive, knowledgable all of that.  But I guess I had one too many requests because the sighs, huffing and puffing started... nevertheless, in my opinion, save your money and hit one of the other restaurants in the area...this is just blah."
Darren C.,"Tacoma, WA",75,18,26,4.0,4/4/2014,Great atmosphere with friendly service. Free bread.. but wasn't warm. Had the Ahi Tartare which wasn't what I expected but was quite good... crispy tortilla with avocado and sesame soy sauce. White Chicken Chilli was on point.. perfect amount of spice and heat... 9 of 10. Chicken and biscuits... Chicken was awesome along with the mash potatoes... the biscuits was a bit burnt on the bottom but the gravy made up for it... 8 of 10 Grilled pork chop with asparagus was good... pork chop was a little dry but the Apple sauce and mAh potatoes was delicious... 6 of 10. Asian chicken salad was okay... presentation would not have you looking for the chicken... but the chicken was delicious... 5 of 10. The Cheesecakes are a different story.... Red velvet cheesecake was outstanding. White chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake was on point. Fresh strawberry cheesecake was delicious. Key lime cheesecake was absolutely to die for.  All in all... was a great experience with great service with great food.
Samantha C.,"Huntersville, NC",3,13,9,1.0,2/28/2016,"We came in on a Sunday and waited almost 10 minutes for someone to greet us.  For a restaurant that my husband and I had never been we were completely disappointed.  The waitress left us with an extensive menu and no recommendations, nor did she ask if we were there for an occasion.  My husband and I rarely get to go out and he's been bugging to take me out for my birthday so we were finally able to.  After our order was finally taken 25 minutes after waiting on drinks- it took an HOUR AND A HALF to get food! Our entire dining experience was over 2 hours and not once did we receive an apology for the length of time it was taking for our entrees.  Finally after receiving food it was COLD! The waitress took 10 minutes to box up our food and sat a desert menu in front of me without saying a word and left again. Worst experience in a long time"
Trey S.,"Charlotte, NC",476,216,505,4.0,12/23/2013,"Went here on a recent trip up to the Hampton/Newport area.  This Cheesecake factory location is located directly off of Virginia Beach Blvd.  Its in what appears to be a fairly new and nicely maintained shopping center - Virginia Beach Town Center.  Its one of these new style of shopping plaza in which patrons are encouraged to park, get out and walk around to the plethora of shops around the premises.  I will say, you definitely loose the feeling of the local area being surrounded by the many chain restaurants and box stores, but that's the only down side of the location.   Upon walking in, you are immediately struck by the magnificence of the entire restaurant.  The tall ceilings and and open spaces make you feel as if you are going somewhere stately and grand for sure. I went here on a Saturday afternoon, before a concert at Hampton Coliseum.  Being by myself, I just went directly to the quaint bar, located to the right as you enter.  I liked that each spot at the bar was already set with a very assortment of silverware and cloth napkin.  I ordered a beer and the Chicken Factory Grande Burrito. The burrito, in a word, was simply magnificent.  It was bigger than I expected and quite tasty (that's what she said, lol).  It was stuffed full of chicken, cheeses, peppers and onions with a nice scoop of guac on the side.  How can you go wrong?   The service at the bar was great.  The food was magnificent.  The ambiance of the building is stately.  Eat here!"
Suomi H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",34,232,77,3.0,1/23/2015,I've been to this place twice in ten years.....there always so much hype around it...that I don't quite get...yes the cheesecake is amazeballs & the staff is nice but the food is typical chain restaurant aka Olive Garden/Bahama breeze/red lobster (don't get me wrong I like those places) ...
Maritza R.,"Virginia Beach, VA",124,66,128,4.0,1/31/2015,This place is pretty good for a chain restaurant. Well this location is was good anyway. I had the chicken enchiladas. It was a pretty good size portion. Hubby had shepherds pie which was pretty big too. We also had the potstickers. The sauce that came with that was delicious. We had the fudge cake for dessert. I would recommend this place.
Kool M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,25,2,1.0,2/26/2016,"The 2012 experience was so bad, still haven't been.  Have you seen a picture of me lately?  I like eating and all those dining $$$$ went elsewhere."
O O.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,72,,1.0,3/20/2016,Waitress afraid to get in trouble for supplying me a chair as I'm joining my small party at the table.  Last time there were many miscommunications with the seating rules starting with how was I supposed to know there were any rules. Too expensive to be treated like cattle.   Go someplace that is not a chain and our local economy will improve.
Tasha W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,29,,5.0,5/14/2015,"Great food, great cheesecake and a very nice building with vaulted ceilings and great architectural work.   A bit on the pricey side and a pain to get to because you have to park in a garage and walk to it but the food is that good that once in a while its worth it. My favorite dish is the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, which is a must try that's been featured on Food Network."
