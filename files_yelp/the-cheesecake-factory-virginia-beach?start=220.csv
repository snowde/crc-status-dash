Alyse A.,"Washington, DC",0,4,,1.0,5/29/2016,Never order take out from here. Put on hold for 20 mins and then had to wait in line for 25 mins at the bakery just to pick up our order. Waiting to see if our food will be cold by the time I eat it....
Toni S.,"Greensboro, NC",62,24,34,5.0,8/13/2015,"This is the fanciest place I've been to in a while. The food is incredibly exquisite. I've heard great things about this restaurant, and I was in pure awe when. I got the chance to experience it myself! I can honestly say that it has been a long while since I've been to a restaurant that I was 100% satisfied with my experience. The service was great, but their food was even better! My first time visiting this location, I ordered the chicken Madeira. They said that it was their most famous dish, and immediately when I received my food, I knew why! The chicken was so tender, and the sauce was nothing like any sauce I'd ever tasted. My second visit, I ordered their Fried Macaroni and Cheese Burger. It was smothered in Cheddar Cheese sauce! I was a bit confused as to why their Mac and Cheese is not a part of their regular side choices, but is a premium side, and you must pay a $4 up charge of you want this to be your side. Although, their Mac and cheese is to die for! You can taste the different variety of cheeses. All in all, the Cheesecake Factory is a winner!"
Stephanie H.,"Suffolk, VA",67,207,19,5.0,5/27/2014,"If you know me personally, you'll know that the CF is one of my favorite and most frequented restaurants. Even if I'm out of town, I'm going to manage to get to a local CF if time permits. My love for the CF started some 12 years ago when I was visiting family in Cali and we were shopping in Macy's at Union Square in San Francisco (if you've read my Macy's reviews, you'll know that Macy's ain't new to me baby) and CF just so happens to be on the freaking rooftop. Personally, I love outdoor dining and any restaurant on the roof with outdoor seating definitely peaks my interest. It was here that I had my first Chicken Madeira and a love affair with CF was born.  Fast forward some years later VB Towne Center was fortunate enough to get a CF!!!!!!!!!! I love this particular location because of the ambiance. Believe it or not, not all CF's have ambiance. They are well outfitted with the finest of marble and waterfallage, recess lighting, leather and shiny fixtures - but some lack that cozy ambiance. I can honestly say that I've never had a bad meal here. On the 50+ times I've been to this location, I've only had one bad experience with a server, that was promptly resolved by the manager. I enjoy the Louisiana Chicken and Pasta, Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, steak Diane, Orange Chicken, fried shrimp, avocado rolls, spinach and artichoke dip, fried calamari, shrimp and bacon club ANDDDDDDDDDDD the strawberry lemonade amongst other things that I'm sure I left out. I've also had just about every CHEESECAKE on the menu and my favorite is the Peanut Butter Ripple. So darn good. Love this place."
Justin P.,"Norfolk, VA",1,8,1,3.0,6/16/2016,"Food was alright, service took quite a long time to bring our meal, not really worth the price you pay outside their dessert."
Susi B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",34,14,16,5.0,4/11/2014,"What can you say...it's always fun & good.  Consistent in every way... Service is impeccable, although I ask for only one, Artuese, & he delivers. Unfortunately you have to be kinda wealthy to frequent this place, but combine Kroger Gift Card deals & get your 'free' gas & it suddenly seems within reason lol!!  Those who shop there understand where it is I'm coming from! I will always wonder why Town Center was put in Pembroke for many reasons I will not mention here, but I know it is taking it's toll in SO many apparent ways on the businesses that have embarked there.  What a shame.  I'll never get that...missed the real chance/place on 31st.  Nicely done Bruce! I will continue to go bc I like this place & will not judge due to location. A venue for good food, drinks & laughter.  For me anyway.  I am comfortable there! Oh and their Brown Bread is AWESOME!!"
Jean-Paul M.,"Chesapeake, VA",103,20,,2.0,8/14/2015,"I have heard a lot if hype about this place, and I have heard it is somewhat pricey. Yes, the prices were a bit high, but nothing outrageous. The food at best us mediocre. I was disappointed that for the ambiance they try to create, and the hype behind the name and the restaurant itself that I got the same boring food I could just about at any other chain for a lot less. I had pasta which I felt was just a large portion size with no thought process at all behind it on how to actually make it different. I understand that the place is a chain, but I really wanted the place to surprise me. I will say that the cheesecake is good. Honestly the money for the what you are getting I believe is more to pay for the real estate than the food itself."
Deyonne C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",105,16,4,5.0,9/11/2014,"As always this place is awesome. Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants ever. Always good atmosphere, great service and amazing food! Each location I have been to (Beverly Hills, CA, Marina Del Rey, CA,  Atlanta, GA and now Virginia Beach, VA) has been the same, always satisfied.  Keep it up!"
Ashlea L.,"Virginia Beach, VA",130,293,121,4.0,1/2/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is hands down my favorite chain restaurant. They have such a large menu that the decision of what to order takes me forever. I have so many favorites though, I end up getting the Chicken Piccatta  most of the time.  I usually get to visit about once a year (my biggest complaint is high in calories & sodium most of their dishes are) & I take full advantage. Drinks, bread, large plates of pasta, & of course dessert.  We dined in last week & everything was delicious. We went on a weeknight & there wasn't a wait. I love the Asian Pear Martini...so good. Our waiter was super friendly. He even ordered for my boyfriend who couldn't decide between the Jambalaya or some other Cajun style dish. He chose the Jambalaya & my bf was happy that he did. I tried something I never had before & went with the Bistro Shrimp pasta. It was delicious. It was so large that I was able to make two meals out of it.  I know it's called the Cheesecake Factory, but I would rename it the Tiramisu Factory...theirs is that good. I really want to go back & try the brunch soon!"
Amber D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,9,,5.0,10/21/2015,I feel like everyone has been to the Cheesecake Factory.......at least once I hope? Their menu is delish. I like ordering this to-go and they always load me up with enough for two days. Very generous helpings and well worth it
Dustin T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",3,12,3,5.0,8/30/2014,"Cheesecake factory is one of my favorite places to eat, and tonight they did not disapoint. We went in at about 4pm and suprisingly we were seated within 5 minutes. We were promptly approached by our waitress, whom was very friendly and kinda cute. Anyways, we were overwhelmed by the 20 page menu, like always. She took our drink order and quickly came back. Very fast! So for an appetizer we ordered the fried mac n cheese balls. I was not expecting them to be so good. There were four very large mac n cheese balls served with what i think was a vodka marinara sauce, i could be wrong, that worked amazing with them. I could have ate those for dinner and been good. But i ordered the house burrito which has rice, beans, grilled chicken, an assortment of a corn salsa, guac, sour cream etc. I always order it. Its HUGE! And it tastes amazing. Of course i only ate half to save room for Chris' cheesecake....which is actually a brownie cheesecake cake hybrid chocolate monstrocity of epic proportions.  Overall, service was perfect, food was quick and tasted great and dessert was wonderful.  If anyone from management reads this, consider putting a cheesecake sampler on the menu. Smaller bite sized pieces of your different flavors of their choosing would be wonderful. That way it wouldnt be so hard to decide which to get."
TerrevusAdijas G.,"Hampton, VA",2,2,,4.0,8/30/2015,The food and service was awesome. I recommend the mai tai drink or the Georgia peach daiquiri!
Ted S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",497,177,140,5.0,1/11/2014,"I appreciate The Cheesecake Factory's approach to mealtime. ""If you want it, we probably have it."" The menu is the size of a short story and they have so many delicious options to choose from!  I usually start with a raspberry lemonade and a hefty serving of the ""brown bread"". (I don't know what type of bread this is--but it's delicious!) If you're looking for some amazing appetizers you can't go wrong with the Tex Mex Egg Rolls, the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps and the Sliders. If you're a bit more adventurous and enjoy seared Ahi tuna, you definitely want to order the Tempura Ahi tuna roll. This is the appetizer that I could eat every single day! The sauce that comes with it makes that flavor explode! I come back just for this! As far as amazing entrees, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta is GREAT! I used to only get that every time I came. A bit spicy so watch yourself. The Cobb Salad is massive and if you get it with the peppercorn ranch you won't be sorry! Do I have to talk about the cheesecake? I mean...really? Get a slice and an espresso and enjoy yourself. My personal fav? The turtle!"
Takelia S.,"Waldorf, MD",0,3,1,5.0,5/29/2016,"The server we had was outstanding. We were in town for Memorial Day Weekend on vacation! She came over promptly, greeted us and gave us a great experience for dinner! We learned it was only her 1st week there. Wouldn't even know had I not asked her. Appetizer was great as well as our entrees! The only small complaint we might of had was we were sitting along the opposite side of where the food was made. A lot of banging noises were made against the wall.."
Jenna B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",54,10,,3.0,10/14/2015,They have great food however they don't make reservations on the weekend when they really need to and they are slightly pricey but they have great customer service
Justin V.,"Norfolk, VA",233,141,645,3.0,8/28/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory in Virginia Beach actually isn't a bad place to dine. I find it a little surprising, though, that it's constantly busy because it's not a great place - just a good place. TCF is a bit more of a jack-of-all-trades spot, witness to the seemingly endless amount of items on their menu.  I've dined here sparingly since it opened around 2004-2005, but I've had a pleasant experience each time. The service is very friendly and responsive, and that's really all you can ask for with the front of the house. The only qualm I have with the FOH is the wait, but that's because everyone goes here. Dinner service is tricky because there's a guaranteed wait, but I've had brunch where there's no wait at all. In regards to the food, it's decent. TCF goes out of its way to provide something for every type of foodie, so I applaud them on their diverse selection. That goes a long way towards customer loyalty and thus, repeat business. But that approach is a double-edged sword as there isn't an outstanding menu item (except for their cheesecake, of course) on the list. If they dropped a few items from the menu they can make inroads into making the remaining items outstanding, rather than good. But hey, maybe that's what people want. In my opinion, I want outstanding, especially for the prices they're charging. For anyone trying to impress a date or appease out-of-town friends/relatives, this is a go-to spot. It's centrally located, easy to find and there's something on the menu even the pickiest eater may like.  JV"
Vikas L.,"Washington, DC",1,4,,5.0,8/11/2015,"Great service, the server was very attentive and was friendly. The food was good. The restaurant was clean and nice. The drinks was made well."
Kimberly R.,"Chesapeake, VA",85,42,21,5.0,6/2/2015,"Food is absolutely amazing. The menu is very extensive. I always try something new when I go. I haven't had a bad meal yet. The cheesecake is the best hands down. I always get it to go because I'm always so stuffed when it's time for dessert. One thing is for sure though, get there early for dinner to avoid the long wait."
Cassandra J.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,8,,1.0,11/15/2016,"I don't understand how this huge restaurant can make business with the terrible service and the high prices.  I really do not get it.  I have tried to give them a chance 3 times and each time I was totally freaked out of how nasty the servers are. My last chance was to pick up a piece of cheesecake at the front counter. I walked in and the server had her back to me. I waited like 3 minutes and know that she saw me. I then asked ""Are you the person to help me"".  She turned around and said very rude "" yeah, i am the one!"". I told her what I wanted and she grabbed a piece out of the freezer and threw it on the counter...yes.,literally threw it on the counter. Needless to say, the piece of cheesecake toppled over in the package. I told her I did not want that one (especially since I was paying $9.00!!!!!!) and she grabbed another and threw the other piece in the sink.  WTF???  This was really the last time I go in this hole where they put their old cheesecake in the freezer and try to sell it to the -take out- customers.  BEWARE of this trick.  The cheesecake tasted almost sour.  Perhaps they will change their ways when people don't show up at their noisy restaurant anymore."
Seana M.,"Medford, OR",112,101,92,2.0,3/8/2015,"The only saving grace at my meal was Dawn. She was a great waitress. The wait was horrendous, but there were tons of tables available, the female bathroom had two stalls locked, while the other two had little to no toilet paper, they were out of shrimp. It just didn't meet my expectations. But Dawn W was AWESOME!"
Leah D.,"Kittery, ME",72,143,34,3.0,11/25/2013,"I have loved The Cheesecake Factory since I was a child. I have been to locations all over the country...it was a tradition of my mom and I. I have been to this location two times now and each time my food has been burnt. It's so disappointing for this store. It is in a great location but many people I know refuse to come back because their food is not up to par. The service is great. Now, for the cheesecake...it is delicious! But how can you mess up a cheesecake that comes premade? If you come here for food be cautious of what you order. It will probably come out burnt. I would be willing to spend the money if the food came out like it should."
