Brian A.,"Norfolk, VA",6,26,1,5.0,3/13/2015,Amazing every time. I had the new Eggplant Parm with a Greek Salad. It was awesome! No one has eggplant like they do. Great service and of course a slice of S'mores Cheesecake!
J David H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",754,1092,19910,4.0,8/22/2013,"We celebrated our wedding anniversary tonight and came in early with the kids so they could enjoy with us.  No parking issues, no line, no wait just before 5 PM, YEA!  We were taken to our seats quickly, but should have asked for another table as we were put directly behind the waiter area to the side, first time ever in this location.  It was not bad, especially at the beginning, but it got really busy in this small area.  Our waiter John was on top of things immediately and did a great job every step of the way.  A waiter (Alec) who had waited on our family a few times came over to say hello and thought that was very cool.  Most of the food came out great and I enjoyed the Kobe Burger which I love, love, love.  I got this burger the first week it was introduced 5 years, or so ago and got it for free that day if willing to provide feeback to the manager.  My wife got the flatbread and said it was good.  The kids both got bow tie butter noodles.  My son never complained, but after a while my daughter said it was hard and we returned it and turn around was around 10 min, or less.  We all got cheesecake which was enjoyed.  On our plates they wrote ""Happy Anniversary"" in chocolate, nice touch.  The bill was correct and we were out in just over an hour which is perfect.  We will be back."
Alison M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",223,1102,3407,5.0,12/3/2011,"I love love love love this place.  The prices are reasonable (not so high if you figure how much food you get) and the menu is enormous.  They're famous for their cheesecakes obviously  but they have delicious burgers, steaks, salads, and pretty much everything else.  I've been here dozens of times and never left unhappy with my selection even though I try to get something different at least every other time I go.  Service is usually very good.  Our favorite items: Buffalo Blasts for an appetizer, Factory Burger or Santa Fe Chicken Salad for entree, followed by Red Velvet Cheesecake for dessert.  MMMMmmm!  And their caramel macchiatos are DELISH too!"
Martina D.,"Norfolk, VA",161,191,7,4.0,2/19/2014,"Yes, the wait is almost always like 30 minutes+ but despite that factor, I can honestly say I've always had great experiences here.   We always get the same thing...appetizer, sweet corn tamale cakes, and entree, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  Just these two between 2 people and you will leave feeling stuffed and most likely have some to take home.  Usually, we don't share meals, but the portions here are always so big, there's no reason not to."
Manny B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",18,100,63,5.0,1/7/2015,Very helpful staff and great location. I come here on special occasions and I've never had a complaint!
Irene L.,"Cape Charles, VA",4,12,1,2.0,10/17/2015,Just ordered the fish tacos for lunch and I was disappointed.  The cod was in a heavy batter and it was oily.  The server was friendly and the dessert limoncello torte was delicious.  Maybe next time I ll enjoy my entree.
Aaron B.,"La Jolla, CA",13,145,52,5.0,7/25/2011,"Love the Cheesecake Factory. Really, it's  one of the best restaurants out there (not just in VB, everywhere).   Massive menu (it's a Book!). I can recommend Tex Mex Eggrolls & Avocado Eggrolls as starters , their salads are all good. The Chicken Madiera is an awesome entree. My favorite entree is the Bang! Bang! Chicken & Shrimp (curried shrimp & chicken with a huge ball of rice). Massive portions (Always something in the ""doggie bag"".)  Ok I'm rambling a bit, but before I go, go to Happy Hour (mon-fri 4-6pm) & sit at the bar - the Ultimate Margarita is fantastic.  Other than that, you need to plan ahead, reservations required unless you want to be waiting 45-1hr. The bar staff (in Virginia Beach) are awesome, there's  Samantha (Sam- although she's moving to Florida soon ) Mary & Tracy. Fun, engaging, friendly. They ""get it"". If there is a ""con"" as (opposed to ""pros"") it's not cheap. But, most of the time you're gonna have to pay for quality. Cheesecake Factory is no exception."
Gary H.,"Norfolk, VA",49,124,11,4.0,9/11/2013,"I'm not big on chain restaurants.  They lack the local and personal touch you get with mom and pop locations.   However, every once in a while I find myself visiting one of these big chains and I have to admit that my experience at Cheesecake Factory in Virginia Beach Town Center was actually really good. I came with a large group, so I expected slow service.  I was blown away by how pleasant and professional our server was.  She was prompt with getting out drinks out and getting our orders place.  The service was anything but slow.  I was surprised. Our food came out in a reasonable time, and the spinach mushroom omelette that I ordered was as good as some of the best I've had.  Nobody was unsatisfied with their food.   If you find yourself looking for a restaurant that has a little something for everyone--I definitely recommend this location."
Phyllis S.,"Hertford, NC",0,2,,5.0,4/3/2016,"Turkey Burgers  were nice and tender, great place ,but get there early menu has great meals and their cheese cakes awesome. Staff wonderful and price of meals great."
Johnny W.,"Newport News, VA",3,79,,4.0,3/16/2015,"This is usually only a special occasion place, if you've been to a Cheesecake Factory before you're already used to the PLENTIFUL selection of items on their menu. This was our first visit to this location here in Virginia Beach. Once again another visit for great service and plentiful food, we were too stuffed to get any cheesecake. We usually have to go for one or the other, food or dessert. We'll be back soon for a piece of cheesecake and then do it all back over again. You can never lose with The Cheesecake Factory, just like any other a place it can be a hit or miss on the visit but usually a hit here."
Robert L.,"Raleigh, NC",18,73,,4.0,2/19/2015,It was Cheesecake Factory.  Nothing particularly special.  Wait staff was nice and food was good.
Andrew T.,"Newport News, VA",60,24,12,3.0,2/12/2015,"Visited The Cheese Cake Factory's Virginia Beach location around 730pm on a Wednesday night. The place was busy, and waited 15 minutes for seating. The wait staff and management team were right on key. I never saw the bottom of my drinking glass. The food came out hot and fresh.  I ordered the Herb and lemon roasted chicken for my main meal. The mashed red potatoes were delicious. The chicken is self was cooked thoroughly and had a nice crispy skin. However, the lemon herb sauce was slightly under flavored, and I found the side of carrots to be under cooked, raw and hard. The vanilla bean cheesecake had a great crust, however, I found the actual cheesecake to be too light and not what was expected.  Over all, I give this location three out of five stars. :)"
Robin A.,"Hampton Roads Center, VA",0,58,1,3.0,1/30/2016,"Food is alright, tastes a little fake in my opinion. The menu is practically 30 pages long but nothing I have tried tastes fresh. Prices are a little high but you do get a huge portion. It's probably a lot more like 3 servings - regulate what you're eating! I have tried burgers, baked chicken, and steak but I refuse to try the pasta options because I am not paying $12+ for pasta with little vegetables or meat. I prefer going to mom and pop places."
Ashton E.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,3,,5.0,3/17/2016,This place was amazing  they ran it if seats so they forced tables together to help us they even sung my sister happy b-day and gave her free cheesecake the food was amazing my only complaint was it was a little slow arrival for he food to come but other than that loved it thanks guys
Renita N.,"Norfolk, VA",97,22,10,3.0,3/13/2016,Lunch time service was very slow seeing how it was right at the beginning of opening and not that many people were there yet. The waiter has a problem with his hearing. He would ask if we needed anything and walk off. Had to call him back to the table three times because of this. I asked for water and mint from the bar and he turn his nose up in disgust. He explained that he doesn't think he can do this but he will try. I suggested sure you can. The bar serves mojitos so there is mint. Once I received my food I had to ask him for a to go box and the server was upset about that. I have to go back to work and it took 45 to 50 minutes for my food to come out..
Mechell M.,"Chesapeake, VA",15,8,65,2.0,8/29/2013,"I'm not even sure why I bothered to wait! If you decide to go on weekends expect a long long long line. The wait is crazy as is! After 30-40 mins wait we were finally seated. Our waitress seems a little annoyed may be because we are a young couple and think we are not a big tipper.. I know those mind as I supposed I used to serve. However, I give her points because she did smile.  Food.. Just like your typical chain food. I order the kobe burger with fries. Hubby got some kind of breakfast meal can't remember the name. And for our little girl, fried mini corn dogs. Taste like a outside get together food.. Throw those frozen burger in the grill & take the frozen mini corn dogs in the frying pan.. That kind of food. Yeah, two star!"
Sally M.,"Astoria, OR",108,476,111,3.0,2/15/2011,"I love this place for appetizers, dessert, and Happy Hour.  I once had a date where we split the spinach artichoke dip and a slice of cheesecake and it was pretty much the best meal ever.  Their small plate menu is awesome- I always get the fried zucchini and chicken samosas.   I'm not a big fan of going here for a real meal though.  I'd rather pay less than deal with the This-Is-Why-America-Is-Fat portions.  Lunch options are limited.  I also am not a big fan of the extensive menu...so many choices!  Last time I just got a burger, figuring you can never go wrong with a burger...but the bun was super buttery and just made the whole thing a big, greasy mess.  I felt like I had to avoid touching my clothes for fear of stains.  Fries were delish though! I've been to a lot of Cheesecake Factories (mostly in the West) and the service is always top-notch."
Elizabeth C.,"Norfolk, VA",16,45,45,3.0,2/11/2015,We have been here several times. It's a hit or miss on quality of food. This time our avacado egg rolls were luke warm at best. Bread wasnt even warm. Butter was solid. Chicken Samosas were warm but not hot like something lighly fried ahould be.
Kimberly C.,"Norfolk, VA",0,37,,2.0,4/30/2015,"Went for lunch my cheesecake looked like it was sitting out for a while when I noticed the edge of my cheesecake was a darker yellow then the rest of my cheesecake, than before paying my bill a roach popped out my waitress killed it and had the guts to still have me pay for my gross and now ruined meal, when I called the manager he said oh we have company's that come and take care of that didn't apologize neither offer anything. Was disappointed!"
Jing H.,"Wahiawa, HI",4,19,5,4.0,6/29/2014,"Used to lived nearby and tried this place with my co workers. The food wasn't bad, ambience was the theme and it was always crowded especially in the weekends. But if you go there around mid afternoon, there was no line and have good conversation with companions. Always love their cheesecakes.  Always try a different one whenever we eat there. Price is reasonable."
