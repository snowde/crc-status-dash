Charlene T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",6,8,2,4.0,4/17/2015,"Everytime I visit Virginia Beach, I make a special point of coming here.  The atmosphere and decor is upscale and beautiful.  The wait staff is beyond compare and the food is indescribable.  Not only do you get a huge serving but the food is delicious.  We went early for lunch and got right in.  As always our choices were varied (chicken salad sandwich, lunch special of 1/2 sandwich, soup and salad and finally a giant burrito.  When asked about dessert all of us groaned.  So much food that we took half home with us, and wasn't able to choose from their vast display of desserts.  :-)"

Greg F.,"Alexandria, VA",384,577,313,2.0,12/3/2012,"I would love to give this place a higher rating, but twice they almost killed my wife, so no more than two stars here. My wife is allergic to cilantro. We make this perfectly clear every time we go in. This last time we even told our server the story. So, we start our meal off the fried dumplings like we always do. They come out on a plate in the sauce this time instead of a cup on the side to dip them in. Okay... clearly some changes were made. Not a big deal right? Wrong. They now put cilantro in the sauce!!!! Although our server was very nice, hello. We just told you a story about this place almost killing her from cilantro and you serve her cilantro. Damn! As soon as I took a bite I immediately told my wife to stop chewing as she was still on her first bite. See, I love the stuff and can taste it clear as day. Luckily, she had an epi pen on her so she stabbed herself in the leg and no death occurred. When we asked for the manager to come over it actually took him a few minutes. Then he stood there with this blank look on his face. This, well you're not dead look. He had no idea how to handle the situation. He comped our meal (packed the order to go while I went and got the car) but charged us for the dessert. To top it off, when we got home lemon cake didn't taste anything like it did before. They made some changes to the menu that sucked. A couple of items they removed I really enjoyed. Then they made changes to existing dishes like mentioned about. My four cheese pasta was terrible. Whatever you were doing in the past was good (as far as flavor), what you are doing now is wrong... Oh, and let's try not to kill anyone!"
Laken C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,1,,1.0,2/19/2016,"This was a god awful experience. Our server was horrible. Very rude and unprofessional, and her attitude ruined what should have been a great birthday dinner. I understand being busy, I was a server at one point as well, but there is no reason to be that rude. Will not be back."
Meghan B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",114,3,,1.0,1/9/2014,"Unfortunately, this restaurant isn't baby-friendly; or, at least, not accommodating for children who are not able to sit in high chairs yet.  While I understand not allowing the stroller to be by the table, there isn't a secure place to leave the stroller while eating and there isn't a good place to put the infant car seat. Usually, restaurants have a high chair that can be turned upside down for the car seat, but the ones supplied here not only are not safe for that but they even have warning labels against it. So, our car seat is squeezed between the booth and the table. Needless to say, we will not be back for several more months; which is disappointing because we use to come here often."
Anne F.,"Virginia Beach, VA",158,199,48,4.0,5/27/2014,"I really love the cheesecake of course! But I was really surprised with how good the food is here. Unfortunately the surprisingly good taste did not make up for the price tag, even for lunch. I will get my cheesecake as takeout next time."
Tyler F.,"Nags Head, NC",4,7,2,2.0,1/7/2016,"Was so excited because I herd that it was ""must try"" but was very disappointed. Everything was much cheaper then I expected. It was right off the bat I asked the hostess ""can we have a booth?"" When she replied ""yeah, that's where I'm taking you"" with the worst attitude. Then we sat and the server asked if we wanted lemon and we said yes. Then she returned with a glass with no lemon.... Turns out we showed up in time for happy hour. So we moved to the bar. The new server was even worse. She never checked on us or on our food, which was awful. Sour cream on my nachos was frozen like ice cream, and grizzle was crazy on my slider, I thought i chipped a tooth seriously.  Then we ordered a Togo an it was all good, but then the server came back right before the food came out and said we could get happy hour food Togo that she couldn't box it. It was super inconvenient and unprofessional. So she brought out a big plate of food we asked to have to go, and a tiny box for us to put it in. At this point I was furious and ready to go. I walked up to the bar and asked the tender for a box myself. Boxed my own food. And left. NEVER TO RETURN!!!"
Desiree A.,"Virginia Beach, VA",111,36,34,5.0,2/17/2011,"I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory. I hear that this restaurant chain is generally a hit or miss based on location, but The Cheesecake Factory in Virginia Beach is definitely a HIT! I grew up with The Virginia Beach Town Center, and the very first restaurants to be built at the Town Center were Smokey Bones, P.F. Chang's, and The Cheesecake Factory. This is probably the most beautifully decorated restaurant I have seen in America. Haha~ No lie. The ceiling paintings/wallpaper/I don't know what are absolutely beautiful. The place is romantic, and I don't think I've ever seen this place lagging. It's always filled with people with waiters running around. That's how popular this place is! However, this is downfall of The Cheesecake Factory. It's always so crowded! Even the bar! There's outside seating, but y'know, most people eat inside. It's always packed, and I think the longest I've had to wait for a table was at least an HOUR. They DO take reservations until 5pm, though. If you need a table past 5, I'd say reserve one for 5pm, but that doesn't save you alot of time. Additionally, the lighting at night is too dull, so it can kinda make you sleepy, but with people bustling around you, you should be okay. Although the prices are kinda high, the portions and the yumminess of the food definitely make up for it. The portions are proportionate to the price if not more. I have not tasted anything in this place that wasn't good! (I always get the herb-crusted salmon by itself or with something like shrimp, then I try my friends' food. Haha~) I don't need to say anything about the cheesecake, do I? All you need to know is that they're heavenly! I came here for lunch after my high school graduation, and they would sing to you. I came here for my 19th birthday with 24 people, and they were super accommodating, and they decorated my cheesecake! I'll post a picture up here. :D Anyway, love, love, LOVE this place!"
Sergio F.,"Elizabeth City, NC",0,6,,5.0,2/19/2015,I couldn't of been happier with the service and food. It was my first going to this location and it was exactly what I expected from a Cheesecake Factory!
Vanessa G.,"Norfolk, VA",485,318,606,4.0,12/29/2012,"The best feature of the Cheesecake Factory is, well, the cheesecake! It is very appropriately named :)  As for the rest of the food and drinks, they are mostly good, but pretty over-priced. The service is decent and the ambiance is posh. Nice for a fancy birthday bash."
JeriLynn H.,"Severna Park, MD",60,106,60,3.0,6/23/2014,"My husband and I came here for lunch on our anniversary.  We remembered that other cheesecake factories in the other states we've been to are a zoo at dinner time, so lunch was chosen.  Parking was such a pain! On street parking everywhere, parking lot parking all filled..they did have parking garages, but I have a fear of those.  When we were approaching there was many people outside waiting and also inside waiting.  To our surprise we were seated right away, table for 2 was instantly seated. We asked to be seated outside, and were put at this cramped little table next to a pillar. The table was fine but barely enough room for two.  Our waitress came up promptly and we ordered something off the drink menu and an appetizer, the fried Mac and cheese balls are amazing!  Eventually she came back with our drinks and we ordered our meals.  However, she never brought us any water.  We were waiting for our appetizer when a girl walks by with what we ordered and asks a different table if they ordered it, if I would not have noticed and spoke up she may have never found our table.  We finished our drinks and there was still no sign of our waitress, a different girl brought us our meals and we ordered drinks from her. The same girl brought the drinks we ordered from her to us as our waitress finally appeared and was in the process of asking if we needed drinks. We had also ordered cheesecake to go through this other girl since we were unsure when we would see our waitress again.  Overall the experience was similar to other cheesecake factories, but the service was under par. If it wasn't for that other girl, we would have probably not ordered another drink or cheesecake.  I don't think we will be back, the food was great as always, between the parking and this being the only one around for miles (I live on the otherwise of the tunnel).  I really hope they open one closer"
Marie T.,"Naples, FL",0,6,,2.0,1/7/2016,"Traveling on business and sat at the bar alone on a busy night. I ordered Shrimp Scampi and specifically asked for bread. 8 minutes go by, no bread. I ask the bartender again (I know it's not their fault, they were very attentive). Another 5 minutes goes by, no bread. I ask again and finally it arrives. Takes quite a while for the scampi to arrive and when it does, there is almost NO sauce. They basically brushed the bottom of the plate with a paper thin layer of sauce and piled plain noodles and shrimp over it. So dry. Sigh. I ask for a side of sauce. By the time it arrives, my food is cold. Not much flavor to scampi and the breading on the shrimp was thick and mushy. I appreciate that the portion of shrimp was generous but unfortunately I did not enjoy them at all. For a $20 pasta I was extremely disappointed. I'd only come here again for dessert to go."
Natalie R.,"Virginia Beach, VA",1,147,5,4.0,6/3/2014,For once there was not a long wait which is the main con for me. The drinks and desserts are always amazing. I recommend the limoncello torte or Linda's cake if you're a chocolate lover. For dinner I had the chicken bellagio. It is great. The basil pasta was cooked perfectly. The menu is rather large and can be a bit much but everything ordered is usually good. The only other complaint I have aside from the wait time is the wait staff. They are usually  very friendly and attentive when you have their attention. Due to the place being so large and busy you may wait a several minutes before they can get to your table just for drinks.
Amanda R.,"Newport News, VA",109,131,22,3.0,9/6/2012,"Came here just for dessert over the weekend. I ordered a slice of the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake, and my date ordered the Oreo Extreme Heart Diabetic Coma Cheesecake (or whatever it's called). We arrived about 45 minutes before closing time on Saturday, and had a server that was definitely feeling the stress of a long shift. He had a very harried demeanor, and his attempts to be friendly came off very cold and abrupt. He plopped down platters of bread and butter and disappeared before introducing himself or even asking if we wanted bread. Once he came back & we told him we were just ordering dessert, I guess he felt bad for not asking, so he started pummeling us with questions about our lives to make up for it... which was odd, since he never stood in one place long enough to receive answers to those questions.  ""You guys aren't hungry?"" *disappears* ""All that cheesecake - want a drink to go with it? Haha!"" *flees* ""So what brings you all in so late?"" *vanishes into thin air* Enough about the server though. The cheesecake was delicious, as usual. If you're a big chocolate lover, go for the Oreo Cavity Making Blood Sugar Skyrocketing slice. It's tasty. [If you finish it in one sitting, though, I cannot be held responsible for your impending doom.] Make sure you go earlier in the day though. Maybe the servers are a bit more well-mannered then."
David V.,"Ballard, Seattle, WA",9,3,4,5.0,10/31/2014,"Excellent service! Our waiter took great care if us and the Mexican tortilla salad was great, try it with cilantro dressing!"
Tierra H.,"Norfolk, VA",16,24,22,3.0,11/26/2012,"Honestly I only come for the cheesecake but I always get suckered in for everything else. Don't get me wrong the food is good but the desert is the showcase. I've never had a bad, unpleasant, or creepy waiter at the cheesecake factory. Don't expect to walk in with no wait on a Friday or Saturday night."
Yuriy T.,"Squaw Valley, CA",0,24,11,4.0,6/18/2013,"Nice location,we got seated right away,no waiting (big plus,we were hungry).Our server was nice and friendly and provide us a lot of info about new items in the menu and today's specials,plus he was always one step ahead on everything which is very nice.I ordered a meatloaf and it was one of the best meatloaf i got from CF (comparing to SF/Honolulu/Sacramento). Positive experience overall but i won't give this place 5 stars due to ~45 minutes wait for food plus food runner girl brought us somebody's else food 3 or 4 times (weird)."
Amanda B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,1,,1.0,11/9/2014,"Wait Time: Way too long. I went on the weekend, saturday evening. You cant make reservations, they have a first come, first serve policy...which is strange because similar competitor restaurants (BRAVOS or PF CHANGS) allow for them. So a party of 3 around 8 o clock waited 45 min for a booth. Space: Waiting for the table was of course uncomfortable because there is minimal waiting space. This results to a large crowd of people taking up the walk-in space, confusing the seating process, and the pick up area immediately to the right of the entrance. Tip: tell the host that you are in a party of three or four instead of two, even if that is your real number or request a booth only, if you do not do this, they will seat you in an uncomfortably tight position next to a stranger. We witnessed many couples be sat in odd booth/table arrangements that forced them to be sat next to strangers, and we also witnessed half of those people demand to be relocated in a larger space. For those who did stay in the awkward seating for fear of complaining were subject to an uncomfortable dinner because there is no privacy! Food: We possibly did not order the best dishes that the factory has to offer, but being first timers, our server made no recommendation and offered no advice...huge no no. Honestly, we have received better knowledge of the menu and local favorites by servers with lower expectations at chains such as Chilis or Applebees. Anyway, we ordered,and half of us received bland food, while the other half received cold food. So, we waited 45 min to be sat, then an additional 25 min to receive our food...cold and sub par. To make matters worse, one person received his food 5-7 min before the rest of us, his was hot, but once the rest of us were served, our food was not even warm. It was almost comical as if someone was playing a bad trick. While a member in my party requested extra condiments to cure the blandness, I requested my food to be delivered to me hot. The server asked me if i wanted the food reheated or prepared. I told her i was entitled to fresh food. Over All: I then waited an additional 25 min to receive my food correctly without a word from a manager or any decent attempt to make things right. We will never return. If anything this place is overrated. If you ask me, this place is for people who like to feel important, and spend little money. It is not an expensive place by any means but it gives the diner a grandiose type of experience...when they're not slipping and sliding on the greasy floor. Lucky for the factory the appearance of quality attracts people, however the actual quality of my experience will repel me from ever returning. My advice: Save a few extra bucks and go to a place like Applebees, you'll save yourself two hours and the aggravation of a sub-par performance."
Randy L.,"Portsmouth, VA",0,4,,3.0,11/6/2014,Service was great. Waitress was on point. I had the chicken wontons. Very greasy. Not spicy at all. Long wait for food. It was 3 pm and not busy. Dissapointed with experience. Don't mind spending $100.00 but this was not worth it. The one in Richmond is much better.
Samantha S.,"Clark, NJ",501,462,,4.0,1/3/2012,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here on a Sunday night a few weeks ago, while visiting his sister and brother-in-law.  Its located in the beautiful and fun Town Center, and was a short and convenient walk from the Westin nearby.  We had called ahead around 5 PM to see if we could make a reservation, which we couldn't, but the woman assured us there wouldn't be a wait if the two of us came around 6:15, and she was true to her word, which was helpful. The space is large and decorated like other Cheesecake Factories.  Our waiter was attentive and fairly prompt.  We love their bread basket, and their extra-large drinks, which mean never needing a refill.  I enjoyed my tomato-basil pizza, and my boyfriend liked his burger.  We split a piece of the chocolate chip cookie dough, which was divine as always.  I'd definitely return here when visiting the area.  It's reliable, good food."
