Jenn C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",87,7,2,5.0,8/14/2015,"eaten here a bunch of times- never disappointed. First time for my 7 month here- awesome customer service- they totally stunned me by bringing a ""baby plate"" with small pieces of bread and a chopped up banana! I will be going back just because that was so awesome and above and beyond!"
Ana P.,"Fort Belvoir, VA",132,156,402,5.0,6/17/2012,"We went here for dinner because there was a 30 minute wait for PF Changs. The food was good but not great. Their bread is to die for! I had the Garlic Noodles and it was very tasty, I just wish it had more vegetables and not a whole pound of pasta! My husband had the Steak Dianne with Shrimp Scampi but again, only 3 shrimp, little steaks and two big scoops of mashed potatoes. Everything tasted good but the carb ratio versus protein and vegetables was not right. I also tried the house merlot and thought it was lovely. My son enjoyed his pasta dinner which was, again a lot of pasta and the ""scoop"" (there was definitely like 3) of ice cream which was enough for all of us. I thought that it's good but definitely overpriced. I think next time we'll just have dessert."
Al L.,"Vienna, VA",3,26,1,2.0,6/6/2015,"Mediocre service on a Saturday night, appetizer served in good time however one entree came out and we waited over 20 minuets for the second entree, no one seemed overly helpful about it. Management took care of it however I will not be returning"
Shantelle S.,"Cheriton, VA",4,16,19,5.0,10/24/2012,"My favorite restaurant in the whole wide world. I am not sure if it is the staff, atmosphere, or the food but I can get enough of this place."
Sandy P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,12,,4.0,2/3/2014,"I've been fortunate to always have good service at this restaurant.  The servers always have a hospitable personality and were quite expedient with orders. They also seemed fairly knowledgeable about the menu.  And the menu selection is quite huge.   I've always enjoyed a meal here.  I've also noticed that the Cheesecake Factory seems to put some thought into how they lay out their tables, since the lighting seems relaxing and there are a fair amount of booths for family parties.  I think this is a good place to dine on the weekend."
Sara L.,"Norfolk, VA",128,236,64,3.0,6/21/2012,"Here's the thing with the Cheesecake Factory. You are going to pay for how the building looks and for the name. The food tastes pretty much like any other American style restaurant. You know as well as I do why we come here...for the cheesecake. My family and I came here to celebrate Fathers Day early. When we got here they said a 45 min wait *shudders* The gods were with us and we were called after only 25 mins. Everybody ordered and though it took a bit to get there (I understood because they were REALLY crowded) the food was good.  The cheesecake was SUPERB! Just writing about it makes me want to go back just to get a slice but I have to pay my mortgage, lol.  Bottom line, don't expect this to be a cheap meal because its not.  Oh and and try not to mind the people that WILL stare at you to hurry up. It's unnerving but it does get the point across."
J A.,"Cambridge, MA",38,66,65,2.0,7/25/2013,"So conflicted.  Usually, I think of Cheesecake Factory and I think of the weird chain that has unnecessarily decadent restaurants. The VB location is absurd. High ceilings and fake plaster everywhere. It's just a decorative mess that I ponder about quite often.  Then, there's the menu. It never ends. Ads on one page and the other page 20 possible entrees. Just an estimate, but the eating options must exceed 100. Who needs that? The prices are reflective of portion of food and definitely not quality. You'll have leftovers for two consecutive meals after the one you just had. Not bad! If you like mediocre pasta microwaved.  HOWEVER!! That cheesecake. Almost all of them are wonderful. If it's cheesecake time, I have someone drop me off at the front. I go to the cheesecake section, grab one to go and the night is great.  Another great thing about the CF is the Thai Lettuce Wraps. They have a peanut sauce that is delish.  Can we note how crowded this location gets? It must be its convenient location in Town Center or maybe people want to be seen and going to any restaurant counts as being out on the town. Whatever the case, I would love to know why it's so popular."
Amanda C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",13,35,12,2.0,9/20/2013,"I went to lunch with a friend. It was middle of the week and not busy. It took over 5 minutes for our waitress to come over. I have yet to have a meal here that makes me want to come back. It has always been low quality and tasteless to me. This place is good for one thing, the cheesecake."
Jenny D.,"Monroe, WA",7,38,,5.0,1/28/2013,"My sis and I love the Cheesecake Factory in general, and we also love this location! There's ample parking in the area and the service is always friendly at the very least. Their food always comes out hot and delicious. I have had only one lukewarm experience when I ordered a caramel macchiato but at least it was fixed very quickly. I recommend the huevos rancheros, The Navajo sandwich, Thai Lettuce Wraps,Vietnamese tacos, Chicken Bellagio, Bistro Shrimp Pasta(the most calorie filled dish of them ALL) ,Crispy Chicken Costellata, Peppermint Bark Cheesecake(my fave,when in season), Craig's Crazy Carrot Cheesecake, (just about ANY cheesecake while we are at it), and their absolutely delicious calorie filled mango smoothie ."
Brice E.,"Chapel Hill, NC",23,25,2,1.0,7/21/2012,"Honestly, why do people like the cheesecake factory?  I made the mistake of retesting what my body thought about a 2,500 calorie plate of carbs, too much taste, and overcooked fish and paid the price for a full day. Staff here was clearly first service job which is fine but they need to be trained to at least answer simple questions like ""what's the best fish dish""? And don't say, ""the tuna is ok of you like a lot of raw fish"". Terrible place."
Kristi I.,"Chesapeake, VA",161,239,232,1.0,9/20/2013,"My husband and I have been to this location a couple times on date night.  I've been here a couple of other times with friends for a girls night out.  Those times I would have given 2 or 3 stars.  Today I went with a large group (about 20) for lunch.  The experience was horrible.  They were not busy at all when we began to arrive at 11:15 for our 11:30 reservation.  They had our tables ready to go and we were seated when we had about 8 of our people.  Our waitress took our drink orders, but was not familiar with the beverage selection at all.  She told one guest that there were no flavored coffee drinks, but we found them ourselves in the menu.  We ended up having 2 servers- 1 at each table.  The man waiting on the other table did a great job, but our waitress did not.  One lady had to order her water 3 times before she finally got it.  One man didn't receive his lunch entree at all.  My order was input wrong.  The manager spoke to the man that didn't receive his food and said he could get a free dessert (to eat now or to go).  He never got that either.  The other table ordered dessert, got boxes, got their bills, and paid them before our server ever came back to ask if we wanted dessert.  We finally flagged the other waiter down to ask about our MIA waitress.  He said he couldn't bring us our bills since they were under her number, but he asked if we wanted to order dessert and boxed our leftovers.  A couple of people had already walked over to order dessert from the counter.  A couple of us decided to do without since we'd waited so long.  Several people in our group said they'd never go back.  It's a shame, because most of them had never been before.  Epic failure on customer service.  I won't be back either.  There are too many choices out there to give Cheesecake Factory a 3rd chance."
Rick S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",73,176,45,3.0,3/10/2013,"After once again learning the lesson, from a recent stop at Kincaid's, that a chain restaurant can still be pleasant, we again visited The Cheesecake Factory at Town Center this past weekend for lunch.  The facility itself is still impressive --- big, open-air spaces, high ceilings, exotic but tasteful decorations, lots of glass and light, tons of real plants, and upscale tables and booths/chairs for guests. After making our way past the cheesecake and dessert station, which sits immediately adjacent to the front door, we were immediately seated and began the walk through the restaurant's huge and very complete menu (I'm still not used to the advertising contained in their menu, but to each his own...).  Our server Brittany was very chatty and informative, and, since we were in a lite-kinda lunch mood, suggested we try their freshly-made chicken soup, along with several other suggestions.  My wife settled on a grilled chicken and avocado sandwich, which was served with bacon, lettuce and tomato and a creamy sauce (?) on grilled sourdough, along with too-salty but correctly cooked french fries, which she found very good (except for the french fries).  I tried the chicken soup, and combined it with a half-sandwich of chicken salad (with almonds) and a small salad.  I think the chicken soup was the hit of the meal, for both of us --- it turned out to be more of a chicken chowder, and included grilled chicken chunks, huge black mushrooms of some sort, green peas, celery, artichoke hearts and red peppers, all mixed in a creamy, thick chicken broth and seasoned with a little black, and probably cayenne, pepper.  Really superb, and saved the day for me from the underwhelming chicken salad (Brittany said it was home-made, but, if so, they need to fire the pantry chef).  And then came the big test of the meal --- cheesecake, or not?  Even though we'd had plenty to eat, we thought long and hard on this --- after all, it's The Cheesecake Factory, right?  So what if you can buy them at Sam's Club --- you can't buy THAT flavor at Sam's Club!  But then we thought about having a slice of THAT flavor --- for us, the Tiramisu, Key Lime Pie or Dulce de Leche --- and decided that it was gonna be hard to improve on a real slice/bowl of any of those yummy desserts by mixing the flavors with cheesecake and putting it all in a graham cracker crust.  Hard to duplicate the consistency of good Tiramisu when you mix it with cheesecake, we thought.  So we passed on the cheesecake, and felt a little guilty --- like we hadn't kept our end of the bargain, when we came in for lunch. So I think this visit was about like the two or three others we've made here --- a lovely, comfortable restaurant outfitted with tasteful furnishings, combined with average plus service, and average minus food, excluding the cheesecake.  Food-wise, we learn again and again the cardinal rule of dining in chains --- figure out what they do best (in this case, cheesecake), and don't get carried away with the rest of the menu.  Every time we come in we say to ourselves that, even though we can buy the same basic cheesecakes at Sam's, we can't eat it in such opulent surroundings in our own kitchen, and we're just gonna get a piece of cheesecake and a coffee.  And I think we've finally decided that that really is the right course of action for a visit here --- although now maybe we'll think about adding a cup of soup, too."
Melinda W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",1,40,2,2.0,10/15/2013,The only thing good to say is the cheesecake and drinks are great. The seating is so close together you feel like your speed dating the way it's set up. You can't have a conversation without everyone hearing it next to you. Pricey as well and the pasta was so oily. Probably will never go again unless it's to sit at the bar and drink eat have a slice of cheesecake.
Taylor W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",2,26,3,1.0,8/3/2014,"Gesh. I hate to do such a negative review because I actually did love this establishment but the mediocre service that my husband and I received was unforgivable.  It was a Saturday evening and as usual around this time they are usually swamped with customers. I was told initially that the wait would be 40 minutes. I had no problem waiting because mind you - this is one of my favorite restaurants. We got there at 6:40...time goes by and it approaches 7:40 so something told me to go inside and see what was taking so long, then I was told ""Oh, we have been waiting for you"". I was confused because our devices never vibrated nor lite up. We were finally seated and we were approached and greeted by our waiter. He seemed to be in a rush and took our order for the appetizers + entrees very quickly. Our appetizers came out in a responsible time. Now on to the entrees, when our food came out it was warm, seemed as though it was waiting for a while before a runner came to give us the food. This is not what I expect from the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi and Steak Dinner and my husband has the Chicken Madeira which he said tasted like wet chicken. My shrimp was pretty good but - my steak was as hard rocks I kid you not. I was so underwhelmed with everything that night. Our waiter never came to check on my husband and I but strangely enough he was very attentive to everyone else. He would blatantly walk right by our table (seeing that we were out of water) and not even bother to fill up our glasses. I don't know If he thought just because we were a younger couple that we wouldn't tip that well. Let it be known that I tip every well $10-$20 when the service warrants for It. And tonight was a no bueno . So we finished our meal and I asked to speak with the manager, I will say he was very apologetic on the experience that we had and tried his best to fix the situation. He offered some coffee or desert which was nice but if I wanted some desert I could have bought it myself. You know? It wasn't about getting anything complementary It was the principle. And being that I was a regular at this restaurant It really did rub me the wrong way. I don't know if they had a new cook there that night but it was not the best. And definitely not worth the wait. It will be a while until I return again."
Rachel H.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",57,138,43,4.0,2/11/2011,"I love Cheesecake factory period. I have been to  the ones here locally to me in the Chicago area.   The food is standard across all restaurants, since I was dining alone no appetizer for me :-( I got a cheese burger which was good...nothing extraordinary but not bad. The fries were something else...very delicious. I got a Plain cheese cake to go which I ate later in the night...delicious! The wait staff were extremely friendly and attentive."
Boyd B.,"Chesapeake, VA",7,3,,2.0,3/20/2014,"I suppose having to wait to be seated on a Wednesday night at 6:30pm is supposed to be a testament to a quality dining experience. However, our party of ten waited for over an hour. Though the waiter was attentive, he very rushed throughout the meal, passing by my raised hand twice to get to the table directly behind me. This may sound trivial, except for the fact that I could turn my chair around and touch that same table. The high ceilings are beautiful, but the ornate decor belies an incredible misuse of space. All in all, this review would have received at least four stars if the food matched the price tag. Our group ordered the nachos, which were superb. I wish I had eaten more of the nachos than the Moroccan Chicken that I ordered as an entre. The chicken was not seasoned and was drastically overcooked. In addition, it didn't even feel like a full meal. No vegetables? Grilled chicken on a bed of couscous left the meal wanting.  To recap: long wait for EVERYTHING, attentive but oblivious waiter, overpriced and poorly prepared meal, an ineffective use of space, and an aesthetically pleasing, yet noisy atmosphere = 2 Stars. Final disposition : I definitely won't be returning and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
Maria B.,"Marysville, WA",32,30,2,1.0,4/4/2013,"I was a former fan of The Cheesecake Factory before my recent experience with food poisoning. I recently had dinner there with my visiting family and decided to share a piece of tiramisu cheesecake for dessert. Not only the day after, but up until now, my husband and I are suffering from food poisoning according to my doctor. I called the location to complain, and they asked me numerous questions and initiated what they said was an ""investigation."" They then had me wait for a follow up from their corporate offices, who then asked me more questions and left me with nothing but an apology. I don't know if I'm wrong, but isn't it customer service to at least offer any sort of one-time-exception to make up for this huge boo-boo they made? I work for a cell-phone company and we throw out credits on bills when we know we're the culprit for the errors. Once the corporate office called and asked me questions for their ""investigation"" to only benefit them, without going an extra mile for me? The customer? Horrible values to show to a customer, CF."
Ari C.,"Oceanside, CA",54,19,33,4.0,8/6/2011,"Let's just say I come here for 2 reasons...to satisfy my cravings for their Lettuce Wrap and Red Velvet Cheesecake!!!! Only thing I didn't enjoy was our server who seemed a bit weird and short and hardly smiles, bad bad bad. Good thing I love the Red Velvet so much nothing would hinder me from going there as much!"
Stephanie W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",137,294,262,2.0,12/28/2014,"I wish I could rate this place on cheesecake alone, because it would be 5 stars for sure. However, I cannot justifiably rate their food with 5 stars. The 4 or 5 times I've been here to eat their food has left me wishing I had gone elsewhere. Maybe their problem is that their menu is too extensive. I think the cooks must have a hard time perfecting anything when they have 100 different items to prepare. (okay 100 may be exaggerating, but seriously). Why not make your menu smaller and focus on the things you do really well? I wish I could tell them what they do really well, but I've not eaten anything that warrants trying it a second time. Even though the meatloaf is on their ""Signature Specialties"" menu, avoid it at all cost. It's dry and flavorless. Don't waste your time on the Factory Grande Burrito either, another ""Signature Specialty"". This was my most recent attempt at enjoying food there. When it got to my table, the inside was cold. I told my waitress and she asked if I wanted them to make a whole new one or just put it back in the oven to warm up. Instead of waiting for a new one, I just asked her to have it put back into the oven. When it came back to me, you could tell it had been left in the oven too long because now my tortilla was hard as a rock. I dissected the burrito and ate the insides, but the majority of my burrito was rice. It barely had any chicken or cheese. I mean, literally, the burrito was 3/4 rice. My husband ordered a Smokehouse BBQ burger cooked medium-well. The burger was well done, and then some. He ate it because he's not one to complain or send things back, but you could tell he was disappointed. I have given up on ever coming here to eat anything other than cheesecake."
B C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,5,,2.0,1/19/2014,With all the better places in VB that aren't over priced chain restaurants why would you even consider this place? I like smaller menus that make the dishes have more feeling to them. When you have a book as your menu it seems like all the restaurant is is doing is throwing food at the wall and seeing what sticks. If this is something you like add good cheesecake and that's what the Cheesecake Factory is all about
