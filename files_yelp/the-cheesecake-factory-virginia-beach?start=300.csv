Rashell M.,"Fort Worth, TX",55,103,102,2.0,9/21/2013,Rating based on service. I literally had the worse waitress ever. She was rude and u could tell she hated her job. Food is decent I mean this place is a chain. Cheesecake is awesome this past time had s'more cheesecake.
Chris W.,"Wake Forest, NC",19,5,,3.0,3/7/2014,"Ate here tonight for the first time.  I'll say up front our food was great and the service was excellent once we got in.  That being said, I was disappointed with our 40 min wait to be seated. They didn't have enough room inside for everyone who was waiting.  We probably should have gone somewhere else, but we wanted to check it out after hearing a close friend of ours rave about it.   We spent the first 20 min of the wait huddled against the building trying to avoid the rain."
Vanessa J.,"Colorado Springs, CO",41,167,14,3.0,9/6/2011,"This was pretty much the same as every other Cheesecake Factory I've ever been too. Gargantuan portion sizes at reasonable prices. And the chocolate raspberry cheesecake was pretty phenomenal.  However... The waitress was VERY pushy! I was there with my mom and before she was even halfway done with her meal the waitress was trying to talk about dessert and didn't really get the hint the first time my mom said give us a little extra time. So that was the one down side, but otherwise a nice dining experience. I would definitely recommend the BLT with side salad off the Skinny-licious menu. It was the perfect size for a reasonable meal and I had just enough room at the end to share a slice of cheesecake."
Richie A.,"Manchester, WA",11,240,26,4.0,11/3/2011,"I always enjoy a restaurant chain that can provide consistent food and for the most part service everywhere I travel and go.  This location is again one that I will visit once more.  Cheesecake factory does make the effort to do this at every location I have ever visited. Dropped in today for salad and was pleased with the produce freshness, appearance and taste.  Some think that $ 15 for a large ( HUGE ) salad is pricey but for the quality and quantity, No Problem.  And side Note : Nom and Nom"
Steve R.,"Virginia Beach, VA",21,20,86,5.0,7/29/2011,"Short and sweet.......  pound for pound in atmosphere, food quality, PORTION SIZE, choices, and bang for the buck, one of the best if not the best spot in the Virginia beach area...you could wait a little while for it but never gone wrong there.  I try a lot of places and always use cheesecake as the comparison!  Solid solid place!!!!"
Irene T.,"Norfolk, VA",3,32,5,4.0,9/22/2010,"One of my favorite places. The wait time can be long if you go at night but there are very efficient in getting you seated. The  menu is massive, it can take a while to figure out what you may want to order. But the food is top notch, everything I ordered was amazing. Even the specialty drinks were pretty. The environment is beautiful with the high ceilings and artsy decor, you can find a lot of things to talk about. The wait service has always been friendly and accurate. Finally, the cheesecake menu is just as massive as the entrees. I've made it a point to try every flavor available and have yet to do so.  If you haven't gone there yet, please put it on your bucket list."
Charles C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,9,,2.0,12/23/2015,"Go here about once or twice a year with the family for special occasions. Not a cheap place to go for dinner but the servings were always large and the food prettu good. Went more for the atmosphere and ambiance than anything else. Went tonight and tried the Chicken Madeira which was my first time. The chicken tasted good and was moist, however, for 17-18 bucks I expected a lot more on the plate. The potatoes were okay but slightly undercooked and not mashed enough. Medium sized chunks of potatoes were in there, maybe because it was too tough to mash. My mom got the chicken di raza? It was a parmesan chicken than came out really dry, but her potatoes came out well done. Sister got the avocado chicken sandwich and that was stellar and excellent according to her. My brother got the orange chicken which is what he always goes for, and I must say he would usually share some, but barely had enough on the plate to share. The same plate would come heaping full at other times, this time it was barely a full plate. We usually pass food around and enjoy the time together, but this time it wasn't as enjoyable due to the okay to blah food for the most part. He did say it seemed like they used too much soy sauce on his orange chicken and when I tasted it, it seemed wayyy too salty. And it was white rice he asked for, so that should have tamed it down a bit too, but it was too strong. The cheesecake as always was the best part, and the pumpernickel bread. I got bored half way through my meal and went back to the bread. Considering we spent well over a hundred bucks here, will probably not come back here again. It's usually a great place for a family meal, but the portions have gotten significantly smaller, the prices stayed the same, and the food much lower in quality. Will try some more of the local places next time around and spend less money and probably be more authentic. Give it two stars for the decor and lighting, it's beautiful inside. I must say though, the constant clattering of plates and other things in the kitchen can be heard while eating, management may want to consider putting a wall up or atleast a sound partition. Felt like someone broke plates almost every 5 minutes. Our waitress was extremely cool, came around and filled up our drinks when we needed, and was very attentive but not overbearing. Not her fault that the food was subpar."
Alicia S.,"Boston, MA",61,589,27,2.0,5/15/2011,The worse cheesecake factory I've ever had :[. We were on a date night and our buffalo blast were good. Yet our chicken piccata was gross. My chicken was super hard and was not easy to chew through. I loved the strawberry lemonade but this isn't my favorite CF
Carnelia G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",27,358,73,4.0,8/19/2010,"Beautiful Tuscan décor?  Check.  Mouth-watering cheesecake selection?  Check.  Trendy downtown Virginia Beach location?  Check.   Cheesecake Factory is nice and is certainly the new dinner date, special lunch, let's celebrate a little more classy than usual spot.  The only thing that disappoints me is the food menu.  It seems so limited.  There's like two steaks, a burger and chicken--nothing special that I would make a point to go here above other restaurants with a more extensive menu.  I come for the cheesecake.  Period."
Shane A.,"High Point, NC",466,340,313,4.0,7/16/2012,"All Cheesecake Factories are the same huh??  Tacky decor, lots of people overweight and over indulging in things they know they shouldn't. This location is located at Town Center and right across the street from the parking deck.  We ate here on 7/13/2012 and arrived around 9:00pm.  We waited about 25 mins to get seated and ordered Dynamite Shrimp and Teriyaki Chicken for entrees. I would NEVER order the shrimp again, where were they?  It was nothing but breading....  TYPICAL of a place that doesnt know anything about seafood yet they try to venture out. The chicken was good, as it always is.  I have ordered it before and never had a bad experience with it.  I do change it up a bit though...Instead of rice, I get Mashed potatoes.  LOL Service was slow, on the kitchen aspect (Waitress was GREAT) and food was good except for the shrimp.  The best thing here in my opinion is the bread and butter.  The butter has the best taste and I could just eat it all day. I didn't do cheesecake, however, I have before and they are all good.  After all, that is what this chain is known for."
Angela W.,"Elizabeth City, NC",0,6,,4.0,1/6/2015,"I always love going to the Cheesecake Factory. The food is always delicious and the service is delightful  I most recently went with my fiancé about a week ago and it was wonderful. Our waitress was Don. She took great care of us and was really nice. My fiancé ordered a burger and I ordered a burrito grande. Both were really tasty. We were also given some yummy fresh bread after ordering. After our entrees we couldn't pass up on dessert. My fiancé ordered the red velvet cheesecake and loved it. I am actually not a fan of cheesecake so I ordered the apple crisp and it was great! We came to the conclusion that next time we need to double date when we go here so we can partner up on the dessert since it was too much for one person. The menu has everything you can think of on it. There's pizza, burgers, Mexican, Asian, pasta, seafood, and comfort food. The prices are a little high but you get your money's worth. We always love coming here and trying out new things on their enormous and delicious menu."
Milo R.,"Dover, NH",0,206,55,4.0,12/25/2012,"Love this place, you've gotta try the Vietnamese tacos.  Yea, the cheesecakes are good but I love the the Vietnamese tacos.  I ordered them for the main meal, for my self, not to share.   They are that good."
Joe S.,"Suffolk, VA",4,10,1,4.0,5/26/2013,"My wife and I went here yesterday and it was excellent.  My wife had the Bang Bang Chicken (a meal she craves often).  I tried the Moroccan Chicken for the first time.  Oh my goodness was it delicious.  Beautifully presented, it was so full of flavor and colors.  The portion was quite large as well, so I had plenty for leftovers later that night (with a piece of Reese's Chocolate Peanut butter Cheesecake).  The cheesecake was very good, but a bit rich.  Dinner was definately the star.  I also ordered orange juice which was fresh squeezed, but it seemed like they added a little something to it that wasn't quite right.  That was the only thing that caused me to take it down to 4 stars.  Mid-day Saturday was a great time to go, no wait at all."
Brian K.,"Greensboro, NC",105,730,264,3.0,9/4/2012,"Large portions, good food and delicious cheese cakes.  Sitting at the bar for dinner is the easy way to go for a single guy."
Tawny A.,"Newport, RI",210,641,231,4.0,11/7/2013,"Sheesh, this CF is HUGE!!! Built for Mount Olympus or what?! Maybe the scale is so large to make their giant portions look smaller? I don't know- what I DO know is that you can never go wrong with a Cheesecake Factory. It isn't always my first choice- but it is a major crowd-pleaser! And no wonder- their food is delicious! It also is consistently noted as the unhealthiest restaurant in America- blowing most fast food chains out of the water.......which means when I do Cheesecake Factory- I go big! If i'm gonna calorie bust......I make it epic. I'm talkin' Bang Bang Shrimp, Orange Chicken, Pasta Da Vinci, second helping of that yummy bread, and a giant piece of whichever cheesecake has the most cookie/candy bar/whip cream on it......and I flush it down with a few cocktails. I like to roll out of there like Violet in Willy Wonka's factory. And it may not feel like it when I am driving home with my jeans unzipped- but it is SO worth every heavenly bite."
Leona B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",118,238,253,4.0,8/19/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is definitely a big, fat Cheesecake-y cut above most chains.  First of all it's beautiful inside and out--warm colorful old world looking decor decor, high ceilings with fauxed walls and frescoes.  And the food is darned good. My husband and I had dinner there. He had a pasta dish and I had the flat iron steak with crispy onion strings and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly and melted in my mouth.  We didn't have room for cheesecake--I don't know how people do. I've had cheesecake at their smaller location at MacArthur Center--that one just has wraps and sandwiches--and it's quite delicious.  Apparently the VB location is also a big late-night bar hangout. I always see a bazillion people milling around there."
Chel R.,"Kill Devil Hills, NC",279,354,438,5.0,7/16/2010,"I can't believe I can even walk by this place without putting on 10 lbs. If the meal portions are not enough to give you a heart attack, the dessert will certainly kill you.  Holy heavens, it's good. I never eat at chain restaurants. They are never as good as local establishments. Everything tastes so processed and prepared. But Cheesecake Factory is the exception. I really have loved everything I've tried there, including pizza and cheese pastas. It's really hard to get a table, so I usually will end up just stopping by to get a slice of cheesecake to go. A slice is expensive, but usually lasts me 3 servings. I can't imagine eating it all at once. My favorites: Godiva and Toblerone cheesecakes. MMMmmm. Worth every minute at the gym."
Bonnie H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",39,163,17,5.0,3/4/2012,I liked the lettuce wraps better than the cheesecake!! Next time all I want is Champagne and Red Velvet Cheesecake!
Angela I.,"Spring Valley, CA",135,104,88,4.0,8/10/2009,"I looked into the jewelry case-like display of cheesecakes and there he was -- my old friend was back!! Pineapple Upside-down Cheesecake. It had been so long, and now you have returned. We haven't made contact in years and here you were, of all places, in Virginia Beach. It was like old times. You are so deliciously evil. I know that we should not be together but I can't help myself. I'm so weak. So here we go again: we both get what we want and I am left with... regret. Til next time."
James M.,"Henrico, VA",122,316,293,2.0,1/12/2010,"Overrated factory food (factory in a bad way).  The bar staff is great and definitely helps to make the experience better but of the +/-10 times I've been here (unfortunately, the boss loves it), the kitchen has messed up the order (overcooked, undercooked, poorly timed, wrong food) 5 times."
