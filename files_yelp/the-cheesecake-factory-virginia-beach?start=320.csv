James M.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,8,,5.0,6/7/2014,"My wife and I really like this place, because it has a peaceful ambience, the prices are reasonable, and the quality of the food is good. Perhaps the greatest thing about this place is its exciting deserts, so if you're planning to go there make sure to burn some extra calories in advance to be able to have a delicious cake after meal without feeling guilty about it ;)"
Travis B.,,107,58,4,5.0,4/1/2012,"This is probably one of the only ""Chain"" restaurants like since I typically like to eat at local businesses. That being said I've never been disappointed with this place. I've always had outgoing joyful services and the food has always been great. I love the Fish & Chips and the Tuscan Chicken. Cheesecake: Godiva: Perfection on a plate."
Sasha B.,"Washington, DC",71,541,27,4.0,10/24/2009,I felt SO suburban going to Cheesecake factory but our dinner dates  insisted. I hate chains but we actually had a pretty pleasant experience.  I'm not sure if reservations were made ahead of time but all I know is that at 7PM sharp we were all seated (6 people).  The service was great - shocking I know. There were six of us but somehow the ordering process was seamless...everything was brought out correctly. The wait staff knew the menu inside out and was always friendly.  The food also came out perfectly timed and when it came time for the bill the waitress split the check into three bills - one for each couple. She was very nice about it. The food my man and I had was delicious - can't complain at all.  Basically I think this Cheesecake factory must have really good management because everything went smoothly and the staff was on top of it.
David D.,"New York, NY",61,312,774,4.0,12/22/2011,"The new Skinnylicious menu provides a nice, concise and healthy alternative to the normal substantial selections. The pear and endive salad was quite tasty and filling yet under 600 calories.  Just remember that most of the cheesecake slices average about 1100 calories!"
Breon H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",17,32,55,3.0,7/2/2013,"use to be a very upscale restaurant ,now the secret is out and even though its been here for a while on the weekend expect to wait about 30-45 mins to be seated, but during the day you can get in very quick for lunch with out it being packed, but other then that food is always drinks are a bit pricey"
Betty M.,"New York, NY",55,206,1,3.0,1/3/2010,"Pros: Cheesecake Cons: Nothing Special   Thoughts: If they can mess up the Cheesecake, I surely like to know why they are still alive. Therefore, until another pastry shop that comes up with a nicer slice of cake, this will do"
Michael S.,"Norfolk, VA",7,9,,2.0,3/24/2012,"Upon entering, I was really impressed. The atmosphere has an Egyptian museum look. The staff was friendly. My wife and I ordered and that is when the adventure began. 20 to 30 minutes later the food came and my wife's order was the incredible crispy chicken. I myself had the Salisbury steak. When it arrived, it looked good with the garlic mashed potatoes and long green beans.    Now the meat. Well, it was redder than I preferred and after waiting the waitress to come back to check on us (20 minutes) I asked for it to be cooked more thoroughly. So, 15 to 20 minutes later it returns and I am starving at this point. I grab the knife and slice a little bit of heaven and behold.... still red. So, after another 10-15 minutes of trying to flag my waitress, she returns and and sees the poor abused steak still red. I don't have to say a thing. She apologizes and says  this has been a real ""off day"" whispering something about problems they are having with the chef that day or something. Unfortunately, I did not have time for another warm up.    They did make it right but maybe next time they will have their act in order or another chef. However, I could not pass up the opportunity to get a big slice of raspberry lemon cheese cake.  Ohhhh soooo goood!!"
Malita N.,"Chesapeake, VA",82,23,3,1.0,2/5/2014,My husband and I ate here this weekend for our anniversary and it was terrible. I was really looking forward to it because this was my first time ever eating at the cheesecake factory and I had heard so many good things about it. the restaurant itself was BEAUTIFUL and everything was great until we got to our table and met our waiter. the waiter seem preoccupied from the beginning. I'm not sure if its cause we came before they were about to close or what but the whole meal seemed very rushed. he pressured us for our drink order and practically made us order our meal with our appetizer because he was ready to get out of there. HOW RUDE!!! For the amount we paid we really expected better service. He got or order totally wrong and didn't even really apologize at all. We asked to speak to the manager but he acted like he didn't even hear is and just bought us our check. I have heard from many people that this is a nice restaurant so I may be willing to try it out again but If I get the same waiter I will definitely go find the manager myself and let him know why I do not want this server. the drinks were good from the bar...once we finally got them. I don't think I will be coming back to this Cheesecake factory soon at all..unless my husband wants too
Jason O.,"Cumberland, MD",0,5,,1.0,1/11/2014,"I am not sure how I've gotten Shrimp in my Chicken Cajun Jambalaya Pasta every time I ask for CHICKEN ONLY. This makes the FOURTH TIME I've been to Cheesecake Factory and expressed a deep desire to the waitress and repeating to her several times, please make sure that it comes with CHICKEN ONLY and NO SHRIMP!!! Brought my food out tonight, and shrimp. Lots of shrimp. I told the manager to comp my drinks and I left. Too bad that when It does come out right that it is my favorite. I am not sure what else I need to do to not get shrimp. But FOUR TIMES NOW!!! What's the deal??"
Richard E.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,5,,5.0,12/5/2013,"Food Excellent, Cleanliness Excellent, but to make it PERFECT ask for Trish.  Amazing Server!!"
Chad T.,"Jacksonville, FL",53,277,72,4.0,8/9/2010,"5 star experience on a 4 star dollar.  This place is consistent in their service, quality, and value. My only bad criticism is the size of their menu; too big. A note: be prepared to bring home leftovers, the portion sizes are large. Always a favorite."
Nina B.,"Oceanside, CA",0,69,13,5.0,4/20/2014,I went here with two of my co workers for supper. The prices are reasonable. No complaints from me. You get what you pay for. And I have nothing but good things to say about this place. I had the lemon Alfredo shrimp pasta with penne pasta substituted for the original pasta that comes with this dish. OMG! It was absolutely wonderful. The flavor was great. The shrimp were perfectly cooked. The pasta was perfectly al dente. I had the Georgia peach which was really good. I had the caramel cheesecake which was also amazing. Both my co workers had the fried macaroni and cheese which was good also. The ambience was great. Our waiter's name was Arturo & he ass absolutely awesome and very personable. We laughed with him often and he was very informative and knowledgeable about every thing on the menu. And he recommended the pasta I order from what I told him I liked. And he was dead on! Awesome advice! From the good to the service....I'll definitely be back!!!!
Steve B.,"Lafayette, IN",0,3,1,4.0,6/13/2011,"Lots of dishes to choose from.  Beautiful decor and friendly service.  Ordered the fettucini Alfredo with chicken, lunch portion.  Couldn't eat it all after the dynamite shrimp appetizer and the fresh bread.  Of course I took home a 7"" original cheese cake.  Only drawback was traffic and parking."
Holly H.,"Smithfield, VA",0,20,,4.0,7/9/2010,Love this place. Cheesecake is amazing! Food is good and they give giant portions. Eat half your entree and box the rest to go or else you won't be able to eat the best part of going here -- the cheesecake!
Geraldine B.,"Allston, MA",1,19,12,3.0,12/29/2010,"I went twice to this particular Cheesecake Factory, and as much as I liked the ambiance and the decor, I was disappointed by the food.  I had a chicken sandwich the first time, and the chicken would not stay in the sandwich no matter how I went about it. The drinks were good (mojito and a chocolate martini not on the menu), but overpriced. The second time I ordered a Cajun pasta dish, and I swear, I make a better one. The pasta was clearly overcooked, there was no sauce, and the veggies and meat were placed on top of the pasta instead of mixing the two.  My husband had a burger, which was good, and I have to say that the fries were excellent. The complimentary bread was great as well."
J P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,45,5,5.0,5/30/2011,"Although the prices are kinda high, the portions and the delishesness of the food definitely make up for it. The portions are proportionate to the price if not more. I have not tasted anything in this place that wasn't good!"
Lydia P.,"Stafford, VA",0,14,2,2.0,9/15/2014,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory because it was within walking distance and my hubby had never eaten there. It was about 6:30pm and a 5-min wait but we were seated in the worst possible spot EVER. Next to us was a long table of loud party folks which extended into the booth behind us and the people popped their heads up SHOUTING for family members and small children running back and forth. I went to use the bathroom and had to literally go to the complete opposite side of the restaurant to get there which is how I noticed ""Wow. Seriously?"" There were open tables and a huge bar that I would have preferred over our seating area. I returned to our seat, food arrived, and I love all their food, it's always good. Not so for my hubby. He ordered Cajun chicken tenders and they were BLAND!!!! I tried 2. Both bland. But there were dipping sauces. BBQ and honey mustard but.....really?! Tasted like what you'd get from McDonalds and their mcnuggets are BETTER. My food was good. Enjoyed. The coke was ok. A bit devoid of that fresh coke fizz. It was just ok. Tried ordering another one. Same thing. My hubby's cocktail wasn't strong, not much alcohol so he didn't order another, in fact he said our hotel bars cocktails were better. I was disappointed because I wanted my hubs to see how great the food is there and wow....it came up lacking. So I tried with a dessert. That had to help make it a great meal. Godiva brownie sundae. It arrived. Nice pleasing site and big enough to share it but the brownie was sideways and it was just ""ok"" too. We left full. But overall should have chosen a different restaurant."
Milt T.,"Alexandria, VA",5,27,,1.0,9/25/2010,"Bartender today has a serious attitude.  Everything I asked seemed like he didn't want to do.  He may be having a bad day, but it's still no excuse to carry himself like that."
Chad W.,"Alexandria, VA",0,38,,5.0,4/16/2013,"Perfect place for dates, casual dinners or if you're celebrating someones big event!"
David M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",44,47,5,3.0,6/23/2011,Not to say there food is bad but nothing on the menu makes me wanna eat. The wait staff does there job very good and the atmosphere is good for a date or a casual night out.
