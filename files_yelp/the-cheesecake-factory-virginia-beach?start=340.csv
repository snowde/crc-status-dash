Shennitta H.,"San Diego, CA",16,38,10,2.0,7/25/2009,"Great Cheescake, horrible food.  You would think that the Cheescake factory would have better food.  I tried it twice to give it the benefit of the doubt.  But it disappointed me both times.  And it is overpriced.  Just get a great piece of cheesecake which is what they are known for and call it a night."
Ashley O.,"Virginia Beach, VA",78,3,,1.0,8/1/2014,"My hubby and I were both very excited to come here because I had never been, and he hadn't been in a very long time. I had heard great things about this place and was highly disappointed. I'm not sure if they were training a new cook or something but everything, and I mean everything we ordered was mediocre at most. We got the calamari app, I had the fish tacos and fries, and my husband had sushi and veggies. Everything was terrible. I had barely touched my plate and the server noticed but didn't offer any sort of replacement nor cut our check down at all. And as for my husbands sushi, it was quite obvious we weren't in an actual sushi bar. We are both big sushi fans, but not for theirs. His veggies were soaked in sauce and were a bit mushy, and my fries were very bland. The calamari was the best part, but still not great. After finishing up our dinner, we decided to give them one last chance and ordered some cheesecake, at least that was good. I haven't eaten a lot of cheesecake in my day but that was the best I had. But, I doubt I'll be going back there anytime soon."
Hector C.,"Hampton, VA",0,2,,4.0,12/29/2012,"Tonight was my first time at the cheesecake factory and my experience was out of this world!!! We were seated in a timely manner, service was very good, the food was outstanding.  I ordered the Steak Diane and my girlfriend ordered theTeriyaki Chicken. The portions of food were not too much but just enough.  Both were very flavorful, very well cooked.  My mashed pototoes were very good as well.  I most definately will be back to The Cheesecake factory."
Mary M.,"Chesapeake, VA",1,5,,1.0,8/27/2012,"Went on Saturday and the service was abysmal.  Surly and slow. They got our order wrong and brought the food out for some people while others waited so we basically ate in shifts. Loud, crowded, and lousy food.  I do not understand the appeal of this unhealthy restaurant"
Jennifer W.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,18,,5.0,7/6/2012,"love this place, the staff was just great, food good for a chain. I suggest arriving before 6pm to beat the crowd and avoid the noise."
aaron b.,"Chesapeake, VA",4,11,,3.0,12/26/2009,its a good place to go get a great meal in VA Beach. The service is better than at most places but I expect that from Cheesecake Factory. The food is great as well. There is nothing that really stands out about this place that make it unique but it is a good bet to get a good mean with decent service
Hannah F.,"Oklahoma City, OK",3,19,4,2.0,10/2/2008,"The atmosphere was nice. It was loud but nice and big with great high ceilings. However, the food wasn't that great and the waiter was distracted and edgy. I probably won't go back."
jen b.,"Virginia Beach, VA",10,138,9,3.0,8/18/2008,"It's big.  It's chain-y.  It's loud.  But, the food and the service are pretty decent.  Too bad the portions are so big no one has room for cheesecake!  Get some to go or come for dessert only.  Not bad, though."
John C.,"Alexandria, VA",11,81,32,2.0,7/14/2009,"this place get a 2stars for me. its OK i mean its big inside but the tables are to close form each other. i mean it is called fine dinning right so y would u put the tables close together to the point where u can touch the next tables plate. food here is good kinda $$$ but OK. yea i would go back. just don't put me on a table, i like the booth................"
