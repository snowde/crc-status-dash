Lorna D.,"Norfolk, VA",6,52,57,5.0,6/21/2017,"I am an unabashed and unapologetic Cheesesteak Factory lover! It's not real close to where I live and it's not the most affordable place and, most of all, the portions are ridiculous. So I don't get there too often. Maybe once or twice a year. But when I do, baby! I roll around and immerse and myself  in the cheesecakiness of this factory. Yesterday I went for lunch with my daughter and I enjoyed their always delicious chicken salad. They add slivered almonds to it which adds a nice crunch. The fries are perfect and I always order mine with a side of their very delicious ranch sauce. My daughter had a generous side salad and a pasta dish with a pink sauce. I believe it was called four cheese pasta. D Lish! Again their portion sizes are so large that not only were we able to take leftovers home for dinner that night but there was no room left for cheesecake. That may be a fly in your business model ointment Cheesesteak Factory. I know their portions are so large that I actually brought a cooler with ice for my leftovers. We were going to the movies afterword and I didn't want to leave food in my hot car. Nor did I want to waste it. The atmosphere is wonderful! It's a beautiful restaurant. The servers are all professional and very friendly. There is lots of parking and just overall five stars. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Go! Tip...order all brown bread. It's D Lish!"
Darnell P.,"Hampton, VA",194,188,901,4.0,12/18/2016,"This spot is always lit, crowded on swoll. The food is vast with variety. You can order anything from steak to seafood. Their customer service is pretty good as well. The truth of the issue is I believe you really come for the drinks and cheesecake. The least I can do is pass it on. I always order some kind of pasta. It never fails me. Please prepare to wait for a while unless you have a reservation. Order plenty of bread...you'll love it."
Angela S.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,10,1,4.0,7/23/2017,"We went here at noon on a Sunday with a party of 5. We had a table in less than ten minutes. Our waiter was awesome. The food was good but not great. We had the edamame app and the fries mac and cheese to start. The edamame is sprinkled with sugar instead of salt. It was weird and we couldn't decide if we liked it or not. The mac and cheese balls were delish.  For the main meal I had the shrimp summer rolls and they were really good but everyone else got pasta dishes and weren't really impressed with them. The pasta was super starchy and it stuck together in big noodle globs.  The cheesecake was on point. It might be my imagination but the pieces looked bigger than usual? We ended up being there for 3 hours. Mostly because we were taking our time. Our server, Matt, was amazing and patient and got more than a 50% tip because I know how annoying it is when you have a party that lingers.  We only make it out to Cheesecake Factory once a year. It's a 45 minute drive for us. But we love it enough to keep coming back."
Jamie J.,"Norfolk, VA",36,4,7,5.0,8/1/2017,This place was good. It was my first time here and it was delicious! I got the old fashioned burger and my husband got the cuban sandwich. The mashed potatoes are literally the best i've ever had and the mac n cheese is pretty amazing as well! The best part of this place is the cheesecake!! Sooo good  i had the oreo and my husband had the cookie dough. Definitely will be back again!
Michelle T.,"Manassas, VA",9,55,36,5.0,4/5/2017,"A party of 12 including myself came in for a friends 21st birthday, we had an estimated wait of 30 minutes. All good, we were all seated. The waiter was pleasant and took our order for drinks. If you've never been to the cheesecake factory they do have free bread and butter as appetizers.  The waiter wasn't speedy but was good with expected timing due to how busy it was; there were about 6 other birthdays. I ordered the California Cheesesteak. I am not a fan of bell peppers which was listed in the description however, I am a fan of cheese steak. I will be honest and say that I wouldn't order the cheesesteak again. The portions are pretty big you are sure to be filled. I don't recommend grabbing an appetizer; you'll be filled before your entree! There's something for everyone on the menu, including vegan options. They also have an additional menu for those dieting, called the skinnylicious menu if I recall correctly. The only downfall to the restaurant would be the lighting, it's way too dark. I can't image how the employees deal with it; it could most likely ruin the older employee's/customer's eyes. The restaurant is well kept and clean. Lastly, I got a cheesecake; Lemon raspberry. It's really good for anyone who really likes that lemon zest, it was a bit much for me but still good."
Felicia W.,"Atlanta, GA",39,95,48,2.0,3/5/2017,"Disappointed! We arrived at approximately 6:30 PM on 03/04/17.  Due to being such a large party (22) our expected wait time was 3-4 hours. During our wait I observed a gentleman who was there with approximately five teenagers.  The gentleman asked the young lady that was taking reservations how much longer he had remaining, with an attitude she replied ""you've only been here 30 minutes your expected wait time is an hour to an hour and a half"".   After waiting approximately an hour my sister- in- law went and asked the same rude young lady how much time we had remaining, her response was ""ain't nothing changed"".   What ever happened to pleasant customer service? I told my sister-in-law to turn the pager in because her attitude was unacceptable Our party of 22 went across the street to Macaroni Grill and had a grand night When dealing with customers you should remain courteous.  Perhaps this young lady needs a position where she is not the first points of contact for customers. PROS * Location  *Complimentary Garage Parking  CONS *Customer Service"
Marie R.,"Chesapeake, VA",25,269,202,3.0,4/14/2017,"Unfortunately I have to downgrade my previous rating.  We ate here last night--my husband and I.  A lot of the menu items have been taken off.  They have added a few new items, but overall the menu doesn't seem exciting anymore.  Additionally, the service last night left a lot to be desired.  Our appetizers And Entree came out at the same time, and if you have ever sat stone of those two seater tables, there simply is no room for two appetizers, two entrees, two bread baskets, a plate of butter, a separate plate for lemons and two bread plates.  Needless to say, it was a little annoying.  Appetizers should come out BEFORE the entree and not with the entree.  We were clearly annoyed but we didn't say anything.  I think because of that, our waitress ignored us (maybe afraid to see that we were annoyed?  I don't know.). She went to other tables in the vicinity and checked up on those tables multiple times but did not stop by to check on us until we were done eating--probably about 20-25 mins later.  To her credit, she was very nice and never rude, but all around that was pretty crappy service that we received.  Since my last review, I have been to Cheesecake Factory multiple times.  Unfortunately I have observed a noticeable decline in service and consistency with the entrees. Due to the lackluster menu, high price and crappy service, it will be a LONG time until we dine at the Cheesecake Factory again.  There are simply too many good restaurants out there to spend good money and not waste it on a dismal experience."
Laure J.,"Newport News, VA",294,112,206,3.0,3/29/2016,"I gotta start off by saying, Ive always thought CCF was overrated. We went on a saturday, with a party of 6, it was super crowded, but thats to be expected. We waited by the bar, I had a couple  Ruby Red Sunrise crush cocktails, DELICIOUS. The wait was about 1 and 1/2 hours (never would have stayed this long if it wasnt for a friend that really loves this place.) When we did get seated, our server Ana was very personable, attentive with a good sense of humor without laying it on too thick. After skimming the HUGE menu for the 5th time I ordered the Orange chicken on recommendation. GROSS, dont. I also ordered the Oreo cheesecake and that was marvelous! so so good.  So all in all, I had some great cocktails and a bomb piece of cheese cake, pretty much what I expected. I feel like CCF would be much better off if they would streamline the menu and focus on doing a couple dishes really well vs 100 dishes that are just OK."
Caron G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",1,13,13,5.0,4/10/2017,"Oh my goodness. I love Cheesecake Factory so much. I came here at 5 on Friday night with my boyfriend. The wait was 20 minutes, but I think we waited closer to 15.  It was pretty crowded and we were seated so close to the diners around us that it felt like we were sharing a table with them, but our waitress was so sweet and made the right seating feel comfortable. Our drinks were always full and we felt very taken care of. We ordered an appetizer each, because their appetizers are the absolute best. My boyfriend got the macaroni and cheese balls, and I got the avocado egg rolls. So delicious! Oddly, about 10 minutes after the mac and cheese balls came out, the avocado egg rolls came out with another order of mac and cheese... apparently our apps got mixed up with the table next to ours. We got a fettuccini alfredo with shrimp to split and it was amazing! The pasta tasted SO fresh, the sauce was great, and the portion was huge, as always. I think the shrimp could have been cooked less but it was still really good. And of course, we ordered dessert, but we were so stuffed we took it to go. I chose the lemon raspberry cheesecake and it was the perfect combination of sweet and tart, and my boyfriend who isn't a cheesecake fan, ordered the chocolate cake, which had 6 layers of cake and 7 layers of the best frosting I've ever stolen a spoonful of. Worth every penny."
Jasmine M.,"New Cumberland, PA",136,250,571,4.0,2/17/2016,"What I like most about the cheesecake factory is their menu...it's Huge! you can find Asian, Mexican, Caribbean.. pretty much any type of cuisine (almost). If you are dining with picky eaters you can rest assure they'll find something on the menu that will suffice.  The cheesecake is pretty good but I'm upset about the discontinuation of my pineapple up- side down cheesecake. I asked what on earth would persuade them to make that decision and they (they = the person at the cheesecake counter) replied ""because it was only popular at this store, eveything is based on what's popular at the California locations"" so basically they only serve what sells in Cali.. Overall i pretty much will choose TCF over other chain restaurants because of the menu, the prices are decent, 85% of what I've ordered tastes good and the staff, they are professional and well groomed."
Craig G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,8,8,5.0,7/12/2017,"A little on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for, and the portions are HUGE!! I got the skinnylicious Asian chicken salad, huge portion. Our other guests got the spaghetti and meatballs, and the buffalo chicken sandwich. I tell you Chick-fil-A don't have nothing on that sandwich. Not to mention the selection of cheesecakes they have is out of this world. Anyone in the area definitely needs to check this place out."
Geno P.,"San Diego, CA",131,656,303,4.0,8/9/2016,"It's always assuring to see how all CFs are the same quality and service with the same kickass menus. I love dropping by and killing the skinny menu and just chilling out. Especially since this one is so close to all the Town Center hotels! Server was welcoming and quick, and there was no wait for a table. I've no doubt this place gets crushed when all these corporate folks leave work for the day, but on this particular week night, it was the perfect respite."
Mark E.,"Virginia Beach, VA",93,246,432,2.0,1/24/2016,"On average, we go about once every 6-8 weeks.  But lately we've noticed a decline in service and quality.  The latest two trips will lead us to taking a hiatus from this restaurant. Last week I attempted to order their turkey sandwich and soup combo.  After a considerable amount of time, the waitress returned to let us know they had no turkey.  This was at noon. This week we returned for the brunch menu.  Sadly, the food wasn't just prepared poorly but also was unsafe.  We ordered the French toast which oozed raw egg like wringing water from a saturated sponge.  Huge failure.  The GM did strike it from the bill but the overall declining trend of this location needs immediate attention."
Dominique T.,"Glenarden, MD",77,16,23,4.0,5/12/2017,"Went to Cheesecake Factory with my best friend while I was visiting and it did not disappoint. Our server James B was very friendly and welcoming. I ordered the crispy fried cheese and didn't realize how small it was so I decided to get the strawberry shortcake. Only issue was it took a while but they up for it by giving me extra strawberries. I didn't realize that it came with ice cream and I have diary issues so I had to eat around the ice cream. Despite it being my fault for not reading the description,  James was very apologetic and sweet about it. All in all, it was a great experience and the food was good as usual with terrific service!"
Danielle K.,"Omaha, NE",10,153,63,5.0,1/24/2017,I've eaten here a few times and I've always had good service. The food has always been a really great too. As usual with all of the Cheesecake Factories that I've been to the cheesecake is great. The server was extremely helpful and very kind. I wouldn't hesitate to come back.
Marcus G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",336,303,417,4.0,1/23/2016,"Although this is a chain restaurant the food never tasted ""fake"" to me. So this is one place I have no problem frequenting. I know my dad disapproves of this place and claims it's too expensive for what you get. In my opinion, it really is what you get here that makes the difference in value. My friends and I tend to come here for lunch. Yesterday I got the Chinese Chicken Salad (lunch portion) however even the lunch portion was pretty big. My friend got the Louisiana Chicken which is the best!!! and the other friend got some gumbo which was just ok.   Of course, the best thing about waiting is Cheesecake Factory's bread, especially the pumpernickle bread and the butter they serve, i forget what brand, it's awesome! I have always liked the way Cheesecake Factory was designed, it's always felt spacious there, the designs are so abstract. Finally after conquering the mountain of deliciousness, my friend nudged me to get cheesecake. I skipped this time unfortunately, however my usual is the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, it's like eating the food of many angels and I'll leave my rant there."
Joshua R.,"Charleston, SC",12,44,11,5.0,9/4/2017,Arrived for Sunday lunch with a large group. Our waitress handled our entire group with ease. I really wanted to not like this place. I tend to be overly critical of large chain restaurants butI just don't have anything bad to say. I would recommend this restaurant if there were no nearby local restaurants to try.
Qing W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",77,44,132,5.0,2/5/2017,"Nice dining experience. They give you bread and butter to hold you over until food comes out. We ate all the bread and had to get a second helping. The food was delicious too and most of us finished all our portions (the portions were huge). The only change I would like to see is the pricing on the drink menu because our two drinks basically doubled our bill. Overall, though, I would go back again."
Kristie M.,"Suffolk, VA",52,8,,2.0,9/24/2017,This used to be my favorite restaurant! The service has always been great!! however the last two times my husband and I have eaten here we have gotten food poisoning so I do not think we will be returning!
Moran E.,"San Diego, CA",13,28,21,5.0,4/12/2017,"I love this place !!!!! First of the best bread ever ! Then , the menu could please any picky eater ... no problem !  It's delicious and great for any event . Omg last time we ordered the fried avocado and it was amazing. Seriously!"
