Rhiannon J.,"Virginia Beach, VA",51,7,8,3.0,5/31/2017,"This was my first time here and probably my last for a long time. I think it's definitely overrated. I went about 5pm on a Sunday, no wait but the restaurant was very loud. Service was sub par; my friend ordered an Asian salad and after 45 minutes was told they were out. The fried Mac and cheese was excellent but not enough for me to come back."
Rhea Kristine S.,"San Diego, CA",1,3,,5.0,5/5/2017,"Tonight we decided to eat cheesecake factory & Im glad we did, why? 1. There was a loooong wait but they had us seated right away since its only my man, our 15 months old daughter & I, which was amazing that we didnt have to wait 2 the food is beyond delicious.  3. The staff are soooooo friendly & Our server is on point I recommend him to anybody who comes & dine here. His name is tom!!! Please please look for him when you eat here, he is the best & on point with everything. We seriously had the best dinner. Besg experience & best server we ever had."
Jenni K.,"Manhattan, NY",136,233,225,4.0,7/29/2016,"I haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory in years but went last night for a friend's birthday dinner. It was a great experience and our server handled our group of 20 like a pro. The restaurant is clean and the decor is classic and pretty.  My friend and I shared the Crispy Crab Wontons and the Fried Macaroni and Cheese for appetizers. The Fried Macaroni and Cheese comes in balls and were delicious and very filling. By the time our main entree came out, the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, we were already pretty full. Because we had told our server we were splitting the pasta, she went ahead and gave us two separate plates and very generous proportions, which we ended up having to take home.  Everything tasted great, the service was smooth, and she even helped served the birthday cheesecake for us!"
Alyssa P.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",587,630,1568,3.0,11/24/2015,Eh. It's a chain. Nothing magical going on here.  The food was just ok. The Avocado rolls are actually the best thing that I've had here. SO I do strongly recommend this place.
Gabby B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",1,8,14,5.0,4/30/2017,This place is so Tasty! Their appetizers are fancy . I chose their Fried MAC and Cheese was great I just wished it had more sause on the side. I ordered one of their combination platters with steak mashed potatoes and shrimp scampi and fell in love. Waitress was on point with the drinks and boxed everything to go . Also I ordered strawberry cheese cake to go and it had huge strawberries on top. Great for a hot day around lunch time.
Cindy E.,"Norfolk, VA",185,392,550,2.0,10/31/2015,"I loathe the factory.  Everything I wrote about the Short Pump (Richmond) location applies to this one, as well.  Menu's too big and they would be better off filling it with different types of cheesecake rather than every entree imaginable at a mediocre level.   This time I tried the tuna tartare, which was OK, however ridiculously small.  Like, gone in two bites.  The huge pieces of ginger in it was bothersome.  Is ginger not a palate cleanser?  Did I miss something? I mean, lemme know.  I'm not a chef, but I've never had tuna tartare prepared that way, and it wasn't terrific...until I removed the ginger.  (I asked the server, and asked him to ask the kitchen about it...Inquiring minds want to know.) Later, I ordered my favorite cheesecake -- Vanilla Bean.  Still phenemonal.  But also ridiculously small.  They're cutting back.  It's a sad new day at the Cheesecake Factory.  Govern yourselves accordingly."
Mike P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",13,22,9,3.0,1/26/2017,Love The Cheesecake Factory. The food is always delicious. They have a wide variety (sometimes it's difficult to choose! My only problem with The Cheesecake Factory? They don't take reservations not he busiest days of the week (Saturday and Sunday). I simply wanted to set a reservation for my wife's birthday. They won't allow it. Boo.
Vic E.,"Virginia Beach, VA",217,122,682,4.0,2/25/2016,"Excellent service and quality! Came here on a rainy night expecting it to be slow because of people scared to be in the rain, but to my surprise, it was crowded.  Checked in and got a buzzer to let me know when my table was ready. Order was taken immediately and came out fairly quickly despite how crowded the huge restaurant was. I had the steak diane and herb encrusted salmon.  Both were cooked as ordered and tasted awesome! The waitress was very attentive and didn't have to wait on drink refills. Didn't have enough room for dessert, but will definitely will try some on my next visit!"
Rushelle T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",160,69,208,2.0,2/23/2017,This is the only restaurant I have sent my food back or complained to a waiter a couple of times. I have ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and the chicken was overcooked and was like rubber. The other time I ordered tacos and it was just average. The Alfredo was plain and I bet could be better cooked homemade. The service is great though and the only best part is the bread and butter. Cheesecake factory is a place I wouldn't crave at all.
Erwin T.,"Burlington, NC",16,3,8,5.0,4/14/2017,Celebrating 54th anniversary everyone enjoyed the time server Mary made it memorable thank you. Food was served well and on time
Francesca P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",11,35,182,4.0,2/25/2017,"Cheesecake factory is one of my ""go-to"" spots whenever I'm with a group that can't decide what to eat! They have every kind of dish you could crave for. The interior of the restaurant is so nice that it can be good for an intimate date or even a family celebration! Their food is definitely affordable. In my opinion you get more for your money here. The only downside about this place is that it can get very crowded on weekend nights.  A typical weekend night for dinner is at least a 45 minute wait. My parents and I got here around 8pm and didnt get seated until 9... then it took a while to get our meals but the toasty bread they served distracted us from how long the wait was. I got the Grilled Turkey Burger, my mom got the Philly Cheesesteak, & my dad got the Herb Crusted Salmon. They were all soo good, but like I said before.. it just depends on what you're craving for!"
C T.,"Newport News, VA",0,46,11,5.0,4/26/2017,I love this place. They have the biggest menu I have ever seen. You can't go wrong going there. They have stuff for everyone. I tried the cheeseballs with marinara as an app. The steak Diane is great for steak lovers. And they had a mango margarita that was brilliant.
Teresa H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,8,,5.0,9/2/2017,The cheese cake was delicious. It was cold and fresh...There was no wait time which is odd for a weekday. We usually frequent this location and the customer service is hit or miss but the food is never a disappointment.
John W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,6,9,1.0,3/26/2017,"What a BUST. After waiting for a booth, we were told they were out of Meat Loaf.   Should known something was wrong when the men's room was unclean. Ordered Steak Tacos as the second dish. It would be nice if the steak tacos had steak in them. A McDonald's single has more beef. As a replacement for the Meat Loaf, Bam-Bam Shrimp was ordered. It was over cooked, soggy and two sweet. Sent it back along with the Steak Tacos. And they were out of whole wheat bread. The manager would not even come and speak to us the second time. Cheese Cake is on the way down."
Shanita E.,"Portsmouth, VA",0,2,,1.0,11/11/2017,We went in and were seated rather quickly. A waiter told us he would be back after we waited for about 10 minutes; however after waiting for a total of 20 Minutes (without even being able to place a drink order) he hadn't made it back and we left. This was very disappointing and frustrating especially because I had my 4 year old daughter with me. We ended up at PF Changs across the street.
Hillary A.,"Chesapeake, VA",150,117,1020,4.0,5/14/2016,"As I am typing my review,  I am enjoying my leftovers from last night. What can I say it's so much food and it's so good!  I've been here plenty of times but it has been a while. My recent visit was for my Sister's 25th Birthday. I had asked her where she would like to go for her birthday and she said Cheesecake Factory as one of her choices, so my family surprised her by taking her there for dinner. Came here around 530 with 5 adults and one infant,  and they sat us right away ( no wait at all,  yay)  Our waitress was pretty attentive, she went a head and took our drink orders as we were still deciding of what to eat. As we got our drinks, we went ahead and ordered our appetizer and meals. As our appetizer we ordered their oh so delicious Fried Mac N Cheese (comes with 4 balls). Birthday Girl ordered first of course, and ordered Hibachi Steak with Wasabi Mashed Potatoes (was pretty good, but I don't like medium steaks *womp*) My dad wanted any fish dish, so he ordered the Thai Salmon with Brown rice. He said it was okay but not the best. Then my mom ordered the Orange Chicken with white rice, she wasn't that impressed either. (My sisters favorite dish, she tried it and she said it was pretty off that time). My sisters boyfriend had ordered the Kobe Burger with Sweet Potato Fries, which he killed it!! I ordered my favorite dish on the menu, the Chicken Madeira with Brown rice instead of Mashed Potatoes!! Gahhhh, the Chicken is so tender and easy to cut and eat. Oh and it comes with Asparagus and Mushrooms too, yummy. Love love this dish!! PRO: Very clean, Great Service, Delicious Food!  CON: A little wait on refills, and bad lighting in the bathroom especially the changing diaper station. Overall, this is a great place for big parties (might be a wait bc of all the orders, orders come out all at once), birthdays, prom dinners, anniversaries, graduation parties and other special occasions! GREAT RESTAURANT IN VB TOWN CENTER!!"
Nay W.,"Chesapeake, VA",14,58,88,4.0,5/2/2016,They are always crowd and at least we have to wait 10-20min. Too close to next table so I feel like I don't have a privacy however this place is cheese cake lover's heaven. I ordered a Mango Key Lime Cheesecake that was so good! Also I order raspberry lemonade it was great too. I had a chicken and shrimp gumbo that was ok. They have a huge menu so I might try to get a Shepard pie next time I visit them.
Jessica M.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",8,15,5,3.0,6/10/2017,Came here last week to eat dinner. As usual it's always busy. The receptionists said it will take about 20-30 min wait to get a table so we waited but then 20-30 min later we haven't got our table. We went to the receptionist and ask about our table and she said that we're waiting on a table... we'll no shit we're waiting on the table. We've been waiting for over 30 min already. She could've said that the wait was 40-50 min and we could've went to somewhere else. She just wasted our time for not telling us to wait 40-50 min.. I would recommend that they should change the person who's working on the reception area.
Cindy F.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,47,,5.0,8/5/2017,We arrived at a good time as we only had to wait about 15 minutes.  I had the sausage and ricotta flatbread and beet salad.  It was delicious!  The service was good.  I was glad I managed to get out of there without eating a piece of cheesecake!  I already know it's delicious but didn't trust myself to not eat the whole piece with all those calories.
Kristine D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",854,429,3833,5.0,7/27/2015,"I once heard that Yelp reviews shouldn't even been written on ""chain"" restaurants but I totally disagree.  I still read reviews on chain restaurants, so of course people still need to write them! Let me tell you that Cheesecake Factory is in my top 3 for chain restaurants! The food, though a tad pricey (for dinner anyway), is always perfect! (To me it is.. Anything and everything I've ordered has never disappointed.) My favorite appetizer is the Fried Macaroni & Cheese balls- just amazing. For dinner- it is the Chicken Madeira, which similar to Chicken Marsala, and comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The cheesecakes are classic and delicious! My favorites are: Vanilla Bean with a side of strawberries, and also my new found favorite - Dulce de Leche cheesecake, OMG. The place is beautiful - I love the high ceilings and decor. The wait staff is always friendly.  One of the cons is how busy and long the wait is during the weekends. But that is to be expected and can't be controlled. I do have to warn you - a slice of cheesecake is not free for your bday! lol. I once dined here with my mom, and she told them it was my birthday, and they asked what my favorite cheese cake was, and it sure was on the bill. lol. (She didn't mind paying for it, but I think they should warn you that it's not complimentary, especially since it usually always is at other restaurants.) If you have never been to a Cheesecake Factory, you are missing out, my friend! Try it today! And if you don't want to wait, your best bet is to come on the weekdays, when it first opens (11am.) Happy Menu browsing (it's super thick like a yearbook!) & eating!"
