Gordon H.,"Williamsburg, VA",13,3,9,4.0,3/26/2017,"Spacious and elaborate decor, host and seating process was efficient and punctual, service was timely and attentive all at the proper moments.  Was painlessly guided through the extensive menu.  Food came out quick, presentation and taste was delicious and especially the firecracker salmon rolls.  The experience lived up to the name and our day was complete."
Carey B.,"Southside, Jacksonville, FL",35,32,43,2.0,4/6/2017,"Brunch is horrible. Went with my family and each item was poorly prepared. Eggs were hard and tasted like plastic. Bacon was fatty, toast was burnt. Pancakes lacked flavor. Service was good but food is beyond poor. Worst brunch for a major chain in Hampton roads. Only positives are that the cheesecakes are good. At all costs avoid the food and stick to drinks and cheesecake."
Mary J.,"Virginia Beach, VA",35,208,460,5.0,10/27/2015,"Honestly, for a franchise, this place is pretty good. They have a huge menu with tons of stuff on it. Whether you want something kind of Asian to something steak. The staff is nice and lots of care seems to be taken to make sure the customer is happy. I hit this place up on a Sunday, last week, after a Symphonicity concert at the Sandler Center, with my Mom. We had a nice date night. I don't remember our server's name, but he had a huge section of the bar to serve and did a really nice job. He was funny and got us everything we wanted. Our only issue was getting sweet tea, instead of un-sweet. I really appreciated him being upbeat and friendly to my Mom (who is frumpy, and doesn't get out much to engage strangers). Their food can be called a little expensive, but it's really good, and you totally have two servings of food there. We were both able to take home half of the meal and save it for another. Definitely worth it, to me. I ate the orange chicken, since I don't like the snow peas medley that comes with it, the broccoli is a delicious substitute that isn't covered in the sweet glaze. The chicken was breaded a bit heavily, but tasted amazing, and there is a ton of it! My mom ordered a chicken and biscuits dish that was like a pot-less pot-pie. She loved it. I tried it... tastes like pot-pie to me, but if she liked it, that's all that matters. Dessert was some cheesecake that they showed on the big ass TV screen. You can see those things from across the restaurant. If you were trying not to order dessert, your eye will catch those screens and you will buy one."
Rose M.,"Chesapeake, VA",72,201,1306,5.0,7/29/2015,It's half price cheesecake day enough said!   I try to come here whenever I am in town!  Great food and atmosphere.  As long as you hit before lunch or dinner you can get a seat versus standing outside in the heat and watching the traffic.   Never a bad meal nor bad experience.  Wish we had one more in Chesapeake!!
Jessica M.,"Chesapeake, VA",89,7,13,1.0,10/11/2016,"I've been coming here for a couple years and I never really had any issues , up until today.  Ordered fish tacos, and as i started to eat a swarm of fruit flies and i began to battle over the fish tacos. The fruit flies won. The waitress came back over to ask how everything was, and i explained to her how that it was really good food but fruit flies were getting onto my tacos along with the bread they normally bring out to the table. She said ""Aw well why didn't you tell me there was fruit flies on your bread and told me you wanted a different table"". I tried not to snap back lol. But i was really pissed cause she was making it seem like I wanted to just sit here and share my meal with the fruit flies ??? Idk, maybe she doesn't mind eating food w fruit flies swarming around the plate and potentially getting fly droppings on her food once they land on the food. I wasn't blaming her for the fruit flu issue but her whole attitude about it really turned me off completely. She came back and told me management took care of my bill and walked away, and although that's nice the way she went about it was bitchy and unnecessary so no tip for her."
Rich R.,"Burlington Township, NJ",9,80,6,4.0,6/18/2017,"You've got to try the chicken and biscuits... it's like a decomposed chicken pot pie. Out of this world! Also had an old favorite, the banana cream cheesecake, which is light, fluffy and rich and creamy. The only issue we had was that the power went out while we were there and we felt rushed after that and couldn't fully enjoy our dinner. It was my wife and I's 11th anniversary so it kind of ruined part of the evening for us. Besides that the service was friendly and accommodating."
Vanessa H.,"Suffolk, VA",3,4,,3.0,7/14/2017,Have been waiting more than 2 and a half hours can't really say if the food is good  we have decided to carry our food out because the kids are tired of sitting and we still haven't seen any food. They offered free cheese cake not much for this long wait
Tom M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",10,35,12,1.0,7/1/2017,"We were. Inside ring going here for an evening slice of. Geese ale, but when looking at the menu, there were no prices listed!  Since this usually mean sky-high ludicrous prices, we opted out. And won't consider them again"
Linda P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",27,6,7,5.0,7/24/2017,"So far so good. Just got here was seated right away. Server has been very patient with us as we decide on what we want. Clean, family friendly atmosphere."
Eylul G.,"Istanbul, Turkey",0,4,11,4.0,2/14/2017,Foods were good but portions were too big.The cheesecake was delicious!!!!!!  It's hard to decide to order a cheesecake from hundreds of alternatives. Employees were kind and they made my day with the birthday song! :)
Jeff B.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,5,,3.0,10/16/2017,"Usually always have a wonderful experience at this location. However last night my wife was there with friends and brought home the Tuscan chicken meal to have for lunch today. Unfortunately when I went to eat it this afternoon, all three chicken breast's inside the meal were undercooked or raw.  I ended up throwing the entire meal out. Disappointed for sure, but glad I checked it before."
Annamarie M.,"Norfolk, VA",84,14,7,5.0,6/6/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to dine. It has wonderful dishes like vegetarian cob salad (delicious and I'm not even vegetarian), beet and goat cheese salad, delicious soups, and a chicken mango and avocado salad that is just heaven to eat. Not to mention the to die for huge rich slices of cheesecake, and always amazing servers that go above and beyond for the customer. Tip, ask to be in Beth or Aprils' section, they are so helpful, humorous, and quick to ensure your meal is enjoyable. I have been here several times with my friends and husband, and each and every time I leave with a stuffed belly and a huge smile. Go to Cheesecake Factory, you will NOT regret it!!!"
Jeff L.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,55,82,1.0,6/9/2017,"One of the worst welcome/seating experiences I have had at a Virginia Beach restaurant.  Cleared the waiting area several times before seating our party and we were there well before parties of the same size.  Hostess appeared to be extremely overwhelmed.  Once we finally were seated our server was very nice, helpful and friendly.  His attentiveness was the lone bright spot of our dining experience.  Food quality was very average but pricey.  They even ran out of croutons for salads? I do not expect to return here as there are plenty of other restaurants in VB that do a better job, provide exceptional service, and are good values. At their prices, as a consumer, I would have anticipated a better experience."
Erin C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",222,214,516,4.0,2/26/2016,"I normally try to avoid chain restaurants. The Cheesecake Factory is great, though! I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here. The food is usually on point and I love that they have plenty of choices for those of us that are watching our figures. It's beautifully decorated and the wait staff is great. Menu prices are average for the rest of Town Center. Definitely be prepared to wait for a table at night and on weekends."
Kimberly P.,"Chesapeake, VA",193,339,670,4.0,7/2/2015,"Whenever I'm in Town Center this is my go-to restaurant to eat at. Why? The 30 page menu. There are sooo many options to suit anyones tastes buds. Mexican, burgers, Italian, asian, chicken, you name it they probably have it. This is also their downfall. After putting in my drink order here a mere 3 minutes later my waiter asked us if we were ready to order. No sir I'm not, Im still on page 7. If you are indecisive as I am this place will rack your brain.  Now the main attraction...the basket of bread. I ask for ""the brown bread"" only and my request was granted. Its something about its flavor that soothes my soul (and stomach), its an easy tie with texas roadhouse bread if only cheesecake factory had flavored butters. For my dinner I ordered the fish tacos which came with rice and beans. The tortilla tasted like flour, the fish had no taste and the salsa and crema brought it back to life. I wont order it again but in combination of the bread, I did not go hungry that night."
Melissa E.,"Chesapeake, VA",53,135,804,4.0,10/21/2016,"It's the only Cheesecake Factory in Hampton Roads so expect it to be packed especially on the weekends. The great think about Cheesecake is the variety of food. If your party cannot decode on the genre of food, then come here! My favorite appetizers is the avocado eggrolls. I try to do a light meal in an attempt to stuff one of their delectable cheesecakes down!"
Xerxes N.,"Virginia Beach, VA",1579,1108,7775,4.0,1/22/2015,"For a chain I have to give this place props. Aside the frustration of going through the 1,000 items on their menu it's pretty good there. Who can really beat their cheesecake? It's perfect every time.  It's been some time since my last visit but I did notice a 550 calorie or less menu. Granted there was a salad with no dressing, the chicken sandwich was pretty good. Lunch is my preference to go because the restaurant traffic isn't ape ish!"
Alex O.,"Chesapeake, VA",2,13,,3.0,2/13/2017,"Visited on a Saturday around noon; no wait time although they were busy.  Service was exceptional; food was just average, though.  I expected a little more, given the prices.  I had the chicken salad sandwich; husband had the hanger steak.  Portions were large and filling.  We were actually too full to try the cheesecake...maybe next time!"
Barcarie M.,"VA, VA",124,54,63,4.0,6/18/2017,"Great wait staff, they are uber professional and it was a overall great experience. The food was good and fast considering that it is fathers day. I will return very soon."
Kathy V.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,40,3,3.0,6/15/2017,"This used to be one of my favorite chain restaurants but now it's just ok. For a restaurant that is based on their cheesecake, I'm surprised they decided to change it. It's no longer dense and creamy. The filling tastes whipped and too light. It's not real cheesecake anymore. Also, the slices are half the size they used to be but still the same price if not more.  I still love the Louisiana Chicken Pasta."
