David F.,"Concord, CA",53,372,1592,4.0,1/2/2018,"The Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek is like a little bit of Las Vegas in your home town: gorgeous and glitzy in an over-the-top but attractive way. This is often our destination for special occasions as everyone can find something to eat on their massive menu.  Then you can top it all off with an amazing variety of the best cheesecake you'll ever eat. However, if you are watching your calories, Cheesecake Factory is a challenge! To their credit, they have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu with entrées of 590 calories or less. Unfortunately, the couple times I had tried items from this menu in the past they had been less than inspiring. But on my last visit I found something good: the Skinny Chicken Pot Pie was actually very tasty! It looks a little different from what you might expect as it comes in a soup bowl with a puff pastry floating on the top. But looks are deceiving, and it tasted delicious. If you want cheesecake you pretty much have to accept it's not going to be a great calorie day. The cheesecakes average about 1200 calories, ranging from the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake at 1540 calories to the Low-Carb Cheesecake at 620. The Pumpkin Cheesecake at about 900 was my compromise and quite good. You can also get cheesecakes to-go even if you aren't dining in. Just inside the entrance on the left is a ""cheesecake bar"" where you can order cheesecakes to go, quick and easy. We have done this on several occasions. One minus is that Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations, and the wait can be long at busy times. My son waited 90 minutes one time on a Friday night."
Leeann P.,"Vallejo, CA",248,109,681,3.0,1/3/2018,"I come to cheesecake for only certain dishes because nowhere else has the taste like Cheesecake Factory. I loooove the fried Mac n cheese balls, avocado rolls, and miso salmon. The avocado rolls here are way better than BJs. When getting the miso salmon, replace the rice for the mashed potatoes. They do free substitutions! Trust me, you'll thank me later. Everything else I've tried is pretty good too but these are my faves! The drinks here are weak, so save your money and go to a real bar. And the service is ALRIGHT. Every time i come, they're always slow and rarely check on our table. Also, they can get really packed so plan your time wisely, and they don't take reservations on weekends. Of course, it's called the Cheesecake Factory for a reason and theirs are huge!!!!! And yes they're delicious and heavy just the way it should be."
Shary R.,"Oakland, CA",107,5,16,3.0,12/30/2017,"It's exactly what I'd expect from any Cheesecake Factory: waiting, architecture inspired by every period ever in history, waiting, bread (the brown bread!!), more waiting, and portions so enormous you don't actually have space for cheesecake. When I do go to CF, I usually just share a bunch of appetizers with friends, but I just got the shrimp spring rolls for myself today. They came with two sauces and were otherwise on the bland side, with too-thick rice wrappers. Eh. Every place with a Cheesecake Factory probably has better options, but if you can't agree on anything or want to play it safe, it's there  Would recommend bringing someone who hasn't been to the US to Cheesecake just to laugh at the enormous plates."
Kevin K.,"Berkeley, CA",526,188,514,4.0,12/16/2017,"Ok this is probably my third review of a Cheesecake Factory, but I gotta do it!  I love cheesecake factory, especially the Walnut Creek location. It was a busy saturday and we were promptly seated within about 10 minutes, which was very surprising and delightful!   Our waitress (Brittany) was pretty nice and attentive and helped us order a heaping amount of food in celebration of our completed finals! I, as usual, ordered the pasta da vinci (ALWAYS a treat) and we split the crab and artichoke dip and chicken samosa appetizers.  I'm usually a fan of the stuffed mushrooms, but I decided to spice it up and try some new ones today.  The dip was fantastic and nice and crabby.  My suggestion is to order it with lemon wedges for squirting on top of your crostinis.  The samosas weren't super amazing though.  A little dry and I wasn't too fond of the dipping sauce so they were a bit dry for me. The pasta was fantastic, as always, and went amazingly with tons and tons and tons of parmesan. Pro tip: order some extra sauce on the side with your da vinci so you can dip buttered bread in it!!!  Honestly my favorite part of the meal! Definitely recommend if you're down for a nice little chain restaurant meal.  Prices are a bit high, but the portions are decently sized and you'll get your fill!"
Tabitha H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",163,290,417,4.0,11/24/2017,Cheesecake Factory is like...the upscale Olive Garden. Nothing wrong with that though! I come here mostly for happy hour and the food quality is pretty consistently good. The service is usually good and I've never come across an unfriendly waiter.  The menu items are like what you'd expect at an American chain and the prices are fair. The nice thing about Cheesecake Factory is also the late hours. It offers a nice place to get late night meals.
Julia L.,"East Bay, CA",550,287,591,3.0,8/17/2017,"3.5 stars! I have been to this Cheesecake Factory many, many times over the years as it is the closest location to me. The wait is a hit or miss. Most of the time, the minimum wait can be 45 minutes to an hour, but there are times where it can be less than 10 minutes! It just all depends on the time and day. This location is large and spacious, which I love. They also have a nice bar and outdoor seating area. The ladies room is clean and nicely kept. Parking is easy as there are several free parking structures nearby. Staff is friendly, but service can be severly delayed at times. My sister and I was shopping in the area and we were randomly craving some Cheesecake Factory. Luckily, we didn't have to wait long to be seated, but we did have to wait some time before our server was able to check in with us and take our orders. We shared the Crispy Crab Wontons and the Lunch BBQ Chicken Pizza with a Cesar Salad. Food was okay. It's your typical Cheesecake food, nothing spectacular other than portion sizes being generous to share with. We were so full that we ended up passing on cheesecake! Boo. Overall, not a shabby Cheesecake Factory. I do think it's better than the Stoneridge location. Prices (for all Cheesecake Factory locations) are a bit steep in comparison to the quality of the food, but again, portion sizes are generous and not to mention Cheesecake Factory has an extensive menu! There is definitely something for everyone. Although it's not the best restaurant ever, I will return in the future. I mean, who honestly doesn't like cheesecake?"
Nicole L.,"Martinez, CA",17,160,692,4.0,7/29/2017,"This place has it all!  One of the most extensive menus that exists anywhere, delicious food, huge portions and gorgeous atmosphere and of course, the wide array of decadent cheesecakes. The listed calories on the menu is a mixed bag:  Great to know, but hair-raising when you see the astronomical amounts contained in their meals.   If, however, the high calories really do bother you, no need to worry, cause they've got it covered with their Skinnylicious menu selection with loads of lower calorie options.  I had their skinnylicious chicken pot pie last night and it was wonderful. There is, however, one thing that I have always found perplexing about this restaurant.   For a place  that pumps out one great meal after another, why oh why, are their fries so terrible?  They're at the top of my list for worst fries ever.  In no way, do they compare to the rest of their perfected menu items.   There is often a wait time to get a table and in my experience, it can take quite a while for the food to come out of the kitchen. Last night however, everything went very smoothly and our waiter was outstanding.   I wish I would have taken the trouble to get his name All in all though, it's a great place and if you can't find anything on the menu that appeals to you, you should really just stay home and eat worms."
Erica D.,"Martinez, CA",340,201,63,3.0,11/10/2017,"Hmmmm i feel like its kinda gone down hill. I have probably ate at various cheesecake factories 3 dozen times in my life, and this particular one at least a dozen times. Huge menu. No wait on a Wednesday night! Bread that they bring out was stale. Ordered mac n cheese balls which are normally my favorite food item to ever eat. - they lacked sauce and have no garnish on them as they normally do. Tasted like they had been fried in older oil. Ordered a small bites salad, it came under-dressed. Shared a huge plate of Riesling seasonal chicken pasta with my bf. While the price point of $13 was great, the pasta seriouly tasted like it came out of a pasta roni!!!! like literally the same. Portion was so large even with sharing it we had leftovers to bring home! All of their portions are so big here  Service and drinks were great. They need to step up their food game."
Carla H.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,15,1,5.0,1/5/2018,Normally I consider the Cheesecake Factory as a standard experience and food OK. But last night was totally different. My family and I had went there for my birthday. The wait was a little long as it seemed they had a few birthdays last night but we got seated in a great section. Greg was our server. He was very attentive friendly and on point. Our cocktails were awesome and the food was even more surprisingly awesome. The bill somehow ended up being surprisingly cheap compared to all the food we ordered and the drinks. Not sure what happened there I'll have to ask Greg. But it was a great birthday experience including cake ice cream and singing. Greg packed up all the leftovers and when I open them later that night they were perfect. I had a super experience for my birthday.
Bree D.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,44,28,4.0,11/18/2017,"My husband and I came here on a Friday night. They were packed, but there was only a 15-20 minute wait. There is first come first serve bar seating and table top seating in the bar area which is nice. We ordered the avocado egg rolls and fried calamari for appetizers. We shared the grilled salmon with rice for our main course. Everything was so tasty! The dipping sauce for the avocado rolls was really good! Salmon was cooked perfectly. Quick service, large menu and great food."
Cheryl G.,"Moraga, CA",0,14,,1.0,12/28/2017,"Just wanted to let people know there is happy hour but not on drinks and the drinks are just a lot of juice. I ordered the blood orange martini and it hardly had any alcohol...it's a Martini! I ordered a shot to make it taste like a martini. When I ordered the shot the ""new to taking our order"" bartender said it's the worse drink there and he wouldn't have recommended it. Wow I just spent money on that!?! So disappointed and this place is a second rate bar. Good we ordered was ok but nothing remarkable. Stuffed mushrooms, beet salad, and fried zucchini. Last time there was  2011 for a dinner,  forgettable too.not returning"
Justice M.,"Antioch, CA",1,8,27,1.0,9/14/2017,BUGS! BUGS! BUGS! They don't even deserve Half A Star!  My family has always had dinner at the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco and it is amazing!  This place is disgusting !!!!!!!! I came here with a couple of my cousins and we were just in shock. The bartender was the only nice person in the building(which is the reason I would rate this place with half a star). The host at the front was VERY RUDE to us!!! I seriously don't know how she got this job when her customer service skills SUCK! You are the face of the company and the very first person people see when they walk in.  THE WORSE PART: There were flies EVERYWHERE!!!! We probably ate about six each just walking in. There were so many bugs in the vicinity it was disgusting
Adrianna T.,"Richmond, CA",211,66,192,5.0,7/12/2017,"Every location I have visited for lunch or dinner, they never seem to fail me. It doesn't matter what I order, they always get my order right and it's delicious.  The staff are always helpful and polite. Even when you're being the most difficult customer, ordering something difficult, they have always put a smile on. They always remember to bring water and unlimited bread to the table, especially when you run out.  I've ordered many things on the menu and surprisingly, everything has turned out to be good. The mac n' cheese isn't too dry nor too cheesy, the steak has always been been perfect (medium) not too salty, the mashed potatoes are fluffy and tasty. Many things I can comment on, but I suggest you find out for yourself.  One of my favorite spots to grab a quick bite, and/or to have a dinner party for a birthday or event."
Robert B.,"San Francisco, CA",492,82,64,4.0,7/12/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory was the first one I've been to in NorCal, specifically in Walnut Creek. There's paid meter parking available right next to the restaurant inside the structure and fairly cheap too. The restaurant itself is very nice, kept clean and organized. One trouble I had was locating the restroom, maybe a little sign would help (if there was one my fault for not seeing it) Our experience was great mainly due to our server Oscar. Although we came pretty late (9pm) he was still as energetic, polite and helpful as ever. Started off with drinks and bread as usual.  We did a basic 3 course meal-- crab dip for appetizer, pasta for entree, and of course, cheesecake for dessert! Personally for me the crab dip tasted a little different, but my date didn't mind it. The pasta was delicious as usual, however I ordered my pasta with chicken. When I got the plate... no chicken. After asking about it one other server (not Oscar) gave me a little attitude on how I didn't order it, which I clearly did lol. After waiting a few minutes we see Oscar rushing through to the kitchen then back to us, then back to the kitchen and back to us a few times to see if I got my chicken. Unfortunately I didn't, but I appreciate his effort and hustle. Fast forward to dessert, the Cheesecake was delish! 'Nuff said.  Overall, you're gonna get either a helpful server or a not so helpful server who's affected by the time period of the day. Was going to give a 3.5 if able to, but I'll just round it up to 4 stars. Oscar was a great guy that gave us a great Cheesecake experience. Hopefully next time we go back we get Oscar, or someone like him!"
Peter A.,"Danville, CA",9,133,434,2.0,7/9/2017,"Location is great but the food is salty! been here a couple of times both times food was salty ...clearly they need to change the recipe as everyone I know who goes here tells me of the same thing, salty food .. Dessert is very good"
Meghan P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",236,71,390,4.0,6/7/2017,"This location is nice and central. We went to the cheesecake before our movie and it was right across from the theatre. We were in and out within 45 minutes.  It's a huge restaurant with tons of menu options. The bathrooms were big and clean. Service was a little slow. We waited till we were long done eating to see our server again to get the bill.  Their cheesecakes are amazing we got vanilla bean and tiramisu. I would recommend both!! I got a lemondrop martini and it was good a little too sweet. My husband got a Long Island iced tea and was a little disappointed with the strength of it.  If you're looking for a place with tons of variety, so-so service, and lots of drink options this is the place for you!!  They also keep the bread and butter flowing so if you come hungry you won't starve while waiting for your meal to come."
Cecilia V.,"Rialto, CA",76,5,4,3.0,1/3/2018,"Waited a long time to get seated, we had to remind staff that we where waiting.. waitress took even longer for us to get our drinks and order in. Food was good ."
Byron D.,"Walnut Creek, CA",49,9,,1.0,1/4/2018,"Abysmal: a menu that celebrates if you can't focus on/execute one good dish, try to do everything in a mediocre manner...including the signature cheesecakes & their thousand variant, hypoglycemic shock inducing over-sugariness. Bad service, weak drinks, & not-worth-it waiting times. One can tell there's no joy of cooking in the kitchen-- it's a production line."
Jc L.,"Fairfield, CA",8,13,,1.0,1/4/2018,My whole family ate here we arrive 11:40am got orders taken by 11:50 food arrived 12:50 my aunt who works near was on her 1hr 30min lunch never got her food and went to work without eating. I work as a cook my whole life so I took a peek in their kitchen their cooks are basura no sense of urgency in a rush hour
Jessica W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",248,128,266,4.0,3/25/2017,"I've been going to this location for years and it does not change for better or for worse.  Waiting times: Can be excruciatingly long to get a table for dinner, especially since they do not take reservations. Luckily they have a nice outdoor patio for waiting, but if you have a large group, go early or late. Otherwise you can wait for several hours.  Food: Cheesecake Factory is known for their large portions. With large portions comes loads of calories. They do have ""skinny options"" but it's not what they're known for.  Chicken Bellagio- My personal favorite. The basil pesto pasta is always consistent and delicious. It's a bit greasy and creamy from the pesto but nevertheless satisfying. The chicken is a large amount and cooked fully with a crunchy exterior. I love the arugula and prosciutto on top which add texture and freshness. Overall the portion is HUGE and I always expect to have leftovers, which is a good thing.  French Dip- not the best French dip, but definitely a satisfying amount of food. Lots of French fries which is a plus. The bread is nicely toasted and buttered but the meats and filling are not very well balanced and was a bit salty.  Hazelnut Cheesecake- If you love Nutella, you'll love this cheesecake. It's not too heavy or rich like other cheesecakes but will definitely meet any hazelnut cravings.  White Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake- One of my favorites for not being too sweet. My favorite part is the chocolate crust, it's perfection and adds more depth.  Complimentary bread- Always makes a trip to Cheesecake worth for the warm slices of bread and butter.  Overall, cheesecake has huge portions, is very consistent, not a healthy option and may or may not be worth the wait."
Jasmine E.,"Oakland, CA",67,2,,1.0,1/9/2018,I haven't been back since my last fiasco here but I really wanted their little house salad and I was ordering to go and figured what could possibly go wrong....call and I'm on hold 10 minutes finally someone answer I order the salad and I'm told 30 minutes...... 30 minutes for a salad that literally consist of lettuce one tomato slice and 2 thin pieces of cucumber.....seriously it's been 45 minutes still waiting..... first time shame on you second time shame on me and believe me there won't be a third officially done eating here there are to many options in the area for this
Shan C.,"Concord, CA",28,142,194,2.0,12/27/2017,Hhmm I guess I'll stick to the San Jose (Valley Fair) Location. Overly greasy so greasy that I couldn't even  enjoy the food. Not sure if it was because I did take out or what. But the quality of food was meh.
John P.,"Dublin, CA",1,11,,2.0,1/1/2018,Slow night we waited on hold for 10 minutes to place a pickup order of 4 cheesecakes.  Drove from Concord to WC to pick up order... Wasn't ready and girl behind the counter seemed bothered her we waited 17 minutes to get our pickup order and treated as an imposition and an irritation.   Additionally we have always enjoyed the large portions as we share the with our group... not anymore.  7-8 bucks a slice and smaller the normal portion.   We can find better service and food and deserts.  We used love the place but these changes have been disappointing.
William H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,84,,3.0,12/30/2017,"If ever there were a place which proved the idea that if people want the food badly enough they will even tolerate terrible service this is it.  And we are as guilty as others of going back in spite of management that clearly has not incentive to do better.   It's a crowd-pleaser so when looking for straight-up options we'll probably keep going back.  How's the food?  Fine. It's the Cheesecake Factory.  Nothing will wow you but everything will please you and you can see by the endless crowds others agree.  It's hard to recall getting the wrong order or things not being cooked properly so it's clear why they are a success wherever they go since that is hard to do so well.  The wine and beer list is long enough and reasonably priced.  It's Cheesecake- they know what they are doing.  But then there's the service.  After a year or so of decent service the older manager must have gotten promoted and things fell back into the old ways.   Ordering take out was good for a while but now the long waits on hold (if they come back) and long waits when you get there are back. When dining in there is the return of the ""not my table"" problem that leads to long waits to place an order.  And then at peak times getting your food can take a long time as well.  Things get worse if your server takes a break midway through service.  At this point this is what we expect and just bake it in to our expectations.  Everyone is very nice so you will never have rude service - that's why they are still A-OK- and why things will probably never improve.  What's the incentive?"
Tony J.,"Union City, CA",102,43,,1.0,12/17/2017,"management needs to hire more people for the cheesecake to go desk area....I stopped in after a movie hoping to just get a slice to go, but I ended up standing around in line for 20 minutes watching the single employee at the counter frantically run around to try to fill orders, meanwhile myself and the other 8 customers weren't even acknowledged at all.  pro tip: if you want a slice of cheesecake to go, take a number and get seated, and order it from your waitress, its faster."
Sam H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",3,23,30,5.0,11/7/2017,"Wow! You really can't go wrong with this place. The atmosphere is incredible, the workers are amazing and the food is wow! Everything about this place is a 5 Star. The cheesecakes are incredible also!!! Really a big fan of this place and it's a one in a while thing since it's a bit on the pricy side, but you get big portions!! I love this place!! The bad part is they don't take reservations past 5:30 and it gets super crowded after 6 ish. I arrived at 6 on a Tuesday and we got a table right away, but I arrived once at 7:00 and we waited for 45 minutes for a table and just bailed on them. Go at an earlier time and you'll get a seat right away!"
Lee N.,"Walnut Creek, CA",2,5,2,5.0,8/22/2017,"Great Service, great staff and great food. It is located in convenient location, super clean tables with all the attention from staff. I will definitely be back . Parking garage is on The corner and have silent and spacious outside area for your dinner.  Price range is slightly less than average and their deserts are amazing. What else can I say, simply try it and see it with your own eyes."
Mikey H.,"Pinole, CA",0,4,1,1.0,12/31/2017,"Ordered a couple meals to go. One was a chicken Madeira, substituting mashed potatoes with broccoli. The other was a macaroni cheeseburger. I also got a few cheesecakes. My order came out and they had forgotten to give me my cheesecakes. They packed up my cheesecakes and I headed home. When I got home, I unpacked the disappointment! The cheeseburger bun was basically charred and what is worse, was that they failed to add the side of broccoli to the chicken Madeira. My partner was very specific and really excited about having broccoli tonight and there was not even any side at all. Absolutely disappointing! I would expect more for $60+!!!! Zero stars for ruining our last New Year's Eve dinner splurge"
AnaLeesa W.,"Vallejo, CA",0,20,3,4.0,12/8/2017,"Service was great! Drinks were great (Moscato & Cabernet) I had the eggplant parmiagiana and was very pleased with my selection. I've had this dish at numerous places and this one was by far the best. I also ordered calamari as an appetizer and I have to say that this wasn't my favorite type of calamari. Calamari is a hit or miss for me, either I really like it or I don't. This one in particular had the pieces with the tentacles still intact and that is what did it for me. Everything else was really good and the bill was very reasonable.  The set up of the restaurant is really nice too. Each table feels very private. Ended off my dinner with a raspberry lemon cheesecake and it was yummmmy. Will be back"
Andy L.,"Berkeley, CA",1557,217,1312,4.0,1/13/2017,"Where do you begin with talking about the Cheesecake Factory? I guess with cheesecake... Oh how decadent the cheesecakes are! My favorites are Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, Key Lime, Cherry, anything with chocolate and most important, the Banana Cream! Bananananana! On a serious note, looks can be deceiving, as it's strongly represented by 1 burger in particular. Don't get me wrong, I think all their dishes, from pastas to seafood to burgers are all delicious. The problem from that 1 burger I mentioned stems from the meat, Kobe Beef! *IMPORTANT!: it's often assumed that a Kobe Burger will contain actual Kobe Beef. Dead Wrong!  There are 8 restaurant, Correction! 9 restaurants in the U.S. that are certified to serve real Kobe Beef.  Therefore, their Kobe Beef burger is as good as ostrich, if not worse! Of these 9 restaurants, The Cheesecake Factory isn't one of them to make the list. 2 factors that characterize Kobe Beef is the marbled texture which melts in your mouth when you eat it and second, the price which should be reflective to the real cost of $55 dollars an ounce; nowhere in comparison to the $15 dollar burger by The Cheesecake Factory.  I've ordered this item several times reluctantly knowing it's not close to the real thing. Fun fact: Wagyu Beef (or Kobe as we call it in the states) is from pure bred cattle raised on a special diet in Japan. I've witnessed the cattle getting massages and special treatment...with a 'happy ending' of course! The A5 Quality Grade entitles the beef as being the very best; this was more of A1, C1 Grade. Another giveaway to the fake meat was when I asked my most recent waitress where the Kobe came from. She replied by saying she didn't know, as it seems the past waiters didn't know either.  My stomach always enjoys itself at The Cheesecake factory and sometimes, I get so full that there's absolutely no room for dessert, which is essentially the reason I came. The easy fix is to eat dessert first and take home the main course as leftovers.   Another word of advice: do ask how much a drink is if you're all about the mix drinks. I should've known better to ask how much a Long Island was before I actually ordered it. I'm used to my Long Island's being in a Highball, not a Stemless Bourbon Glass in which my Long Island was in. The drink cost me $11.50 and I finished it in only 2 measly sips... 4 Mississippi's  TLDR: long story short, be careful what you order! Kobe Beef is fake at most places! Cheesecake is yummy!  --------------- --------------- Overall experience: 8/10 food, service and ambience Water quality: 8.5/10"
Socorro W.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",14,22,5,1.0,12/24/2017,"There is a new girl employee working at the pick-up/takeout counter who is rude as hell. I was there to pick up my order and she said it wasn't ready yet. After waiting for more than 10 minutes, the food was just sitting on the floor in a bag. Take note, I didn't see anybody bring in new orders from the kitchen!  So, my food has just been sitting there!  I heard the same complaints from people waiting there that new employee is nothing but a piece of shit. I will be getting her name and update this review."
Jana C.,"East Bay, CA",470,2986,10633,5.0,1/18/2017,My friends treated lunch here the other day. Delicious and so much food as well. Gorgeous huge CF and great service for lunch. Yummy for my tummy....no dessert.
David C.,"Martinez, CA",0,1,1,1.0,1/8/2018,"Great staff, very friendly and prompt service, Although the people were great I cant say the same for the cleanliness. Table was sticky with food , Silverware was placed directly on table top which isn't a big deal until I noticed how nasty the table was, I started to inspect the silverware and sure enough there were chunks of food still on multiple pieces of silverware including a large piece of what looked like dried spinach. I kindly asked for a new set of silverware and when the new set came they were also dirty. At this point I just cleaned them off myself. I'm not much of a complainer when I go to restaurants but at this point I was pretty grossed out and I honestly didn't want to eat there anymore. I was out with family so I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. This was my first time there and was quite disappointed. If the silverware is dirty I would hate to see what else is not handled properly.."
Ashley F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",50,309,120,1.0,1/4/2017,"For some reason, we keep coming back here and I don't really know why. Maybe it's the location and how close it is to us and things around it that we like. Anyway, the cheesecake factory always finds a new way to disappoint us. So here is todays gross story. We ordered 2 waters and when I finished my water, I noticed that there was water left inside the bottom of the glass even though it was empty. The glass also looked strange. When I realized what this was (after I drank the glass), I was disgusted. It was a glass saucer that was stuck in the bottom with dirty water around it (and in my glass). I immediately asked for a manager and showed it to him. He offered a free slice of cheesecake which is great but still disgusting. How this happens is beyond me but it shouldn't happen. This restaurant in general has cleanliness problems and the silverware is often very dirty. Check out the pics for more awesomeness!"
Amber P.,"Antioch, CA",0,5,1,2.0,10/13/2017,"Went in with a party of 7, at 11:30am on a Friday, not busy what so ever. We ordered 3 appetizers, 2 of which came out pretty fast- the third one took forever, we asked that it be taken off bill b/c we figured it was taking so long and our main course meals would be coming soon. We were wrong, we waited a whole hour for our food to come out, talked to a manager who went to ""see what the problem was"" and never came back to check on us!. Our food finally came, no apologies of any kind! We saw 4 different tables get their food before we did!  Food was decent but could for sure use some service/management training!!"
Young B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",13,10,,2.0,10/25/2017,"Every time I come here I ask myself, why did I come here?? There is always a wait followed by a second wait, followed by waiting for the waiter. Today was a weeknight, Wednesday. Told 20 minutes, then was told after the buzzer went off to wait by the tree. 10 minutes more minutes by the tree.  The food isn't bad, but it isn't excellent. I like the skinnylicious menu. None of their pasta is very good. everything is overpriced.  Kids like their cheesecake so I guess that's why we keep coming back. And I forget after a length of time that I said I'm never coming back.  I guess the place serves its purpose."

Bernadette T.,"Pittsburg, CA",40,230,107,4.0,8/8/2017,"Love this location. Always busy, but totally worth it. Everything Ive had is delicious. And the cheesecakes are sooooo good. A little pricey, but as I previously said, worth it."
Michelle S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",37,18,8,3.0,11/14/2017,The appetizers are good Most of the entrees are good (burgers air ok)  Prices are over the top expensive they don't need to charge so much.  I've decided not to go again.  Cheese cake is excellent tho
Saeed R.,"Richmond, CA",67,94,39,3.0,8/6/2017,"This was my second time ever going to this location (the first time was in June). It was pretty standard for a Cheesecake Factory. No set theme (is it African? Asian? Egyptian?) My party was seated extremely quickly and was given the menu. Once out bread finally came it, we only had one piece of each type of bread. Uhmmmm what is that going to do? So after a billion carbs later, we settled on the BBQ Chicken Salad, Cheese Bites, and Cheesecake. The salad was big enough for both of us to eat it and be stuffed. Next time, I will not order it with cucumbers. By time the cheesecake came out (Smores Flavor) we were both stuffed. Next time, I will not order that particular type of cheesecake. Too much chocolate for me! Way too much chocolate"
