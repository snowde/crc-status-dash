David P.,"Antioch, CA",126,63,33,1.0,9/10/2016,"Probably the worst place I've been too. From the service to the food it was all bad. The waiter seemed to have forgotten about us and our food. Tried to flag him down but he was to busy paying attention to the table full of girls. After asking for our food the shrimp weren't deveined, the pasta was super salty, and the sandwich bread the other diner had was soggy. Had to send the it back and instead of offering us the menu to see if we would like anything else the waiter took the food and didn't return with the check for thirty minutes. All in all I strongly advise avoiding this place if you are hungry because even if you wanted to talk to a manager it will take at least an hour wait."
E U.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",3,5,4,1.0,5/19/2017,"Mind blowing slow service! Everytime I go there it gets slower. Today I went there around 9:20pm, for my husband's birthday. Food came slow as usual. Then we paid around 10:50pm. Waited for the birthday cake and singing until 11:35pm because the waitress told us she will be right back! Because I am pregnant, it was so uncomfortable to me to seat and wait for this long time. But I really wanted my husband to get his birthday song. We waited and waited but she did not bring the cake. We left disappointed! Never going back again! I would recommend to go there, if someone wants to challenge their patience of waiting."
Sharrie N.,"Novato, CA",242,232,671,2.0,1/25/2015,"This location is pretty is consistent with the chains. However , their menu execution is quite disappointing. Appetizer- Eggroll with avocado was mushy. I think it may have sit too long beiges it was served. I couldn't find the crunch I was looking for. Drinks 1 star: I ordered the mango cocktail- it was good.. Reminds of slushy with alcohol  Main course: I ordered their veggie burger and was quite disappointed  :( it's made out of grains that was not constructed very well.. It was not cohesive..  1 star for their cheesecake!! I wish I could give this a four, but unfortunately it wasn't the only thing I ordered. Service - it took awhile for my drinks, appetizer and event he main course .. It is a busy Sunday .."
Jeremy K.,"Walnut Creek, CA",14,8,14,1.0,10/7/2016,"Terrible experience , had to wait for curbside. Then opened a container barely half full of cold food. Do better"
Jonathan Y.,"Union City, CA",296,29,271,1.0,2/18/2016,"My friend and I have a little joke about this place where we consider it a five star restaurant (her friend truly thought this place was a five star restaurant and we called it this for over a year. Their ambiance isn't too shabby and people dress... Kind of nice I guess.). We had a good amount of respect for this place, coming here maybe once every month or so. This experience was by far the worst experience I've ever had here.  Wait time: We put our name down and they said it would be about an hour to an hour and a half wait. So we waited. And waited. And waited. A little less than two hours went by and still nothing. We stood by where they called the names so it's not like we didn't hear them. I asked them about our table only to be told they called our name already. Then they said that we would get the next available table. They called several other two party names but still didn't say our name. It's not like they mispronounced it... It's Jon. How hard can that be. So about thirty more minutes went by before I asked them again what the status of our table was. They replied by telling me that they had already called our name and seated us. Food: I ordered the chicken Marsala and substituted the pasta for a salad. It wasn't bad but it seems like it was done cooking and sitting out from the looks of it. There was a film already formed on the sauce. As for the salad, it was extremely bland. If you like a Caesar salad with a tiny big of sauce, over fried croutons, and browning lettuce then this is perfect for you. On a positive note, the fried macaroni was good. Only problem was that they skimped out on the sauce this time. They usually have more. Either way I do recommend it.  Service: The service was extremely unresponsive. They didn't do anything to make up for what they did. I think because it wasn't our waitresses fault, she felt like it wasn't her problem. She even decided to disappear for 10 minutes and this was when we were finished eating too.   Overall I would have to say that this experience was just disappointing"
Diem N.,"Sacramento, CA",13,71,96,3.0,9/24/2016,"WHAT happened to The Cheesecake Factory, foodwise? Cheesecakes are still as delicious and addicting as ever, but the food, the food has gone downhill. The service was acceptable for a busy dinner night. The wait was only about 10 minutes on a Thursday night. Food portions are huge, but not appetizing. We ordered the Chicken Piccata (a favorite), Chicken Littles (chicken nuggets), and the Chicken Parm. It was all mediocre, I don't think I want to eat Chicken Piccata for awhile now. We literally took 3-4 bites and packed up to leave. The location is great and a good area to explore, shop and hang out. Love the new updates to the Walnut Creek area."
Jude L.,"Vallejo, CA",0,3,,4.0,5/8/2017,"My wife and I often come here for our date nights. Wonderful service, great food. Cant complain about the restaurant overall because it is just amazing. However we finally had a bad experience there. Our waiter, Joel, was extremely rude and just overall an awful waiter. He never introduced himself to us, just said ""Do you want any drinks"", To which we ordered our drinks and appetizer. We waited almost 20 minutes after our appetizer had arrived to even order our entrees. I had my hand on the menus sitting on the table, getting ready to hand them to Joel, but he grabbed them out of my hand off the table before the conversation was even over. We tried brushing it off as if maybe he was just having a bad day and it would just blow over.. Everyone has bad days, we get it. At one of the 3 times he stopped at the table (during the whole 2 hour experience) and let out a huge sigh as if he was exhausted serving us, which he barely did anyways.  But lastly- the restaurant is great.. But Joel on the other hand is not."

Shirley C.,"Burnaby, Canada",37,144,177,2.0,8/12/2016,"Why do people wait an hour to eat here? I don't get it! There are a lot of great restaurants in the area but I guess if you want to experience obesity in the making with oversized portions of food that's just ok then this is the place for you! You could order one dish for two and still share a slice of cheesecake. Too bad the waits are so long! Oh I also got bumped into by a server with a tray full of glasses, and no apologies from the floor manager who saw her walk into me. Hmphf !"
Ursula H.,"El Sobrante, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/27/2017,The manager Paul... Is an ass! He watched us all night as if we were stealing something... And even went as far as to admit it...Is it because we are of African-American race Paul? I'm thinking so!...Two thumbs down Paul!...U suck!
Dino R.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",1,33,47,1.0,5/6/2016,"Walnut Creek, CA First time at Cheese Cake Faketory yes Faketory, hardly anyone eating there around 3pm, we wanted to enjoy the weather and sit outside, manager/ hostess Victor Lim said 10min wait to sit outside due to one server outside with only a few customers sitting outside (not my problem) he offers us to sit inside to be seated right away and we still had to wait 10min with a lot of empty tables. Our order did not come out after 20min. The buffalo wings were over cooked dry and hard, asked him to refund this order, he still was debating if he should do it or not, told him to take this to the back and eat it and see how hard and dry the chicken is. Got our bill and he didn't refund our order. So the bottom line he lost us as future customers and now gets a 1 star review. Great Manager skills, not!!!"
Rob N.,"Tracy, CA",0,43,4,1.0,3/31/2017,"Love how expensive the frozen food is here. I also love that I get a extra fly in my order of food and the waiter nonchalantly says ""oh, sorry"" dude at least take that meal off the bill for us. This is such a gross place !"
Umeet S.,"Berkeley, CA",287,157,134,1.0,6/17/2016,"Not a fan. Though the service here is okay, and the venue is huge, the food absolutely sucks. This is not Cheesecake Factory quality food, unless the other Cheesecake Factories I've been to have been above average. In that case I am not a fan of Cheesecake Factory. He ordered a burger, and I ordered the eggplant parmesan. He thought his burger was okay, but I didn't really enjoy my eggplant parmesan at all. I ate about a quarter, mostly because I was starving, but it tasted slightly undercooked, and really greasy. Again, not a fan. To top it all off, I had ordered a slice of cheesecake with strawberries to go. And it ended up being disgusting. The strawberries tasted unbearably artificial, and the cheesecake was subpar. I have never been unimpressed by Cheesecake Factory cheesecake, let alone disgusted by it. I guess bravo to this location for steeping to an all time low. There are better places to eat around this location - so walk away and thank me later."
Bernard J.,"Antioch, CA",0,7,1,5.0,5/23/2017,Customer yesterday at your restaurant about 2:30 an noticed a young lady working on an order and a lady was upset because she was waiting to long she thought.  The lady was so rude to the young lady that I wanted to defend her.  The lady gave the young lady a compliment and the young lady replied thank you and she was by herself trying to get everything together an the lady told the young lady that she was not giving her a compliment but she was being sarcastic   I felt so bad for the young lady.  I respect how the young lady handled herself.  The people you have there are always happy and this is why I dine at the ccf.   Continue the good work.   I think that customers should not be as nasty as the lady was.  Rude
Amanda T.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,1,,1.0,9/5/2017,"I never write on here but I think it's time to. The Cheesecake Factory at this location is absolutely horrible. I order to go and use DoorDash frequently and everytime, without fail, the order is made incorrectly. Worst when you call they try to make it DoorDash's fault.  Do they make the food? Do they put the bags together? No. That's on the kitchen and the to go line. I don't know who owns/manages this location but they are really falling down on the job."
Edgar F.,"Richmond, CA",38,42,153,5.0,3/26/2016,"Great atmosphere, best cheesecake I've ever had, (govida chocolate is my favorite). Good quality food and always consistent, the place is always clean, they have full bar, and great service.  5 stars"
Jason C.,"Financial District, San Francisco, CA",0,17,,2.0,9/15/2017,"I've been coming here for years but I've fallen out of love with this Cheesecake Factory. My last two experiences were almost identical and well below that of other locations.  The menu is great and there's usually something for everyone. The food quality is also good, it's getting it that's the problem. On my last two visits with a small group - 4 - there was 20-25 minute delay between the first person's entrée arriving and the last person's, such that everyone was finished by the time his food came out. They also forgot to bring out the appetizers and gave us frozen cheesecake to finish.  I get that things like this happen, it was unfortunate that it happened to us on two visits in a row, but what really was disappointing was the manager's attitude.  He came to our table he said that the particular cheesecake was a favorite and so they didn't have time to defrost it....... Then when we mentioned the delay in bringing the food out and that some people had already finished before others got their food, his responses was ""Well, what do you expect? Do you see how busy we are?"" What do I expect? I expect you to only seat the number of patrons that you can actually serve. Apparently this Cheesecake Factory doesn't agree."
Nishel L.,"Oakland, CA",0,22,14,4.0,4/7/2017,The wait was horrible. But the food was great. My friends and I had a great time. Our waiter was thee best!!! Parking was easy. Options were good.
April M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",130,41,82,5.0,8/26/2016,Amazing Duo Service at the Bar w/ Jenna & Shawnna... Check out their pic w/ my fav under rated Stoli Vodka
Kevin K.,"San Francisco, CA",40,60,7,1.0,1/3/2017,"I waited 45 minutes for a table last night (8pm on Monday night). The server forgot 1:3 drinks, the bread, and forgot to inform my partner that his meal would not come with the sauce indicated on the menu because they ""ran out"". They also ""ran out"" of the mac and cheese balls.  I went to the restroom and it was absolutely disgusting. Someone had made a mess in one of the stalls and it smelled like homeless people had been cleaning themselves in there. Also, the waste baskets were overflowing with used paper towels.  The restaurant was also freezing. They had the back door (going out to the parking garage) propped open which created a cold draft.  I really expect better customer service and cleanliness from this restaurant."
