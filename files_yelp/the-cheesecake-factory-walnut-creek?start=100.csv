Enrique C.,"San Jose, CA",35,36,,4.0,9/10/2017,Great food and atmosphere with a friendly staff. Yeah the way can be a little brutal...so for that we can't rate a 5. But it just might be worth the brutal wait times.
Shannon B.,"Fairfield, CA",146,4,,1.0,10/1/2017,Waited almost 30 minutes to get quoted a wait time for my party. A male manager approached us and told us it would be another 30-40 minutes. One of the girls I was with told him we had already waited 30 minutes and he approached us and continued to yell at her that she should have expected it. Most RUDE service I have ever seen. He needs to be fired. Not a very friendly person at all.
Federico D.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5,2,,1.0,9/30/2017,"If you come here you need to be the master of patience. Food takes 45 minutes to be prepared and waiters get overwhelmed when they have to manage more than 5 tables. I come often but I know I have to wait a lot to have the food on the table. The price is ok-ish but the wait is too much, you are buying the experience. They make you wait even if they have plenty of room available. The cheesecakes are amazing and that is what saves the dinner from being a complete disaster."
Lizzie S.,"Oakland, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/28/2017,"After waiting 30 minutes past the 55 minute wait we were originally told, I went to speak to the host. I was told I was 11th on the list and would need to wait another 15-20 minutes. I waited and then asked again and was told I was 4th on the list, I continued to wait (7 months pregnant with my husband and 5 year old kid) after ANOTHER 15 minutes I asked to speak to the manager who clearly didn't care about our wait and told us we would have to wait-no discount, no wait time, no free cheesecake, nothing.  When we were FINALLY seated, we were told there was a backup in the kitchen and the food would be late.  We left....after waiting an hour past our original wait time."
Heather A.,"Redding, CA",15,124,25,3.0,4/18/2017,"We love the Cheesecake Factory!  Our visit here was okay... The food was excellent... Service & response time & food served time was a looooong wait..... Other than that, it was delivered hot, just took a while."
Sac M.,"Sacramento, CA",39,180,426,2.0,3/7/2017,"Strolled in on a mondaynight around 9 pm decent amount of people but not too bad let me just start by saying (the beginning) first impressions are everything; we walk in and are able to be seated right away we asked for a booth for two and were seated way in the corner in the back of the Establishment which  I definitely was unhappy with and asked to be moved so the hostess moved us to a booth I requested; waited about 5 min to be seated and when we got to the second booth the floor was dirty surrounding our table and food was left on the seat which I brought to his attention and he quickly tried to wipe it off but I did not want to eat dinner at a booth with a dirty floor surrounding my feet ( disgusting) it's a mondaynight not too busy to where u guys can not clean up I didn't see one busser in sight  I sware I almost walked out .on to table number 3 after a couple of min. We were finally seated this time booth was ok with ( only just a little crumbs on the table ( which shouldn't be there at all) but after moving 2 other times I just brushed them off myself I almost felt like I was going to see roaches next!!!!  time to view the menu and order finally    FOOD CHOICE: steak and shrimp scampi Diane and salmon and shrimp scampi Diane & a Greek salad with kale  food had a good flavor but was cold we were going to request our food be hot but I said just forget it I requested my steak well it had a good flavor but was overcoked and too dry the shrimp were very good had a great flavor and cooked in a yummy sauce , honey was not a fan of the salmon but everything else was good too bad the food wasn't hot  SERVICE: considering how dry the rest of the staff was and non welcoming  our server was decent he let us sample a Little wine before making a decision and this is why I like to bring my own wine overpriced basic tasting wine. The server came by a few times just in passing and only asked once how were things nothing special but he was ok not bad and not good!  CONCLUSION: I've been to this establishment in San Francisco which is always packed which is why I came here and the ambience and service was so much better had no problems Cheesecake Factory is a popular in my Opinion casual place to dine but I'm sorry this location was horrible it looks nice on the outside and inside but is poorly maintained each section we went to was dirty staff looks very bored and Unintrested I'm glad this was just a casual date night and not a special Ocassion or I would have been very upset and probably would have informed the manger but hey that's what Yelp is for and by the way whoever the manger is clearly does not care or is not attentive to the restaurant he is managing these standards are unexceptable especially for this place I don't recommend this location you'll probably be disappointed or leave with bread crumbs or a bug in your bag I'll never return to this location!  Check out their previous reviews click the more review tab I'm sure they wouldn't even pAss an onsite inspection"
Joey F.,"Brentwood, CA",5,94,44,1.0,2/26/2017,"The pastas here used to be really good. The last three times we've come here and ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta and spicy chipotle pasta it's been horrible. It's come out very dry and the taste has been off. I'm not sure if they have changed their recipe but whatever is going on, it's pretty bad. To wait 50 minutes on a Saturday night and have food like this is unacceptable. The waitress was nice and offered some more sauce but by the time that comes the pasta is already cold appetite is gone. The factory nachos used to be good and last night it was burned in some areas. I would definitely avoid this place if you can help it."
Jaiesha C.,"Vallejo, CA",18,53,47,5.0,4/25/2017,"It was a Friday afternoon on April 21, 2017. My two friends and I decided to celebrate one of my friends birthday. We came inside, immediately got our seats, our servers name were Chris and Josh (I think; both were great). I ordered the Chicken Taquitos, crab cake bites (those are very very delicious; you have to try them!!) as appeitizers. As for entree; I ordered the New Truffle Honey Chicken; it came with red mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was soo delicious. I had it paired with a refreshing Cucumber Lemonade; that drink is very refreshing. You have to try it! Overall service was great; my friend got her birthday cheesecake and ice cream. I would recommend both Walnut Creek and San Francisco locations."
Jen H.,"Goleta, CA",10,47,70,4.0,3/11/2017,"Always a go-to spot of mine if I want a vast selection of foods. The food is higher quality than what you'd expect from a chain restaurant, but also a little pricier. A lunch-sized portion of the pasta carbonara with chicken was $16.95, and that's for the less expensive option. Nonetheless, the service and food have always been great for me."
KellyAnn J.,"Guerneville, CA",64,120,215,1.0,7/15/2016,"I finally made it to a Cheesecake Factory. Since I am a big fan of anything cheesecake I was excited. Maybe my expectations were high. Maybe I make a better cheesecake than I realized. But, it was less than mediocre IMHO.  I stopped in alone as I needed a break to go over some paperwork and wanted a cool place to rest in between my busy plans. It was a beautiful, huge place with a grand entrance and spectacular decor. That is where the greatness stopped.  I waited too long before my server came to my table. I ordered a slice of chocolate mousse cheesecake after telling my server I was excited about being here for my very first time. There were no suggestions from him, and he brought it back relatively quick.  It seemed too old to me. The Oreo like  crust was bitter and a bit slimey on the bottom. The mousse too was flat, loose and seemed like it wasn't made anytime recently. The cheesecake part was good in the middle but the chocolate shavings on the top were few and once again, kinda slimey -ewww.  I pushed the slice around with my fork, trying bites here and there and became more unhappy with each bite. By the time I was done I disassembled it to eat only the middle. The edges tasted wrong. And the crust was awful.  When my server finally showed back up to ask how it was, I had been pushing it around my plate for far too long. I then explained my opinion in a very polite way. He understood that I did not like it at all, and in fact I thought it was stale or old. He then suggested I try his favorite: the ""tuxedo"" next time and described it. Now he makes a suggestion? A bit late for me... I felt slighted about my old slice.  He then took my plate, as I wasn't eating any more of it, and took awhile to bring me my tab and then surprisingly disappeared for another 12 minutes ( I counted because I wanted to leave, but needed change) I had a $20 waiting for that tab, but he dropped it and ran away before I could slip it inside. That 12 minutes wait (too long)left me thinking he maybe was going to bring me a fresher piece of cheesecake. But NO, just the tab. So I left a dollar tip and was sorry I had come to the Cheesecake Factory. Note: my visit was on Thursday afternoon, July 14th between 4-5pm. The place had very few customers at that hour. There seemed to be lots of employees. So I see no reason for such poor service. In addition, the stale cheesecake with no offer to give me a fresher slice was unacceptable."
Casy T.,"Moraga, CA",76,8,,4.0,7/24/2017,"Always a wonderful location to walk into and have a nice filling meal. I went in today by myself and I felt like all the customers were staring at me for not sharing my table with a friend or family member, but my waitress was really chill and made me feel very welcome. I forgot her name, but she really brightened my day."
Elijah B.,"Martinez, CA",200,362,440,2.0,7/22/2016,"I remember why I do not eat here anymore. The food is ok.  Server did not refill breads. Did not refill my cup once. I did not get a water cup. Came by to check on us twice, but yet still no refill, I should not have to ask though. Cheesecake - when I was younger the red velvet cheese cake was my favorite. So obviously I got it again to reminisce the great taste. Well, it did not taste as good as I remember. There was so much frosting on it, I ended up sharing with my sister but we only ate half of it.  This chain tasted way better a long time ago!"
Zouzou K.,"San Francisco, CA",48,1,,1.0,9/17/2017,Well I'll start with this THE SEVICE SUCKS they made us wait for 2 hours then they were wrong on 3 dishes we were 4 people and one of us didn't get his meal at all and the waiters and waitresses were extremely rude and at the end the food was cold so basically don't go there go to the one on union square in sf it's so much better
Steve A.,"Pleasanton, CA",348,168,41,5.0,2/5/2017,"The 5 star review doesn't go for the food. Bc this is as generic of food as any restaurant is going to get, although some of the dishes are good and may not taste generic. The service we received was some of the best service we have ever received.  Last night, Saturday night the wait was around an hour and half, so we decided to sit at the bar. All I have to say is Liam is one of their best employees I have ever encountered at any one of their locations!  He was hustling, taking orders and taking care of his clientele left and right, nonstop, and had time to make small talk and engage in conversation.  A true professional and dime of dozen! If I decide to come back, Liam had a huge impact on that decision!"
Benjo S.,"Concord, CA",10,58,83,3.0,7/30/2017,"Huge menu selection, bar food and drinks and of course cheese cakes. Happy hour is pretty good. The place is always packed and the service has not been consistent but I never had a bad time. My lunch favorite is the miso salmon.  They changed the fish taco recipe and I miss the old one.  Going here on a weekend night of the national cheesecake day is insane, but we are here , 45 minute wait."
Waymond W.,"Alamo, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/1/2017,Been there at the Walnut Creek location several times since we live locally.. The food quality is the same every time cold and not up to quality and amount..  when service is ok and takes forever.. There excuse is there busy.. Well if ur busy you need to hire more cooks and staff.. Should not have to compromise food quality with under staffing at the expenses of the customer.. If u complain to management they want to compensate you with cheese cake slice.. I don't want the cheesecake. I go there to eat either lunch or dinner and expect good food and service. Not Cheesecake for compensation. By the way I don't care for cheesecake sorry that's my opinion.. won't be going to  the Cheescake Factory there's a lot of other choices out there with better food and better service.. one last thing you will wait an hour just to eat lunch there..

Britt C.,"Los Angeles, CA",157,113,99,1.0,1/22/2017,"The carry out service here needs serious improvement. On more than one occasion I have been quoted a 25 minute wait time to pick up my order only to arrive and wait an additional 15-20 minutes. This has happened on weekdays and weekends. I don't mind waiting 40 minutes - just don't tell me it will only be 25. The whole system is just unorganized - the last time I visited the poor girl ringing up the line of 20+ impatient people couldn't even access the tickets to ting them out - she had to find someone else with a card. When my order was wrong the same young girl had to leave the register and go to the kitchen to correct it herself, she had ZERO management support. I tipped her $10 and told her I was sorry she had to deal with such a poorly ran establishment. We won't be ordering take out or dining in again."
Teal D.,"Danville, CA",0,8,,2.0,1/15/2017,"Went to this location with my wife  on a Sunday. The wait inside was 45 minutes. It was just assumed that we wanted to wait for that 45 min. My wife asked to sit outside to avoid the insane wait. We were seated In 5 min, relatively far from the heater with many closer seats available. My wife posed the question to me why we didn't get seated nearer to the heater.  As they sat  all the middle aged Caucasian couples right beneath the heater, it became clear that they sat us further because we were a 20 something couple of color and they wanted better tips. It's offensive, to say the least. We would have tipped very well having both worked in food service previously, but they will be lucky if I willingly tip anything after being pushed into the cold by their lack of regard for everyone. I bet if we weren't darker skinned and young, we'd have gotten better seats. It's shameful."
Becky N.,"Fairfield, CA",7,257,18,2.0,7/9/2017,"The place is very beautiful. The outdoor seatings are awesome. The food...not so great. The sweet potato fries, there was quite a few not cook. The French fries was good. Buffalo Wild Wings not good, I think it was old. Their omelet was very boring. The chicken little was alright, and one other dish I forgot the name but it was just alright. The only hit is their chocolate bread with butter. Service was good. Their pina colada was a minus."
Beckah G.,"Richmond, CA",3,7,3,1.0,8/21/2017,"This use to be one of my Favorite places to eat until tonight. We called tried to make a reservation they said they didn't take reservations , their website even yelp says they do. They told me to come in early to put our names on the list, which I did around 545pm for a party of 8 (6 adults 2 kids) first they said 30 minutes I checked in after 30 minutes then they said an hour 1-1 1/2.  Kept checking in and they hostess was rude she kept saying Bc we were a large party Making all kids of excuses. Long sorry short we weren't seated till 820pm over 2 1/2 hours later. Bigger parties were sat down before us and we had checked in before then we even asked them if they had reservations and they didn't."
