T G.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,3.0,9/27/2014,This Cheesecake Factory is surprisingly still not up to the company standard. Poor service and food coming out too quickly.  The most unfortunate part is the cheesecakes are not cooked long enough.
Sheila D.,"Danville, CA",120,326,6,3.0,1/4/2010,"Just fine!  I am actually torn between 3 and 4 stars.  Must come back and maybe have a full meal to make a final decision. I came here for the first time after catching a movie at the Walnut Creek Century Cinema, which is very conveniently located right across the street.  Originally we planned to hit Va-de-vi, but hell, we are lazy Americans therefore the closest joint wins! I was impressed.  I have never actually dined at a Cheesecake Factory before, these folks have got the business model down!  The place was PACKED.... at 4pm on a Saturday. We managed to grab two seats at the bar, although they were like kiddie seats, 2 feet lower than the rest of the folks at the bar.  I truly felt like I was at the kiddie table... wanted to ask for crayons or something! Service was fantastic.  Pretty much the second we sat down, the kind and efficient bartender asked what we'd like to drink.  We asked for drink menus and we were set within seconds.  Their menu is extensive! I ordered a glass of Chardonnay and my friend ordered a Pink Lemonade cocktail...  the cocktail was very tart and delicious and my Chardonnay was crisp and perfect. We also ordered a couple of items off of the ""small plates menu""... .there is NOTHING over $10 on this menu.  We enjoyed a fabulous tuna tartar dish ($6) and crispy fried artichoke hearts ($5).  Nice prices!!  At Va De Vi, either of these dishes would have been at least $10.   It's definitely got that corporate, franchise feel to it...but not too bad.  It's hard to believe that an Andronico's used to be housed here. I will be very interested in coming here in the Spring/Summer to hang out on the fabulous patio with fireplaces and gorgeous foliage. Welcome to Walnut Creek!"
Arlene F.,"Vallejo, CA",40,44,,4.0,2/17/2010,"You can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. I've been there multiple times over the years and to various locations (East Coast, Hawaii, West Coast, etc.) and I'm always pleased.  It's been especially nice to have one nearby finally.  I was just there for Valentine's Day and went with my husband and two boys.  I love that they cater really well to my children and have the food out as soon as possible - just so the little ones don't get antsy. I had their Orange Chicken. And let me tell you, I don't usually order Chinese unless it's in a Chinese Restaurant. But, this was good. I ate it all. And the lunch - size was just right. I also had my favorite Ahi Carpaccio for an appetizer - always a pleaser.  But I can tell you there is a lot on their menu I like and would recommend:  This BBQ Chicken Salad The Meatloaf The Chicken and Biscuits The Shepard's Pie The Tataki Salad The Rotisserie Chicken (not the right name, I know...) The Three Cheese Pizza The Shrimp Pasta with Tomato Basil (not quite the name...) And of course, their cheesecakes...yummy! The Godiva Cheesecake is my favorite."
Robert C.,"Oakland, CA",8,220,4,2.0,11/11/2009,"I had the jambalaya for lunch which included chicken and shrimp.  The whole dish seemed like it had been re-warmed from the day before.  The chicken didn't have much flavor, the shrimp looked like it had seen better days and the bell peppers looked over cooked and lifeless.  They try to jazz up the plate with paprika and parsley on the sides of the plate similar to the areas indicating the points on a compass. The only redeeming feature was the service which was good and the old standby original cheesecake for dessert."
Melissa C.,"Alamo, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/19/2015,"Called in an order for curb side to go.  I was told to just call when we got there and they would run our food out.  Once we got there and called, we waited 1 full hour before our food was brought out to us.  Two other cars that came after us were given their food first.  Once an actual employee finally came out to us with a bag of food, it was the wrong order.  We should have just left at that point but waited another 10 min for our food which of course was cold and disgusting by the time we got it (are mashed potatoes supposed to be hard?).  I asked the server how long it had been sitting as we had been waiting over an hour at that point and he said ""oh, we cook it as soon as we get the call from you"" so yes, it had been sitting forever.  I understand things were very busy this Saturday night, that being said their customer service was terrible and it will be a long while if ever before I go there to eat again."
C L.,"Concord, CA",26,57,3,4.0,8/26/2012,"I have been here a handful of times and have always enjoyed the food (dinner and dessert). The service is fantastic, but the wait for a table can be very very long. On a recent visit, when we finally got seated, our server immediatley brought our 2 year old a ""baby plate"" without us asking (it was free) that had little pieces of bread and bananas. They also brought her a booster seat quickly and took our order. All of our food came out of the kitchen quickly. The Ahi tuna appetizer was delecious as was my chicken belagio. As far as cheesecake goes, we took a slice of red velvet home and it wasn't as good as the white chocolate raspberry or the oreo one I shared with a friend last time, Next time I want to try the cookie dough one!"
JacQue S.,"Contra Costa, CA",28,97,24,3.0,3/19/2012,"Food was good, the service was great but got upset when another waitstaff got our left over to box it for to go. The waiter knew that its for to go, he then piled the food on each other. Maybe he is in a hurry or in training."
David R.,"Moraga, CA",50,38,,2.0,2/14/2013,"Okay, I've been to this place a number of times with others and have yet to enjoy the food.  This last experience was probably the worst. Party of 4, first available table, in or out- 20 minute wait.  Nope, outdoor seating, we waited an hour, sat in an area where the heaters were not effective. Asked our waitress if the bar had single malt scotch.  What is single malt scotch? she asks.  Legitimate question and I briefly explain.  She returns with the answer - yes, we do have single malt scotch.  What do you have available?  Let me check - another trip.  Another waiter returns asking what I am asking for - a list of single malt scotches - okay, I'll get that for you.  The waitress returns with the list.  Oban 12 - great!  I'll take it. I ordered White Chicken Chili and a tossed green salad with honey mustard dressing on the side.  The chili was flavorless - really, I wish I could give a better description for you, but it was just flavorless, nothing distinctive, just no flavor.  The salad was delivered with oil and vinegar dressing on the salad.  I mentioned it was ordered with honey mustard on the side - I'll take care of that.  She did - she didn't remove the salad, she simply brought a vessel of the honey mustard dressing.  I guess I was to use it on top of the salad with the oil and vinegar dressing on it.  I didn't even bother to address this issue.  I just ate what she originally brought. Now, I know a restaurant that offers the selections The Cheesecake Factory has cannot be good at any of them.  But, I do expect acceptable food, but this was quite terrible. Too many better restaurants in WC to spend time and money here.  Beautiful and interesting interior architecture and an inviting outdoor patio are the pluses. Tasteless food and inadequate server knowledge and attention to detail are the negatives."
Joe B.,"West San Jose, San Jose, CA",21,31,,1.0,5/23/2014,"This review is of the Walnut Creek location only.  I generally like Cheesecake Factory.  Service, environment and food quality were  good but wait time for food to show up at table was astronomically long.  We waited an hour plus from the time we put in our order before even the kids drink and arrived.  We've seen other reviewers also complain about the time it took to get their food.  At every other Cheesecake Factory I've been to you might wait long to get a table but not to get your food once you get a table. The waiter was nice and attentive other than a lack of acknowledgment that we'd been waiting forever.  Perhaps the wait is standard for this location so he thought nothing of it.  I will not be returning to this location!"
Anna A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",25,205,204,3.0,5/26/2012,"Yet another corporate restaurant review... my expectation as just my experience. *sigh.  The menu is highly overwhelming... I mean it's a novel for goodness sake!  The fish tacos came highly recommended, and I didn't feel like studying the menu so I ordered the fish tacos.  Honestly, it was bland!  Asked for hot sauce.. even with that, it was still aiight.  :-(  Sucks.  This place is a cool hang out though.  Has a lounge ambiance.  I wouldn't come here for dinner... but maybe for appetizers if Im not real hungry and want something lax & cool place to chill...this may be the place to be."
Roman O.,"Concord, CA",3,1,1,4.0,2/6/2011,"We went there with a huge group of 21 people, they were fantastic for our large group. We had one large long table, and had around 1-4 servers all at one time. They were great on water and asking about food and such. They were fantastic. I shall return. Key Lime Cheesecake, Best."
Salernitana A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",6,95,2,2.0,3/6/2010,"Wow, all I can say about this place is you better have long-ass arms cuz you're gonna be grabbing your server as he/she ignores you for about an hour. Also, every time I have been there, there are also several Golden State Warriors players there, lookin' all tall and handsome. They must love the place, and the place must love them, cuz they get seated immediately while I try not to bust into the cheesecake display glass."
Robyn R.,"Wailea-Makena, HI",96,134,,3.0,5/18/2012,"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but my dear, sweetly nerdy husband loves them all.  (Case in point: last week, we drove forty minutes to go to Red Robin.  Seriously).  And I can see the appeal of The Cheesecake Factory--it's brightly lit and always hopping, although it brings to mind the contrived appearance of Las Vegas--and I've rarely had a disappointing time here.  The food is what it is.  I feel they try to overcompensate for taste by serving insanely large portions but there are a few things worth sampling.  The crab wontons are usually great, as well as their salmon dishes and ahi.  The salads are mediocre, as is their fish and chips, but their pasta is delicious.  And the staff at this location is terrific.  I'm sure I'll be eating here again, thanks to the Mister."
Saniya K.,"Stanford, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/26/2013,I always come here with family and friends for celebrations. I love their pastas and their cheesecake is nothing short of amazing. Would highly recommend.
Dani M.,"Weymouth, MA",0,36,8,4.0,8/19/2011,"This is a chain, obviously, so you're always going to have good and bad experiences, but overall it is a good place to come. The variety is amazing, you won't find any other restaurant that has as many choices as they do. Their cheesecake is delicious! Also many flavors to choose from there. Portions are big, but honestly this is America since when does anyone honestly care about portion, people keep on eating it and getting bigger . If you don't like it then don't eat it all or ask for smaller size.  Ask for a box right when you order your food stick half in it and then eat the rest and you have two meals for the price of one!  Some favorites- the chicken chili with white rice, vietnamese tacos, tex mex egg rolls, georgia peach drink not so great- cosmos (didnt make it very good when I got it there and that's my favorite drink so big bummer), their brioche egg breakfast sandwich, the buffalo wings with ranch sauce ( i've had much better elsewhere ) oh and the avocado egg rolls (you better LOVE and I mean LOVE avocados, I love them but not as much to enjoy these ) I've had really good service every time i've gone. Just recently had a really nice server named Jessica (i think) I was with a friend for late lunch/early dinner and she mentioned it was my birthday at the beginning when she ordered drinks for us. She let us talk for a long time only coming by when needed (which is always nice ) and when we didn't order dessert she brought by a little sundae for me anyways because it was my birthday. Very unexpected and very kind of her. It's loud if you go during peak hours. The food and dessert are yummy. You won't regret going. If you have a problem with your meal don't hesitate to send it back to be fixed or ak for something else. It's your money. Cooks have bad days, people call in sick, it's life. Take with a grain of salt.. especially in chains."
Shana M.,"Duluth, MN",0,14,,4.0,7/18/2014,"This was my first time here. It was my birthday, and I wanted a nice chocolate dessert. It seems every restaurant is on some sort of lava cake fetish, so I found this place, and was looking forward to the 30 year anniversary cheesecake! Before that though, we had to indulge in drinks, apps, and dinner. We started with the crab bites and the mac and cheese marinara appetizers. They were great comfort foods and appealed to me and my husband! The drinks were okay, we didn't order anything too substantial. Then, onto dinner. I, being Irish, was looking forward to the Shepherds pie- *let me stop you here, if you have the same plan*. I was so disappointed. It tasted like a 1.99 frozen dinner salisbury steak- reconstituted with pasty mashed potatoes. I have had better and wished I had ordered something else. Now, onto desert! My cheesecake was awesome, but my husband's was better (he had the godiva chocolate cheesecake!). But well worth the cheesecake trek! Any future visits, we will just do apps/drinks and deserts. Oh, the service was spectacular! She did an awesome job!"
Bill Y.,"Tracy, CA",7,18,2,2.0,6/12/2014,"""Please note this review is on the payment of the bill"". Went to the Cheese Cake Factory to celebrate my girlfriends birthday (party of 5) on a Thursday. The actual service was very good and the food was good, no complaints. My problem came about after the my visit to the restaurant. I was checking my bank acct. the following day Friday and found that I was charged twice for the same amount (the amount was over a $100). I called my bank and they stated it was most likely a mistake and probably would be corrected by the restaurant the next day. The next day was a Saturday, I checked again on Monday and still had the same 2 charges pending on my acct. I gave it one more day to see if it would clear. Checked again on Tuesday and still both same charges pending on my acct. I called the restaurant and spoke with a Mgr who assured me they only processed 1 charge and tried to explain how it could have happened. Basically, what it boiled down too was employees not following procedures with payment processing. My acct was finally corrected but after tying up my money for both charges for 7days total, 5 working days. I would advise you too check you bank acct. after eating there to make sure you are not double charged. Not sure if I will visit this location of Cheese Cake Factory again after this event."
Brian Y.,"Alameda, CA",202,310,6,2.0,10/20/2009,"2.75 Judging the business this place is getting you'd think it's got some awesome food!  Not the case.  It's basically like any other chain you've been to except maybe worse because the wait is so long.  Maybe that's not the restaurants fault so much...because the food and service are avgerage.  Parking available in a nearby structure.  Movie theater and shopping also within walking distance make it a fun place.  Anyways, still not the best place to go, but you could do a lot worse.  Kind of pricey considering it's basically a nicer chillis or marie callendars kind of place."
David E.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,13,,5.0,10/27/2011,"First time to the Walnut Creek location and I have to say I'm a fan .Everything was great .The food ,wine and the service .A young man by the name of Michael Banks was our server. Even with the restaurant at full capacity he managed to keep the water ,wine ,bread and goodies flowing so Thanks guys!!!!"
Femme P.,"San Francisco, CA",3,64,9,4.0,7/19/2012,I know the food is not like 5 star but obviously their cheesecakes are fantastic. In the regular menu there are some dishes that seem to have a lot of sugar in them even for dinner dishes. I gave them 4 stars because their turkey burgers are fantastic! It's hard to find a good turkey burger that does not come from a frozen patty. My husband and I don't eat beef so when we are craving a burger we have a turkey burger. They are very fresh and cooked perfectly with a nice big patty. Now we have a new place were we can go for turkey burgers!
