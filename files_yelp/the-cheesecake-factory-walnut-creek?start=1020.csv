Chris K.,"Livermore, CA",218,1178,230,3.0,6/23/2009,"Went here with friends for dinner.  This is a great place for groups of people b/c everyone can find something they want to eat.  We shared an order of the avocado eggrolls...man were those things good!  I had the bbq chicken ranch salad, which was huge (although that was to be expected).  We shared a slice of plain cheesecake with fresh strawberries...our first cheesecake was still frozen :(  They brought us a new one but didn't comp us for the cheesecake. We sat on the patio, which was beautiful on a summer evening.  The patio is much nicer than the one in Pleasanton.  I felt the service here was much slower and disorganized that Pleasanton.  Hopefully the service will improve because overall the food and atmosphere are good."
Ranjeev H.,"Concord, CA",2,38,,5.0,5/31/2014,"I am giving this place 4 stars for the food and an extra one for the service! We came in last night and had a party of 7 plus two young children. The manager, Mike, saw we wanted to get a table ASAP and tried to accommodate us as quickly as possible because of our fussy kids. Unfortunately, the table that first became available was a booth and it just wouldn't work with the kids. Mike pulled some strings and got us a regular table quick. All this considering there was a 45 minute wait when we walked in and were seated in 30. Can't thank Mike for all he did, awesome service, he made our night."
yp w.,"Kensington, CA",0,17,,3.0,12/29/2010,"OK place.  Food is pretty decent, but you have to go in knowing this is a chain with cookie cutter food compared to other locations.  Portions are big and the value can be pretty good. For the person who relayed a waitress story about this place being special because the founder was from Walnut Creek and attended UC Berkeley - your waitress must have made it up.  The founder is one David M. Overton from Detroit.  He graduated from Wayne State University (in Michigan) and dropped out of Hastings College of the Law (in San Francisco)."
Jenny H.,"San Mateo, CA",391,222,234,3.0,6/15/2009,"Good old reliable chain restaurant. I was happy to see that they opened one up in Walnut Creek.  Waiting over two hours at the location in Union Square was just not cutting it for me. Big portions, great selection, and great dessert.  You can't go wrong with this place when you looking to please all the different cravings for a group.   A new addition is that they are now offering a separate menu with smaller portions.  Not sure if this is only offered at the Walnut Creek location or at all Cheesecake Factory places.  Nice to know they are trying to be a little more healthy and not contribute to the obese population."
Justine C.,"Washington, DC",4,5,5,1.0,8/16/2013,"What a god-awful experience! I came here for dinner with a couple of friends from out of town, hoping to enjoy a delightful birthday meal, and we got the exact opposite. After waiting forever for our entrees to arrive, I took bite out of my pasta and nearly had to spit it out because it was so salty! My entire table came to the same conclusion. Our server was nowhere to be found, our glasses were all empty, so we flagged down a different waiter who couldn't find our waitress either. Finally she comes around and I tell her about my food, at which point the manager comes to say that they added salt to the pasta water, so that's probably why. The rest of the table is nearly done eating by this point, so I don't want to order another dish. So we order cheesecake. The waitress tells us this round of dessert will be quick to arrive, apologies for the massive delay before, but again 30 minutes pass before we decide to ask where our dessert is. She checks and it eventually arrives. After we ask for the check, another 20 minutes pass before it arrives. At this point, the restaurant isn't even busy anymore - all the surrounding tables are empty. I just want to pay and leave, but we can't even do that. We can see our waitress standing about 15 feet away, entering tips into the computer and neglecting our empty water glasses and attempts to get her attention to just pay. Finally, she swings around and we are free to go. There was no thank you for coming, or anything mildly polite. I have eaten at other Cheesecake Factory's before and enjoyed my experience. This one was beyond awful, and I am fairly certain that I will never return to this restaurant again. Rather surprising and extremely disappointing for an establishment in downtown walnut creek."
Jim B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,364,,4.0,12/23/2011,"Amazing the quality of the food here despite the massive size of the menu. Never have had a bad meal here, and the service is always pretty damn good...."
Brooke E.,"Concord, CA",34,6,,4.0,3/18/2013,The interior of this restaurant is absolutely beautiful with ornate columns and ceiling murals. This is one of my go to places when treating someone special to a fine night out. The atmosphere is incredible here and you wouldn't look out of place if you dressed up or wore a suit. The food is positively delicious and the cheesecake is even better! I love this place and go every month or two. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a classy night on the town.
B M.,"Oakland, CA",4,6,1,1.0,2/17/2012,"Horrible,waiter sayed ""I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE SHARING "".WHO COMES TO CHEESE CAKE FACTORY AND SHARES FOOD.MAN ,WOMEN,CHILD!! TWO MEALS ,THREE PEOPLE WHO DOES THAT!"
Holl T.,"Walnut Creek, CA",40,111,1,3.0,5/12/2010,"I do not get the allure of this place. Its kind of a fun atmosphere, but the interiors are way too gaudy to be taken seriously. The service is hit-and-miss. Im pretty sure the majority of the food is from a freezer. The only reason I could justify giving them 3 stars is because they have a really decent 'small plates' section located at the beginning of their GIANT menu.  Seriously, how can you make special, good-quality food when you have hundreds of items on the menu?? Way too salty, over priced, and chain-like for me. Not to mention way too many calories for food I could make better myself!"
Jason B.,"Oakland, CA",110,111,150,4.0,6/4/2009,"You're gotta love the variety in their menu.. So many choices that it's sometimes hard to decide..&  their portions are big! Their factory Appetizer Favorites is always a good way to go which easily feeds 4 people.. & their desserts are crazy good! There is definitely something for everybody. This new spot in Walnut Creek has a very cool ambiance, great decor.. The nicest looking Cheesecake Factory I've been to & is usually really busy.. Their outside patio & dining is what tends to catch your eye especially driving by at night.. It's a cool place to lounge next to an outside flame with drink in hand..  Their servers are cool.. real attentive & friendly.. They have plenty of free parking right around the corner which also has valet right in front of the back entrance. A couple major downsides with this Corporate chain is that they do NOT take reservations & you can almost always count on long waits (usually more than 45 minutes to an hour & a half) during peak if you are not willing to dine outside (which you are seated immediately once the next table is available) so I recommend to come early or have a seat at the bar.. The bar area is medium sized which I've never really had trouble finding either a table behind the bar or a spot at the bar."
Kevin L.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",43,19,,3.0,7/23/2012,"Food was good as usual. Gave them a simple order and they found a way to mess it up. The Margherita Flat Bread was really good and was a nice appetizing starter. All we really wanted was a quick dinner before meeting some friends, so the job got done. The server was a bit slow. Other Cheesecake Factories have been better."
Matt J.,"San Diego, CA",36,36,2,3.0,7/16/2012,"It's a chain, I know I can't expect the best food but it's still good. The service was good as well. Just okay overall."
Stephanie L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4,40,1,2.0,4/26/2012,"The customer service has gone downhill at this place. What a bummer because it used to be one of her regular stops. The last two times we were there, we waited 25 minutes to get our drinks ordered. We sat at the table waiting while servers kept walking by. I also noticed that our server was quite sick with a cold--NOT a good idea when you are serving people food. The food is fine--i'd say very average. The menu is VERY long and detailed and a bit much, if you ask me. The big thing for me is the poor customer service. Cheesecake Factory should address that quickly, especially with all of the new restaurants coming into Walnut Creek."
Tricia A.,"Danville, CA",161,15,34,2.0,6/29/2011,Will NEVER understand the draw of this place! I have ordered a few things off the menu and they are always bland and quite honestly sub-par. Between the quality of the food and the wait time... I'd much rather head somewhere else.
Michael S.,"Concord, CA",4,61,6,2.0,7/28/2009,"The two stars is for the service I have received the two times I have been there. Once for lunch and another time for dinner but both times we kept waiting for our waiter.  The food was good  (Which is why we went back) but service at the table is NOT acceptable. I kept having to flag down the waiter for things like ketchup for a burger, more ice tea or the check.  Either the waiter wasn't found or she would walk right by us to service other tables.  WTF?!   Maybe they need to reduce the amount of tables each waiter serves to get better service?  I don't know, I just know that the service really sucks.  So hopefully they get their act together because service is EVERYTHING, especially in this economy.  If it wasn't for service i would have rated it 4stars because of the good food, quantity and price."
Jesse G.,"San Ramon, CA",8,68,,4.0,5/24/2012,"This place is ALWAYS insanely packed, but the service is actually always pretty decent considering that it's always at capacity. The chicken soft tacos are awesome! I would stay away from the godiva brownie sundae. The brownie is like a solid chunk of hard chocolate. I was expecting a warm brownie sundae, but got this instead. Good place to hang out!"
Jason C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",70,27,8,1.0,5/17/2012,"I have been to a lot of cheesecake factories throughout California.  I especially liked the San Diego location.  Unfortuatnly the staff at this location are some of the worst service staff i have ever had. My food has consistently come out late and either cold or was left under the heat lamps too long. I have frequently seen the staff on the sides talking rather than doing rounds. I understand people come here because they enjoy the chain or love cheesecake factory.  But poor service and unqualified staff leads to a bad experience.  Try yacht club, 1515, or the other amazing restraunts in wc."
Julia L.,"San Francisco, CA",793,318,508,4.0,2/16/2010,"Been here a couple of times during our sojourn up North & the only reason I'm writing this review is the SERVICE! Food is the same at all the Cheesecake Factory restaurants I've been to (Beverly Hills, Arcadia, Westwood, Marina Del Rey, Redondo Beach and now Walnut Creek). But our servers were both excellent and friendly.  To top it all off, my wonderfully absent minded boyfriend who was in food coma along side myself & 4 other friends left his credit card there with the signed check. We didn't notice until 2 days later - called - and they had the card!  SCORE!  No extra charges - SCORE AGAIN!"
Lenee F.,"San Francisco, CA",96,57,1,3.0,5/14/2009,"This restaurant is new to Walnut Creek, which must be the reason why the waiter included bacon in my vegetarian pasta dish.  I try not to frequent chain restaurants to much; however, every so often I will eat at at the Cheesecake factory because there is so much to choose from and you can find some good items on the menu, like the avocado egg rolls which are absolutely delicious.  The original cheesecake in my opinion is the best and the other flavors just don't stack up.  This new location has the typical bright mixed themed decor and the normal long wait for a table."
Blondiee L.,"Lafayette, CA",9,48,3,1.0,4/11/2011,"This was my first visit to this particular Cheesecake and I will not be back! I have never in my life had worse service. It was horrible!!! Don't go here! We waited for almost 30 minutes at our table with no hello, no water, no bread. Nothing!  Everyone around us was being helped. It was bizarre! I asked a bus boy to get our waiter, no one came. I asked a waitress if she could please get our waiter and her response was "" Oh, that's me.""  What!? No I'm sorry or care at all that we had been waiting so long. She was rude and seemed bothered to be helping us. But we ordered and hoped it would get better. Oh were we wrong. After waiting more than 10 minutes after she took our order for drinks I asked for the manager. He was friendly and blamed the wait on himself. And I told him our waitress seemed annoyed with us. He said he would get us a new waitress and apologized. Our waitress then finally came back with the drinks, threw them on the table and walked away. At this point I really just wanted to leave. But we had already ordered and I had placed an order to go for my boyfriend. So we waited.  Our new waitress came and introduced herself, she was friendly. And then our food came. Great! Except we had ordered an appetizer and it never came. So we told them to forget the appetizer we would just eat our salads. No one knew what was going on. When the manager came back to check on us we told him about the appetizer. He offered to give us a free desert so I took a piece of cheesecake for my boyfriend to go. Good thing I did because big surprise, his to go food never came. It wasn't even on our bill. I  couldn't bear to complain about one more thing so we payed and left, NEVER TO RETURN AGAIN!"
