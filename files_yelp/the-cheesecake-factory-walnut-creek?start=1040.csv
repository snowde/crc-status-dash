Ashley L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",23,38,12,5.0,3/17/2012,This is an awesome restaurant! My mentor and I come here on occassion to catch up with one another.  Nice decor and outside eating area. It can be loud if they are particularly busy. The food is great . My favorites are the barbeque ranch chicken salad and their baked potato soup they serve on Wednesdays. I would recommend sharing a dish with the person you are dining with because their serving sizes are HUGE!!.  That way you spend less and waste less food.  Cheesecakes are good. It's my sister's favorite part of the restaurant :) Overall great restaurant  to go to.
Jessica R.,"Martinez, CA",0,13,3,1.0,8/15/2011,"We went here for lunch this saturday with our 14 month son. When we arrived it was Busy but not swamped. After waiting 30 minutes for a seat we finally got a table. We promptly placed our orders for beverages, appetizers and lunch.  After 45 minutes I had to ask a passing waitress (since ours disagreed) to check on our appetizer. By now our son was getting antsy and I was starving. Immediately she brings it out and says ""this just came up"". After eating our appetizer, another 45 minutes or so passes before I have to ask, yet again another passing waitress (because our waiter still had yet to check on us) where our entrees were. By this time most tables around us had been seated, received their meals and left already. I was getting frustrated.  Finally after 2 hours, our lunches arrive. My Mediterranean Mahi Mahi is in a huge pool of oil, absolutely swimming in it. If i could have sent it back, I would have, except for the fact that our waiter never once came to check on us. With my baby getting more and more fed up by the minute I ate what i could and asked a random person for our check.  Our lunch was outrageously priced, service was terrible and trying to justify the oil pool as ""mediterranean"" is laughable. Horrible food and service. Will not be returning again."
Scott B.,"Concord, CA",2,23,11,4.0,4/19/2010,"Friday night was by far the best service I have had at this Cheesecake Factory.  Our server was the best and he made out date night really fun.  We stopped in about 9pm for a snack and cheesecake and thought maybe the server would try and rush us.  No way.  He was very helpful with out dessert questions and even made sure we had enough french fries for our starter ""snack"".  Yes, we ordered a side of french fries for our starter and our server came over to check on us and surprised me when he told us we needed more fries.  No extra charge...we received a huge plate of french fries. Our desserts were awesome.  I had the key lime cheesecake and my wife had cherry cheesecake."
Todd E.,"Oakland, CA",224,196,46,2.0,3/25/2009,"Poised like the ginormous Stay Puffed Marshmallow man in Ghostbusters, astride of downtown WC, the Cheesecake Factory practically bellows out... 'I am a mega restaurant chain...eat at me...love my food...crave my deserts...Mwah, ha ha!!!' And of course if it really was able to do this, it would have it's mouth full when it spoke 'cause clearly mega restaurant chains have no manners... Let's face it, the WC deserves a Cheesecake Factory and vice versa, they're made for one another...it's a marriage made in the suburbs. 2 Stars because the food is well, food...there's a lot of it and to be honest quantity has a quality all it's own..."
Katie C.,"Oakland, CA",94,55,15,4.0,6/9/2009,"the interior....is.....GORGEOUS! the 2 pasta dishes we had was delish, the fried calamari was the best we had in a long time. the batter was light and crispy....looove it!!!!  our server was awesome. i wished i'd remember his name. but he was trying to juggle our table and another table next to us full of little girls. they came back due to one tween loosing her bag/phone??? she was LOOSING her MIND. annoying yet entertaining. but he apologized and did his best on a busy friday dinner shift.  he did a really great skit on the dessert choices and even made me want some cheesecake.  i would definitely come back when i'm in the area again!"
April J.,"Crockett, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/8/2010,"The first time I ate at this particular Cheesecake Factory was November 20, 2009. I remember the date because that was when my now fiance and I seen New Moon. Anyway, the host was nice and so was our waitress. We got our food right away and it was delicious. My fiance ordered the chicken piccata and I ordered the spicy cashew chicken. We always get the same thing whenever we eat at Cheesecake Factory and so far they haven't failed us.  So to those who haven't eaten at cheesecake factory and think that it's all about cheesecake. YOU'RE WRONG! They have a wide variety selection on drinks alcoholic and non alcoholic, lots of pasta dishes and their fillet Mignon is HUGE! and of coarse plenty of cheesecake to choose from.  The only negative thing I have to say about the restaurant is that they make their drinks super sweet. But hey if you like it that way then you'll definitely enjoy yourself."
Joanne H.,"San Leandro, CA",291,271,21,5.0,3/15/2009,"yes im giving this chain 5-stars. How many chain restaurants out there do you know that can possibly be better than Cheesecake Factory?  Honestly for me, none.  It's definitely better than Elephant  Bar. When I was 18, this was my favorite restaurant simply because everything from appetizers to desserts were delicious, big portioned, AFFORDABLE, and my golly the choices!  you want burgers?...done.  you want pizzas?...done.  you want oriental?... done.  you want pastas?...done.  you want some bomb ass salad?...done.  get my drift?  Service was a hit or miss but what do i care about service at the age of 18?  I just want to get my money's worth. Years passed, and food went down the drain. what happened?   and why all of a sudden i love Cheesecake Factory again.... because of this new location. Food was good again... and our server Chase was great.  they did messed up on my order and he did tell me a lie but hey, it's restaurant business.  forgiven...as long as you can bring me some good food. done. CHICKEN PICCATA ... yuuUUUummmm  that plate alone deserves 5-stars. and don't forget BUFFALO BLASTS. again..  I LOVE CHEESECAKE FACTORY BECAUSE IT'S GOOD & AFFORDABLE & SO MANY CHOICES TO CHOOSE FROM. okay i have one complaint... the wait.  but but... why do they have such a long wait?  duh!!!!"
Josephine C.,"Concord, CA",24,62,37,4.0,2/1/2010,"Honestly, it's a chain, but pretty good for one, so I don't know what people are expecting.  The food is pretty tasty in general, the ambiance is nice.  The wait is hell, parking is hell.  Not much else to say.  My Chinese mother loves this place, she thinks its adorable and I took my parents there for their anniversary and my mom requested it again for her birthday.  The service is nice and friendly.   I heart the Stephanie's Red Velvet Cheesecake.  Not tooooo rich like everything else that goes down but wants to come back up."
Betsy Z.,"Benicia, CA",4,56,12,2.0,7/17/2012,"Went there on 7-13-12 for  a late lunch around 3 pm.  The service was extremely disappointing  We didn't see a waiter for almost 20 minutes. We finally had to ask the hostess to send someone to our table.  The waitress said there was some confusion as to who was supposed to serve our table.  Like we care about that?  Isn't it their job to know who serves whom?  Anyway, the service was horrible. Then they served all but one of us food.  My mother-in law had to wait another 5 minutes for he sandwich.  Anyway,  I've always liked their food and menu, but if I go back and the service sucks again, I won't be back."
Kiera R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",374,124,245,5.0,2/14/2013,"Our friends were talking about cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory yesterday, so on the way home last night, I called to place a curb-side pick-up order. We LOVED that we never had to leave our car, could just pull up and get the yummy dessert for Valentine's Day. I called, was immediately and politely assisted, transferred to the bakery and immediately taken care of post-transfer. The staff were very professional, friendly, courteous and quick to answer all of my questions. Since I couldn't pull up the full cheesecake menu on my phone, the guy taking my order was giving full descriptions of the cheesecakes I might be interested in. So many to choose from! I settled on the German Chocolate Cheesecake--SOLD! We ordered the half-size. The portions were huge--several thick, tall slices. $26. We shared one slice on the way home, and even with both of us hungry and eating it, we couldn't finish one slice--the portions were that big. The taste was Cheesecake Heaven! Definitely try the German Chocolate Cheesecake! Thank you, Cheesecake Factory of Walnut Creek, for your wonderful customer service! Especially to the baker last night who took my order over the phone and delivered it to our car!"
Foodaholic G.,"Walnut Creek, CA",10,108,2,3.0,1/28/2012,"Knocking down a star - they got rid of $5 cocktails as part of the Happy Hour! I miss those $5 cosmos and mojitos!. Sizes of the cheescake slices seem to be smaller than how I remember them to be 2 yrs ago.  Also, they still have issues with poor customer service in the front."
Mary E.,"Martinez, CA",3,120,4,3.0,7/12/2012,"Service is hit and miss here.  Either wonderfully, attentive wait staff or horrible ""where is my waiter"" type of service, no middle ground.  Service aside the food,drinks and desserts are consistently delicious and large, filling portions.  Alcohol is overpriced but that's expected with the social dining experience you come to expect when dining out for a special occasion."
Elaina Rose L.,"Berkeley, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/28/2015,"When The Cheesecake Factory opened in Walnut Creek a few years ago, I ate there several times.  I wanted to like this restaurant but, over time, the quality of the food and how it was served deteriorated.  I stopped eating there for more than a year but on June 26th, I ate there  with two friends.  Once again, my order was sub par.  The broccoli was literally cold.  The mashed potatoes were tepid and the grilled salmon was barely warm, too.  This was my complaint previously and that is why I stopped frequenting this restaurant.  The food was not served hot.  This time, when I used the pepper shaker, the top came off and the pepper coated my food.  The replacement food was also tepid, so there is no winning in this noisy, overrated place.  My friends said that their omelet and fish and chips orders were served hot. So, I guess 2/3 is a win for this place.  However, I will never eat there again."
Curtis C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",186,120,6,4.0,7/6/2009,"Went for the 4th of July when it was slow.  Our waiter, Emerson, was excellent and may have checked on us a bit too much.  He was very attentive, funny and professional.  The food on this trip was far better than the first time!  We sat in a window table in the back so the noise was much lower this visit. Fresh made lemonade Salmon Firecracker Rolls Jambalaya pasta Bistro Shrimp Pasta Steak Diane Pasta Arabbiata with Shrimp The portions were huge and we didn't have room for cheesecake. Since the place was dead, we got parking in the garage right in the front-the very first space. We had to tell the manager how great Emerson was."
Jennifer D.,"San Leandro, CA",1,53,,5.0,11/20/2013,"AHHHH-MAZING!!!!!  I have yet to write about this restaurant because the experiences in the past have always been pretty neutral but I was blown away recently so had to write a review!!! While the food at Cheesecake Factory Is consistently good the service that I had last Monday was above and beyond that I wanted this establishment to know how happy I was!!! Céasar is the best,greatest, most magnificent waiter that I have ever encountered!! You can tell he is a people person and EVERYTHING he did far exceeded any experience I have ever had at a restaurant! He brought out my nephews food early because what kid can wait for food when it's lunchtime right?! I had a question about a menu item and rather than guessing what I was talking about he brought out both items so I could compare the two! Our food was hot and fresh!! He was nice to our baby and brought him out cut up fruit to mush on our table!! When we ate our cheesecake after our meal the napkins were in the shape of roses!! I hope Cheesecake Factory recognizes an important asset to their company that will keep people coming back to their establishment!!!"
Jenita N.,"Fremont, CA",39,5,2,1.0,2/17/2012,They thought I was sharing an order? Waited an hour for my food.......
K. I.,"Concord, CA",13,64,,2.0,7/6/2009,"First of all, this location of the Cheesecake Factory... ...is a cock blocker. Want to go to Ruth's Chris on a Friday or Saturday night? Parking sucks because of the Cheesecake Factory. Last time we went, I couldn't even pin a valet, even after waving a 20 in his face.  Want to catch a movie at the end of your work week? Same situation. We took our little boy here for a last-day-of-school lunch. Being a weekday, and early in the afternoon, the wait was only 20 minutes. I've heard of people waiting up to 2+ hours to eat here. Not sure why... maybe they sprinkle crack on the plates during the weekend.  Service was good - prompt and unobtrusive.  As for the food? Just ok.  Wifey and I split a burger, my parents got something that was not significant enough for me to remember, and my brother got a pizza. We all sampled each other's food and all concluded, ""meh."" We've definitely had better. At Applebee's. At Chili's. At Denny's. Not sure why we didn't notice before, but this place has no kids menu. So my son ended up getting a HUGE pile of chicken strips, which I'm sure was made with 8 or 9 chickens, 6 of which died in vain because my son clearly couldn't finish this huge portion. Prices weren't at all expensive, but I walked out of this place feeling that I didn't get my money's worth.  I really don't understand all the hype."
Jacqueline F.,"San Francisco, CA",182,83,43,4.0,3/24/2012,"loved it! the four cheese pasta alfredo, was so delish..!! location was great!! its sooooooooo pretty inside, LOOOOVE thedecor... the workers were so nice!! had a good time, jus chilled and relaxed!!!! def. coming back!!"
Michelle W.,"Moorhead, MN",121,447,115,4.0,5/13/2009,"In search of defining moments for the seven deadly sins? Search no more!  Find your GLUTONY experience here! I ordered: small salad & standard burger.  Could have rolled me out of the restaurant like my name was Violet Beauregarde!  Of course I could have exersized some self control and eaten off of them for 3 days, instead of consuming 3 days worth of food in one sitting....but then it wouldn't be glutony, now would it? The burger was scrumptious!  The meat was perfectly cooked and juicy and full of real beef flavor!  It was topped with a grilled red onion & served with french fries that I gave to my daughter.  The salad was pretty standard, though large, with lots of fresh veggies and really good balsalmic vinegrette.  The service was decent, with some great aspects and some not so great ones.   My dinner partners ordered mud pie (which was actually chocolate cake a-la-mode) and we all had some & left half of it behind.  Could have served 6 people from that one piece of cake! So here are my Cheesecake factory tips: Go for lunch & get the same food for less money Share 1 entree, 1 appetizer & 1 dessert for the whole table.  I don't care if you have 2, 3 or 4 people, don't order more than 1 thing!  You'll regret it later.... unless, of course, you have self control and can eat 1/4 of your meal & get the rest to-go.  Just get the take-out box when your food comes.  Don't even pretend you might eat it all. The interior design is a bit cheesy vegas. All in all I had a good experience here, though my dining partners were not as happy with their entrees.  There is a bit of a mass produced feel to some of it, but what I ordered was delicious.  Overall 3.5 stars"
Lorena Raquel B.,"El Cerrito, CA",3,14,5,1.0,3/27/2009,"I am going to give this place one star only because the location is good and the place itself is nice and because I am nice too!. The location: good Service: BAD BAD BAD It was my fisrst time there and I was very dissapointed.   After waiting more than 20 minutes to get a table I was starting to lose my cool.  when finally we were seated  we had to wait an aditional  10 minutes  until the server showed up  and only took the orders for drinks.  she served our drinks and dissapeared ....  at that point i was  p. o.  all the employees seemed to  setting up another tables ,  our server never came back  to ask our order.   after wasting one hour for nothing .left  immediately.   and  I won't come back  I do not recommend this place."
