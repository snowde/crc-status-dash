Steven R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",7,112,,2.0,3/24/2009,"Great food?  People, please!  It's average at best.   Quantity does not equal quality. You need to be a speed reader to get through the menu in under an hour. Look, before or after a movie, this place is fine.  Outside dining should be the ticket during the warm summer months.  Nice atmosphere to sip a cool one by the fountains.  It has its place but a fine dining destination is not one of them."
Sarah H.,"Englewood, CO",74,15,,5.0,9/10/2012,My experience with this particular Cheesecake Factory has been excellent.  The first thing you notice when you enter the restaurant is the magnificent decor- It really is one of a kind!  The menu has an enormous selection of food which is wonderful when trying to feed someone picky.  My husband and I both ordered new items and were impressed with the freshness and flavor of our meals.  And the cheesecake?  Delicious as always!  I would go back to the Cheesecake Factory again and again.
Sonya C.,"Antioch, CA",5,52,6,4.0,1/10/2012,"I loved the decor. I HATED the wait. All we wanted was dessert after watching a movie nearby, but we still had to wait 45 minutes. The desserts were delicious, but not worth the wait. We'll have to go back for dinner on a slower night. Saturday night was too busy."
David C.,"Seattle, WA",4,75,,4.0,1/10/2010,"This location was clean, the service was great, and the food was tasty.  With large portions and consistant quality from the kitchen it is no surprise that there is almost always a long wait.  Even at 2pm on a weekday I called and was told that there was a 1/2 hour wait.  I have never gone wrong with the meatloaf, burrito or the amazing eggplant sandwich.   The fish and chips were really not that great. I was surprised at how dry the fish was.  They have some lower calorie options for those of you that are on diets.  Goodluck getting a table."
Scotty D.,"Pleasanton, CA",2049,1139,1426,4.0,2/12/2009,after hearing about this location for so many years they are finally set to open. i got my invite to the soft open so i can't wait to see if this will be a good place to eat or just another passable cheesecake factory location. either way it adds more to the great number of restaurants in walnut creek and is definitely going to hurt other businesses in the area. i stopped by the other day and it looks great but i fear that someone may just be stupid enough to hurt themselves with the torches out front. the menu looks as good as always and the food they were testing looks so darn good. i know many of the cooks and wait staff so i know it's going to be a great location. the menu has something for everyone so it's hard to decide exactly what i want. i'm a big fan of the meatloaf! please! please! please! bring back the pineapple upside down cheesecake! it was the best i have ever had! make sure to ask for extra brown bread also. it's the best!
Sim V.,"Pittsburg, CA",5,12,4,3.0,6/7/2009,"I will admit. This is one of the nicest looking restaurants in Walnut Creek, inside and out. Unfortunately I would rather pay high end $$$ for a great meal rather than what it just looks like.  The waitress who helped us out in the patio with our drinks before we went in to our seats was great. Very friendly and prompt. Once seated we had another great waiter who was friendly and did not make us feel rushed to order even though they were swamped with customers.  The bad. For the price that we payed for our meal I was VERY disappointed. We ordered Orange Chicken, Chicken Marsala, and a salmon meal. Both chickens were over cooked and the salmon was VERY fishy (sorry maybe it's just me who doesn't enjoy such a fishy tasting salmon). We walked out of there spending over $130 for 3 meals, 3 drinks and 3 slices of cheesecakes. This was my second time at this location. I can almost say that I am 100% positive that the only time I will be going back is to sit at the bar for drinks and cheesecake."
Christopher B.,"Clayton, CA",6,78,,3.0,3/6/2010,"Okay, on a normal day this place would receive at lest 4 stars, because the food is just awesome and the portions border line crazy, but yesterday was kind almost a uncomfortable experience here. For some reason our server was just not down with us at all. He was actually kind of rude. He would come by and barely say anything to us, other than the few things he was obligated to say as a server, and when he brought the check he didn't even say anything. Sure, we probably weren't helping by talking shit about him pretty much right in front of him, but he was being a douche before that. In the end he did bring us everything we needed, so we tipped him the appropriate amount. Now the important part; the food. This menu is so huge, it has like 4 different types of cuisine on it, and their ""specialties"" section is pretty much the entire menu, which doesn't really help make choosing any easier. I tend to usually order the pulled pork sandwich, which is a monster of a sandwich that satisfies on so many different levels. Today however, I went with the spicy crispy chicken sandwich. It is a delicious sandwich, with a chicken breast so big that it must have come from a mutated chicken created by mad scientists in a lab. My only problem with this sandwich is there is not quite enough buffalo sauce on it. If I'm ordering some spicy chicken, I want some fucking SPICY chicken. That's why I ordered it. This chicken was completely dry all over, except for tiny pocket of buffalo sauce in the middle. That one bite pocket was pretty damn good though. I don't know who orders the cheesecake here. I'm not ready to eat anything for the rest of the day after I eat here. I've had the cheesecake once though and I understand why they are called the cheesecake factory, although their name should really be ""The Obesity Epidemic Factory"", which I would still go to. Their cheesecake so rich and perfect, there is no nutritional justification for eating it. However, if you ever have the stomach space for it, do it. It'll be an experience you and your vascular system will never forget."
Ricke B.,"Brentwood, CA",71,52,9,3.0,1/29/2010,"The atmosphere is the best part of this restaurant.  The service is spotty at best! The last time I was there I had to ask three times for a place-setting, and my water & soda were empty for over ten minutes.  The food is usually consistent: hot and good. The portions are large, which is the second best part of this place. I've always taken a doggie bag home. We like the Chicken sandwiches/burgers and the Fried Mac & Cheese Balls are awesome!  Be prepared to wait for a table if you go anytime close to prime time eating hours of dinner. Try to go before 5:30 on the weekends. But if the wait is long, rotate who waits and take advantage of the shopping all around."
Sfo S.,"San Francisco, CA",3,10,,4.0,5/3/2015,tough to get a seat but great food options and full bar and service is pretty decent
Chloe C.,"Danville, CA",481,134,40,5.0,6/29/2011,"Always love it here!  Great drinks, generous portions, sports on the TVs... and of course the desserts!  Worth the wait any day of the week, and the outdoor dining around the fire/water feature is awesome!"
Jermaine B.,"American Canyon, CA",8,4,,3.0,10/24/2011,"Yesterday afternoon my wife and I decided to eat somewhere south of Napa for a change and we stumbled upon The Cheesecake Factory. Busy of course, the wait actually was only 5 minutes or so. Upon initial impression, I was not pleased with what appeared like caos and loss of control by the FOH management.  The servers uniforms were distasteful (white shirt, white pants, white apron, and white tennis shoes) The servers seemed out of control and more concerned with the idea of hanging out with each other during the shift then the fact they are on the clock to serve guests. I noticed 1 shift leader, whom looked completely lost and uninterested in being on the floor. We were also led to our table without it being wiped-down and had to stand in the middle of the aisle until two bussers finished a table that seats 4. Really? It should not have taken two bussers to clear and wipe down any table in the restaurant. The highlight of our experience was definately, and surprisingly, the food.  Moderately priced, we ordered the calamari as an appetizer and the children's sliders for our son. Our food was delivered to our table in and around 7 minutes and was fresh, warm and ready for our opinions. The sliders were well portioned for a child, with a light potato bun and seasoned fries. Calamari was really good, lighty-breaded and served with a ketchup/horseradish cockail sauce. My wife ordered the bbq burger entree' meal, which was cooked to a perfect 165 degrees and served with crispy red onion rings and fresh organic lettuce. We passed on dessert, but left very full and pleased with our meal. I give this experience an overall grade of a B minus. Food stellar, but sub-par service and overall poor flow of the restaurant floor. If you can get passed the madness of servers looking like chickens with their heads cut off and servers wearing sunglasses, you will trully enjoy the freshness and great flavors the corporate chefs have put together."
Constantine T.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,24,,1.0,6/11/2014,"Not a good place for kids, we went early as we know it gets crowded, I put our name in for 3 adults  and 2 kids, let them know 1 is a baby.  They said 10 minutes, I checked in 15 minutes later and they didn't have our name, took 20 minutes after that to get a seat, but window for kids already closed!"
Bill J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",17,125,1,3.0,4/25/2009,Tried it again. Hm everything went well no mistakes so have to improve my rating. It is a chain but food OK.  I am curious how they wait on tables. After being seated a waitress came with a second waitress and introduced her stating she would not be our waitress but the other one would. Do not know what this is all about.  Also the watching wait staff standing around doing nothing while others run back and forth is unsettling.  Major complaint asked how many carbs in low carb cheese cake. Told it was 10 carbs a slice found out later it was 35 carbs. Still not sure but would be better it they told the truth.
Stacy W.,"Martinez, CA",0,3,,2.0,3/23/2015,"I've been going to this location for quite awhile. And always had amazing service and great food. But when I went yesterday service was a let down. The food was amazing as always, but the service just ruined my mood. When I got into the restaurant, the hostess didn't even have a happy look. She seemed so angry at the world and didn't want to be there. After a 30 minute wait for a table we were finally seated. I was hoping to get a nice friendly waitress or waiter, but no I didn't. My waiter didn't come to my table for a good 15 minutes. When he finally came he asked what my sister and I wanted to drink and left. I wanted to tell him we can order since he already gave us 15 minutes to but he ran away. Right there, I knew this is going to end bad. He finally came to our table with drinks and was about to leave! Thinking that we needed more time to think what we wanted to eat! So I told him we wanted to order, there was no ""what can I get you"" like a real server would say. He said "" okay give it to me"" with attitude. I ordered a cup of soup and pasta. I was thinking that my soup would come out first, but no!!!! It came out at the same time!! So by the time I was finished with my soup I didn't want to touch my pasta! After eating my sister and I decided to eat a cheese cake. We asked for a menu and knew which one we wanted. Looking for our waiter so we can order again, I found him sitting with customers for a good 10 minutes! Does he not know he has other tables?? It seemed like they were making a deal or something. At that point o was furious. He ruined my whole day! And this was in the afternoon! I will always come back to cheese cake factory because of their delicious food. But if I ever get him as a waiter again I'm out of there!"
Bri B.,"San Diego, CA",1,44,73,1.0,8/9/2012,"I have been there a couple times over the past few months. I feel like the Cheesecake Factory is put on a pedestal, since the environment inside the restaurant seems more upper class, and it is kind of pricier.. Anyway, I got a lemon chicken meal once, although it was huge as hell, it was the kind of chicken with a bone... like a fat ass chicken leg that you would buy from the carnival.. anyway, I don't really expect high class restaurants to use that kind of ugly chicken, i was hoping for a boneless breast or something.. The second time I got Salmon... how could you go wrong with salmon right? anyway they put some weird tasting sauce on it, that I wasn't expecting.. and also the salmon had a nasty texture, it wasn't really soft and also it just tasted gross. I love salmon, so this was definitely a heart break for me... They also don't have rice pilaf, so I just order normal white rice (i'm half filipino so I didn't mind as much..) but their rice... I could have made it better at home.  I tried to order Tiramisu but they were out. The waiter asked me more than 3 times if I was sure I didn't want anything else.. Are you kidding me? I was with a group of 15+ people so there's no need for him to try and suck up my money too, considering I didn't like the food so far and I only wanted Tiramisu! Jeeze I wanted him to stfu.. Today I actually went there at lunch with a friend, the lady asked inside or outside and we said inside.. we had to wait 5 minutes before being seated, although there was no wait!! unless you had a larger group but for only 2 people there shouldn't have been a wait.. also she seated us outside!! it was kind of hot so i just took off my jacket and dealt with it... then some guy approached us 5 mins after sitting down and said a waiter will be with us.. and then the same guy came back another 5 mins later and said he would be the waiter. throughout the meal he did not check up on us much and my water was empty for 3/4 of the lunch. He actually did come up and mention he would get me water, twice before he actually got the water.. I was not happy in the service, since he seemed too busy running around for other tables... and then also the service is bad, none of the people pay attention enough This restaurant doesn't seem to put enough effort towards their food. Once I went to TCF in SF and order a caesar salad but they gave me some weird ass salad with hella nuts in it.. gross.. so then got my caesar, which was also gross.. it's like they don't use traditional food or sauces/cooking methods that one would expect.. ugh.. the ONLY thing bringing me back here is the fried macaroni and cheese but once i find another place for that, I'll be gone!"
Victoria M.,"Richmond, CA",5,7,,1.0,8/7/2012,"If I could give this place 0 stars believe me I would. I had heard that the service here was horrible lately and boy did they live up to it.  It was the evening before my mother would return to Mexico, so naturally my brothers and I wanted to do something for her so we decided to take her to the cheesecake factory. I figured most of the bad reviews for San Francisco  CF are for the pricing too high and the cramped space, not many about the customer service. So we took her there,they don't take reservations even for big parties so we decided to wing it, now mind you, I was already on edge about my mother leaving so imagine my frustration when they said it'll be an hour wait and 4 of us would be at one table and 4 of us at another but they wouldn't be together!! The host said by the time we got a table large enough for us it would be closing time, it was 8:30!! Still fairly early but anyways thats a whole other review.. So we ended up at the CF in walnut creek (I wad extremely reluctant but again we winged it). I called ahead to see if they had enough room for 8 of us in about 30 minutes ( the drive from sf to wc) she said it would be a wait but yes  we got there and We waited about five minutes and were seated.  The waitress took our drink order but forgot my brothers wine, strike one.  One of the runners then brought out the food and brought out the wrong order again for my brother. He said that wasn't what he wanted so he took it back. Five minutes later, our waitress shows up with the same dish, sets it in front of him and says ""this is what you ordered"" and left.  He got up to get a manager, meanwhile I signaled our waitress over and say okay this isn't the pasta he ordered, the chicken is fine but not the pasta. She says ""okay do you want me to just leave the chicken here?"" WHERE WAS SHE GOING TO PUT IT?? there were no extra plates so I am curious as to what her thoughts where in that moment. I said ""um can you just take the whole thing back and maybe replate the chicken with the right pasta?"" so she took it back, by then the manager was at our table where my husband proceeded to describe what had just happened. My husband mentioned he worked at Ruths Chris for some time and he had never seen customer service like that. Now I've heard the manager is arrogant and will roll her eyes whenever approached by such issues, but she was very apologetic to my brother and my husband. But I didn't really appreciate the fact that after we got done explaining what happened she looks at my husband and says ""you worked at Ruths Chris? Cool, were you there when Vince was there?"" and tried to make conversation. TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL. We called you over to deal with an issue, not to strike up a little chit chat with my husband! Deal with the issue and that's it! We did end up getting another waiter but ny brother decided against any food or dessert for fear of bodily fluids ""accidentally"" ending up in it out of spite.  The next waiter but was okay but was kinda creepy walking up and down the aisle staring at us in case we wanted anything. When we got the check we gave him a pretty large tip considering he only took over our dessert, but this jackass had the shamelessness of COUNTING it right at the table! Who does that?!  We didn't even get any compensation for what the other waitress did. Not even one free slice of pie or a small discount as an apology. You figured we gave them 230 of our dollars they would at least compensate for something!  Needless to say I will never be going back there ever!"
Kat S.,"San Diego, CA",112,241,94,2.0,4/13/2009,"Yes. I would definately choose to eat at the Cheesecake Factory than Chilis... but is it worth the wait and cash? Not for me.   I've learned that the food.. well is typical, nothing has caught my attention (except the fried crab won tons) yummmm... The menu is overwhelming. Yeah, there's something for everyone, that is, if you can find it. Drinks are YUMMMYYYY but EXPENSSSIIIVVVEEEE!!! Some of my faves: Georgia Peach, Peach Bellini, Strawberry Banana daquiri Customer Service varies with the people... some ACTUALLY listen to what you want and others just talk over you to get over the ""schpeel"". The actual location and building is nice. The reason why I'd come back? Cheesecake. My Faves: Adam's Peanut butter fudge ripple and the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamian nut."
Tuff G.,"Castro Valley, CA",13,557,87,3.0,5/21/2009,"For a minute I thought I was in Vegas We stepped through the big glass doors . . . turned around . . . stepped out, and then walked back in. . . I thought we had gone to Vegas for a minute. The old Andronico's grocery, has been transformed into this expansive, glittery, Las Vegas appearing restaurant. I LIKED IT! Not your standard strip mall diner that is so common in the East Bay. This place has some visual POW to it. One thing you will notice immediately is that the entire room booms with noise. Very very noisy. So don't expect a quiet evening here. Kind of a cool bar area with lots of high tables. I suspect that a lot of people hang at the bar and have the 'small plates' for dinner. This was a late Sunday afternoon, and the place was packed. The menu is just as expansive as the dining room, it reads like a book, complete with advertizements inside. Not sure I like that, but hey, if it pays the bills, and helps out the local stores, go for it. Good variety of food choices that I think would fit into just about anyone's desire to eat. And, everything we saw go past us looked pretty good and fresh. Even the 'small plates' looked pretty substantial. Our server was a little on the slow/confused as to where we were in our dining, side. But, she did ok in the end. The servers are all buzzing like they are late for their final exam, so you get the feeling you should be hurrying along with your meal as well.  Our food was fresh and simple, yet good. Not a fine dining experinece, but certainly a good option for those looking to have a decent meal out. This was our first time here, so we will see if the consistency holds up. As always, my abhorrence with how people dress and act when going out, was not a let down.  Aside from the plethora of aweful tacky jeans to the knees, size XXXXXXXL T-shirts (untucked of course), baseball caps and sunglasses being worn, there was a table of 10 people (all about the same age so it wasn't John and Kate plus eight), 6 of whom had that cell phone plastered to their head the entire time they were eating. Were they all talking to each other, or did they not want to talk to the people they were dining out with???? If not, then why go?  MY DREAM IS TO CREATE A RESTAURANT WITH ELECTRONIC DISRUPTERS!!! The people I share my time with are important enough in my life to get my full attention."
maria b.,"Walnut Creek, CA",5,7,1,5.0,3/19/2012,Seroiusly only three stars?? Thjis place has great food and the best cocktails in town (except for the mojito that is way too sweet but just ask for have the sweetness)and you can take your kids and be comfortable. Plus the location is excelent and they have the most fun outdoor seating for a family in the the Creek.  Now that deserves 5 stars to me.
Gordon E.,"Oakland, CA",113,106,2,2.0,2/25/2009,"The Walnut Creek Cheesecake Factory is a definite comedy of errors. We had one waiter come over to our table, one who had clearly never waited a table before.  He gave us the introduction to the menu, which is always laughable.  ""Ever been to a restaurant before?  Here's how the menu works."" Eventually, he gets replaced with an ever slightly more competent waiter who takes our order.  A few minutes later, he comes back and asks us to repeat our order because he can't understand what he wrote.  ""I wrote org chick and I didn't know if that was orange chicken or org chicken.""  Now I'm not sure what Org Chicken is, but I don't want to eat it. We ordered the spinach cheese dip which was served to us as an artichoke.  One of us ordered apple cider and was brought apple juice (not the same).  They brought out our food, and hadn't made one person's entree.  We had two managers apologize and about 20 apologies from our clearly overmatched waiter.  The appetizer and the forgotten entree were comped. The service was pretty horrible.  The food is ok enough I guess and the oppressive decor can't be topped. They do serve way too much food.  Sure, it's my fault for actually eating it, but all the margins are in dessert, and when I was done, I didn't want any.  They could have sold me a slice of delicious cheesecake! (The slice of cheesecake is still in the fridge to be eaten when I'm hungry again.  I'm guessing this will be some time tomorrow.)"
