Kim B.,"Concord, CA",44,133,1,4.0,5/4/2009,I went here for the first time on a Friday around noon and had to wait about 20 minutes..not too bad. The place is gorgeous inside. The service was very good and the portions huge.  Had the chicken salad sandwich which was pretty good.  The menu is gigantic! I can't wait to go here again and try their cocktails and dinner menu!
Nikki N.,"Vallejo, CA",37,411,,2.0,4/6/2009,"I have to agree with Yelper Lorena B. The food was great but what happened to the service? Our waiter was never to be found and we had long periods of just waiting and more waiting. The tables around us couldn't find their waiters as well or they were being helped with two or more people. I saw the manager more often than the waiters!  Our waiter to left to go on break and left with us another clueless person. The fastest service we had is when they took my dad's credit card.  Huge restaurant but small women's restroom with only four stalls?Overall, nice restaurant, good location but they really need to tighten up their customer service game."
Brandon C.,"Pleasanton, CA",57,473,16,2.0,5/15/2009,"I really hope that the management of this location is reading these reviews - and plans to make improvements. I have been to this location 3 times since it opened. The service has progressively gone down hill on each visit.  During my last visit, we sat on the patio. We may have just as well sat across the street because the service was that disconnected and abysmal. Some background: I had finished a long run about an hour before our visit and hadn't eaten since lunch - this means I was hungry and thirsty upon arrival. We promptly ordered drinks, an appetizer and asked for bread. Two of us got iced teas and two of us got drinks from the bar. The two of us who got drinks also specifically asked for water as well. The two iced teas came quickly. The two drinks took 10 to 15 minutes (which is fine I'm not a lush) but the water and bread didn't come either. The excuses were that the bar was busy and the bread was ""on the way"". When the drinks did arrive, I drank mine pretty quick because I was very thirsty and I still had no water. Bread eventually came as did our entrees. As I was still thirsty, I just decided to go to the bar and get two glasses of water myself. This was nearly 30 minutes after we sat down. I'm not too demanding or jerky but this was ridiculous. The server noticed the purloined glasses and THEN brought two others - waaaay too late. The food was just okay. I couldn't wait to get out of there because I was sick of waiting. Other tables around us were complained about their service as well. The server was pretty much MIA. Two stars for the location and decor. The service and food get no stars until they improve. And the drinks are stupidly expensive."
Rpm R.,"San Ramon, CA",829,437,,4.0,5/10/2009,"Corporate franchise food.......... I like it though...expect long wait times here during peak.  Friendly staff, they have an outdoor waiting area that will serve you drinks(not free) when you're waiting for takeout or to be seated, or if you just want to get hammered and people watch is fine as well. I ordered takeout, BC I can't deal with a  30-45 min wait.  Had the chicken avacado club sandwich that was very good, wife had the incredible eggplant sandwich....it's her favorite."
Suzanne M.,"Concord, CA",42,56,30,3.0,2/17/2010,"If you are not sure what to order, go with the Small Plates I'm not a huge fan but if I have to eat at a chain, at least I can find something decent on their menu.  The one thing I did want to mention was their ""Small plate"" options...which were quite large.  Instead of ordering a whole meal I thought I'd pick 3 sensibly priced small items including the Greek Salad, Artichoke hearts and Corn fitters.  Once those items hit the table....the salad was more than enough for one person and quite tasty.  I ate about one corn fritter and 2 artichoke hearts and had to bring the rest home.   It was a nice way to get a variety of menu options at a reasonable price...but it was way too much food. Note: the Artichoke hears were good.  The corn fritters...not so much.  Tasted like corn deep fried in beer batter.  I was hoping for something more like corn bread."
Denise L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",14,61,51,4.0,10/29/2013,mmmmmmmmmmm s'more cheesecake!!! Too big and sweet to finish even between two people but makes a great breakfast for two the next day :)
Roger B.,"San Pablo, CA",0,10,,5.0,9/18/2012,Omg ran up a $275 bill here and had a tad too much to drink but service was great and well worth the wait
Allison R.,"San Francisco, CA",88,9,18,3.0,1/1/2012,"Not impressed with presentation of entree AND 'they' completely forgot to plate a portion of my meal. It took a while to get our drinks form the bar (it wasn't that busy yet) even then, the Mojito was over-sweet. The food tasted good; I ordered the Jamaican peppered shrimp. Huge portions. The service, questionable-although I still left my share along with the bill, I thought the waitress was a bit over medicated on prozac yet inattentive... I MUST SAY it was very nice to be able to bring my dog to the outside patio which is quite warm and cozy. I MIGHT come back ...all in all, not a huge fan..."
Mike M.,"Oakland, CA",0,16,4,3.0,9/17/2010,"we have been here almost 10 times. Service is friendly but sometimes not very efficient.  Our server changed almost everytime we were there.  Although Last night we finally had great service. The server did not change in the middle of our visit, and she stayed on top of our needs.  The wings are good.  I have never liked the Entrees there.  great ambienece and alwasy super busy.  Sometimes the wait can be 30 or 40 mins.  sometimes an hour.  Last night the wait for us was 20 mins. I think we go there mostly for the ambience. We always get a booth and if you bring kids,  the kids can play at the booth without bothering other people."
Horacio R.,"Contra Costa, CA",0,14,,5.0,4/4/2012,"By far one of the best places to eat in walnut creek. The atmosphere is very inviting and for the price all the food is well worth it. pasta devinci, steak diane or the chicken madeira are great if you cant decide, and the passion fruit Mojito is amazing and strong!!"
m j.,"Danville, CA",1,13,,2.0,6/14/2012,"I went there for lunch yesterday...it was probably my 5th visit to this location.  Sitting out on the patio was nice.  We got seated a bit before the lunch rush, however, the service was very slow and just not very good.  Ice tea...no lemon.  Our appetizer didn't come out until we asked for it, and ended up coming out at the same time as our pizza.  (and you know pizzas always take longer).  The pizza tasted good, but was seriously lacking toppings...we had to ask for additional toppings.  They also didn't bring us any plates to eat our shared pizza from.  Server came by three times during the meal, and two times was at our request.  The manager felt it necessary to come over and appologize.   I am sad to see they have decreased the size of thier cheesecake slices:( Very disappointed! For now, I am taking a break from Cheesecake Factory!"
Peter J.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",447,230,62,3.0,3/8/2009,"First impression of this place, busy! That's a good thing in my book considering the economy these days sucks but people do have money for good food. Reading through the previous reviews, it seems most had an unpleasant experience, give them a chance. My experience here was good with the food but service was lack luster. they been open for about 3 weeks so I will give them a chance to get on point. Usually it takes about 4 months for a new restaurant to get it just right. I ordered: Hibachi Steak Cooked perfectly *med well* it has grilled onions and mashed red potatoes including some skin and a green colored butter I believe had a hint of basil in it. It was a little too sweet and oily for my taste. Crab Cakes Came out a little too overdone on the outside and the insides were not hot enough. The flavor was there but I would like them hotter. Turn the heat down on the oil about 150 degrees so you can cook them longer and not burn the outsides, it was on the verge of being burnt. Side salad was pretty unattractive and didn't have enough greens, the carrots, beets, and cucumber were all strung out over the lettuce which made for a ugly dish. Corn fritters Cooked perfectly but the corn could have been cooked before mixing it with the corn meal and frying. Calamari Was good but if you go wrong there you must fire the cook. I did enjoy the dipping sauces that came with all the appetizers Fried Zucchini I call these Zucchini fingers, when the dish comes to your table it might remind you of that game jenga, you might be tempted to pick from the bottom. The disappointment! Strawberry Short Cake! Ok when the dish got to me the sponge cake most short cakes come with was a biscuit and even funnier was that it looked like the biscuit the chicken pot pie has in it's gravy. So i took a bite and it was soooooooooo DRY! and was a biscuit. I then asked out waitress to get the kitchen manager for me. I asked if it was the same biscuit the pot pie comes in and he said it was! My GOD! the manager hesitantly offered his apologizes. I told them it can't be called a short cake without short bread. Call it a "" STRAWBERRY BISCUIT CAKE"" but I said I would not order it again if it is made with a biscuit.! all in all I will give them another chance in about 2-3 months, I will order the strawberry short cake again but it better have short cake in it! The whole time I was looking at the Chicken Pot Pie across from me, refraining from taking a bite of their dish, but what do you know! I got to try the biscuit in my strawberry short cake!"
Elliott L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",79,39,,1.0,12/30/2012,"we arrived at 5:50 pm, checked in,  and was told 45 minute wait time.  at 7 pm, was told our table inside was ready and being bused.  at 7:10 was told the table was reoccupied by the people who had left.  at 7:15, we noticed a similar sized group (8 people) were seated.  we  were told the group had been waiting for 2 hours (not true).  we were asked to gather our group , which we did, and were seated outside, where it was freezing. we were the only ones seated outside.  although our waiter was fine, the food came out cold.  our hot tea was cold before brewing. 3 birthdays.  terrible worthless experience."
Chimpy L.,"San Francisco, CA",6,224,16,4.0,1/23/2012,"This is one of the nicest places to eat in Walnut Creek.  The restaurant itself is beautiful. We had the mushroom-chicken soup - so unbelievably good. And of course the cheesecake is amazing. Just don't eat before you go in to be able to take in all those calories. The only drawback of this place is the large crowds. 40 minute wait for us on a Saturday, but still, sitting outside near the fire pit with a drink was no problem."
Neville V.,"Oakland, CA",93,347,232,2.0,3/14/2009,"The service was sloppy. Food was CF standard, but not worth the wait. Hopefully they will get better with age as the place has only been open a month..."
Haley R.,"San Francisco, CA",22,12,3,4.0,3/17/2010,"Walked in to be greeted by a very warm smile at the front desk. The host seated us within minutes at a booth, which of course is every ones favorite & on a Friday night a booth seems almost impossible.  our service was great! appetizers were delightful and dinner was fabulous.  I'm a very impatient person with very high standards, if I'm going to spend my money on eating out I better get the full experience. I was very pleased when I left. Drinks were contently being refilled and the food was served in a promptly manner.  Would for sure recommend The NEW Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek!!!!!!"
CHRISTY M.,"Concord, CA",188,119,2,4.0,3/24/2009,"So, where do you go for a party of six on a Friday night? To the Cheesecake Factory of course! So, we had to wait for 45 minutes to get a table... the service was good. I ordered the asian pear martini and it was super tasty. For dinner I picked two 'tizers...Corn pancakes and lettuce wraps. The cord pancakes were so good (highly recommended). The lettuce wraps came with all sorts of stuff: 3 different sauces, carrots, sprouts, and strips of tender chicken. They had so much flavor!  The only cons are that we have a 3 year old and they don't have a kids menu or paper and crayons...Kinda bites. Otherwise, it was really good!"
Norman M.,"San Francisco, CA",11,60,,3.0,7/24/2009,"3 stars is pretty right on for location. The wait is always super long and bar is too small for all the people they have waiting.  Those two things put a major drag on the overall experience, hence the minus 2 stars.   Once you're seated though, the food, drinks and service are above average. Go for lunch or early dinner and you'll have a probably have a great experience."
S. C.,"Martinez, CA",2,83,6,3.0,3/12/2010,"Service was great although we had to wait about 20 min for our beers, but understandable considering the there were only two bartenders. We both ordered salad dishes and they were fantastic, but over priced at $ 16 each. The decor in this place makes you feel like your at  a dreamland cheesecake factory."
Ruxandra I.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,30,2,5.0,7/20/2011,One of my favourite restaurants because there is a lot to choose from and the bill is decent. The servers are very very nice all the time. It';s like they take happy customer service pills before their shifts:):):):) We live close by so it is also conveniet for us!
