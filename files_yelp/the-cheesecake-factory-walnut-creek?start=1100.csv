Madeline S.,"Lafayette, CA",0,99,2,3.0,3/14/2014,"I generally like the food at The Cheesecake Factory, especially what it's famous for. But in the past I've been put off by the extreme noisiness of the Walnut Creek restaurant. However today being a pleasant spring-like day, my friend and I thought we would try sitting outside--surely we wouldn't have the same noise problem in the open air. Wrong! The 'background' music being piped to the patio was cranked up to such a high volume that it was quite the challenge to carry on a conversation. I know some people don't mind it, but I've never cared for shouting and straining to hear when I'm trying to have a relaxed visit. In the future, I still wouldn't be adverse to stopping by to take out some of their famous cheesecake, but it's unlikely I will be sitting down for a meal--even outside I now realize. However note that the food was perfectly good, and our server (Nicole) was top-notch. I would give the service alone 5 stars and the food alone at least 4, but the loud music was so aggravating and such a drawback to the experience that I am dropping the rating to 3."
H N.,"Lafayette, CA",0,13,,3.0,3/11/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is ubiquitous and most people are familiar with the menu, so I won't go into details about the restaurant.  My favorites are the avocado egg rolls, the chopped salad, the Pasta de Vinci, and the Godiva chocolate cheesecake.  The wait staff in Walnut Creek are nice and professional.  My only negative comment about this restaurant is also its biggest attraction The patio is beautiful and it's a great spot to dine outside.  However, the hostess will not seat you in the patio until the waiter/waitress is ready.  Even though, there are other servers who are not busy.  The server stationed in the patio seems to always be the last one to show up for work.  This draconian rule is also practiced between busy hours, when customers are only seated in the designated area.  The hostess will not seat you in the patio.  As a server or a restaurant manager, I would think you want your customer to be comfortable or happy with their dining experience.  Why bother with having a nice patio, if YOU don't use it?"
Ping P.,"Medford, NY",26,372,3,3.0,9/5/2011,"Three Stars - FOR WHAT IT IS... so I am comparing this establishment to other like establishments: Big Box, High Volume, Everyone can find something on the menu they will eat  kinda places.  Due to the proximity of the movie complex - during certain times be prepared for a LONG wait. We got there last night about a quarter of 6 and waited 10 minutes for an outside table. Inside and we could have sat right down. Just 15 minutes after we arrived - line out the door and into the patio. I use this only to illustrate that you must time your visits or prepare for a long wait. Given our experience - I bet the 6 PM folks were planning on a 7:30 or 8 PM show so they arrive at 6:00 - 6:20 - super busy ...but by 7:30 when we were leaving - no one around - could walk right in and sit down. Now wait for it - the movie let's out and I bet there is a mad cheescake rush for apres movie sweets.  so those are the logistics.  When you peruse the menu - it is extensive... almost TOO extensive and creates confusion. I opted for the asian weight managment salad because at 600 calories that was plenty and then some for my dinner intake. My husband had a chicken piccata thingy. Based on the waitperson's recommendations we opted for some small changes to each meal to customize it... NONE of those changes were made in fact we are sure that my husband ended up with another diners meal as his had none of the changes he asked for and a bunch of changes he didn't ask for - so someone grabbed the wrong meal. When we alerted the guy who brought our meals to us (our waitperson was on break) he apologized and said he would immediately bring our corrected meals - that NEVER happened. We finished our meal and we let our waitperson know what happened. It wasn't exactly her fault but at the same time she now knows that her back up can't be trusted and shouldn't be tipped out.  Just a note: our server and all our servers were super friendly and really did try I think.  The cheesecake - wow ... out of a box icky. Way too sweet. Way too fluffy and creamy for a real NYC cheesecake experience. We tried the original and the chocolate rasp. The chocolate rasp has two bites out of it and now sits in our fridge (I am typing this the following morning) in an appropriately shaped little plastic coffin...RIP little cheesecake!  So all in all - great place for large groups that are cool with mediocre to okay food (and lots of it), families: parents will be able to get their buzz on, kids will find all kinds of fried snacks to pimple up on and grandparents who are footing the bill won't feel raped when the tab comes.  Not sure we would go back unless it was the only option..."
Jhunn T.,"Oakland, CA",108,254,1184,5.0,9/2/2009,"We went here for my nephew's Birthday Celebration, Dinner Time The place is huge, high ceilings, it's crowded, and it seems very popular with youngsters. The Food selections Are just okay, but all of our orders are delicious. And of course the cheesecakes are Perfect, they even have sugar free ones. All of our servers are so friendly and attentive. We'll be back definitely."
Robert B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,18,,5.0,7/24/2012,"This place has consistently great service and delicious food.  And yes, the portions are huge, so be prepared to bring a doggy bag home! Wait staff is helpful, and the management really care about the dining experience. Parking is ample in the attached garage."
D L.,"San Ramon, CA",1,108,1,4.0,4/28/2012,"Interesting menu, portions are probably not meant to be consumed in their entirety.For a chain it is obvious why they are doing well: Great, prompt and friendly customer service, great ambiance (even though the lights looked decidedly penile ;P ) and good food. Not the worst place one could end up in the Est Bay just a bit kitschy overall."
Karim R.,"San Francisco, CA",74,215,1,4.0,8/13/2009,Cheese Cake is a cool spot to hang out at on a tuesday night because its not to busy the bar tenders are pretty cool and the food comes out pretty fast and if your waiter/waitress is pretty cool they might slide you a piece a cheese cake to sample so you can make your final choice on what to have. The other thing I really like is the decor! Its pretty amazing compared to the one in SF and the outside patio area is way better and you get a little more space. Oh and it warmer in the east bay than in the city so sitting outside is a little more pleasant than in SF even with the heat lamps.  So yeah I'll be back for another tuesday not chill session before heading to the city!
Olivia D.,"San Francisco, CA",198,138,77,3.0,5/19/2009,"The food is good..... if you have 3 hours to spend at a meal.  The staff is nice enough.  While our server was, umm... Informative (he rattled off the specials in a way that would rival most auctioneers!), the service itself was sssslllooowwwww.  Although we we're seated right away on a Sunday afternoon.  But the food was good, so no complaints on that front.   But as our server walked by to ask us how our meals were, he was off in the other direction before we could answer...  If everyone that worked here was drinkin the same koolaid as our server, I think the service would be a lil more efficient."
Corran S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,7,2,1.0,7/12/2012,"This place is a joke! The hosts are more concerned about prancing around and adjusting their headsets than anything else. After being paged for a table, we then had to line up behind several other tables and wait for someone to take us to a table. A snotty boy led us to a dirty table like he was doing us a favor and then seemed appalled that we would ask him to clear it. There were empty tables all over the place and they were all dirty. Understaffed? There's no excuse for that. We waited quite a while for a server and then waited over 10 minutes to receive our drinks. It wasn't even busy. The excuse we were given was that they were waiting for glasses to cool down. Really? In a restaurant that size they run out of glasses? The food was blah, and the service was terrible."
Lauren S.,"Lafayette, CA",102,153,25,5.0,10/10/2009,"Ok what can I say about Cheesecake Factory that you haven't already heard/read! Either people like it or they flat out hate it! I love that it's right near the Broadway Plaza mall so I can drop in when my feet start to hurt from shopping! Its spacious, there is parking right next door, but it can also get super busy during peak hours! Expect to wait a minimum 20-30 minutes for a lunch or dinner table during peak hours :(  But in general it is so worth it! Love the fire pit out in front and love the menu! So many different kinds of food to choose from and there is a big enough portion for me to take home.  Oh yea can't forget dessert! I mean the cheesecake is what they're famous for right ;)"
Jamie G.,"Walnut Creek, CA",83,73,9,5.0,10/10/2011,"I always love coming here!  Came here last weekend and enjoyed a yummy dirty martini, great lettuce wraps with perfectly cooked chicken and delicious dipping sauces (3 different types on one plate), and ended the night here with a plain cheesecake slice.  We sat in the bar at a pub table, and our server was very attentive, friendly, professional, and on-point.  The fireplaces outside are a fun touch, I love what they did with the decor inside, and even though the outside looks like there is always a big wait, if you just put your name in, it's usually only a few minutes before you get a seat.  We stayed in the bar even though our table was ready within 5 minutes, just because the bar is as fun as the restaurant and we were having a good time :)"
John C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",30,16,,5.0,3/26/2009,Excellent!! The Filet Mignon (24.95) well worth the $$$...the regular one is (31.95)...I had the petite cut with fries on the side...the fries were really good...and the filet mignon was world class.ssooo....goood... the bar drinks are really expensive...my uncle had a small beer...5 bucks...a cran vodka is 6.95.. the wait was well worth the hour wait...on a Thursday night... Great place over all!!
Cathryn H.,"Oakland, CA",1,28,,3.0,1/16/2012,"Over a year later and Cheesecake Factory has earned an extra star.  I went there with my mom this weekend and was pleasantly surprised by the new Skinnylicious menu.  I had some very fresh soft chicken tacos and didn't leave feeling guilty!  There are still better restaurants in Walnut Creek and I think Cheesecake is a bit overpriced, but if three stars in Yelpland is A-OK, I think three stars it is."
Marco C.,"Vallejo, CA",43,13,4,4.0,1/13/2012,I Love this place. Atmosphere outside is nice. Food is always good. Service is good for 2-4 people. Chicken Maderia is my Favorite dish. They never fail me yet.
Jac T.,"Oakland, CA",413,290,24,4.0,7/26/2009,"First off, I really dislike how people expect more then what the name actually says.  If it's a brewery, then of course you're going to go there for the beer.  You don't go to Cheesecake Factory for the specialty beer.   On that note, I do like the chicken piccata...lemony, buttery, juicy chicken and pasta! YUMM! For the main entree, I LOVE the Tuxedo cheesecake and Wild Blueberry White Truffle Cheesecake!  I have heard the godiva cheesecake is devilishly delish too, though.. will go back another time =)"
Matt S.,"Concord, CA",1,202,1,4.0,12/31/2013,"Came for lunch today.  Not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but like a few things on the menu and I usually stick to them.  Once again, I had the Americana Burger.  Always fantastic.  I asked for garlic aioli for the fries, which brings it over the top.( It's kind of inside information, because they don't list it, you have to ask for it.  Trust me-ask for it).  My partner had Baja Chicken Tacos which he said were really good.  Friendly staff too.  I'll be back."
Ashley W.,"Benicia, CA",87,270,36,5.0,10/18/2010,The food was fantastic!  The prices are good especially for such a fancy restaurant.  I loved the atmosphere and the architecture of the place was awesome.  I will definitely come here again.  Definitely a great place to go while shopping in Walnut Creek and actually looks perfect for a date.
Sade L.,"Milpitas, CA",7,34,10,5.0,10/30/2009,"Everyone knows I absolutely LOVE the cheesecake factory! Its my favorite restaurant: The food, service, dessert, everything Is AWESOME Walnut Creek Store: THE BEST OF ALL CHEESECAKE FACTORY's!! Please go visit! Its huge, very cute! Theres an awesome outside lounge area with cute furniture...you can order drinks while you wait to be seated! TRUST ME, GO VISIT!!! Its worth it!"
Jennifer G.,"Alameda, CA",23,65,18,5.0,7/30/2011,"First time ever to The Cheesecake Factory and it was National Cheesecake Day! I went with my Cousin and we had an awesome time, got seated quickly, very polite staff, music not to loud and we got our cheese cake 1/2 off for National Cheesecake Day. I got for lunch the Sweet Corn Fritters (which tasted like a corn dog yum) and Roadside Sliders (w/cheese no onions) while my cousin got the Vietnamese Tacos and Edamame. And for our cheesecakes I had the Red Velvet Cheesecake sooooo good and my cousin had the new Hershey Chocolate Bar Cheesecake. I am definitely coming back in the fall to try there pumpkin cheesecake :) And on a side note the ladies room was very clean."
Vicki T.,"San Francisco, CA",9,162,314,3.0,9/3/2009,"The food here is presented beautifully, and the setting is very impressive.  I am not sure why, but on both of my visits, it reminded me of a casino.  It is very, very noisy.  The food is good, but it looks even better.  Service is very attentive, and considerate.   We noticed lots of young people having a good time.  I did appreciate the booklet that they provided which listed the calorie count for all their dishes."
