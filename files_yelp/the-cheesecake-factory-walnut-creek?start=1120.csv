Rajeev B.,"El Sobrante, CA",18,73,14,3.0,6/10/2011,"Great food! Every time my girlfriend and I go here (bi-weekly), we start with the Avacado egg rolls and some beer. Huge menu, service is either a hit or miss, try going during their less busy hours. Would give them four stars if they had blue moon on tap!"
Pineapple C.,"Orinda, CA",1,28,17,3.0,2/22/2010,"Good service but incredibly long wait.  Food was only okay. I love the calamari! All other food was only okay. I really hate the madierra sauce, but that just might be my own taste. Beautiful building with very nice helpful waiters. Just plan on waiting an hour or more on busy nights!!"
R J.,"Carrollton, TX",27,47,14,4.0,7/23/2013,"I happened to go in this restaurant for a special occasion, beautiful decor, great service and best steak around.  I would always go back"
Jeff H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",23,49,38,4.0,12/4/2013,"All Cheesecake Factory Restaurants are good, but this one stands out as a touch better than most. (Might be because I heard the owner lives nearby this one!) It can get busy at dinner hours when weather is nice out. Food is really prepared well. Its a bit loud and busy, but that makes it fun to be in that mix I think. It is not uncommon to hear Happy Birthday sung more than once, as it is a great place to treat someone to that. A bit expensive, but hey, you get that free warm bread brought to the table (ask for the dark bread, its better than the French) If you want to save on the cost, do as me and my wife do, split the Gumbo to two plates. Service is usually good but not perfect. For example last week we were seated after a short 8 minute wait. Place was not terribly busy, yet young lady who sat us down overlooked that the table had no silverware or napkins. Plus it was just wiped clean, yet it was my elbows that saw it was wet, not the hostess. Then the waitress also did not see that we had no silverware, even after food was brought to table, still nothing to eat with. We asked for both silverware and napkins. That might be why I kept a star back from 5! The employees could put that slight extra effort in, to make this place closer to perfect, but some don't. They are quite pleasant though. You can see that some hussle hard, then a couple others have one speed only. I still love this place and always look forward to eating here. Oh, wait, one last thing. The cheese cake is fantastic, but unfortunately it is very expensive! I buy a piece once a year maybe, and then split it to two people usually. Big fresh beautiful pieces of cheese cake, but what, $6.00 or $7.00 a slice? Wow... Great selection too. There is also a secret back left entrance from free garage too. Valet parking too back there. Jeff"
C H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,18,,1.0,12/24/2010,"I didn't eat here. I didn't even look at the menu, but I can imagine that it's jam-packed with heart disease inducing creations.  Instead, I picked up a cake at the to-go counter, which was reason enough to never enter the restaurant again. My wife had already ordered the cake, I was just picking it up.  Although labeled a ""factory"", this outfit seems to have implemented the least efficient process possible for fulfilling to go orders. Despite 5-6 people behind the counter, there was only one lone 20-something both processing orders and packing cakes. Sanitary issues aside, it seems ridiculous that the ""factory"" cannot afford one or two additional minimum wage employees to fetch and pack cakes quickly. Instead, this one poor soul was left to his own devices and as a result did a very poor job of servicing a short, but impatient line.  While waiting in line, I did notice that the factory is selling something called ""weight management"" products. I assumed this was a joke - and as such it was pretty funny, so that helped the twenty five minute wait go by somewhat more easily."
Susan N.,"El Sobrante, CA",13,180,7,4.0,7/16/2009,"The last time I was here I was picking up hummus and pita chips when it was an Andronico's Park & Shop.  It was quite amazing to see the building's transformation from supermarket to restaurant ... I kept thinking, I'm sitting in the wine aisle!   What makes a Cheesecake Factory fun is their menu, which reads like a novella, and the discussion of what's good on the menu, what people have tried before, etc.  Oddly, in our party of five, three of us all ordered the same dish, Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (hey, what fun is that ... but we didn't realize until we announced our orders, and didn't want to delay our meal by having to peruse the menu all over again). We started with the Calamari and Sweet Corn Fritter appetizers.  I'm not a calamari eater, but those who were gobbled them up with gusto.  I was pleased with the corn fritters and between those, the fresh bread, and my strawberry lemonade (constantly filled), I almost could have skipped my entree. The pasta itself was pleasingly al dente with olive, eggplant and other summer veggies.  I did get a taste of the Thai Noodle Salad, which had a flavorful peanut sauce.  As usual, no one saved room for cheesecake!    We were early birds for dinner (5:30), so there was only a short wait until our table was set up.  We had a quiet booth in the corner where we could chat comfortably.  The noise level was fairly low, given the size of the restaurant.  All in all, it was a very nice dining experience."
Eli S.,"Daly City, CA",392,30,21,3.0,6/17/2009,"AMBIANCE AMBIANCE AMBIANCE is all I have to say!! The place is amazing compared to the one in the city. The celings r remarkably high and the columns r gorgeous!!! they even have this outdoor seating/waiting area with a fountain/fire feature. Pretty nice. Of course the food here is always the best. Though I thought they put waay to much whip cream along with my banana cream cheesecake. Hence u can nvr go wrong as everything on the menu is delish! The PROB: it will be a TWO HOUR wait for a BIG PARTY so beware!!! But for a party of 6 or less they seem to turn over tables quik. And i must say they have SUPER SLOW SERVICE. Our waitress sucks ass...Kimberly or Beverly? Can't remember but a blonder chic w/short hair. i guess that's what happens when the gratuity is already included with a big party.  Oh but did i mention the free parking garage conveniently rite next to the restaurant? $7 for valet if that floats ur boat, but why do that if the parking is FREE????"
Vikram C.,"Concord, CA",31,97,38,4.0,3/30/2009,"Other than having to wait an hour to get a table on a Friday, everything was great, no complaints.   Food was good, portions were huge.  My wife got a salad and it could have fed 4 or 5 people, too big.  Everything could have fed 2 people.   Servie was good, place was nice, shit it better be for spending 14 million on it.."
H H.,"Union City, CA",253,261,67,4.0,7/5/2009,"WAY better than the Pleasanton site.  Looks the same as any other Cheesecake factory.  One friend said the Louisiana pasta was too bland,  the Orange chicken was a thumbs up,  I was happy with the Chicken white bean chili,  Bang Bang shrimp chicken thing to me seemed like a bad interpretation of actual Thai food-but every single other person loved it. The salmon was rated as ""can make better salmon at home myself."" Kids loved the pepperoni pizza and huge grilled cheese sandwich. Cheesecakes were all good but not great-but that's because I prefer a less sweet, denser cheesecake. At least they tasted fresh, looked beautiful, and were crowd pleasers. It would be a 3 star except the service was truly exceptional-even as they had to put up with our 4 noisy, messy child dining companions. Drinks were always full, constant requests for bread, butter, plates, cups etc. handled speedily, friendly not cloying.   Not gourmet, but a darn good place to hang out after a movie across the street."
Ron E.,"Martinez, CA",7,12,,2.0,1/24/2011,"I've been to another cheesecake factory in Palo Alto before, and it was much better there. We waited for half an hour to be seated, and when the hostess announced our name, some asshole took our seat instead. For some reason the restaurant takes your buzzer once it buzzes, then you have to wait again till they call your name. At that time any jerk can say they are whomever was called and take the seat. How dysfunctional is that! It was very low class that somebody took our seat, but it was also very bad that the restaurant doesn't even do anything about their seating system. The food was OK, but the drinks are expensive. I don't think I'll go there again for what it's worth."
Wooka W.,"Richmond, CA",40,57,,4.0,6/27/2011,"Wow is this place nice!! They have a friggin chandalier!! seems everytime I go here i have to dig deeper into my pocket there is already a hole in my pocket! I don't have that kind of money but it's worth it! The atmosphere, The service, the ladies!! (come here mostly because of you girls) the food is kind of small for the price!! but don't get me wrong taste good! Ladies I would like to buy you dinner here but I can't afford free water =)"
Joe S.,"Hayward, CA",230,94,826,4.0,5/5/2011,"Not a fan of reviewing chain restaurants but I've frequent this establishment in SF, Corte Madera and Walnut Creek enough to say that the Farmhouse Glamburger with Cheese is AMAZING! Nothing else (besides that and the cheesecakes) has been as memorable.. BEEFY, PORK BELLY & FRIED EGG! Mmmm, *DROOOL*"
Brian D.,"Brentwood, CA",15,10,4,3.0,9/12/2011,The food is good. But what really amazed me is the Meatloaf! I hate meatloaf and had a bite of it one time and became hooked!
Regi R.,"Omaha, NE",7,31,9,5.0,3/19/2009,"Say Cheese!!  Okay, check it out people...the food is amazing...so yeah- there's a wait. The plus side? You don't have servers that look like they've been waiting in truck stops their whole life. The crew in the factory is like that of a ship...neatly pressed, ironed, ties have to be a certain length...my god, you could almost talk fashion here rather than cake. This location is new, so cut them some slack...calm your selves and order a drink from the bar while you're waiting. I recommend the Long Island Iced Tea...CCF makes the best! Better make that two! If you're looking for cute staff and awesome food in a clean, romantic, yet family friendly environment- yes, great date spot, or a place to celebrate b-days and little league...go here. Otherwise...enjoy your single life with 30 cats because you chose a fast-food place with arm-pit stained employees for your dating experience."
Scott W.,"Lafayette, CA",8,39,,2.0,6/15/2009,"Just a few quick thoughts because many a yelp-er has written excellent in depth reviews of this place.  The design and decorations are incredible. It looks like no expense was sparred and the space is quite impressive.  The menu is expansive and has a little something for everyone, but they do this at the expense of doing a few things very well. I have never had anything that I hated but nothing that I loved or really even remembered after an hour of eating. The food is mediocre and forgettable.  The service can be hit or miss, getting drinks takes quite a bit of time when you order from a waiter/waitress.  A quick aside from my latest trip here. It was for a birthday celebration and we had around 10 people and the waiter and another waitress had a lengthy discussion about who would get to serve the table because i guess it was made up of tables from both of their sections. They did this right in front of our table and it literally stopped our conversations as we watched to see who would be our server for the night. I had never seen anything like this, it wasn't all that enjoyable.  So yeah, a nice looking place but it has a big name and big wait but not a place i choose to go."
Steve R.,"Concord, CA",64,66,2,3.0,6/13/2011,"Every single cheesecake I've ever had here has been top notch. My all time favorite is the red velvet cheesecake. Its really filling though, and 1 slice is enough to share with at least 2 people, maybe 3. Also, if you want to save some calories, get rid of 90% of the whip cream they give you! They amount they usually give you is almost half the size of the cheesecake itself!  On to the service..This place is constantly busy and you will most likely be waiting for a table unless you go at an off time.. Not a whole of lot of seating for those who are waiting and the bar area is usually just as crowded. So most times you are stuck to standing around staring at the other people, or if you are given enough time and a pager, you can go out front and sit by the fountain. Once you are seated, the staff is pretty quick to bring bread and take your order. They do a pretty good job of also getting your order out to you and refills on drinks fairly quickly.  I've never really had a bad meal here and there menu is quite extensive. Even though there are a large number of items on the menu, I have always ordered from 1 of 10 things I usually get. I have found that you can never go wrong with the burgers, philly sandwich or the mahi mahi fish dish. This past time I ordered the mahi mahi again and it was excellent. The side dish of mashed potatoes came out luke warm, and was promptly given a brand new side dish with pipping hot potatoes. This is the kind of service that makes me want to come back.  The reason for only 3 stars is that the last few times I have been here the food for my young children came out at the same time as the adults food. Those with kids know that getting the youngsters there food first can sometimes be the difference between having a meltdown or not. The server we had said they would bring out the kids food first, but then the expo brought everything out at once..Like I mentioned earlier, the food came out fairly quickly, but I was more perturbed that the server never came back and said "" let me check on the kids food for you""...  Anyways, I still enjoy this place and will be back."
Mila M.,"Concord, CA",0,1,,4.0,3/16/2014,I think their Chicken Katsu is  the best and my sister-in-law loved her chicken enchilada but I was disappointed because I told the server specifically that it was my sis-in-law's Bday and they forget all about it . :((
Cc S.,"San Leandro, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/14/2014,Great restaurant for kids and large groups!!! It has a festive atmosphere but it has a long wait. You can still shop at the places around it!! I give it FIVE STARS!!!
s d.,"Vallejo, CA",62,16,,3.0,6/25/2011,"~45 minutes wait.  Hostesses are little rough around the edges probably due to the sheer number of customers.  They have a wide range of food, but i wouldn't say that they are the best. I like their avocado eggroll, shrimp and chicken gumbo, and keylime-mango cheesecake with coconut shred-infused crust. I first had that cheesecake when it was announced as a special. I hadn't forgotten about that cheesecake since, but when I visited Cheesecake Factory again, I didn't see it on the menu. I asked my server and he knew exactly what it was and brought it out. It's tangy so that it's not as heavy on the palate.  My waiter showed excellent service and attitude. I forgot his name, but he was courteous when we asked to change tables when it was chilly, smiled generously, refilled drinks and followed up with us well.  The bill came out to be about $60.00 for two."
Kendall R.,"Oakland, CA",0,80,,3.0,6/22/2011,"Been here a few tmes.  Lots of selections,  Pricey.  Service is hit & miss.  It can be really good, or really bad where you have to find your server.  Food is good.  Love their salads.  Cheesecakes are always to die for. I typically don't wait for seating.  if it's more than 15-20 minutes, it's not worth it for me.  there are far too many good places to eat, where you don't have to wait!"
