N S.,"San Bruno, CA",73,71,11,1.0,3/24/2009,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon, put my name in for a table for four.  They said 15-20 mins it took 30.  We got seated were told our waitress was having a shift change soon but she would get our drink order.   One of us ordered a passion fruit mojits, it took about 20 mins, and they brought a regular one. sent that back and it took another 15 mins. during this time we had ordered our food. I have a recent allergy to any type of pepper, i order a breakfast burrito, and specifically told our waitress, (who was still our original waitress) that i had an allergy and to please not add any peppers. around 45 mins later out food trickles out, one plate at a time, we all wait for each other, i start to eat and get bombarded with a mouthful of peppers... are you fucking kidding me? If there's one thing i can't stand it's when someone says the word allergy.. and things like this happen. when the waitress made her way over to check on us, and introduce us to her replacement i explained the situation, she yanked the plate away from me and said oh no your not eating that, hows your tongue? (its not quite how my allergy works, but i did appreciate her concern) she said they would make me a new one. she later brought the manger over who looked pretty stressed to begin with. he said he would comp my meal and the mojito. The comps are nice but damage done imo. I'm sorry when someone says allergy it has to be right. the new burrito came, it tasted like crap, the onions weren't fully cooked, and the whole thing was cover in some sort of Hollandaise monstrosity. yuck, it was not a burrito it was a lab experiment. AVOID. I avoid all cheesecake factories now... they are a joke, not worth it, over prices, the food is bland."
Kristina G.,"Martinez, CA",145,67,12,1.0,4/10/2009,"Not impressed at all! I went to the grand opening of this restaurant and i seriously has bad food, the atmosphere was nosey and not to mention BAD, BAD, BAD SERVICE!! the waitstaff watched you but never checked on you, i made i connect with out server and he just turned around.. the whole wait staff acting like children! whispering and making comments about the diners.. thats really UNCALLED FOR!  I feel like they failed to train ANYONE horrible experience! The only thing i like here was the chessecake! i think they need to stick to that!"
Gus W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,89,4,3.0,9/24/2011,"I didn't want to like the Cheesecake Factory. It is just too Las Vegas -like for me. So, I won't eat here. It is also always crowded. But I do have to admit that their cheesecake is amazing so do swing by and pick up some cheesecake to go. You will be happy!"
Anna S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,7,,4.0,2/25/2010,"Very good food, friendly staff, nice setting, very good service! The portions are very large but the waiter will tell you up front what is big and what's not. Cheesecake is big too and very delicious!!!!"
David K.,"Martinez, CA",10,9,,3.0,7/22/2009,"I've been to The Cheesecake Factory locations in at least three states. The food has been consistently excellent to my uncultured palate. The service continues to be top notch as well. Yesterday marked my first off experience, and it was only due to the food. Lets talk about service first. We (my mother, wife, and I) were attended to by Cornell. He was everything one expects from a server. Nice, attentive, and a 49ers fan to boot! He did an excellent job and if his manager comes across this review, please provide him with some sort of accolade or commendation! Now for the food. I had the chicken enchiladas. Second time I've had them and they were great! My mom had a shrimp dish and my wife had the grilled Mahi special. My mom's experience was similar to mine. My wife's however, was somewhat mixed. She tells me the Mahi was excellent, but the fries tasted fishy and the broccoli was salty. Seriously? Fishy fries? At The Cheesecake Factory? I tried a few and experienced the fishy flavor as well. How does that happen? I've been to places that specialize in fish and chips and the chips/fries did not taste fishy. How on earth did The Cheesecake Factory pull it off? I know they were just fries on the side. But fires are a basic restaurant staple that should be VERY hard to mess up. Especially at The Cheesecake Factory.  Oh well. In the end, we passed some feedback on to Cornell about the fishy fries and salty broccoli. He apologized, committed to pass it along to the kitchen, and even offered to get a manager (which we declined). He effectively mitigated the situation. I will patronize The Cheesecake Factory again. But the fries made the difference between three and four stars for this review. Hopefully it was a one time thing. I'll report back next time I go!"
Joanne M.,"Berkeley, CA",43,25,21,4.0,5/31/2011,"The food is great, however, from reading on Yahoo, this may not be the healthiest choice. The only other contributing factor to why this review isn't five stars is because the service can be quite slow. Oh, and also the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake is amazing!"
salini k.,"Pittsburg, CA",1,55,9,4.0,7/5/2009,"I've been here 3 or 4 times now, and I really have to say I love it. When I first saw it, I thought it was the gaudiest building I'd ever seen outside of Vegas... and it's true, but the food is really great!  I've had the White Chili, the kobe beef burger and the cuban sandwich. All very very good. The little snack plates are awesome as well! The corn fritters (oh corn fritters so hard to find outside the south) and the stuffed mushrooms we tried and they didn't last long. The fried cheese we tried once was ok, nothing too exciting. Above all is the service, they have a very cult like customer service nazi vibe going on, which is great. Never had a problem with service and one time my plate was luke warm and the manager was ALL OVER IT. Kind of funny almost how serious business they are, but definitely a plus in their favor. My main complaint is the women's bathroom. 4 stalls, in a place that big.... seriously?"
Sam Q.,"Vallejo, CA",161,26,7,3.0,8/27/2010,"Great service but the floor is ALWAYS greasy to the point to where I can do a baseball slide to home plate standing straight up on my feet. My Louisiana chicken pasta was dry as hell 3/5 times. I hate to complain so I just splashed some of my ice water on it. I forgot all about every thing after i order ""Patron El Diablo"" hella strong, hella good... the best thing this location has to offer"
Neal G.,"Concord, CA",0,17,,4.0,1/27/2012,"It was lunch at 2PM on a Friday, done with work and ready to eat and drink.  This place is an eyefull of ambiance.  Sat at the bar had an asian pear martini, very creamy and fruity, had alot of alcohol but not alcoholic tasting, a five star drink.  Had the fried macaroni and cheese appitizer and what  you would think a fried macaroini and cheese ball would taste like...a heart attack! Not sure why it's not 5 star, just not quite.  The bar guys were friendly and attentive, food was good, try it if you haven't been"
Emmika E.,"Orinda, CA",7,66,16,4.0,4/5/2009,"Yummm! I love the Cheesecake Factory. I've been to the one in San Francisco (which is really nice since it has the outdoor seating at the top of the Macy's building), but only once. I was so happy when I heard they were turning the Andronico's in Walnut Creek into a Cheesecake Factory as well! The food, as always, is delicious in every way. The staff is extremely friendly. The portions are HUGE for a decent price. The cheesecake, of course, is SCRUMPTIOUS. The starter salad is enough to fill you up on it's own. The onion rings have a delicious home-made batter with special ranch. Almost all of the seats are booth-style seating. The outside patio looks like a really great place to eat (it's heated by over-head lamps and also has firepits to add an additional flare). There is valet parking for an additional fee, but you should be able to find parking somewhere seeing as how it's downtown Walnut Creek.  The only complaints I really have are that 1.) they didn't have many options for a friend of mine who has a wheat allergy. He ended up having to order steamed broccoli and french fries. 2.) the wait time is ridiculous. We went two weeks after it had opened and still had a 2 hour wait. We went again and had a 45 minute wait. The last time we went we had a 30 minute wait, but we went in the middle of the day on a weekday which was less than ideal. and 3.) the place gets EXTREMELY noisy. Most of the tables are within close proximity of one another and the chatter builds up in there very fast. It's hard to hold a conversation unless you're yelling at the top of your lungs. And since the place is ALWAYS busy, it's hard to get away from this dilemma. All in all though, I'm very glad they opened this place up! It's a new gem to the Walnut Creek area."
tabisky c.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,334,1,3.0,6/23/2009,"We've been waiting to try this new restaurant in WC; I noticed that most of the earlier reviews criticized the service and that the place needed to work out their service problems. We visited on a weekday after the peak lunch hour (50% full) and was seated immediately.  The waiter (Matt)  appeared right away and asked for our drink orders.  The drinks were served promptly and we were still reading the menu.  The waiter returned and took our order and was pleasant throughout. There was absolutely no problem with the service. The only complaint that I have is the long wait to receive our meals( 1-hr plus). After all we were dining at ""off"" hours and I can fathom  the long wait in the evenings or weekends. Many previous yelpers wrote about the long wait.  It's not the server's problem, but management should look into streamlining the kitchen staff.   All of our meals were great'; the portions were generous and the bread was also good.  I'll probably go back again and hopefully they will get their kitchen problem resolved."
colleen f.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,24,1,1.0,8/20/2011,"WAY TOO MUCH NOISE GOING ON!!!! Food is extremely salty, wait people are too spread out, cheescake is not good and way overpriced, and drinks are lousy.  No thanks."
Andrew K.,"Danville, CA",32,57,7,3.0,6/21/2009,Went early and anticipated a 45 min wait which turned out to be 30 min. Seated outdoors as the weather was balmy. Amelia served us and was attentive. Food was good all around and portions were large. This is one of the newest locations and supplants the former Andronicos market. Ate light so we could have cheesecake.  30th Anniversary cheesecake was really good.
Joanna S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",13,359,4,3.0,12/15/2010,"Had lunch here last Fri. with a friend at 1:30, which is just after the big lunch surge is over and it is less frenzied. We were seated immediately. While the food was delicious, I fault them for music played way too loud for comfortable conversation. Also, our waitress was hurrying us for some reason, even though the place was not full. I felt I had to defend my plate from being removed before I was finished with my meal."
RICHARD A.,"Pittsburg, CA",4,38,8,5.0,6/19/2009,"My first time eating lunch here was very pleasant. Cheesecake Factory speared no expense at this location. In fact, its the nicest restaurant I've been to. I was greeted, and seated by a very nice server, and was quite interested in getting my order the way I wanted it to be. I got my spaghetti order, and the portion was just right for me to finish without over eating.  But when I ordered their Pina Colada, it was a bit too sweet for me, and barely tasted any alcohol  in it. But overall, I liked the server/ waitress so I gave her a nice tip.  A few weeks later, I was on the free trolley with one of their waitress, and the waitress was bombarded with annoying questions about her job from a passenger. She was as polite as she can be, and tried to answer her questions, and when she had enough, she just left the bus early with a great big smile! WOW what a character, I would have just ignored that person if I were her."
Gavel Of Truth X.,"San Francisco, CA",76,88,9,5.0,8/4/2012,"Great place. I think it's awesome. I like this location better than other locations because of its layout and design. The cheesecake is amazing. Love the Key-Lime and Red Velvet and Tiramisu Cheesecake on top of the regular cheesecake. I've been here quite a few times with friends and for birthdays etc... The food is always nice and the service has been good so far! It can take a little longer to wait for a table or food sometimes when they are having a busy night but I don't mind. The parking facility is free right next door so that's a nice little bonus. I think its a little pricier than most places but well worth it since its a place you can take your friends to or use for formal dinner meetings as well which is hard to find nowadays. The ceiling reminds me of Las Vegas Caesar's Palace for those of you who've been there you might share the feeling. Great for groups as well and the wait staff is really patient. It just has that fancy feel to it and its well maintained which is always a plus. The tiki torch outdoor area is super cool in my opinion and creates that fun tropical feel to it which I like. Its also ideally located with a huge Century theater across the street and shopping all around. Great place to check out and great area to be in. Lastly, you can always take things to go such as cheesecake which is always very tempting."
Trigo T.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",1,102,59,4.0,3/24/2009,This place is Poppin! it was PACKED both times ive been here past 11 pm  its great to have a place to be able to come to after dinner to order a delicious dessert and sit outside in the beautiful setting to enjoy your night
Sam A.,"Benicia, CA",232,694,304,3.0,2/4/2011,"this is the perfect place for a couple drinks and splitting a few appetizers.  Meals on the other hand - woah! haha  I'm not saying the food isn't good, its just pretty much, across the board, huge portions and terrible for you - don't look at the calorie book or you will be nailed down to about 7 items haha  But if your just going to share some snacks, its perfect. I just stay away from big meals here."
WJDL P.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,4.0,8/6/2011,"conveniently located in the heart of downtown walnut creek and has ample parking.  a movie theater is across the street with other nice stores located near by.  the service has always been excellent, however, the last few times i went i needed a high chair for my son and each time they gave me one with a broken latch, which is definitely a lawsuit ready to happen.  when i asked them to replace they did happily, but they gave me another chair with a broken latch.  cheesecake factory if you are reading this do yourself and all of us a favor and and replace the high chairs or at the very least fix the latches! The food is generally very good.  my wife likes the salads and i favor the burrito which is not authentic at all, but still tastey.   the gumbo is decent as well as the jambalaya.  as for the cheesecake, i love the strawberry and the banana  cheese cake, BUT pricey in my opinion for a piece of cake."
Elizabeth T.,"San Francisco, CA",148,55,,4.0,2/18/2009,"I was one of the lucky ones to be invited to the soft opening on Feb 16th. I was taken aback by the opulent interior. Its gorgeous! As soon as I snapped back to reality and remembered what I was here for, I looked around to find the hostess. I couldn't help but chuckle to myself about how nervous everyone looked. They all had these huge guilty grins on as if to say, ""WE'RE HAVING SO MUCH FUN, I CANT WAIT TO SERVE YOU HAND AND FOOT, SERIOUSLY, I CANT WAIT!"". Bless their souls, they were all so very eager and sweet that I couldn't pop their eager beaver bubble and tell our waitress that she had a mysterious piece of red something stuck between her two front teeth. Oh well, clearly even she can attest to their divine cuisine.  I have nothing bad to say about my experience. Our main purpose for being there was to simulate a 'real' customer and a 'real' service experience for their newly hired staff. Though my burger was brought out 10ish minutes later than my dates, I couldn't complain, my conversation with my date was so sparkling that I didn't even notice. In addition to the cheeseburger, I ordered Wontons and the White Truffle Raspberry Cheesecake. It was delish. No complaints. As for the late burger, I'm sure that they will get it soon enough. I cant wait to go back."
