Arlene T.,"San Leandro, CA",0,18,,4.0,1/5/2012,"I forgot that I wrote this review a while back.  I never gave an update for the office Xmas party.........Well, it was a great night.  We had the fried macaroni balls, which I have never tried before- they were delicious!  I had chicken (which was breaded) with fettucine and alfredo, suprisingly very good too.  Normally I have only found the appetizers to be good and that dish was very good.  Overall good food and lots of fun for an office party and of course the cosmos helped out!!"
Marco A.,"Concord, CA",0,2,,2.0,10/5/2013,"Foods ok over priced , drinks are good over priced $7 coke and rum , $10 half filled piña colada boomer , I been here many times and sometimes service is good and fast and some times they lack oh and too loud not going back any time soon"
Stephanie S.,"Vallejo, CA",0,13,,3.0,12/19/2011,I gave it a 3 stars because the food wasn't really good for its price although the portion was pretty hefty. I just wish the food didn't tasted so bland. The service was great and the place was clean and elegant. I would probably come here again and try something else.
Koui S.,"Davis, CA",15,8,4,2.0,9/23/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is my top favorite American Restaurant,  just not at the Walnut Creek location. Took forever to get us our bread at Happy Hour... The waitress was not very attentive and she took my friend's change from the tab. It was only like 60 cents but it's the concept that is judged upon. She was going to just leave it and add more to the tip but she never got it so they got nothing... And because I am a loyal friend, they got nothing from me either.. tsk tsk tsk..."
Colin P.,"San Francisco, CA",27,597,43,5.0,12/17/2011,"Thanks so much for quickly accommodating us, a drop in group of 30 on a Saturday night...always great service and friendly staff..."
J. W.,"Orinda, CA",10,35,,3.0,5/12/2009,"The food is WAY ovelry priced for what they are...but when it comes to the desserts, TOTALLY makes up for it.  $25 for shepard's pie is NOT WORTH IT!  The staff is very friendly though. The one girl we had was AWESOME, all I remember was she had curly hair, kinda looked like that girl, Mercedes from ANTM, GET HER! She was ON IT!  However, there was one guy who was a little...ummm...annoying. Kept asking us every five minutes if we were doing ok, but when it came for us to actually need something, he was GONE!...WTF!  Don't go on a busy night like Friday or Saturday. Best time to go is a weekday, before dinner!  The long island iced tea was tastey!  Decor was kinda weird. There's a mural like ceiling painting that made my eyes and head kinda hurt. It was very out of place...that's it."
Charlene O.,"Vacaville, CA",45,21,4,5.0,5/8/2011,"I crave the red velvet cheesecake that has about 2,000 calories in a slice. It's sooo rich and yummy!"
Nick F.,"Martinez, CA",2,3,,1.0,9/15/2009,"Im a pretty patient person....i usually give restaurants the benefit of the doubt. I am usually more than happy to wait for service IF it the restaurant looks massively understaffed and extremely busy.  HOWEVER!...the problem i have with cheesecake factory in Walnut Creek, is they honestly have an army of a staff! You can see waiters and waitresses everywhere! However both times i have been there my party has had to wait an obscenely long time for service.  The first time i went there was with a party of 10 or so for my birthday, and it was very near the grand-opening of the restaurant. So i was still expecting them to work out the kinks in service. But when my sister and I wen there a week or two ago...which has been many many months after intial opening....the service was somehow worse!  The food is pretty good, service is horrible. In all honesty if you want to go to the Cheesecake factory in Walnut Creek. You might as well hop on BART...go to San Francisco...eat at the Cheesecake Factory above Macy's...return back home to the east bay...and you will still be done dining quicker than going to the Walnut Creek restaurant!!!!"
Andrea V.,"Gilroy, CA",22,230,46,4.0,2/13/2013,"great food! good service!  ""eggcellent"" eggs benedict... tee hee!"
Glyrha F.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",95,9,4,4.0,5/1/2011,"I gave them 4 stars based on my last time we went there. Our server was excellent and very helpful. The food was very good and the portions were huge! And their cheesecakes are off the hook, hence the name ""The Cheesecake Factory"". lol! Will definitely be coming back soon!"
Michael D.,"Lafayette, CA",59,74,10,1.0,3/14/2009,"I won't dine here again, although I found some redeeming qualities. - Wait was crazy long, but we snuck in a table in the bar. - The mojitos were so incredibly sweet, we couldn't drink them. I had to send them back. - The NOISE. oh, the NOISE. The music was blaring, awful, and insistent. What in the world are they thinking? For this reason alone I don't ever want to come back. Even my wife complained, and she's more tolerant. - The staff, from front desk to waiters to clearers were amazing. So fantastic and friendly and efficient, I gave them a very hearty tip. Good job guys. - Portions were huge, but so were the prices. We spent $40 w/o tip for drinks & one appetizer or dessert each. OUCH. If you like mall-type atmosphere, crowded spaces, loud and stupid music, and generic experiences this place is for you. I'm still searching for an SF-type restaurant experience for everyday dining. Any suggestions?"
Val H.,"Martinez, CA",46,21,2,2.0,1/2/2011,"Food was excellent, service was terrible! We had a large party, so gratuity was automatically included, therefore our server didn't try. One of our appetizers wasn't brought out, we didn't get bread, just about the only thing he got right was to refill our sodas. We spent a lot of money and were charged gratuity that we didn't even want to pay. 2 stars for good food. But I'd rather go somewhere smaller and calmer with more attentive staff."
Stephanie B.,"Tracy, CA",20,17,8,4.0,6/18/2011,The four stars is for our awesome waiter Cornell. Cleanliness and food quality gets 2 1/2 stars. The floors and bathrooms were filthy and my bacon in my club sandwich was under cooked to point of being raw and my husbands pasta was uncooked as well.
Clarice K.,"Wailuku, HI",7,91,2,4.0,1/29/2011,"Had to come here while on vacation as we don't have a Cheesecake Factory back home.  The menu was so big I couldn't decide.  After much thought I ordered the steak diane. A few minutes later our waitress came back and told me they were all out of steak diane!  So I went with my 2nd choice, meatloaf.  It was very good, lots of food.  Couldn't finish it all and no room for dessert."
Martin T.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,9,,2.0,11/18/2013,It looked like our table had not been properly cleaned because several bits of green stuff (lettuce?) were still present.  The waiter cleared off one piece but we noticed another piece later.  One of my forks also had some food lodged in between the prongs.  Cheesecake was OK but the service was a bit slow.
Kristen H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",2,22,,2.0,3/2/2009,"I went with a group of seven people on a Friday night and we were seated at a table for 6 with a chair on the end of the table for the seventh person. My friend who sat there kept getting bumped all night long. The service was slow. I don't know if it was because it was busy because it just opened or it that is just how the service it. Either way I was not impressed by the service. Also, It took an hour and forty five minutes to get seated. You can't make a reservation. The food was ok. The portions were really large. The menu was very large. If your going with a large party it might be a good place because there is some of everything. But if you are health conscience do not order the cheesecake; one slice of the original cheesecake has about 60 grams of fat.  I would probably go somewhere else, especially on the weekends. I did not think the food was worth the wait or the hassle of finding parking."
Pink L.,Bay Area,11,133,160,3.0,1/16/2011,"Love the Red Velvet cheesecake with some Starbucks coffee!  Delicious!  Other than that, I'm not a big fan of their entrees tho the Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken was good.  Had some moist and dry areas to the chicken.  Beware that the mashed potatoes and everything on the plate had black pepper on it.  I found it odd that it came like that since there's black pepper on the table and unfortunately I'm kind of allergic to it, so it ruined my meal a bit.  Anyways, this place gets really busy weekend nights and thankfully for Joe who helped our large party have a table ready at the time requested.  He's great!  So, ask for him when you have large parties."
Dana T.,"Burlingame, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/7/2011,"My party of six adults and two children arrived at 5:45 p.m. at the Walnut Creek location for a Birthday dinner.  We knew we would have a wait because the restaurant does not take reservations and we did not want to sit in the outside dining area.  We waited, and waited, and waited in the bar area and then were told that our table was ready at 7:30 p.m..   Unfortunately, the table was outside and we had specified inside.  The manager for the evening advised us we would be seated soon and that he was doing everything in his power to get us a table.  Since we had given up our seating in the bar area, we were forced to stand and sit on the floor on the side of the restaurant because there was no seating for patrons waiting for a table. Additionally, some friends of ours in a group of eleven had also come for a birthday dinner at the restaurant.  After arriving at 6:30, they were seated at least 40 minutes prior to us.  Obviously, management chose to seat the party of eleven before us. The night manager completely ignored us and went out of his way not to walk anywhere near us, because he knew we were angry.  We were finally seated around 8:00 p.m. but not at one table, but two. Because this was a birthday dinner, we wanted to sit together and ended up squeezing into one booth. At the end of the evening, (after my brother, two kids and wife had to leave because his daughter was ill after eating the meal), another manager came to the table and tried to fix this mishap.  The restaurant never offered an explanation for our treatment, but tried to fix it by offering a free appetizer (that only fed six and we had eight in our party), paid for the the birthday entree (but not dessert), and reimbursed us the $5 for a child's meal. I have been going to the Cheesecake factory long before it was ever in the Bay Area and I have always thought favorably of their service, food and management, until I went to the Walnut Creek location.  I will never eat there again. Maybe it is too much to expect to be treated with dignity in an establishment that, obviously only cares about the bottom line."
FairMe R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4,36,6,5.0,5/31/2011,"I live in WC and go to this place at least once a month. I love it! Food is always delicious. Waiters are nice. Even if sometimes they forget things, I always give them a break - the place is incredibly busy and it is possible to become forgetful. They also started to provide complimentary baby platter with banana and bread pieces for babies. Isn't it cute? Whoever loves avocado, take avocado rolls. For fish lovers, take Wasabi crusted tuna - it will become your favorite for the rest of life! Enjoy!!!"
Coopdawg C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",3,148,,2.0,2/1/2010,"OK, this is an about-face for me.  I've always enjoyed the food, but here's the deal. They put chicken in almost EVERYTHING.  As a vegetarian this is unacceptable.  They kind of sneak it in to things that appear perfectly vegetarian, and these are things that could do perfectly well without adding chicken or some sort of meat to them. It's really like they're gerring free chicken and HAVE to use is.  Look at their menu,  It's HUGE, but almost everything has chicken this or that.  Hard to get away from. I wouldn't know about their use as an ingredient unless I asked and the particular server knew. I suppose I'll be going there a lot less if at all.  I'd rather go where they respect vegetarians and their reason for being such."
