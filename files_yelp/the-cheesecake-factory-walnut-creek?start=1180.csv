Elke M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",12,75,16,4.0,3/18/2009,"We went on opening night and knew to go early.  We got in line at 5:30 and were seated by 6:00. We went with another couple and ordered 5 or 6  sdifferent things to share so we could all taste alot of different things.  Amazingly, the service, food, organization, etc, for opening night, were all excellent!!!  We had at least 10 different servers and staff come over to our booth and talk or ask how everything was.  Everything we ordered was wonderful.  We actually thought the cheesecake was the least delicious.  The corn fritters were awesome!!!! The decor is beautiful and the existing staff from all the other locations training the new staff seemed to work really well.  Can't say anything bad at all about our experience.  This is the first time we had ever been to a Cheesecake Factory, and frankly I wasn't expecting it to be as upscale and the food as good as it was.  Very pleasantly surprised."
Katie G.,"Austin, TX",1,4,,1.0,7/19/2013,"I love Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes! My favorite is by far the white chocolate raspberry truffle! However, the service at this location is awful. I have two kids and am pregnant with my 3rd and decided I would call for curbside service, I was craving my favorite cheesecake and my 2yr old had just fallen asleep. I ordered they said 10min after almost 25min a girl came out with my bag of two cheesecake slices. She said the total and I gave her $3 extra for running it to my car luckily I had cash because if you pay with cc or don't have exact change they go inside and you have another wait. I'm surprised they don't have the ability to swipe a credit card on the spot. Nevertheless I live about 30min from this store and I arrived home to find that not only did I not get what I ordered I was stuck with a very Oreo cheesecake hardly to be desired if you are expecting raspberry. I was very disappointed and ended up throwing away both because they were so awful big disappointment! Will not go back a big waste of money! I ordered a very easy order I am surprised they screwed up so bad."
Elizabeth T.,"Brentwood, CA",20,53,6,5.0,1/17/2011,"Love The Cheesecake Factory, this one has to be my favorite because it is only 5-10 minutes from my home :) I have been here a few time and haven't been disappointed.  I have tried many dishes and about 8-10 different cheesecakes. My favorite has to be the Red Velvet Cheesecake, highly recommend, you should try this one! Our parties are usually 2-4 people so our wait is never long, service is quick and everyone is very friendly. Don't have any negative remarks plus the movie theater is across the street and you can either valet for $7.00 or park in one of two free parking garages plus it is close to a lot of different shops! Close and convenient!!"
Dustin B.,"Bellflower, CA",82,213,23,5.0,4/27/2010,Love this place. Love the menu Love the service and I love the town. Damn I miss Contra Costa County
Betsy K.,"Lafayette, CA",12,85,,1.0,1/30/2010,"This is a flashy, Vegas-style version of Denny's.  Total garbage."
Mary F.,"Concord, CA",5,32,1,3.0,4/7/2011,We were really disappointed with the service at a recent visit.  The server was just not interested in our table.  The meals were slow to come out and he never came by to check on us while we were waiting.  We would have ordered more drinks and the kids would have had refills had he come over.   It was my daughter's bday which I made known to the hostess and to the server.  After dinner we waited to get her dessert and to sing and all we got was the check.  We have eaten birthday dinners there in the past with much better results.
Angie L.,"San Bruno, CA",26,54,71,5.0,5/23/2012,"Came here first time ever for a birthday lunch with my co-workers and OMG! Can someone say: E-X-T-R-A-V-A-G-A-N-T!!!!! I wasn't expecting so much elegance in this restaurant! It's freaking gorgeous the minute you step in the doors you feel like you're at a Las Vegas 5 star hotel lobby!!! Anyways besides the ambiance which is superb! The food was also excellent! I had the Skinny Grilled Salmon with Yummy Grilled Veggies! Super scrumptious! Then my co-workers convinced me that if you come to Cheesecake Factory, you MUST have their cheesecake! And yeah they have a whole two pages of probably at least 30 different cheesecakes to choose from! How can you resist??? So I chose the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake. ABSOLUTE HEAVEN!!!!!!!! I had to take half of it home it was so huge!!! And the staff, AWESOME! Very attentive, friendly, great attitudes, everyone acts like they love their jobs, smiling happy servers! Nothing to complain about! And its right smack in the heart of Downtown Walnut Creek! So after lunch or dinner, you go shopping! This place definitely gets 5 stars hands down! Just don't come here on a diet!!!"
christine d.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,14,,1.0,9/1/2011,"Terrible!! The two of us ordered a pasta each and a salad between us. My seafood spaghetti was very greasy and my partners pasta was underdone....horrible. The salad was so sweet I could not eat it. I complained to the waitress and her attitude was ""well you ordered it"" I should have complained to a supervisor, but instead I left vowing to never return which I will not. I have eaten in a number of Cheesecake Factory restaurants and I have never before had any complaints."
Ann T.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",34,5,,4.0,3/26/2011,"OK gotta say the meal and service I had tonight was amazing.  Had the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad.  I always have to read the nutrition guide here before I eat so that I'm not consuming 2000 calories in one dish.  This salad came in around 490 which is light for the Cheesecake Factory.  The tuna was AHmazing.  I kid you not.  Was shocked as all get out.  Our service was great.  We had our 2 year old with us and they brought her some bread and banana when we sat down.  They even put in her order first and had a very reasonable $3.95 pasta with butter and cheese which of course she loved.  Service was fantastic too.  Friendly and very efficient, and nice to my kid without being scary.  The place was slammed at 6:00 PM on a Saturday and while told we would have to wait 20-25 minutes it was 10 minutes tops.  Was quite pleasantly surprised."
Nick G.,"Lafayette, CA",7,14,7,3.0,3/17/2009,"OOOO cheesecake factory....   Lets start with the service. The wait was reeeeeeeaally long, but I was prepared for it.  Wouldn't expect anything different from a brand new restaurant.  The host staff was very friendly and helpful and Im pretty sure estimated our wait time correct to the minute.  (I started in the restaurant business as a host and I dont think I was ever able to do that) The food was great.  We ordered the grilled artichoke appetizer (My gf ate the artichoke and I licked the salt off the leaves) , fried mac n cheese (I love fried food), orange chicken (fresh orange zest and fresh chicken made this better than Panda's orange chicken mmmm) , caesar salad, and four seasons pizza.  They messed up and gave us the large pizza instead of the lunch size so that was a nice bonus.  Portions were huuuuuge.  The Bad...  It took 45 minutes from when we finished our apps to get our entrees.  We had to ask twice if they were coming and I was late for work because I didnt expect my lunch to take 2 1/2 hrs.  Also, our waitress boxed our pizza for us and crammed the entire thing into a small box... When we got home it was one big mushy ball of toppings and cheese.  I know they have pizza boxes, but not for us I guess. Overall, I was very impressed with the food..  I came in skeptical because I didnt think that the food would be that great, since the kitchen has to know how to prepare the hundreds of items on the menu, but was very happy with the food. Service.... SLLLLOOOWWW,  but its a new restaurant so I will probably go back eventually to see if they worked out all the kinks"
Daisy M.,"Antioch, CA",1,14,,1.0,8/20/2011,"We asked for a booth twice and twice we were given a table.  The crispy beef and rice was bad. The rice was cold and blend and dry and the beef was just like the cook poured a whole container of salt into the beef!!  It was terrible. The lemon torte was so-so. For those 2 items, we paid $27.98. It was overpriced and very disappointing. Don't bother to go there."
Edward D.,"Lafayette, CA",41,119,3,5.0,3/14/2011,"I went to CF for the first time on Sat night.. I had no idea what to expect.. I shared sliders and a asian salid with my friend.. Great burgers perfectly cooked, served warm.. then the salid came and i was equally pleased.  tasted fresh and healthy.. not too much dressing.  skipped desert, maybe next time.. the only thing i did not like was the mass of human beings. the place was packed and i dont like crowds, i would return sometime when the place was less full.. helpful friednly service, we ate at the bar. Good work CF!"
Angel B.,"Martinez, CA",1,7,1,2.0,8/18/2011,"My mother & I used to love the Walnut Creek Cheesecake Factory but after our experience in May for her birthday and the lack of response to my complaint, we won't be back. Since she is partially disabled, she has a hard time getting around without a cane. This being said, when dropping our car off at the valet, who we waited on for 15 minutes, the back patio area had been washed off making it slick and hard to maneuver. Once inside, they made us climb a couple of stairs to get to a table not once pointing out the ramp on the side of the room or allowing us to sit at a table on the ground floor. It's too bad that had to be our experience to begin with because the serving staff and food are always good."
michael m.,"Walnut Creek, CA",21,6,,4.0,8/15/2011,"I like pretty much everything minus the wait when there is a wait. Oh, and the drinks are way too expensive. Still, this is a pretty good joint. The decor is awesome, and fried calamari are not too bad either.  Looking forward to my next time at the factory."
Gi R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",2,39,,5.0,3/3/2013,I came here on a tuesday night with a friend and had a great time and great food. the restaurant is decorated impressively and the service is friendly and quick. I ate the enchiladas and they were really really good. The tab came out lower than I thought for how nice the place looked. about $15 a person with food appetizers and a beer each. niiiice!
sam l.,"Concord, CA",1,52,,1.0,3/20/2012,"Wow! Denny's food, less than Denny's service and Spago prices! You'll need to get liquored up to not be furious about the price for the poor service and mediocre food. The cheesecake is good, however (I suggest take out)."
Jessica H.,"Concord, CA",149,235,337,3.0,1/5/2010,"Decided to go to The Cheesecake Factory for lunch with a coworker today. We were immediately greeted, and told that there was open seating in the bar AREA. Apparently, what they meant was open seating AT the bar. After sitting around for awhile, we caught a waitresses attention to get menus. Finally our server came and told us that we were sitting in a closed area, so that's why we weren't being helped. She took our orders and was friendly enough. There ended up being a little mini rice bowl in my garden salad. That was the end of that. The lunch pizza is HUGE and for a pretty moderate price."
Ma S.,"Fremont, CA",0,52,,2.0,5/10/2011,"We've been there 6 or 7 times.   Service is always friendly and exceptional! Had garlic noodles - lunch-size portion and added chicken.  Lots of noodles, barely one asparagus and maybe 2 shitake mushrooms and a bit of tomato in the noodles, that seemed not much veg for the price.  When I saw the description, I expected more veg, especially with today's focus on healthy food.  Chicken was good, but had a wing with bone-in.  Garlic sauce just OK.  Again, service was terrific."
P S.,"Albany, CA",0,30,,5.0,7/30/2011,"We always enjoy our meals here every time we come by! Servers are great, delicious food, and overall a nice place to grab a bite or drink..or just to enjoy some cheesecake. Try the little plates..corn fritters are awesome, ahi tuna and the salmon rolls are some of our favorites too.Also, they have a great kids menu!"
Justyne C.,"Pittsburg, CA",131,3,4,1.0,7/1/2014,"Sp lets just start off with saying I understand that it does get extremely busy here. But when you have a party of ten you have to wait for the manager to approve you or okay the fact that you are being added to the list... This took twenty minutes to get the manager to talk to you. So once we finally got our name on the list we then had to wait an additional hour and a half. So over all just ten minutes shy of two hours. So our buzzer goes off, and so we go in to check and the host is beyond rude. She looks at us and says oops not you guys. So we ask how much longer, and without even lifting her nose up from the computer she starts to stare at us and rolls her eyes. Seriously?  Then we continue to wait for 30 more minutes and are sat close to closing. The server started out really great, but towards the end you could tell we were an inconvenience to her and her wanting to go home. We ordered drinks, appetizers, and entrees. With the intentions of ordering dessert. It just kept getting worse, food was cold, cooked wrong, server started to get rude with us. So we asked to talk to a manager. And he simply was just a waste of breath and time to talk to. He thought by ""buying"" desserts for us that it rectified the situation. I will not go back to this location.  From beginning to end this place sucked. Food service and management!"
