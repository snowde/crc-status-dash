Judy O.,"Walnut Creek, CA",59,43,2,2.0,8/19/2017,"Have not been here for a few years and now I know why.  I can't stand this palace. Food was gross, service was horrible and bathroom and table was dirty.  Done and done!'"
Leah C.,"Martinez, CA",23,24,,5.0,8/26/2017,Amazing dinner with my fiancé at cheesecake tonight! Food was hot and delicious. Our server (super cute brunette named Kelsey) was super attentive and made great recommendations! She anticipated all our needs during our visit and we will absolutely come back and request her section!
K W.,"Antioch, CA",0,19,,2.0,12/26/2016,"Have been coming here for several years. 5/5 for the cheese cake. 4/5 for the service, they were very busy. 2/5 for the food, it is not up to par from the previous visits.  The portion for the four cheese pasta with chicken cost 19.95 and it looked like the lunch portion. The Santa Fe chicken salad was dry and lacked flavor. It took almost 30 minutes for the main course to be served.  Tip: come for the cheese cake, but don't stay for the food, if it is busy. ""Cheese cake Togo""."
Richard L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,31,4,1.0,6/25/2017,This place is disgusting. Two of the plates on our table were coated with the dried remains of someone else's cheesecake. The server didn't bother to apologize when we pointed this out. The utensils had bits of dried food stuck to them. The food : calamari & hibachi steak were too greasy to eat.  The tomatoes on the salad had a fishy taste and were just off. The bathroom was equally gross with used paper towels on the floor and toilets that hadn't been cleaned in a while. I've used portable toilets at rock festivals that were cleaner.
Allison M.,"Santa Barbara, CA",78,1,,1.0,9/7/2017,"By far, the worst customer service I've ever received! The first couple of times, I let it slide...thinking it was a fluke - but wow...rude. From mistakes with the bill, to employees cutting bathroom lines...cannot believe it's a bad experience EVERY single time! The servers are fine but I only eat here when I'm dragged here. I come for the cheesecake DEF not the service!"
America R.,"Pittsburg, CA",131,34,18,1.0,8/1/2017,"Don't bother calling in an order! They will have you waiting on the line for as along as possible. Once you place your order your lucky if it gets out through. I placed an order at 5pm and came in by 5:25 only to hear it wasn't even put in the kitchen. No manager available to help even after waiting, it's now 5:45 and nothing. It's paid for and no one has checked in on me. Horrible service!!!"
Fuzzy S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,20,,1.0,11/13/2016,"This has to be the worst Cheesecake Factory in America!! I've driven from Florida to Denver and back and tried different ones and yes this is the worst!  Let's start by saying the wait was longer than usual almost 3 hours tonight! And we get a server who pretty much was absent from our table all night!  It was only four of us at the table and we didn't get water, bread and a menu until 10 minutes after sitting down.  Once we did get our bread we ordered right away seeing how none of us had eaten all day due to busy schedules. I ordered a To Go Meal and specifically asked for a pasta dish with no meat! I told the waiter 4 times and stressed to him that my girlfriend was a Vegetarian!!!!!!!  After waiting over an hour the server comes back and says and I quote ""sorry about the delay our kitchen is swamped and they haven't got to your order yet but here's the TO GO meal""  I couldn't believe it! The to go meal was ready but our actual food for the table wasn't? Absurd! but wait there's more ..  35 minutes goes by and only 2 plates come out! Not all four but 2 ... now this is all after waiting almost 4 hours in total! And it's not even the worst part!  I get home cross the bridge and the pasta dish for my Vegetarian Girflirend had nothing but MEAT in it!!! I lost my top! I called and spoke with the manager Jason Shum and his way to solve the problem was a gift card and a sorry!!?!?! After my girlfriend is throwing up sick after eating this nasty poor excuse of meal the best he had for me is a gift card and a sorry??????  No this is way unacceptable and I'll be sending my check order my complaint and a lawyer if need be to the corporates office! I'll never dine at another Cheesecake Factory ever again .. and I say this while my girl is sick throwing up and now even more hungry since she was waiting around for her food.. unacceptable Cheesecake Factory .. you'll be hearing more from me on this matter"
Kyle R.,"Pittsburg, CA",3,42,25,1.0,8/5/2017,His place is absolutely disgusting every time I come here it's a horrible experience my grandmother buys me gift cards every year for the Cheesecake Factory and I never have a problem in San Francisco but everytime I come to this one in Walnut Creek they always say there's no money on it I'll call in to check and I'll be plenty of money on it for the balance and they'll continue to tell me there's not the food get served with your salads just absolutely horrible only good thing I have to say is our waiter was extremely polite and extremely nice
Molly H.,"Folsom, CA",291,20,5,5.0,8/4/2017,"So little bit of a wait but to be expected on a Friday. Gregory was our second server since he returned from break, HE IS SO NICE AND HELPFUL AND HAPPY! and the gentleman host loves giving compliments which is good since we came to fatten up haha. This is by far the best cheesecake factory ever. THANK YOU GREGORY, love the two girls who ate too much and asked for everything to go and extra butter!"
Gizelle B.,"Fullerton, CA",221,38,20,5.0,8/8/2017,"This location always has awesome customer service. I went around 5pm on a Friday and surprisingly I only waited less than 10 minutes for a table of 4. My four cheese pasta with chicken is always my go to dish. The different cheeses blend so well and the size proportion is always plenty. I always get either the red velvet cheesecake or reese's peanut butter but we decided to try the chocolate hazelnut cheesecake. It was worth trying something new because it was crunchy yet a perfect amount of chocolate and then its topped with nutella, which gives it a more special taste."
Yen H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",199,117,121,4.0,6/29/2016,"We generally have a good experience here. Our most recent visit was late at night to fulfill a chicken Parmesan craving by my husband. Well it turned out to be amazing!! Service from the kitchen seemed slightly delayed or we were really hungry.  Our server was attentive and the other staff were cordial and helpful too. Our server suggested we try the Cuban sandwich the next time we visit.  We didn't get dessert this visit, however, the previous visit we ordered the (I don't remember the name) ""apple pie cheesecake"" to take home and it was sooooooo good!!!! One of my favorites there."
Brenda N.,"Danville, CA",0,14,2,1.0,8/7/2017,"We are a family of three (with young child) and Sunday night was a very frustrating dinner experience for us. We arrived at 6:50pm and waited 40 minutes to get seated (around 7:30pm). We placed our order immediately (as we've already waited so long to get seated) and were hoping to finally enjoy a relaxing dinner, BUT... 1) Our Pasta Da Vinci was missing chicken (we did not ask for vegetarian option, btw) and had to be sent back to be remade.  2) This is minor: Our coconut-lime green curry with chicken had rice that was dry and clumpy, which makes me suspect that it was day-old rice.  3) We placed our child's ice-cream order (along with our main dishes) at 7:30pm and by the time we were ready for dessert (before 9:00pm), they said they were out of chocolate ice-cream and only had vanilla. When we asked if we could have some chocolate syrup as a compromise, our server said OK then when the bill came, it showed up as $7.95 as opposed to the expected $2.95 for ice-cream. If we were going to be charged $5 extra for syrup, we need to be informed!!! The ice-cream did not arrive yet so we were able to refuse it and get it taken off our bill, but that took 10-15 minutes. 4) By now, we just want to get out of there. We got the corrected bill, and my husband gave the server a gift card and a credit card to cover any outstanding balance. It turns out that our gift card had enough to cover the entire meal with $4 leftover. Instead, the server swiped the gift card until the balance was down to zero and then charged our credit card another $10. Good thing we checked our gift card history and saw this. We approached the manager and he fixed it, but this was another 30 minutes of extra wait time. No apologies were given. Needless to say, by the time we were done with this nightmare, it was 9:40pm and my child was sleeping on my lap. It was a horrible 3-hour dinner experience with multiple attempts at deception.  We would SO NOT be coming back!!!"
Sabrina A.,"Lancaster, CA",40,10,3,1.0,7/29/2017,I really need to give this place no star's. I had lunch today and had hair in my food. Manager did come over and apologize but I think he should of taken care of the whole bill... That is very discussing!! I didn't even want a piece of cheese cake. I'm wondering if they wear hair nets? Very disappointing! I will never eat here again.
Lexi K.,"Vacaville, CA",54,2,,3.0,8/22/2017,"First off, my boyfriend and I loooove cheesecake! We drove from Vacaville to celebrate his new job. Waitress was nice, but not very talkative. Our food took an hour to come out. The server said it would come out soon, but never did. This sucks, because we are both servers at a high paced restaurant too and understand. But when the food takes that long, as a server, you need to apologize for the wait. She did none of this and was so hard to find. We talked to a manager and got a discount and free cheesecake luckily. An AMAZING SERVER named Jackie took over and took care of anything. Thank you for your kindness and help, he saved this experience. Tips to managers: they said the kitchen was short staffed and that's why it took so long. Help your servers out and staff the kitchen, expecting a big rush at anytime. Thank you again Jackie for saving the day! (:"
Terri P.,"Pittsburg, CA",1,28,1,5.0,1/31/2017,Went for my daughters birthday with some friends. Service was great waitress great enjoyed the food. Loved that I could bring my own birthday cake. Wish I could include pics we had a good time.
Wendy S.,"Portland, OR",43,5,3,1.0,8/8/2017,"Sorry to say... there were several disappointments at the factory today... The service was extremely slow... the French dip was burnt to a crisp and when I mentioned it to our server... she said oh ok... didn't offer to replace it... or offer something else... then we ordered dessert... 30 minutes and still waiting for our dessert... I asked the hostess to Check on our dessert... and he goes and wipes a table... and then comes back by and says.. ""I'll find your server.... "". We're standing here to pay... she brings the melted ice cream... and says do you want this... ahhh no.... the part I don't understand is that the restaurant is not busy... are they short handed??  What gives....interesting enough as  still standing here waiting for our check... the server tried to blame the bakery for their slowness... its was not the bakery's fault... Now that I am home and had a chance to reflect on our service, I'm still frustrated and disappointed.  I think what bothers me the most... was not the burnt French dip, or the 30 plus minute wait for our dessert, or the lack of check back by our server, but how the server tried to blame the bakery for the delay in getting our desserts out... which was not the case as we watched the ice cream melt while waiting for our check at the counter... however the most frustrating part of the meal, was how the manager handled my concerns... maybe he was having a bad day.... maybe his cherries spilled... who knows... but his utmost lack of customer service was absolutely shocking... his comment to me in regards to the burnt French dip was "" well the server showed me .., and you did eat half of it..."". Well yes I did eat half of it as the server did not return to check on us.... my reply to the manager was"" YOU saw the quality of food your kitchen sent out..., and you didn't immediately to something to rectify the situation?.,,"". Unbelievable!  Everyone and every establishment has a bad day.., I get that.. however the managers lack of customer service is not acceptable! He could benefit from a significant amount of additional training!"
Crystal C.,"Antioch, CA",0,14,27,2.0,7/30/2017,"The server was the sweetest thing on this earth but everything else was downhill from there. The burgers took too long and were extremely dry. The bread felt stale (?) When I spoke with the manager, he snatched the receipt out of my hand! How rude! I'm sure this place makes so much because of the name and location, so we will not be returning again."
Tom P.,"Vallejo, CA",11,28,,1.0,10/25/2016,"What a disappointment! After years, decades, even, of hearing the hype, and that one celebrity who swears by it, I found it to be on the low end of Mediocre. We got there at opening time on a Thursday. The staff seemed sad to see us walk in. The drinks server was good, no problem there.  As we waited, we had opportunity to observe the staff in action. There was a lot of yelling across the open space amonst the servers. Not sure what it was about, but they seemed oblivious to the presence of customers. At one point, a server passing by our table shouted so loudly that I got an Adrenalin rush, right down to the tingly fingers. And I'm not that easily rattled. It was as though we did not exist in her world.  Add to this the hard environment -- tile floor, faux marble columns, etc. -- couple with the oppressive, even assaultive loud music, and the noise level was such as to dampen the taste buds. Also, for heaven's sake, CF, have a word with yourself: that's the most obnoxious mix of music I've ever heard in a restaurant. There is plenty of non-aggressive music in the world. Another comment regarding staff: Management needs to direct staff to forego perfume, especially cheap aftershave. Apart from the fact that many people are sensitive to such chemicals, the taste of them on the tongue detracts from the food. Okay, that covers service, atmosphere, noise, and offensive odors. On to the food! I had the Vietnamese spring/summer rolls. They were built well, with apparently fresh ingredients, and I liked the dipping sauces, especially the hot chili one. But they were permeated with a a stale refrigerator smell and taste.  The Baja fish tacos would have been acceptable, except they were served lukewarm. The black beans were lukewarm and bland. The rice was lukewarm and tasteless. Possibly left over rice from the previous day? Hard to tell, but I wouldn't be surprised. The original cheesecake was way below mediocre. I've had better from a frozen box.  I see that management's response to other comments runs along the lines of ""Why didn't you discuss this with your manager?"" Good question, why didn't I? Because it's not a problem with a single meal, or a bad day. Obviously, the place is operating as designed, and the staff is operating as trained. I didn't care to have an unpleasant conversation to state the obvious. Why do you need to be told, CF, that loud, smelly, overblown environment combined with sub-mediocre lukewarm food is not acceptable. Stop blaming customers, get your act together. And don't you think that 80 bucks for lunch for two is insanely over the top? That's 1 beer, 1 cocktail, 1 entree, 1 appetizer, 1 slice of cheesecake. 80 bucks. Eighty. Bucks. That's before tip, and doesn't count the nearly impossible-to-find parking, or the bridge toll."
Rebecca W.,"Antioch, CA",44,50,46,5.0,2/9/2017,"I LOVE coming here! Me & my boyfriend come here for our monthly 'fancy' date night. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is very mellow & the servers are very friendly. The Pasta Da Vince is by far the best & the Key Lime Cheesecake is pretty amazing too."
Carlo S.,"Moraga, CA",11,20,1,2.0,7/28/2017,"What a disappointing experience. We were a group of 4 people and were told 40 minutes of max waiting time. It took 65 minutes. We only did not go somewhere else because there was already too much time invested in waiting. Only a standard ""I am sorry"" was given. The table was beautiful; food was ok. The strawberry's cheesecake was tasteless. They were super busy, seems like they don't need new customers, I will help them by not coming back."
