lisa d.,"Alamo, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/19/2010,"Service and the wait for a seat  was the worst experience I have ever had.  If you happen to be African American, stay clear of this place.  They treat you horrible.  During our visit, the waitress forgot about our table and said ""you must not be from around here"" after asking what is taking so long with our order.  This incident happended over 8 months ago and it still impacts me to this day.  I will never go inside a cheesecake factory again."
Aim E.,"Santa Clara, CA",300,335,3,5.0,12/29/2009,long lines but me love cheesecake factory (even though i hate cheesecake!). when you feel like having a million options and want to stuff your face - this is the place to go.
Terry L.,"Concord, CA",0,7,,1.0,2/28/2014,"Six months ago I went to  the cheesecake factory and they gave us a table the table was dirty so was the utensils I could not eat there that night. I went  there today with my wife and the water glass was dirty to start, ordered a cheese burger and fires they brought the burger but no fries he said they were coming they never came .  I then went  to my car there is a ticket  I paid the meter for a hour an half I put the time on my iphone so I would not be late , I was  to be back at 2:20 the time on ticket 1:30 the car next to me also had a ticket the owner stated that she had more time also.Then I realized that the meters were off by half the time. I called the cheese cake factory and told them, we all know what they said its out of there hand and that was the end of the conversation. So let me recap I got no fries and I got a ticket  by con artist. and cheese cake factory does not care about the customer. Will not go back"
Shane R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",28,155,2,2.0,1/11/2011,"I don't see what the big deal is about. The service was alright, but the food..  We could have gotten better food at mcdonalds. For the price of what you get, you are better off going somewhere else. It has that fancy atmosphere, but what good does that do if the food isn't good?"
Stephanie E.,"Antioch, CA",156,121,56,3.0,8/31/2009,"I got three words for you - Passion Fruit Mojito.  Know it.  Order it.  Love it.   Now that that is out of the way... This spot has been poppin off ever since it opened.  We had to wait for the rest of our party to arrive so posting it at the bar was the best decision we ever made.  Finding a seat at the bar is a mission in itself  but my girl an her man got here early and managed to get us a prime spot...major score!  Her Sangria looked tasty and she ordered quite a few so I'm guessing it was a winner.  I, however, was too stuck on my Mojito's to stray.  Hubs got a Well-Mannered Dirty Martini and my boy got a beer.  We also ordered the Fried Macaroni and Cheese for an appetizer.  Umm yeah, whoever came up with frying mac and cheese is a freaking genius! On to dinner.  Everything up to this point had been good (including service) and I was wondering about the mediocre rating of this place.  Then my dinner arrived.  Yes, I think you know where this is going.  Major disappointment.   I haven't had anything fried in I don't know how long (I know right) and being that it was Friday, I was in a ""fry"" kind of mood.  The fried mac and cheese set it off so I decided to go with my usual at CF which was the Navajo sammich (fry bread - yum) with fries (I was bound to OD after such a long drought) and a side or ranch dressing.  The ranch dressing is key and helps make this dish.  Unfortunately, they really effed it up.  Their dressing is homemade and done in house and typically I love it.  They clearly got the recipe wrong (insert expletive here).  Even the fries were ehh.  Sammich was OK but it was all just off.  I tried the Hubs Garlic noodles and it was blah blah bland.  I totally regret ordering dinner and should have just went for a slice of cheesecake (too full after even though I did not finish my dinner).  Oh, did you know they now have a red velvet one???  And it has my name written all over it...literally.  So would I go back...sure, but for the bar only.  I should make mention the drinks are pretty pricey though (damn passion fruit mojito got me hooked).  Our bar tab was more than our dinner tab (real talk).  The only food I would order is the appetizer and/or a cheesecake (hellooooo Stefanie's Ultimate Red Velvet).  Other than that, I would rather drink my calories here, thank you!"
Dixie S.,"Martinez, CA",22,8,,1.0,4/5/2012,"This review is for their so-called curbside service.  This was my first and last experience with take-out from the Cheesecake Factory.  After waiting 30 minutes for someone to bring out my order, I walked inside and inquired about it.  The girl at the curb-side register told me she was sorry and that they had been ""bombarded"" with take-out orders.  At 11:30 a.m.?  Funny ~  there were 4 waitpersons standing around the curb-side/takeout register talking when I walked up to it.   The girl went back to the kitchen and immediately returned with my order.  Yummy.....nothing like cold crabcakes.   Come on Cheesecake Factory....you can do better than that.  Not even a a dollar off for making me needlessly wait."
B P.,"Plano, TX",43,28,3,1.0,3/18/2009,"Wait was long, service was BAD. After our service made a mistake, she decided not to say anything. We waited 2 hours for one of our main dishes to arrives. The rest of us ate as one of our friends waited forever for her plate. We paid the bill, and still no dish!  It was bad.. I LOVE Cheesecake Factory, but prefer the Stoneridge Mall one! They have GREAT SERVICE! And admit there mistakes ---instead of making us wait and get even more fustrated."
EandT N.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,28,,3.0,12/29/2010,"It's an above average chain restaurant but a chain nonetheless. They have a huge variety of food that will suit everyone's fancy and it's all pretty good. Nothing spectacular (but I do love that Pasta Jambalaya!). I'm always puzzled as to why people will wait an hour or more to get a seat during a rush -- that's just plain silly. I prefer to go for a midweek lunch or use the curbside takeout. All in all, 3 solid stars."
Caylynn H.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",52,61,12,3.0,12/11/2009,"We could have skipped out on the check if we wanted to since we were so poorly attended after dessert. I would not come here to eat a meal, but I did enjoy having appetizers and drinks with friends. This place is worth a visit for the fried mac'n'cheese and cheesecake when you have a big group of friends and cash to blow, but don't go out of your way to eat here."
Carolyn D.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,8,,4.0,6/4/2009,"After reading horrible reviews, my family must have gotten lucky, or you other might have just been having a bad day. ; ) We got seated within 20 minutes, party of 5. Our waters were served in warm cups, which was kind of odd... Delicious food, I got the shrimp and bacon club sandwich which was probably not the healthiest, but it tasted fantastic, also, crab cakes tasted bizarre, not very fresh. My mother loves key lime pie, hence her choice of key lime pie cheesecake. It wasn't bad, just not fantastic, next time we'll opt for the original. In general, the atmosphere is nice. Its a little loud, but its a great family restaurant."
pasta e.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,5,,2.0,5/27/2009,"Oh my! The ambience is wonderful.  Outside dining perfect, BUT the menu is too extensive and the cooks have not learned to prepare a thing correctly. Food very mediocre, salty, greasy. Our carrot cakes tasted like bread  topped with frosting. I should give it a few more months to get their act together, but we all know things go downhill  rapidly around this town!"
Van C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,34,,3.0,2/27/2011,"Cheesecake Factory used to be one of my favorite places to eat, but through the years, the quality has gone down hill.  This place is probably the most unhealthy place I go to. Most of their menu is high calorie, which is probably why it tastes so good. The portions are so big that you eat a third of it, and you're pretty much done.   The staff is usually friendly and fast. But the last time we went, we got seated at a table with no silverware, and it took the waiter 10 minutes to introduce himself and ask us about drinks.  I would have understood if they were packed, except the restaurant was not even half full. Their namesake cheesecake, is pretty good.  It always comes with whipped cream on top and at the tip of the cake, it has a specific artificial, commercially made taste.  Through the years, I've tried their Red Velvet, Banana Cream, Key Lime, Tiramisu, Oreo cheesecakes.  My favorite is hands down the Red Velvet, hold the whip cream, of course. If you're on a diet then this place probably isnt for you, but the pastas are good hangover cures."
Lynsey T.,"Livermore, CA",236,133,28,4.0,1/5/2010,"This Cheesecake Factory is in a great location, right across the street from a movie theater, within walking distance of Walnut Creeks down town shopping destinations and another plus is that there is plenty of parking on the weekdays. Come the weekend though, don't count on finding a parking space right off the bat.  As you may have guessed by the parking on the weekends, or lack there of, this place is down right packed!  Even before you get through the front doors, one must step slowly and carefully through a sea of people. Upon crossing the threshold, you can hardly get through the lobby area, to the customer service desk, to procure one of those pager thingys just so you can wait 35 minutes for a table. *whew*   It is worth the wait though. Their food and table service have never disappointed me and seem to be consistent with every location I have visited.   Most recently, I visited their bar area for a coffee and the bar tender was such a great salesman that I ended up purchasing a slice of cheesecake to take home with me.  He didn't have to twist my arm to far though.  ;-p  and it didn't hurt that the coffee was superb. Recap: Give yourself time for parking if you want to go on the weekend or most nights of the week. While you're at it, give yourself some more time to wait for a table. Oh and one more thing... come with an empty tummy and try to leave room for desert.  ;-) or maybe just a coffee. Enjoy!"
Elly G.,"Walnut Creek, CA",3,338,30,4.0,7/17/2010,"We delayed our visit to Cheesecake Factory secondary to some of the negative reviews that we read at yelp. To our surprise, we actually liked it. The service was excellent and we were seated right away. The food was also good. We had the ribs and fish tacos. The servings are huge. I also like their idea of showing how much calories there are in each dish that they serve."
Logan P.,Bay Area,105,184,39,3.0,12/1/2010,Im not really a big fan of cheesecake factory and the only time i come out here are for special occasions. Like birthdays or family gathering and the food here is always the same. Good enough to eat and the service is always a little bit above average. I usually just order some drinks first to get me a little buzz that way the food taste a lot better. I always just get the philly cheese steak sandwich. Cant go wrong with a bunch of cheese on your shredded steak..
A C.,"Centralia, WA",1,110,17,4.0,11/30/2010,"Fabulous place, beautifully decorated, great food.  Awesome selection, the menu offers just about anything you'd want and more.  Can't wait to return!"
Gene R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",24,93,83,3.0,1/4/2010,"It's a chain.  They spend a fortune on decor.  They are well staffed and they seem to be trained well.  Food is good, portions used to be bigger before the recession.  The waits are long because people love it.  Key time to go:  2PM to 3PM.  You should be able to walk into this location and get a seat.  All other times you will wait.  Be prepared.   Don't complain about this in your reviews.   Food is good, drinks are good, the experience is highlhy ""canned"".  It's corporate.  It's like a Disney experience.   Go to Barnes and Nobble down the street, read a book, magazine whatever.  Come back 10 minutes before they told you to be back and let them know you were gone, and that you want to check on your status.   The friendlieness is canned, trained and staged.  That's better than nothing.  For me I prefer a more local place, but this day and age, that's difficult sometimes.  I am a health and exercise advocate, so the good thing about chains, is by law they have to give you a sodium and calorie count.  This actually is a plus for the chains in my book.  (A salad with the wrong toppings is crazy isn't it?)  You can have a very good dining experience here.  There are some very skilled waistaff working in the WC location.  It's not sincere, it's not local, but you could do worse.  The food selection is outrageous.  But then hasn't everyone been to one at least once?"
Laura D.,"Brentwood, CA",16,56,7,3.0,7/6/2010,"I sip my cocktail, I hang with my girls, but I can't get past the fact that a restaurant with such exciting ambiance can't put together a meal worthy of four stars. If I'm going to use up my weekly calories (1028 calories for an artichoke?!), I had better feel like I've died and gone to heaven since I will be starving myself for a month straight. I'd recommend this place for drinks and apps, but I wouldn't come here for a full meal unless I was seriously pining for the Mad Hatter decorating skills of my beloved Vegas."
Rich D.,"Livermore, CA",0,14,,2.0,4/26/2013,"My guest ordered a Americano cheeseburger and wanted it cooked medium.  It took forever to arrive with the server checking three times and expressing wonderment on why we didn't get it.  When it did show up it was red, cooked rare at best.  When this was brought to the server's attention she blew it off with a tuff-luck attitude.  Very disappointing."
Adam C.,"Petaluma, CA",55,20,5,5.0,9/10/2010,"How can you NOT love this place? The prices are high, but for a substantial amount of food. And the Tiramisu Cheesecake is amazing."
