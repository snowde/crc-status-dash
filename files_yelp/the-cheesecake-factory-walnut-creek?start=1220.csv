Sean M.,"San Francisco, CA",81,477,8,2.0,10/19/2009,"We came back here because my daughter chose it. The portions of food are huge and nobody ever finishes the meal and that is before the cheescake which is okay, not great. I guess 150 bucks before tip is okay for 6 people, but we weren't having steak, we had a hamburger, fish and chips, enchiladas, one petite steak and two salads for the 6 of us. I've eaten at a Cheescake 3 times and each time felt too full and not impressed with the food and the wallet is always pretty empty as well. I would have spent the same amount at a couple of good Italian places close by and enjoyed it much more."
Erick C.,"Brentwood, CA",17,3,1,3.0,8/14/2010,As usual food was good. Nothing extra ordinary. Just seems to be more ambience than substance. Not the place to be if your on a diet.
Alan J.,"Oakley, CA",14,388,3,4.0,5/9/2012,"Let me get this out of the way so y'all understand here. I LOVE CHEESECAKE, Chocolate or actually anything sweet and filled with a million calories!!! There I've said it so me going to and reviewing a place with Cheesecake in its name is probably not fair. Anyway we went there Sunday and because of the reviews expected terrible service mediocre food and sky high prices. We were pleasantly surprised. The food was very good the prices not too bad considering this place looks like some sort of palace from days of yesteryear. Oh hell did i mention the service was top notch? Wow I'm not sure but I think these people must have gone to a different restaurant or maybe the expectations were too high and mine too low? Anyway the ONLY problem is parking. You could easily drive around till a week after your dead, literally 17 floors of parked cars no pacesetter to valet even if it costs 7 bucks. Overall an excellent place for a meal."
Stephen H.,"Berkeley, CA",166,433,58,3.0,9/2/2009,"Nice & airy high ceilings.  Standard cheesecake factory portions so there is always leftovers.  Try the new red velvet cheesecake, its got twice the calories as the others but it is moist and irresistible!"
Lois R.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,106,1,3.0,1/13/2010,"The outside patio is charming, and the service is great. I ordered the Cajun chicken bites which came with a side of vegetables & mashed potatoes. Scrumptious! I also dig their hummus, super bomb. . But honestly, I love the SF location; I work in Walnut creek, there's only so much I can take from the people here."
M F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",6,140,3,4.0,3/17/2010,"Review #205. Of course this was not my first time here, but last Wednesday friend Barbara and I headed to Flemings (see my review) only to find the bar packed. Walked over to the factory, waited for 15 minutes and was seated. There have been nights you can't get a seat and other nights you can just walk right in. This was in between. Ryan was our waiter: charming, tall, friendly, helpful but not intrusive. He suggested a Pinot Noir and was right on. I ordered two. I love their hamburgers with the sourdough bun, their martinis are huge so I only ""need"" one. No matter what, the ambience always creates a festive feeling."
redtulip s.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,96,24,2.0,8/4/2009,"On Monday evening, waited 20 minutes just to order and 1 hr to get our food. Food was just OK, too salty. Next time will go somewhere else."
Steve U.,"San Antonio, TX",10,68,1,4.0,4/22/2010,"The food and of course, cheesecake was awesome! The red velvet is the best of all time! Definately hall of fame material! Although, one of my family members got sick after eating one of their appetizers, overall it was  a great experience."
Lee D.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,11,7,2.0,7/21/2009,"We had an early dinner at the Cheesecake Factory last night. Usually, customer service is pretty good, but now that they have settled in, they have completely taken their eye off of the ball when it comes to service. Our greeting was a guy on the computer who conducted the entire seating conversation without ever once looking up or smiling. Once seated, didn't see a wait person for almost 20 minutes. After we received our appetizer, no one brought us napkins or silverware until the appetizer was cold. My husband and I got our dinners about 10 minutes before my 8 year old son got his chicken strips....very long time for an 8 year old.  It wasn't very busy and we could see several wait people just standing around talking....They really need to spend some time in customer service training. My pasta was good but that's about it."
Lindsay L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",89,125,,1.0,4/20/2009,2.5 hours waiting to get seated + 2.5 hours spent at our table wondering where our waiter could possibly have kept disappearing = 5 hours wasted at the worst Cheesecake Factory EVER.
concord l.,"Concord, CA",0,13,,2.0,1/10/2011,"It was a weeknight so we didn't expect to wait too long even though we had a party of eight. Starts with 45min wait, which we were okay with. After 45min I checked and the hostess said they would have us seated in the next 15 minutes. We kept checking and still no seats?? Meanwhile we see all these people come through and get seats. Couldn't they put a couple of tables together or something to accommodate us? After 1 1/2 hours we decided we couldn't wait any longer and let the hostess know we would be leaving. Low and behold our table is suddenly ready. Okay, no problem we are happy to be finally seated. I talked to the hostess and simply asked to notify the manager of our situation and how easily pleased we would be if he/she acknowledged the problem.  But a manger never came by to acknowledge or check on us. The server was good, the food was wasn't bad, That's the best I can say. Way over priced for just plain tasteless food. We did end up ordering a couple of deserts, one was cheesecake which was very good! Would I go back? Ah...maybe.. ..for a drink and cheesecake in the bar area, but not for dinner. A good lesson for the Cheesecake Factory to learn......... Managers should manage."
J W.,"Concord, CA",0,4,,4.0,1/4/2011,"I just love this place..From the wide variety of menu items, excellent food (did I say cheesecakes and carrot cake), and great service I will definitely go back. The only con is that they dont take reservations and the wait time is usually long...but if you dont mind waiting its well worth it."
Regina S.,"Pittsburg, CA",28,128,11,3.0,2/5/2010,"Been to this location 4 times  its near the broadway shopping center. The food is ok nothing great i've only had their cheesecake once and it was good, im not really a cheesecake fan lol but i do love their BBQ salmon :P sooo tasty and i love their outdoor seating with the fire pit or whatever you call it lol, but one thing that sucks is that they don take resevations... prices are affordable for good portion size food and they give bread and butter while you wait for your food, nice decor, i would say its good for birthday parties but agian they dont take reservations so you'll have to wait for a large party but all in all this place is ok!"
sonya h.,"San Jose, CA",123,599,48,3.0,7/1/2009,"food was mehhh--your typical stuff...whatever i got was too greasy--couldnt finish even half of the lunch portion...the free bread was the highlight of my meal. friends shared a slice of the anniversary cheesecake...they said it was heavenly...i was good, i stayed away from it...even though it smelled and looked super delish. service was too good that it  got annoying...every other minute, we had someone come ask if everything was ok.... yes, yes, yes, yes, yes... i just want to eat ---leave me alone ( i hate when they ask as i am chewing--i force myself swallow half chewed food just so I can answer)...total over kill"
tonya m.,"Contra Costa, CA",0,151,,4.0,3/2/2012,"We walked in on a sunday afternoon, the place was packed.  They said 20 minutes for first available, it was 5 minutes.  Got a nice table outside.  The service was excellent.  The food came out with good timing.  Everyone loved their food.  I have been many times in SF.  But my husband and kids had never been.  They were hooked.  This is a nice special occassion restaurant, or a big treat."
Mina D.,"San Francisco, CA",21,48,3,1.0,4/17/2011,"I have never been this disappointed with my experience at Cheescake Factory. First off, I stood in front of the hostesses and not one acknowledged my presence until they were done chit chatting. Second, the waiter we had was plain and simply discourteous and payed more attention to the other tables he had. (maybe cuz we were the only non-white table there?) Third, He never refilled our drinks. Fourth (oh I'm losing count) my niece ordered a lunch special with a Cesar salad, they brought her a garden salad. We asked them to exchange it for what she ordered, that  took him about 15 minutes to bring a new one. By that time my niece was already finished with the rest of her meal so we asked him to box it up. We waited a total of 40 minutes for the boxed food and bill . To top everything off nicely, When we got home and opened the box, we realized he packed someone else's half eaten salad!!!!!!!!! I'm sorry but I would never let my niece eat a stranger's left over food.  This is ridiculous and unsanitary!!!! Our total time spent here was 2 hours. I'm never returning again and I'm going to be sure to tell everyone I know!"
Pam K.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,19,3,1.0,9/13/2013,"I have to say that I am disappointed to have to write this review about terrible service I received while at this Cheesecake Factory recently.   I was in the bar area with 4 friends.  We all ordered various Martini drinks.  The bartender, Kirsten, told us they were short on Martini glasses and asked if the drinks were okay being served in wine glasses.  We preferred to wait a bit for the correct glasses and we got the eye roll.  As the glasses came out of the dishwasher they weren't given to us as a group but one here and one there over a period of about 10-15 minutes.  Would have been better to handle one party and then the next.  When I said thank you when she did happen to get us one, there was no comment or eye contact just very rude behavior.  When you are in customer service, there is NO excuse for eye rolls, or any kind of behavior that is short of courteous and polite.  It was a complete turn off especially when you are paying well over $10 per drink.  There are plenty of places to go that are thankful for your business."
Trina M.,"San Francisco, CA",2066,139,456,5.0,1/28/2009,OMG !! They're opening a Cheesecake Factory in Downtown Walnutcreek near my work !!!! SoOoo excited !!! can't wait !! ahaha i'm totally gonna be here every time on my lunch lol who wanna join me? =D
Mina S.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",337,54,,3.0,3/29/2009,"The architecture is indeed splendid. The fireplaces placed strategically near the front entrance pave way to clean lines and high ceilings once inside. During lunch time, the sunlight fills the restaurant, and it really is pleasant to dine there. The music volume is at a tolerable level, whilst the human traffic kicks it up just a tad more. Both times I've frequented, the service has been friendly and prompt. I suggest dining at the bar, if applicable. The round tables in the center are also free for all- so much more convenient and quicker than waiting for a table."
Missy B.,"Danville, CA",0,17,1,5.0,8/21/2010,The space is fantastic !  This was a great use of the old Andronico's supermarket - - plenty of free parking too!  And of course the food is great - biggest menu in the worlld which is important for those of us with food issues (vegitarian)  --- love it when I pick up a menu and can't decide what to get and its all good!
