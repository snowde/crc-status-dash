Elizabeth R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",31,45,28,5.0,12/21/2009,"I've been here a few times now.  Anything with cream sauce is yummy and the BBQ pizza with salad lunch was really good.  Every drink I've had has been so good.  Most of all, LOVE the decor!!  Just look around at all of the glass, SOOO beautiful.  I wish I could buy some of it for my home.  The service has always been good.  They keep my iced tea full...  Did I mention the ice tea?  Get the tropical tea, they gave me some on accident, SO good."
S B.,"Reno, NV",7,46,1,4.0,8/7/2009,"We went for an early dinner (around 4:30 ish) knowing that it could get packed at dinner time. The food was good, our waitress very pleasant and the cheesecake of course was delicious and there were so many varieties."
Michael C.,"San Jose, CA",23,41,17,1.0,4/19/2009,"We came here for lunch and had a terrible experience and here is why: We had terrible service.  I have been to many Cheesecake Factories and I have never had such a poor experience dining at a Cheesecake Fact.  Our waiter never brought us our bread.    Instead, they brought out a second green tea when I had about 3/4 of my first drink still in the glass.  But our bread never came to our table until I asked for it upon arrival of our entrees, which took about 25 minutes on a Tuesday afternoon.   The waiter also forgot to bring out the dressing for my salad.  I actually had to wave down another wait staff to come by our table and get us my dressing.  This is something that I shouldn't have to ask for in the first place especially since salad dressing is an integral component of a salad.  Conclusion- Poor service has left me with a ppor impression of the waitsaff here at the Walnut Creek establishment.  I will not be rushing back to this place anytime soon."
Kevin L.,"Berkeley, CA",1,68,,2.0,3/24/2009,"Wonderful decor and the servers were very friendly. but now onto the bad  1. waited FOREVER. It was lunch on a weekday and we had to wait 30 mins after they told us that it would take only 15 mins  2. After we were seated, it took another 15 mins to get our server to come and another 20 mins for the drinks  to arrive...UGH...I was so thirsty that I was ready to go out and get a bottle of water  3. More waiting time for the bread. ( I really dont know why it takes so long to get those things. They weren't even that busy)  4. Finally the food came, but guess what? they messed up our orders...forgot to put the seafood in the pasta, portion sizes were switched.....and the pasta was wayyyy to dry.  5. now we waited another 20 mins for th cheesecake....i really dont know why it took so long. food was just average like any other cheesecake factory.  but the staff are nice..they are just slow"
marie c.,"Fairfield, CA",0,29,36,5.0,12/16/2010,"i love how their cheesecakes are super sugary, creamy, and full of delicious! the inside of the restaurant is kinda dim, but nice. the tomato, basil, and cheese pizza is pretty good with and without ranch. but i usually just go for the cheesecakes."
Leah B.,"Concord, CA",1,3,,2.0,2/24/2011,"Terrible service! We ordered a pasta dish  with ""no mushrooms"" it came back to us with mushrooms, so I politely told the waitress it had mushrooms and sent it back(as they were sautéed with lots of flavor that I don't like). When she returned it I specifically asked if they just scraped the mushrooms out and she said no. I tasted it and sure enough it was still full of the flavor, I pushed around the pasta to find a couple mushrooms they left out! I let her know that they did in-fact scrape it out and pointed out the mushrooms. We were still fully charged for the dish. On top of that mess of a dish, we ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes. The potatoes had a 2 hard clumps about the 2-3 inches wide.  How do you send out mashed potatoes hard?! We had to break it up with the fork. Terrible food with bad management! Poor management, not looking for a free meal, but would expect them to correct their mistake not try to lie and scrape out items!!"
Heidi C.,"San Francisco, CA",28,10,,4.0,5/11/2012,"I love this place! Been here a few times, love the atmosphere, especially the outside seating area.  On our last visit, my whole family went for my baby sister's bday celebration.  There was, I think 16 or 17 of us, including kids, so my mom & sister were told to show up early to get our names in for our 7pm reservation.  They got there 2 hours before, my kids and I arrived a half hour after them, and everyone else slowly rolled in after us.  Despite the ridiculous 2 plus hour wait for a table, our server (I apologize, I forgot his name) was THE BEST SERVER EVER! I have never seen such perfect, easy service for a large party (like my family always is), but this guy seemed to do it with ease.  Not to mention he was fun and friendly! The food is always good and so is dessert...would have given 5 stars, but the wait for our table was a negative. :)"
Florence W.,"Fremont, CA",122,281,27,2.0,5/5/2009,"Worst Cheesecake Factory ever! Do you remember how I said the Chicken Bellagio I ordered at the Stoneridge location was dyed with food coloring and it was coming off? I really liked it otherwise, so I asked them to put the sauce on the side. They brought me two ramekins of sauce, a white sauce and a green ""pesto-like"" sauce. Although... it wasn't pesto. It was basically green oil with melted cheese on the bottom. The whole table wanted to puke! Needless to say, I only used the white sauce. My sister ordered the Pasta Da Vinci, which in my opinion, is probably what falling in love tastes like. It's probably healthier than my Chick Bell, or my other fave, Four Cheese Pasta. Joe Bro ordered a roast chicken that didn't look too great, and Will had a pulled pork sandwich, which he inhaled and said was good. Service was pretty bad--guy kept forgetting things and ignoring us. We basically summed it up as ""he really didn't want to be there"". I understand everyone has bad days, but please don't take it out on us!  Final Verdict: No more Chicken Bellagio for me! I'm only going to order the Pasta Da Vinci! Though I found a fave entree, it doesn't make up for the fact, that customer service was what our server lacked :("
Anne M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",9,37,,2.0,4/21/2010,"While I used to somewhat enjoy the Cheesecake factory, I really am no longer very fond of their food. The ingredients are just so so. Dishes are laden with calories. It's a very loud place too. Downtown Walnut Creek has so many much better places to offer at great prices.... Yet I understand if it's a good spot for large groups as there definitely is something to get for every taste."
Anahe C.,"Sacramento, CA",5,66,1,3.0,11/5/2009,"I know people go crazy for this place, but I am not a fan. The menu is TOO big, the dishes are overpriced for what they are, and the wait is always outrageous. There are a few dishes I am a fan of (some of the salads and pastas), and the bread that they serve before your meal is so good (especially the darker bread), but I'd rather go to a local place than spend the money here. We went recently for a friends birthday and the wait staff was very nice, kept asking her if she would like another drink, and they brought out some sort of free dessert and sang to her at the end of our meal. But again, we had to wait a long time, the drinks were overpriced, and I wouldn't say my food was anything special."
Janet B.,"Martinez, CA",112,42,,2.0,2/12/2010,"WOW this place has an amazing atmosphere....now lets talk about the food. There is certainly a lot to order...but have you noticed its so easy to make yourself...and so cheap!! For example the chciken alfredo pasta with the sundried tomatoes. $16??? Are they crazy. The food barely even has any flavor and is not worth it.  The cheesecake is pretty good i would give it four stars. If you can get in the door even, just order some cheesecake and maybe get a table if you can. Dont come here for food its a mistake and a waste of money. It is a beautiful building though. If your coming here for the atmosphere....go."
Heidi T.,"Sacramento, CA",1,25,,3.0,6/12/2010,"If you want to come here with a large party, expect to get there early and wait at least two hours. The wait for a few people isn't too bad, usually about ten minutes or so. There's always a lot of hype around these kind of chain restaurants, kind of like BJ's. It seems everyone is attracted to these places, but they're usually nothing more than ordinary.  I always split a meal with someone, not only because the portions are enough but because so many freakin calories in every dish. I wouldn't dare eat a whole cheesecake slice by myself. Having a few bites is really all that's need to fix a craving because they are really rich. The classic strawberry cheesecake is always a favorite.  This location is perfect in downtown Walnut Creek. You don't have to walk more than a block or two from the parking garages which is nice. This wouldn't be a first choice of restaurant just because downtown has such a variety of different foods, but I'd come back here again, very occasionally though."
Alex H.,"Pittsburg, CA",5,29,,5.0,6/10/2012,"I love the food and service everything was as good as it gets but the ""Red Velvet Cheesecake""was the best I ever had I am hooked on it lol. I will be back soon."
scott p.,"San Diego, CA",199,858,80,2.0,5/9/2009,"Well I've seen more then one Cheesecake Factories in my day:  The one in Macy's in Union Square in SF, the one in Fashion Valley in San Diego.  I have to say, when they designed this one they really pulled out all the crazy stops- the interior would not look out of place in Las Vegas, so ridiculously rococo is the design.  As for the food?  It's Cheesecake factory, bro.  Cheesecake factory.  Certainly they are not hurting for business."
Dorothy M.,"Lafayette, CA",70,149,13,4.0,11/6/2009,I have been to four of their locations around the bay area. The Walnut Creek one is my favorite! The food is usually very tasty & full of calories. =/ The dishes are well priced for the large portions. I always have left overs! The service is usually slow because they are always so busy.
Jennifer L.,"Chicago, IL",8,13,,3.0,5/3/2009,"The wait is always ridiculous and the food is mediocre at best.  Not a big fan, but I'd go here or order from here if I was starving."
Pouria Y.,"San Francisco, CA",22,199,10,2.0,2/25/2009,"here's my quick review: Service ""We're sorry.""  Service.  ""We're sorry.""  Service.  ""We're sorry."" These were notes from my Iphone...a little live yelp if you will: Haven't eaten here before and everyone is warning me about the size of the meal. I am already nervous about picking something here to eat.   The restaurant feels very much like vegas, complete with the gold bathed fixtures. Our waiter was nervous and new and used lots of hand gestures. It doesn't seem like he's worked in a restaurant before. I have.  We might start a tally of how many mistakes are made. Our waiter is apparently not our waiter, the old switcheroo.  The menu is super expansive, so much so they brought two menus.  They use their names way too much.  They definitely don't know how to wield their trays yet either. I ordered the cold apple cider, the server brought me my drink and said here's your apple juice.  Sure enough, apple juice. So I tell the waiter hey this is just apple juice, he apologizes, comes back and says apparently cold apple cider is apple juice. The waiter came back just now, couldn't read his handwriting, had to ask us what we ordered again. So we ordered  spinach and cheese dip and received the fried artichoke. The waiter, after bringing our 2nd bread basket, at least noticed it was wrong. So apparently it was the waiters fault. We found out because he told us. Rookie waiter mistake, never admit your fault. Patrons don't like honesty.  A manager came by to sincerely apologize. So one of our entrees were ""stolen"" so we had the pleasure of having a second manager come and apologize.  Took forever to get the new one. So to tally, 4 servers, 2 managers and about a billion apologies with only one comp. End of Live Yelp Here. Food was okay, my companions were happy with it.  I'd go back once the restaurant has had some time to grow into it's britches.  Some of the decorations look like the eye of mordor.  I wasn't pissed about anything, it was just really poor service.  But this happens when these monolithic restaurants open and hire a whole bunch of people who have never served food before.   I'm sure it will become a culinary destination in the future for all the 40 something white people who enjoy watching Celebrity Dance Off and hearing jokes about wine.  But for this Persian boy, I'll only go if it's paid for, my arm is twisted, I am outnumbered, or my girl really wants to go."
Katie C.,"Sacramento, CA",18,24,3,1.0,3/16/2009,"I'll start off on a positive note: Great job with this new location. Beautiful decor, outdoor seating and fixed the issue with the adjoining parking garage.  Here is the negative.  It's a rare occasion for me to take the time to comment on service I've received but my experience last week at CF has left me appalled and shocked for the time wasted. I've never received such poor service from any restaurant or retail establishment. My first and most likely last experience on Wednesday afternoon for a lunch leaves me wondering how people can actually speak positively about this restaurant.  Went by Wednesday to grab lunch and check out the new restaurant. Waited 30 minutes to be seated (actually told 20 minutes for the wait) which I thought was unusual for a Wednesday afternoon but was willing to wait anyways.  Seated at a great table on the patio along side the fire/water sculpture. We waited 20 minutes, after being seated, before being greeted by our server. In that time we watched 3 other tables who sat down after us order before us. Once our waitress came to us she said, ""Hi."" That was all she said; no other greeting, no apology for the wait but mostly no ""can I take your order?""  She clearly wasn't listening to our order because I had to repeat everything to her THREE TIMES before she had it all down correctly. Once she took down our order she preceded to walk away until we stopped her because she failed to take our drink orders. We waited an additional 15 minutes with no water or bread but noticed our neighbors had received theirs (clearly their waitress was more on top of it). After seeing that and realizing we had just given over an hour of our afternoon to CF without even getting a glass of water we just to decided to get up and leave.  For a large establishment such as CF, I thought they would have invested a gross amount of money on training and operations. In the opening months of a restaurant you would think they would be overstaffed to accommodate the learning curve and hoards of crowds. In an economy as poor as this; which is saturated with over qualified job seekers, I would have expected to receive much better service then what we received at CF the other day. The girl who attempted to serve us was clearly under qualified and unhappy with her job, unfortunately we had to be ones to point that out.  Such a shame since they did a great job re-oing the location."
Hank T.,"Walnut Creek, CA",5,11,8,1.0,7/19/2010,"Went there the other night with my family. Of course a long wait and to add insult to injury the food was terrible. My son got the fish tacos...i took one bite and it tasted so bad. Not fresh and god knows how long it was frozen. My wife ordered a hamburger...how does the saying go...""wheres the beef?"" the worst burger i have every had. Not planning on going back and certainly not worth the wait. seriously dissapointed."
San F.,"Dublin, CA",0,13,,5.0,7/18/2012,Very classy place with many rich and beautiful women. Fancy restaurant. Hot waiters. And I love cheesecake. The bias is strong in this one.
