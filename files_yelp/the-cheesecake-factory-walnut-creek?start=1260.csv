Lora C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",9,147,5,3.0,3/18/2009,"It is the Cheesecake Factory so the food is exactly the same as at all Cheesecakes. Huge portions, lots of selection, etc. We went on a Tuesday night at 5pm to avoid the crowds and we still had to sit outside, which was fine. Our waiter was very nice, thankfully, because he was clueless at best. If he'd had attitude, I would have reamed him and the experience. He took my order twice, he said he'd bring water and never did, he walked away from our table in the middle of us ordering without saying anything to us because he realized one of his other tables had received the wrong food, he didn't bring my husband's second drink, (which was a bottle of beer), until after we had ordered dessert, but he was FUNNY, so I forgave him."
Minority Critic C.,"Concord, CA",3,42,2,4.0,6/20/2009,"My wife and I are great cooks and this place blew us away! Amazing! Cheesecake lasted us 2 days, we couldn't finish it. My only complaint? They stiffed us on the bread, they didn't bring us any, we didn't realize it until later, it wasn't a big deal but after walking through the restaurant and seeing bread at every table....? Hmmm. Where's our bread dammit? Lol"
Jess C.,"San Francisco, CA",279,429,22,5.0,2/22/2009,"I have waited so long for a Cheesecake Factory to open in Walnut Creek and it's here... it's finally here!  Official opening day was Thursday but I decided to forgo the crowd the day of.  Instead, I attempted to go for a late lunch on Saturday without a wait.  What was I thinking?  Even at 2:45pm, there was a 30 minute wait.  Completely expected though.   Anyway, we went for lunch and ordered: -Ahi tuna tartare small plate -Pasta Da Vinci lunch portion, penne pasta replaced with spaghetti noodle with extra garlic -Fun burger The tuna tartare is excellent!  I would order two!  It is tartare over a bed of avocados with four crisps on the side.  The pasta da vinci is also highly recommended.  In fact, a woman sitting right next to me asked me what I ordered and ordered it the exact same way.  She loved it. Pasta Da Vinci is a pasta with chicken and mushrooms in a madeira wine sauce. So yum. Fun burger is an extremely large burger.  I can only imagine how many calories are in that thing.  It's a triple bun burger with two patties, swiss and cheddar cheese, and all the trimmings.  I had a bite.  It was pretty good.  We passed on the cheesecake because we were stuffed!   The service we received from everyone from the hostess' to our waitress to the busboys was phenomenal.  They were frequently checking on everyone despite the craziness of the opening.  I was impressed.  Lunch total for two - $40 including gratuity.   I will be back, a lot.  I think you'll have to pry me away from this place."
Julie K.,"Walnut Creek, CA",6,130,188,1.0,3/2/2009,"We will NEVER eat here again.We ordered to-go. Phoned in our order and was told it'll take 30 minutes. When we got to the 4 parking spaces reserved for the on the go, we got the last spot. The other 3 cars had no one waiting for their food. My husband called to tell them we were here, they transferred him to several different departments. In frustration, he decided to go in to pick it up. Of course then the waitress shows up with the food while my husband went inside. He was sent to 4 different places to pick up the order. Geez.... Do I need to go on? When we got home, we realized that some of our food was missing. It was the worst $50 spent. Don't eat here."
melissa a.,"Concord, CA",6,15,1,4.0,10/28/2011,"I love coming here. They have huge portions, it's  nice because  then you can share it with somebody else and they can share their dish with you. Surprisingly their steak wasn't bad either. Loved their stuff mushroom appetizers. This I can finish by myself, so I don't share this with anyone. The service here I thought was pretty pleasant. and  friendly,  And Ohh my gosh... the red velvet cheesecake is delicious.You have to try this flavor. It's to die for!!  We'll definitely be coming back."

East Bay P.,"Oakland, CA",0,40,,1.0,11/11/2010,"Rude maitre d'!  Rude waiter.  Terrible service.  The maitre d' called us to the podium, told us to step to the side and then left us there for five minutes.  When my husband said, ""Excuse me..."", she cut him off with, ""Can you NOT see that I'm busy?  I will get to YOU when I CAN!""  When we were finally seated, the waiter acted like we were the most difficult people he had ever encountered.  We were polite, well-behaved, didn't ask questions about the menu; in fact, the only special request we made was for a booster seat for our youngest child.  To top it all off, the waiter LOST MY CREDIT CARD!!!  When it was located, there was no apology or responsibility taken.  Unbelievable!  For the price, the service should be topnotch.  In reality, the service was disgusting.  Won't ever return."
Harle Q.,"San Francisco, CA",1,10,,4.0,7/21/2010,Great place to hang out with friends... good food and service.
Daniel A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",85,36,1,4.0,2/22/2012,"Ok first of all this is the cheesecake factory so nothing uniquely amazing. HUGE menu between affordable to filet mignon and even a big selection of healthy or skinny items that are pretty good. Honestly I only like the walnut creek location. It's big, over the top decor with giant ceilings that create a nice classy almost Vegas feel to it and the service is usually good."
Fey S.,"San Pablo, CA",112,4,,1.0,11/4/2010,"Never in my life would I go to a Cheesecake Factory again.  I encountered the worst customer service ever from an employee name ""Mike.""  He by passed me the first time I entered the place and help this couple behind me first.  When he got to me he asked for my name and the amount of people in my party. He said he had to ask his manager if they had room to sit seven people.  I said please do so because it's my sister's birthday.  And it has always been our tradition to go have dinner for our birthdays at the Cheesecake Factories. He asked us to wait at the side where the benches were and we did.  An hour passed with us sitting there seeing and hearing the waitresses calling three parties and never my name.  I walked to ""Mike"" and asked him why  he called three names when they were after me and with parties of six and seven? He lied and said he tried calling me three times and I didn't replied.  I said excuse me?  That's not true. You asked me to wait at the bench to be called and I did just that, waiting for an hour.  I saw and heard your waitresses called three names and not once mine.  I asked to talk to his manager and he seated us after ten minutes but no apology.  What a disgraced representing Cheesecake."
Dale S.,"Antioch, CA",1,3,2,4.0,5/8/2010,"Every time I've eaten here, the food has been great. Prices are high. Employee are nice. I want to go here more often, but the wallet could not keep up. Just special occations for my family."
Marcia S.,"Moraga, CA",0,33,,1.0,2/21/2011,"Inconsistent and nothing special. Went for dinner around 7pm on a Thursday night and ordered the meat loaf, chicken madeira and spinach, mushroom, cheese and bacon omelette.  We waited about 40min for our food and during that time, never saw our server or offered soda or tea refills.  The explanation when our food finally arrived was that they had burned the english muffin.  Hmmmm.  This is the 4th time we've been to this location and have tried something different each time.  Who cares that the portions are huge when the food is not very good and you don't really want to finish it."
john s.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,,3.0,4/27/2010,"I went there about six times since it opened it up.  food ... good service ...forget about it, make it self service  the quality of food has been declining slowly, not as good as it used to be on its opening day."
Ted G.,"Lafayette, CA",0,18,,2.0,4/25/2012,"Went there for lunch today.  The place was half empty and they made us wait 15 minutes for a table.  It took FOREVER to get our food.  Our server actually went on a break during our lunch, that's how slow they are.  The music was very loud and it was hard to have a conversation.  Will never go back to this place - ever!"
P B.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,2.0,4/22/2012,"Food was good, service not so much so.  So we went there with a large party, saw our waitress maybe 4-5 times the entire time, I had a hard time trying to figure out what she was doing during the off time. I'm a bit of an ass, I like having my drink refilled.. without me asking for it. Hell, I expect it from any good waitress or waiter. If I have to sit around and stare at my empty glass for a couple of minutes, let alone the 5-10 minute disappearances she had, I get a tad grouchy. That's what they were doing, I spent a good 15 minutes at some points waiting for our waitress to get in my line of sight, and I could see the entire restaurant from where I was sitting and I didn't see her almost at all. Some of the food came out wrong, horrible service. The food was okay, but not like mind blowing good. The price was absurd for the quality of the food. At least the cheesecake was some good stuff. tl;dr: Service terrible, food okay, price WAY too high, cheesecake good."
Michael M.,"San Francisco, CA",7,57,,4.0,9/17/2009,"Oh, how excited I was to find out just prior to moving to Walnut Creek that there was a Cheesecake Factory downtown. We came in for dinner a day or two after moving in and got seated right away at the outside tables. I don't know what the wait time for a table inside was, but I'm sure it was insane (as always). Thankfully, the weather here makes it perfectly ok to sit outside. My boyfriend had white chicken chili and thought it was quite good. I had my usual spicy chicken sandwich, which was the same as it always was: tasty and big. We both saved about half for leftovers (especially after taking a look at the nutritional guide).  We split a piece of the special white chocolate blueberry cheesecake and it was delicious (of course).  The food itself is nothing amazing, but this place is fun, the cheesecake is great, and the service is attentive. Entrees are reasonably priced, but once you add in cheesecake and drinks, the bill can definitely be a bit hefty. I'm scared of its location right next to the movie theater. I fear I'm going to want to stop by for lunch every time we catch a movie."
Lori F.,"Benicia, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/20/2010,"The atmosphere is nice, but that's where it ends. The menu is way overpriced for the quality of food received. I've eaten at several locations and never been impressed. I've always had sticker shock and buyers remorse after dining here.  Last but not least, the service is always terrible. Thus restaurant is consistently bad, overpriced with poor service at locations from coast to coast."
Dan R.,"Concord, CA",0,6,,2.0,1/30/2011,"I highly recommend the cheesecake, but.  get it to go We waited half an hour to be seated, which, for a great restaurant is not a long time to wait.  This is not a great restaurant.  All the ambiance is lost in the noise and shuffle, and the entrees are average.  SFO has less hustle and bustle.  We paid more than seventy dollars (plus tip) for a meal for three, consisting of a cuban sandwich and fries, a pasta dish, and a tostada salad (a la chilis, chevys, appleby's etc). Throw in three sodas, the crab cake appetizer and one piece of cheesecake.  We waited thirty minutes for mediocre food in an overcrowded restaurant, and then paid a ridiculous price for it.  Next time around I'll eat elsewhere, and maybe stop in for a late dessert after a show..."
Alissa L.,"New York, NY",391,5,,5.0,1/24/2010,"LOVE this place! The outdoor seating is great, the design is gorgeous.  Every time I go I feel like I walked into a grand restaurant in Vegas.  The service is fast, waiters are courteous, food is great.  Also, when waiting for a table, you can sit in the front by the fire and have drinks.  This makes the wait for a table go by fast."
Frank J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/10/2011,"I had to wait for more than an hour just to get seated.  After I got a transponder, I had to wait and when it  vibrated, I was told to wait even more.  I saw people who got seated even though they came after me.  After I got seated, the waiter was courteous and got the food within 15 to 20 minutes.  However, the food was just ok not great.  There was a lot of noise and I got tired of waiting so long just to get a table.  I am not coming back again with my family.  If you like to get great service and not to wait too long to get your food and beverages, go somewhre else.  There are a lot of good restaurants to choose in downtown WC and the cities nearby."
