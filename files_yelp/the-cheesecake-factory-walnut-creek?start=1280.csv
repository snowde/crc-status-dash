Corissa S.,"Oakland, CA",156,43,1,3.0,2/28/2009,"Wow, just what Walnut Creek needs, another trendy chain restaurant. My friends and I thought we would be safe going on a Friday afternoon. Boy were we wrong! The hostess told us it was a 30 minute wait (liar!) and so we decided to stick it out. Off to find the restrooms. This place is enormous, so we were thinking the restrooms would equal the population. Nope. Three stalls for a super huge restaurant, and one wasn't working. I can't repeat most of the comments I heard waiting in that line. Finally, over an hour later, our pager went off and we were seated. From here, we actually had a good time. Our server Brian, was very friendly and didn't mind our attempts at joking with him. He was efficient and funny, always a good combination. You get what you deserve when you decide to go Cheesecake, $10 drinks, $10 apps, and $20 meals. It is a very expensive after work stop. The food is the same at every one, so no need to explain it.  When we left, the wait was over two hours, and there were still 50-60 people totally willing to wait, with their screaming children. More power to them! I think once was quite enough for me. I can now say I have eaten at the former Andronico's restaurant, and feel happy and accomplished, if not with a small feeling of being ripped off for overpriced food and drinks. Oh, well, at least there was good conversation."
Cristelle J.,"San Francisco, CA",173,226,20,3.0,2/25/2009,"You know when you have this immediate feeling that you just hate someone (i.e Michael and Toby from the Office), well that was my feeling toward our waitress. I know she was probably new and this being her first waitress job she was unexperienced, but her she took the job and she better do it well.  First she took our drinks and  the boyfriend and all I ordered for an appetizer was Calamari cause I love me some calamari. Then we waited...and waited. It's understandable if she had to jump in the Pacific Ocean and kill the giant squid and all of it's babies and bring it back to Walnut Creek to batter, fry and over season it to my liking. If that had happened I wouldn't complain. It took FOREVER to get my stinkin appetizer and worse of all SHE DIDN'T BRING US BREAD! I love carbo-loading! We had to ask this other waiter for bread and he couldn't even get the job done bringing us cold bread, how dare he!  By the time our calamari came out I was sooo hungry! When the server had brought it to me, it didn't look appetizing. The calamari was like fried in bundles so when you tore it apart there was still gooey batter intertwined. It did NOT look yummy. There were also many times were several waiters came to our table and brought us food we didn't order and on one occasion that happened one waitress muttered ""I swear this table ordered these"" , really don't be talking shit on your new job! For my entree I ordered the crispy chicken costoletta and the boyfriend ordered the fried chicken littles, he really liked what he got, me not so much it was bland the sauce on the bottom was cold I ate 3 bites and I was done boxed it up and brought it home.  This place is new and I hope they work out the little kinks, cause it would be great place to eat at."
kristie s.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,14,,2.0,12/26/2010,"have gone about 4 times.  Food is just OK, service is so-so.  Place is simply way overrated and wait time is atrocious so I don't end up going much.  Unimpressed."
Dustin L.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",8,2,,4.0,12/19/2011,"I always have a great time at this Cheesecake Factory. The staff have always been friendly, the food usually great, and the cheesecake... fantastic. Only issue I have are wait times, but that's what you expect at a busy restaurant."
Tomasita P.,"Oakland, CA",61,1,,4.0,11/30/2011,"so yesterday was my dad's birthday and we decided to try something new... we waited for 20 minutes and i told my family of 4 it was my second time i ate here and it was gonna be worth waiting for... the people were really nice... love their attitude.. i loved the dim lights and how the place looks.. i took my 2month old daughter which she slept throughout the whole evening and was not disturbed.. as an appetizer we tried the salmon something and it was delicious... then food cam i ordered same as last time Cajun jambalaya pasta and i had the same experience which was great.. my parents and my brother not so great because they were unsatisfied with their food... either they weren't hungry or the food was not as good as they expected since i talked so much about this restaurant... they order steak ( i think was quite pricey for the size) this place in particular was not that busy and the employees were great. My overall was experience was good.. but my family says otherwise, thought was quite pricey for what they ordered, and my dad waited for his cheesecake which never came.. and we witnessed 2 other birthday tables.. so i ordered some to go.. 2 slices 15$.. food was okay but pricey :|"
Jeff O.,"Dublin, CA",13,136,13,3.0,2/28/2009,"If your looking for an extravegantly designed place to hang in for a while, the cheesecake factory is cool.  If your looking for reasonably priced drinks the cheesecake facotry is not cool.  The food isn't anything to get excited about.  The whole thing behind this place is that it looks cool.  Its more of a cool place to go and hang out in because it looks like it should be in a vegas casino or a resort or something.  Dont go to the Cheesecake factory expecting great food.  Or reasonably priced drinks for that matter, I can tell you that a draft beer and a mixed drink will make you part ways with your buddy Andrew Jackson.  But if your not concerned with that, check the Cheesecake factory out, it is impressive.  Overall, ""It's all show, no go."""
Bobby T.,"Pittsburg, CA",78,122,86,4.0,3/16/2009,"This place is brand new soo Im not going to review based on the service.. as they are still figuring stuff out even though our waiter was cool... great recommendations. Food was fast and good. The mac and cheese balls are divineeeeee! The Chicken Carbonara was hella good and I can't wait to finish my leftovers. The outside is super cute.. with heating lamps and waterfall fireplaces.  The desserts were great as usual. Now why is it that The Cheesecake Factory looks like a restaurant from Vegas? Love this place, great for gatherings.. Its a bit nosy and some of the patrons can't control thier unruly kids.. Luckily I can control my ghettoness, otherwise I would have gone off on them! :) totally four stars for cusine, 2 1/2 stars for atmosphere and 3 stars for customer service. Overall, a good dinner."
Ken S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,35,,2.0,7/29/2011,"Went to this place last night since we had a $50 gift card to use. It's an OK place and it seems to be very popular as it was 7:30Pm on a Thursday night and we had to wait for about 10 mins for a table for two. No biggie on the wait. Got a couple of drinks from the bar and sat in their outside waiting area. Got seated in the bar area, which was passable. The decor reminds me of some joint in Las Vegas with the ceiling trying to imitate an Italian palace. The music was too loud and when mixed with all of the noise from the people, it was very annoying - forget about having a conversation without yelling. The server(s) were prompt and brought water and bread right away. The menu is huge - too huge! We finally decided on a spicy ahi tuna roll (fried), steak Diane and a spicy chicken salad. The food was promptly served, but the server could not take our refill drink order and had to find our waiter. He finally showed up and took our order. I wanted a glass of red wine to go with the steak dish BEFORE I finished it. It took at least ten minutes to get two glasses of wine and I had to purposely not eat my dish while waiting for the wine. The steak dish was good with a mushroomy dark sauce, not too overly done (close though!) for being ordered med-rare and there were at least two cups of mashed potatoes piled high on the plate - I think they are proud of their mash potatoes! The chicken salad was good, too, but nothing remarkable. The ahi roll was acceptable, but a little over done. The spicy part of this dish was a mayo-based sauce that seemed to overwhelm the dish with gooeyness. Again, acceptable, but not remarkable. We got out of there for $80 (not counting the $15 for pre-dinner drinks) for one appetizer, two entrees and two glasses of wine with tip. We only had to cough up $30 of our own because of the gift card, so we got good value for our money. We are not fans, however, and will not be making a point of going back. It's too chaotic for us and the food isn't worth the annoyance. Maybe this place is more fit for a younger demographic than we represent."
John Z.,"Orinda, CA",10,99,12,5.0,3/12/2009,"This place is great. Don't know why the reviews are so low. Great cheesecake, cool decor, and great food."
Dave W.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",31,38,7,4.0,3/10/2009,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory in SF and I have always had a positive experience going to this chain restaurant.  It was very very busy inside for sure and there was a line to get in line to sit at a table.  The hostess said 30-45 minutes when we showed up for party of 2 at 6pm and they sat us in 20 minutes.  My wife loved the mojito and the server kept our glass of water full throughout dinner.  I had the grilled skirt steak, which was cooked just how I asked and my wife had the crispy chicken costoletta.  Both were good.  The servers were busy, but smiled the whole time he was severing our order."
abby l.,"Vallejo, CA",12,63,7,4.0,4/12/2009,"after reading all the bad reviews, i'm guessing we had a lucky day or something. we went for lunch on a saturday and service was not heinous. it was crackin (and freaken noisy inside) but we were seated right away. the whole place is beautiful, even the outside patio area, with a fireplace/waterfall that warms the outside space even if it's cold out.  anyway, yes service was very good! our waitress was polite and checked on us every so often and brought refills and dessert promptly. and the food is hella delightful and harmonious in flavors and shit...like my cousin's gumbo, my lemon-herb salmon, even my little cousin's cheese pizza was so good! the only thing that sucks is parking. i know they have valet, but knowing walnut creek it probably costs 20 dollars or something, so we just parked down the street at longs drugs and walked."
Sarah L.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",51,41,,4.0,4/3/2009,"I've been to a number of Cheesecake Factory locations.  I was very pleased to know there would be a location in Walnut Creek.  The wait was shorter than anticipated and we had great service.  The food is up to standard as all other locations.  I'd say the wait staff is young and inexperienced, however, over time I believe the service will improve as they gain experience.  I'd dine here again.  Be sure to arrive early to avoid a long wait."
Eric V.,"Walnut Creek, CA",23,168,63,3.0,3/25/2009,"Yup, it's just A-OK. When I think of Cheesecake Factory I think of Applebees, MiMi's Cafe, and Chili's. But on steroids! You pay more here and the food isn't to be more desired than the other chains. The menu is huge and will rage incisiveness on anyone. The atmosphere is over the top, It almost feels like Vegas inside. They have flame fountains out front! The food is OK to good.  I've sat at the tables twice as well as the bar. The staff almost has it down with a few hiccups here and there in the service and food prep.  All of the staff that has waited on me has been friendly and attentive. Don't wait an hour in line to eat here, walk to nearby restaurant that can seat you in less than 20 minutes."
Doug V.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,19,,2.0,3/9/2009,"The service here is beyond bizarre. Originally wife got table for two and then I strolled in unexpectedly a few minutes later so requested a table for 4. This was around 2pm and there were open tables right near us. So here I am standing next to the table for two, while different employees tell me no problem we'll get this fixed. Nothing gets done. I even pointed to the open table for four and one of the employees shakes his head that it's not possible. So another few minutes pass and I get to yet another employee who tells me, no problem, to take the open table for 4. Now as the meal progress there are at least 10 different employees interrupting my meal to inform me that they are here to help with anything etc. How many CC employees does it take to screw in a lightbulb? They have way too many incompetent employees here. Food is ok. Now I understand why Americans are so fat. Even the salads are fattening, and it tasted like it. And ads in the menu?! That's so tacky. I don't even think McDonald's does that."
Patrick M.,"Oakland, CA",35,8,,3.0,6/16/2009,Heaping amounts of good food. Ambiance noisy decor overly kitsch
Alicia M.,"Dublin, CA",78,32,8,1.0,10/3/2010,"Never again! I actually wanted to go to PF Chang's, but it wasn't MY birthday dinner. And it was walking distance from the bar we were headed to afterwards. For a party of 12 and an 18% gratuity added on, plus $11.50 for a drink, you think we would have gotten what we paid for. Sadly, no. Our waiter introduced himself and his co-server, who was at another table! He never came back to refill my soda. 3 of our party had time to leave money, go to make 3 stops, and come back while those of us who stayed waited for the check! I had to ask several times, and while we waited, both servers asked if we wanted to see a dessert menu - in hindsight, now I understand why. The most disappointing moment was when our server brought my friend his dessert - with no other servers to sing and it was after we had paid and were getting up to go!!! How busy can you be on a Weds night?!? It would have been so easy to dine-and-ditch; they wouldn't have even noticed."
carole a.,"Walnut Creek, CA",2,38,,4.0,8/20/2009,"My husband and I started going to the Cheesecake Factory in L.A. when our kids were both in college at UCLA and USC at the same time!!!  It's a place you go to when you're not in a hurry, but want to have fun with friends or family.  Don't go there during peak time if you need to have a serious conversation with someone, find a quiet slow paced place. We are drawn to this restaurant time and time again when we have no idea what we feel like eating.  Believe me you will not have a problem finding something that appeals to you.  We always either share appetizers or go the 9 yards and plan on taking some home for lunch the next day, or snacks later!   This is the best place to go for dessert if you are watching your diet.  No kidding.  They make the best low carb original cheesecake with strawberries.  It's indulgent and guiltless!  ha ha.  We order it sometimes and take two pieces home after a movie when we just want to honker down at home and have something special to look forward to after we settle in. I am always happy to see one when we're in Boca Raton or Palm Beach Garden in Florida and the ones in Scottsdale and Phoenix , Az. too, because we just get tired of all the rich food we wind up consuming 3 meals a day, living it up trying to find every 4 or 5 star restaurant on the planet!   Bottom line is that I never feel going to the Cheesecake Factory was a mistake.  We are always happy when the check comes and the boxes of leftovers come out.  It's like having your Cheesecake and eating it too!  tee, hee  I"
Paul A.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",3,12,4,1.0,8/13/2011,"Zero stars. Service was junk.  I've been here before and it was well worth the $100 tab for mac n cheese and huge salads and ridiculously over-portioned cheesecake, but tonight was ridiculous.  I shouldn't have to beg for service.  First time I have not left a tip."
Chris F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,8,,3.0,10/10/2009,"I'm going to assume that majority of the people have heard or know of ""The Cheesecake Factory,"" especially the one located in San Francisco. I would have to start off that they did a great job with the atmosphere and interior design; it definitely caught my attention. Now as for the food, that's an entire different story. Having been to the one in San Francisco, I thought to myself the dishes should taste practically very similar. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong. I ordered the ""Chicken Maderia"" which in my eyes, is the safest dish to order since it is definitely well known and highly recommended by others. When the food arrived to the table, it tasted so different that I felt as though I was eating another dish (if that was only the case). I am not stating that the dish wasn't appetizing but I am stating that it was not similar at all. In my honest opinion, if I'm going to spend roughly $20-$25 on a lunch meal (per person), I would definitely want to get what I ordered.  Another issue I had was with the waitress. Now, I can understand during busy hours that a server may have issues in providing the utmost service to their customers, but for my case, it wasn't even busy at all and yet we still received bad service. I had to fetch the waitress for refills and I had to remind the her multiple times about the bread which was not offered to us at all until way later in the meal when the main dishes were already out. After all this, the question is, will I ever come back? In all honesty, I would since it beats driving to San Francisco. I just hope that they will take a look into these matters if they haven't done so yet."
Right A.,"Del Mar, CA",0,65,,1.0,9/29/2011,"I usually like Cheesecake Factory since it pretty much offers such a wide variety that no matter what you are craving, you'll get it. But this location is horrible, their service is horrible. Granted we were part of a huge group, wait time was 1.5 hours. We figured we can just walk around while we waited. But closing in on the estimated wait time, they added another 45 mins. We left! Snobby hostesses, not good!"
