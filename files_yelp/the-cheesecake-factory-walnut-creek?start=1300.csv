jessie h.,"San Francisco, CA",3,52,1,4.0,6/12/2009,4 stars for their martini's.  they're wonderful. food is alright.  mostly stick to appetizers...just a little crowded for my taste.
Liz M.,"Lake Stevens, WA",2,15,,4.0,3/26/2009,My fiance and I LOVE this place. We go here once a month for our date night. I tried their margarita and it is strong but sooo good! The cheesecakes are really good also
Christina B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",48,9,4,4.0,1/21/2011,absolutely love their combo dish shrimp scampi and steak Diane. it's a pretty large plate so go hungry.
William L.,"Oakland, CA",2,31,,4.0,3/15/2009,"The food was good! A heads up, every night it's really hard to get good seats & service. I did have to wait so beware especially dinner time on any night. The food again gets all the stars!"
Laura P.,"Livermore, CA",0,9,,1.0,8/20/2011,"After reading a few reviews on here about Cheesecake Factory being overpriced, check your bill before paying it. We were there tonight, and the waiter added a beer to our bill that no one had ordered, and then he took the bill back to make an adjustment, he then deciced to add two glasses of wine to our bill that we never ordered..... So twice our bill had to get fixed, and the wait for the adjustment on the bill took longer than it should have.  I wont be coming back here anytime soon."
sharandeep g.,"Yuba City, CA",0,6,,5.0,7/31/2009,"The food is great, I really like the salads they offer.  The weight management spicy chicken salad is amazing!!!  And if your not counting calories then the santa fe chicken salad is also good. And this is the place you have to have dessert, I stick to the original cheesecake with fresh strawberries. They also have the best service that I have come across in a long time and thats why I give them 5 stars.  The general manager, Max, is a great guy we ordered something we didnt like and he offered us a new meal which we didn't want  so he took it off the menu.  He even took the time out to get to know us during lunch on a busy friday.  Very thoughtful guy!"
Sarah L.,"Lafayette, CA",160,1,,1.0,7/29/2011,"Honestly, giving 1 star is giving too many. Went to Cheesecake Factory last night with 2 of my girlfriends. Got seated within 10 minutes by a host who didn't seem to know the table numbers and ended up taking us on a tour of the restaurant before seating us. Once seated, we waited 15 minutes to be greeted by our server. I wish I remembered his name but unfortunately I don't. He was a tall guy with a shaved head, pretty bulky. Hopefully management will read this and know who it is. Anyways,  when he greeted us we ordered a bottle of prosecco (which he asked me 5 times what it was until I finally pointed to it on the menu), and appetizers. The next time was saw him was 5 minutes later when he dropped bread with no butter and 1 water at our table. WTF? We waited another 15 minutes for our wine to be brought to the table (which arrived after our APPETIZER!!). Additionally, he brought regular wine glasses instead of champagne flutes to the table. Is this guy an idiot or is it just his first day? Regardless, he shouldn't be allowed to serve people when he has no knowledge of anything. He FINALLY took our entree order and then  proceeded to not return to the table until 15 minutes after we had finished our entrees and were waiting for the check. Now mind you, some of this could be understandable if he had a huge section of tables but in reality, this guy had 2 other tables besides ours and that's it. As a waitress myself, I give no excuse for such bad service. When he finally reappeared, my friend asked for the check, a request which he ignored until I finally had to yell at him to grab it. Just terrible overall.  DON'T go here."
Buck E.,"San Francisco, CA",1,20,2,3.0,4/14/2009,Have been back to CF a couple of times now.  The service seems to have improved.  Food quality is consistently good!
Missjmu U.,"Vallejo, CA",26,3,,5.0,7/8/2011,"My mom, gradmom, and I love this place to death. You can't get better service anywhere else. We LOVE It"
Patrick N.,"Concord, CA",0,9,,2.0,8/19/2009,"Overpriced for what amounts to dolled up franchise food.  I realize that they opened recently, which is why they don't get one star.  We ordered a fish dish which, once put on the table, filled the vicinity with the stench of rancid fish.  I'm not saying the fish didn't smell as fresh as it should have, I am saying it was ""left out in the sun for two days""  RANCID!!!  We called the waiter over and pointed it out.  He remarked that he could also smell it and took the dish away.  I would have expected a manager to come by apologising and offering some form of compensation for this.  There was absolutely nothing.  We were left waiting for a new dish to be prepared with nothing more than a ""sorry about that"" from the waiter."
Pasha M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",2,3,,4.0,1/2/2011,"This was my first time going to the Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek. As I stood to the side for my name to be called (so I could be seated) I started reading the Yelp reviews on the place. I noticed that the rating averaged out at ""A-OK"" with actually a lot of concerns/complaints written by the reviewers (the ones I had read at least). I think individual experiences can have a big impact on your impression on a place, but as for me I liked the food and I think the service was good. At this point I would definitely consider going back to take a relative, friend or even a date. Depending on my experience next time, I might have a different view, but I believe I received what I expected from the place, a 3.5-4 star feeling. I have to agree with one of the reviewers about the waiters wearing white and sometimes worn-down dirty white tennis shoes. Little things like that hit my eye, but if you're just down to grub in a relatively nice place I would say try it out if your curious."
Arthur T.,"Concord, CA",0,44,1,4.0,12/18/2010,"Good place. None of the food is spectacular, but they have a good variety, a pretty good bar and PHENOMENAL cheesecake."
Anthony K.,"Oakley, CA",745,56,3,4.0,9/22/2009,"I know, a Cheesecake Factory, is a Cheesecake Factory, is a... well you know what I mean. I really happen to like this location. We've always been lucky and seated almost immediately. It also helps that I prefer to sit inside, as opposed to patio seating. Not interested in sitting out in the blistering heat in downtown Walnut Creek. Besides the interior of this location is something to behold, seriously, as giant as Grand Central Station. Typical Cheesecake decor, just on a grand scale. They must have sunk mucho dinero into this joint. We have always had prompt service. We always start off with the avocado egg-rolls those are truly addictive. I recently had the fish of the day, which, was a grilled encrusted catfish, I have to say it was fantastic. The spicy cashew chicken is always a good bet. The Kobe burger is one of my faves, and to finish things off, the cookie dough cheesecake can't be beat, or the Godiva cheesecake, or the upside down pineapple cheesecake, or.... take your pick! Just make sure you go with a healthy appetite, because portions are ginormous. Overall, this is one of the most consistent Cheesecake Factory's that I have been to."
Lani d.,"Moss Beach, CA",0,15,,4.0,5/18/2009,the best Cheesecake is their BLUEBERRY SWIRL. It's not on the menu and i think it may be seasonal..you will not be let down!  I've been here a couple times for lunches etc.. and you can easily over order... i recommend ordering some small appetizers to share from their smaller plates menu... and maybe share a meal!  I think my favorite servers so far have been Michael and Miguel. They're both really nice and really attentive and kinda funny so ask to be seated with them and you'll be taken care of for sure!
Chris G.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,19,,4.0,2/16/2011,"I have always been a fan of the Cheesecake factory, even though I am not a fan of cheesecake. I do not know if I got lucky but I went to this particular Cheesecake Factory and was able to get a seat fairly quickly and our server was great. She constantly checked on us and the food tasted great. I definitely recommend this place, especially since it is one of the only place's in Walnut Creek that stays open for dinner even when it get's dark!"
Jay R.,"Concord, CA",424,2,,4.0,2/6/2010,"food was awsome! Service was ok though. This place is consistently busy and I see why. Food is good and they give good portions. The wait is rough though as it could take more then an hour to get a table. Great for groups, I'll be here. But with reservations!"
Connie O.,"Concord, CA",0,49,,4.0,9/6/2010,"Had the Cuban sandwich.  I wouldn't usually order a pork sandwich, but this was Delicious!  Slow roasted pork, ham, swiss cheese, pickles (got them on the side), mayo & mustard, all hot & melted on a pannini.  Yum.  Still think their plain original cheesecake is the best."
Jen P.,"Benicia, CA",2,13,,4.0,4/3/2009,My second visit to CF. My husband & I each had a bowl of clam chowder - YUM - and then shared the salmon salad. A slice of cheesecake to take home. Perfect - Not too much & not too little. Nice glass of wine too! So many things to try can't wait to go back!
PDX t.,"Portland, OR",2,14,9,3.0,1/19/2010,"I'm not sure what sort of addiction-forming ingredient they put in their food here, but I'm always shocked to see the huge line of people waiting to get in, rain or shine, Monday through Sunday, people waiting anxiously with buzzers in hand. The food is good, but to me, not worth waiting an hour."
Marie N.,"Oakland, CA",1,15,,3.0,3/24/2009,"they serve fairly good food but they are just too pricy!!!!  we went to eat sunday brunch and ended up spending $40 per person!!!  their portion size is way too much. I always order shrimp and bacon sandwich, which is my favorite, but can never finish even half of it!!  instead, I think they should make a portion smaller and make the price cheaper.  their service is alright. for some reasons, whenever i go, i always get the wrong order... because they are too busy and can't keep truck with which meals go to which table?   I liked their decor though."
