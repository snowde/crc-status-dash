Mrs M.,"Oakland, CA",0,37,,4.0,12/27/2012,"I love the portion size, perfect for an eat-m-up person.  The Thai Wraps, perfecto!  Just make sure they don't bring the 3 sauces and ask for the peanut sauce, not the peanut dressing the heavenly Peanut 'Sauce'.  I bought a bottle there for about $6 and we use it on our steam carrots and brocolli, sooooo good! The 30th anniversary cheesecake, tangy and too sweet, not the combination I'm looking for.  The salmon on lemon sauce with mash potatoes, yum!!!  Yes, a bit pricey, think it was $17 but you can get the lunch size which is enough and lower priced.  My friend got the Shephard's Pie and he eats a lot and always knows every buffet restaurant in town, brought home 40% of it.  Yes the bread, the brown one only is like dessert and the quality butter they use, its addictive.  I can't find that butter in grocery stores.  I love this place and will keep coming back for the food over and over again until I tried everything on the menu!"
taryn e.,"Danville, CA",0,2,,4.0,5/7/2011,"Great food. Here on a saturday for lunch, had to wait about 15 minutes. Sat outside, wonderful atmosphere very relaxing. 4 stars just because its a lil pricey.They do have my favorite Martini here: The Strawberry Martini. Sugar water, vodka, fresh strawberries muddled together and strained into a sugar-rimmed martini glass...YUM."
Bonnie F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,2,1,5.0,3/6/2009,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factories and have hoped one would open in Walnut Creek.  So last week it finally did, and I happily discovered the food and service were as good as others I have been to. This particular Cheesecake Factory is probably the most beautifully decorated that I've seen.  Lovely artwork on the walls and ceiling.  The wait service is friendly and was surprisingly efficient, considering it's just been open for a week.  The food was fresh, tasty, and plentiful - enough for me to take leftovers for lunch the  next day.  I'm always amazed at how reasonable the prices are for the amount of food you get.  And of course,  the Cheesecake topped off the evening. Be prepared to wait, or go early for lunch when they first open."
Peter R.,"Alamo, CA",6,16,,4.0,4/26/2009,"I really like this chain. It's pretty expensive for a moderate meal, but you get good food and lot's of it. However, since it's new, there is a very long wait. But there is plenty to do around the block, so it's not too bad. It looks uber-clean and really nice. If I were to go somewhere nice for dinner around the area, I would probably choose Chessecake. The only draw back is the price. For one person, it's kind of expensive. You do get A LOT of food which is nice. The verdict: a very nice place that gives A LOT of good food for a high price."
D B.,"Lafayette, CA",0,43,,1.0,11/10/2012,"Never, never again and only went this time because was given a $100 gift card.  Be Warned - no price on drinks - cocktail that took forever was average and cost $12  - yes you read correctly $12 fricking dollars for an average cocktail in a tacky, tacky, restaurant.  asked for all white meat in my dish and it came out brown and fatty, plates were just overwhelming - who the heck eats that amount of food - no wonder American is turning into the land of fatties - with a place like this serving over sized plates full of greasy food.  Oh check their nutrition menu you would faint - every dish came with over 2000 grams of sodium and those were just the lighter fare dishes!!  Forget saturated fat - their dishes come with a double S and F.  we didn't even want to take anything home.  my friend went there for breakfast one time and the pancakes were swimming in grease.  you have so many great, really great restaurants in Walnut Creek, why, oh why is this place packed - must say the food was cheap enough, 4 of us for under $100 and to think over a 10th of that was my cocktail!  the one star is for decor - it is pretty, and outside would be lovely if only the food match the decor.  Sadly cheesecake is not for me and never will be - no class."
Alan V.,"Hercules, CA",18,269,3,4.0,3/17/2011,"spicy crispy chicken sandwich ftw, get that with the chipotle mayo, cut in half, and half regular fries, half sweet potato. the building is huge service was excellent"
Mary B.,"Livermore, CA",0,13,,4.0,1/20/2011,"Fun place for a family, wide variety of food on the menu.  Great location."
Miss C.,"Lafayette, CA",134,30,5,1.0,8/25/2009,"I normally like to write positive reviews, but my experience at the Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek was one of the worst dining experiences I ever had.I was going there for a friends birthday dinner. They said they don't take reservations, so my friend went in a few hours before to talk to the management and let them know we were having a group of people come at 7:30pm for dinner.We arrived 15 minutes early, so we made sure we can get a table. They said it was going to be awhile, so we thought we would wait in the outside area and get a drink.The cocktail waitress came out a couple times and avoided the group of people we were with. So  we decided to go to the bar. I waited 45 minutes for a drink. Then we didn't sit down till 9:00pm after waiting 1 1/2 hours.I was starving and didn't get to eat my dinner till 10:00pm. I ordered Lettuce Wraps, because most of all there food is fried. And by the time we were finished, I had to rush to my car because there was 3 hour parking.  Who would of expected for dinner to take 3 hours. The decor there is beautiful, but the service was terrible.They need to get a bigger staff. I don't reccommend going there to eat."
C C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,34,,1.0,8/19/2009,Two bad experiences at this restaurant.  See no need to go back.  The staff was indifferent to the crowd and was seating out of order.  We saw groups being passed over as if the hostess was purposely ignoring certain customers while seating other groups of the same size.  Stay away.
Rebecca L.,"Berkeley, CA",9,19,,2.0,3/4/2009,"I think I'm still in shock that we weren't offered cheesecake at a Cheesecake Factory.  A friend and I went for an early dinner last week and it was quite disconcerting to see so many servers in their all white outfits...it seemed to be a ratio of 3 servers to 1 patron.  I wasn't expecting much for the food and the service left much to be desired despite the number of employees standing around.  First, we order the fried won tons that came about 3 minutes before our main dishes.  Secondly, my burger was overcooked and my friend's order for a sandwich was mistakenly entered as a pasta dish. Whatever, it happens.   The gal that brought out the food apologized. Then the manager apologized.  Then our server apologized. Okay, we get it and we weren't upset (yet), so let's get the chicken sandwich.  Then we had to catch one of the thousands of white sneakered clad servers passing by just to get us some ketchup.  It kept getting better, but the kicker was the check without a cheesecake."
James P.,"San Ramon, CA",1,16,,1.0,3/7/2009,"Called the Cheesecake Factory Saturday afternoon to find out if they had a happy hour, and what time and days it was available.  The hostess who answered the phone told me they did and it was between 4pm and 6pm.  I specifically asked her if it was available today, Saturday, and she said yes.   Arrived at the Cheesecake Factory at 4:15 and waited for a high table in the bar for 30 minutes.  Once we sat down, it took 5 minutes for someone to come over and clear the previous diners plates and wipe of the table.  Another 5 minutes went by before the waitress came by and delivered menus.  We asked her for a happy hour menu and she informed us that they did not have one.  I explained to her that I called ahead and was told that it was available.  Then a manager came by and explained that they didn't have a happy hour, when i pressed him he admitted that they did on weekdays.  I asked to see the menu and he told me they didn't have one.  I pressed again and he was able to let me look at it, but I couldn't order from it.  So we ordered some appetizers and a pasta dish which took forever to come out.  The service was terrible throughout the meal, and we were constantly crowded by tons of employees just standing around chatting and laughing.  It was incredible to see the waiters and waitresses and runners, just standing around blocking the aisles and crouding tables.  I would estimate that there were probably as many employees in the place as there were customers, yet the service was still incredibly slow.  If this place plans to survive, they have to get a new manager and actually train their employees.  I am going to give this place a few months to work out the kinks, and then maybe I will try them out again.  Oh... and the bar service was probably the slowest I have ever seen at place.  Since I was sitting in the bar, I watched people wait for their drinks and some people literally waited 30 minutes to get a bottled beer."
Kris S.,"Oakland, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/25/2010,"Went to Cheesecake Factory in Mid-June 2010, with a party of 8, and am here to discourage anyone from going to this place with a large party (8 or more).  The service, and the whole experience was an amazing exercise in poor service, poor training, and bad execution. This has nothing to do the the food.  I'll leave it to others to talk about that.   The eight of us arrived at 7p.m., knowing that they did not take reservations, and prepared for a wait.  I was told that ""eight was a party"" and I would have to wait for the assistant manager to give me a ""quote"" on how long it would be.  The wait for the assistant manager was ten minutes.  This is poor training and a bad system.  Why do this at all? The assistant manager ""quoted"" me 30 minute wait time. The actual wait time was 70 minutes.  That's right, SEVENTY.  The location for large groups is in the bar area, not bad, but not great either. The wait for attention, or even drinks, was long, but the wait for entrees, after ordering was nearly 30 minutes.  The entrees did not come out all at once, one was two or three minutes after the others, and this resulted in THE ONLY TIME ANYONE APOLOGIZED.   The server did a sound job of keeping everyone's beverages maintained.    After the entrees were done, it took a very long time to clear and bring the check.  The server began a routine of saying ""I'll be right back with that"" (such as the credit card slip) and returning 10 minutes later.  Very bad training and execution. Cheesecake Factory has good desserts.  We did not attempt them, because we were tired of the endurance-style experience, and did not want to spend more time waiting.  All tolled, we devoted 2.5 hours to dinner for 8 at the Cheesecake factory.  If you have a big party, avoid this place.  They are not set up for it, they have no idea how to do it, the staff and management are apparently not trained for it, and the execution is very poor.   With a smaller party, I have had good service and experience at this place.  With this large party:  Very poor."
Vicor D.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,66,,3.0,6/23/2012,"extensive menu, too much food served--probably why so many patrons are fat that go there----seems like a hangout for the obese crowd--food is decent but very crowded--wait staff seems to be trained as food pushers especially desserts---good sales pitch by the waiters overall maybe a C+ everything considered"
S Z.,"Clayton, CA",231,9,,5.0,3/27/2009,We went there tonight for a special Birthday.  There was a 10 of us.  Trust me serving 10 is not always easy at a place that is so busy.  Kim our waitress was awesome. She split our bill 6 ways and didnt even mind.  The Cheesecake was great.  I had Chicken Marsala which I loved.  The portions are more than enough.  Everybody in our group loved their meals.  I will be going back soon.
Thea M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,5,,3.0,3/7/2009,"Though it's fun to go to any new restaurant in the first opening weeks, The Cheesecake Factory is a place I'll look forward to return to as the hoo-ha dies down. There were many things going on when seven of us were there recently for dinner, and again when I returned for brunch. Here's a list I hope the owners will read and work on.  1. A seventh person should never be seated in the aisle. 2. The coffee desperately needs to be improved. There's no excuse for bad coffee in the Bay Area! or in any restaurant wishing for return customers. Next time I'll bring my Peets coffee in to make a point. 3. The waiters need to keep closer tabs on their peeps and what they want. 4. Where were the busboys? 5. Several people need to be cruising and watching for empty water glasses, more bread or butter needed, plates that need to be removed, people trying to get a waiter's attention, etc. 6. If dogs aren't allowed on the patio by the summer, all I hoped for in this restaurant will be lost. There should be water available for them, as well. Walnut Creek is a happy community of dog lovers who could easily be accomodated. 7. Last, but probably most importantly ... the wait staff needs to grow up or be older, maybe. They seemed frantic, overwhelmed, and incompetent. A bright smile is not enough, though their courtesy was appreciated. There were so many of them, but half of them seemed to be hanging out and talking about the other half. If there are more than four at a table, maybe teams of two, rather than one poor person trying to manage on their own in the midst of the high energy the place radiates. 8. I have my fingers crossed that this will be a great destination in the future."
Alan D.,"Concord, CA",138,32,738,2.0,3/14/2009,all i have to say is the wait is ridiculous.  if you want cheesecake from here you might as well just pick it up.  thats just me.  nice to have one in walnut creek but the service took to long.  almost 25 minutes just to get my drink and a few shots.  should of opened up 2 bars in this place.  im to angry to write anymore.
Andrew W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,15,,3.0,1/3/2010,"If you like huge portions of average quality food, then this is the place to be.  If you like huge Disneyland type restaurants but only have a few gallons of gas in your 'nut creek area car, then again, this is the place for you.  Seriously, I do like this place, for the sheer size and spectacle of both the building and the menu.  I think drinks & apps on the front patio is the way to do this place though, unless you are one of those ""more is more"" type people, in which case feel free to endulge in a huge pile of very okay food from any corner of the world you can think of.  While you're waiting for your table (or a movie to start at the theater next door) the open air, high ceiling, front patio with it's fire pits and comfy seating is actually a very nice place to kick back with a beverage.  For a drink or two, you almost feel like you are in Hawaii, until you walk inside and remember that you're in Vegas :)"
Alano T.,"Los Angeles, CA",58,53,27,4.0,5/2/2009,"In comparison to the San Francisco location, I have to say that I much prefer the Walnut Creek Cheesecake Factory. The parking is free instead of God knows how much in San Francisco. I've been to this location three times within the first month of its opening and there are still some kinks to work out like the waiters' endless speeches of what's featured. However, my dining experiences have all been very positive. This place is a personal favorite of mine to chill and enjoy the company of the people I'm with and the food. My friends and I come here and we'll sit at our table for hours without feeling rushed or anything like that. There isn't anything on the menu that I didn't like except the jambalaya. If you're curious about it, it doesn't have any tomato sauce and it tastes rather bland. All the appetizers are great. The cheesecakes are all delicious. The last kind I had was the 30th Anniversary and even though that name isn't as descriptive as Kahlua or what have you, it was the best one I've had there. The times that I've eaten here were planned strategically because I know how the waits can be. If you're expecting to get seated right away on the weekends, you really should go to another restaurant. It can get really busy but all the staff make me feel very comfortable when I flag them down for anything."
Ben P.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,5,11,5.0,2/16/2010,"here is my review. Karissa---who was my server last nite. she had a great smile and right attitude...she didn't forgot anythings we ordered, coz usually the rest. i went, mostly the server will forgot one or two things i asked. but she didn't. the foods my family order were so good. we finally didn't order cheesecake coz the meal were so big........ try the popcornshirmp......that's the best i like."
Jose C.,"Lafayette, CA",0,13,,2.0,11/20/2009,"Here's the thing. The Cheesecake factory is fine. Food is pretty good. Portions fine. Price...a tad high, but not unreasonable. Service fine ( too many of them, but fine). The problem is the overall experience. Assuming you found a place to park, it all begins with a rather impersonal greeting , being told ...."" it will be about 30 -45 minutes"".....huh?. Why wait? Way too many other choices nearby......but if you do wait this is where the problem begins.  Just waiting to have your name called you get the feeling of a cattle call. Guests are herded in and thus the "" impersoanal"" adventure begins. The place is HUGE. HUGE. You feel lost. Just herded in, herded out. Give me a mom and pop independent any day...."
