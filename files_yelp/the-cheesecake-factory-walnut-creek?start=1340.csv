Jamie T.,"Eugene, OR",0,5,,1.0,2/13/2010,"Here's a true horror story: I'd been to the one in the city before and it was decent, so about a year ago my girlfriend and I came here for lunch.  Our beeper thing they give you ended up not working, and we had to wait over an hour to get seated.  When we finally did, they forgot to bring out the drink I ordered.  Next, they brought out the thai salad wrap appetizer we ordered, but when I bit into one of the pieces of chicken I got stabbed from a skewer that the cook had accidentally (I hope) broken off inside of the chicken.  My girlfriend ordered the pizza and salad lunch special, but they not only forgot to cook her pizza, but they had to ask her what kind of pizza she had ordered in the first place - and this is as they brought out my lunch.  To top it all off, with all the apologizing the manager did, we were still charged for everything."
Charlene R.,"Oakland, CA",56,151,,3.0,3/18/2009,"The menu is a novel!  There is so much to choose from.  The food is consistently good and the best part of all... the cheesecake.  Get the caramel turtle or similarily named.  It's new, and sooooo delish.  Three stars because our waitress ignored us half the time.  She took care of all the tables around us and just kept walking by us.  Whatever, this IS Walnut Creek and I know you've heard the stories... anyways, whatever.  The food was still good.  I'll still come back."
Robert C.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,29,,2.0,8/20/2009,"Took the family on a Thursday night.  Started out well enough, but went downhill when the food started arriving.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which ended up being big chunks of tasteless pork.  It was terrible.  The rest of the food was OK, nothing to get excited about.  We then ordered cheesecake all around.  They pushed the key lime cheesecake, so my daughter and I got that.  Someone did a run-by drop off of our cheesecakes and didn't leave any forks.  We had to wait 10 minutes with cheesecake sitting in front of us before we could get anyone's attention to get forks.  The key lime cheesecake was waaayyyy too sweet and buried in whip cream, waaayyyy too much whip cream.  Couldn't finish the thing.  The bill came to well over $100 (with no alcohol) for two adults and two children.  Wasn't worth it.  Disappointing experience."
Kurt M.,"Suisun City, CA",3,30,,5.0,3/24/2009,"now i know what you're thinking, 5 stars?! what is he crazy?!! Alls i got to say is, this is the best cheesecake factory i've been to so far. There was a total of 6 of us so as you can imagine the wait was pretty long(2hrs!) so we hit the bar, it was amazing! the bar staff was on point, whippin up the drinks ina timely fashion, had an array of drinks (but no LC's!) the bartender opt for me to try the surfer on acid, which really hit the spot! (3 was enough for me lol) oh yea, another drink my bro had, a mango-rita, good sheit so try it! So in the mean time, while sippin on our dranks, the 2hrs flew and in no time we were ready to be seated. The waitness was a total doll, ordering was a breeze (since we had all that time waiting to look amongst the menu haha) never ending bread and butter was awesome(they even foiled up 3 rolls to go!), my 2 entrees were humungo! (can't believe i killd it) i had the chicken tostada salad and the california cheesesteak all were tasty and had pretty good presentation. last but not least was the infamous cheesecake (macada nut to be exact) it was sooo satisfying in every way possible! thanks c factory, we'll do it again"
Cassandera S.,"Concord, CA",0,49,2,5.0,9/11/2009,It is always crowded but the food is great.  The food portion is large so you always end up with a doggy bag.
Jean R.,"Concord, CA",145,12,,4.0,4/16/2009,i will always and forever love this place! ..this cheesecake factory here in walnut creek is the biggest and most beautiful cheesecake factory ever!..ive never seen one thats as big as this one....menu is pretty typical however..but if you havent tried the LOUISIANA CHICKEN PASTA...your missing out.! ..thats all i go there for! ..the wheat bread is also tasty too..and the snickers cheesecake is on hit.
Chris G.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,3,,3.0,11/2/2009,I'm sure other comments have said the same thing but it's useful to know that portions are huge.  Even the lunch sized meals are large.  A month ago I ate 2/3 of a lunch portion meat loaf plate and had to go lie down on the couch for the rest of the day.  I think I have it figured out now though.  Two of us went yesterday and split one fire roasted artichoke appetizer and then a grilled rib-eye steak.  The steak comes with good french fries and fried onion rings.  Perfect amount of food for two average sized humans.
steve k.,"Orinda, CA",28,17,,3.0,12/30/2011,okie dokie. the food is good. the interior gives me the creeps. It would be a great place if I was blind
Eve C.,"San Francisco, CA",1,96,17,2.0,1/4/2011,"If you like chain restaurants and overeating, you'll probably love this place.  I ordered the cashew chicken over brown rice and took more than half of it home. Had it for lunch two more times!  It wasn't terribly expensive, but I go for quality over quantity and it just didn't make the grade.  Hubby liked it because he got the largest burrito he's ever had.  When he tells me he loves a restaurant I know it's because he was served large portions (sigh).  I swear there were 100 items on the dinner menu.  How can they possibly do them all well?  I'd rather have less choice with high quality than more with mediocre.   Drinks are a real rip-off.  Had a watered down ""ultimate"" margarita for around $12.  Service was good and we went without a reservation during the holiday week for an early dinner so I can't complain about the wait or service.  I wouldn't return unless I was with someone that insisted on going."
B W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,8,,2.0,10/14/2009,"I came out of here feeling fat, disgusting and like I was about to throw up.  I was excited to try it when this place opened.  It looks cool with the fire pits outside and everything.  We had to wait over an hour to get seated.  The food is over the top and just too much.  The drinks were disgusting and made all wrong.  We had to send them back.  The decor made you feel like you were in Vegas, so if that is your thing you may enjoy this.  I won't be going back.  Walnut Creek has much better food to offer."
Lori R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,42,,3.0,9/25/2009,"First and only visit 9/21/09 . The Service was excellent from the moment we arrived to the end.  The food was good to bad depending on what we had,  the Avocado eggrolls were great.  the crabcake sandwich was pretty good, the pasta was just ok and the salmon salad was terrible.  The prices were a little high for what we ordered but not to bad,  The reason I wont go back is because there are so many other better places to go."
wendy W.,"Berkeley, CA",0,18,1,3.0,8/22/2011,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for a drink and appetizers after shopping.The outside seating is very nice on a warm day. I found a Happy Hour menu on my seat and and realized I was just in time to take advantage of it. I asked to be seated outside and was seated after a short wait. I ordered the Fried zucchini with ranch dressing from the small plates menu and the guacamole and chips from the happy hour menu. My waitress couldn't have been any better. She had asked me how spicy I wanted my guacamole and I asked for medium, when I mentioned it wasn't spicy enough, she went into to the kitchen and had them fix up three different ways to make my  guacamole more spicy. I used one of the hot sauce mixtures and it was perfect. She checked on me frequently and was seemed very concerned I was was happy with everything. The zucchini was very good and the ranch dressing was just the right dipping sauce  When the bill, I discovered the happy hour is only when you sit at the bar, which was a big disappointment.  I would go back for the wonderful outside seating and the decent food, but mainly for the very sweet attentive waitress..I wish I knew her name.  Good customer service can make all the difference."
MARK S.,"Oakland, CA",4,7,,1.0,3/2/2009,"Oops they forgot to serve me my dinner....awkward...A horrible and excuse-laden staff forgot to place our appetizer order and later fogot to place our main order.  The staff is far too busy huddling up with each other in 3-4 staff cliques all over the restaurant and not too concerned with working.  My date got her meal but i never got mine so after waiting 15 minutes we finally agreed to share hers and after finishing about 60% of it our waitress finally reappears for the first time in ages and apologizes for vanishing and asked if we wanted a bigger plate to share the one meal...i asked if maybe instead we could get my meal sent to us.....never happened....the mgr later came over and was ""gracious"" enough to comp us my meal which I did not even get and that was it (HEY GUYS, THANKS FOR NOT MAKING ME PAY FOR SOMETHING I DIDN'T GET)...thanks DB's......NEVER AGAIN!!!"
Becky G.,"Washington, DC",0,16,,3.0,6/30/2011,"So I wouldn't normally bother posting a review for a chain, but there are a few things to note if you visit this home of huge, high calorie servings. First, you can piece together a decent meal of small plates shared with a friend. White bean hummus, firecracker shrimp, lettuce wraps (though PF chang's are better), and fish tacos (it's an entree, but there are 4 and they are easy to share). Second, the mojitos are surprisingly good. I've had my fair share of mojitos and was a bit surprised. Perhaps it helps that my expectations were low. You will need to muddle the mint in the glass yourself to get the right flavor, but after that you are set. Finally, my husband keeps making the mistake if ordering food at restaurants based on concern that our toddler might not like what we ordered for him to share with his older brother. It never works out in his favor. The chicken and biscuits he randomly decided to order tonight were foul. Instead of gravy, it tasted like they were covered in Alfredo sauce. I would avoid this if you ever manage to even see it on the huge and overwhelming menu."
Richard L.,"Oakland, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/22/2009,"If you want to have a nice, quiet lunch, DO NOT go to this place.  It was perhaps the noisiest place we have ever been.  The canned music was too loud, the noise from the guests reverberates thoughout the building due to the hard floors, walls and high ceilings.  An acoustical engineer should be brought in to work on deadening the noise.  We were exhausted from trying to make ourselves heard (5 of us in a booth).  I would be interested in knowing what the ""db"" level is there - and how much damage to the hearing might be from the noise level."
Armando A.,"Long Beach, CA",0,6,,2.0,6/23/2009,"I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory before but my experience at this one left something to be desired.  I ordered a pasta dish with shrimp.  The pasta had just about no flavor to it and I had to add salt to it just to jazz it up a little; this was even after the server put cheese on it.  Secondly, about the worst thing you can do to shrimp is over cook them and that's exactly what they were.  I can say, however, that they were very nicely seasoned but for the price of the dish and the fact that I only received 5 on my plate, they should be done correctly.  In their defense, we put our order in ~6:15 when things are heating up in a restaurant so the chefs were likely busy.  The decoration in the restaurant is very well done and there seemed to always be a line of people waiting to get in so if you like crowds, you'll like this place.  The server was friendly but at the end of the day, if I'm gonna shell out $50+ for a dinner with my wife, the food should taste better."
Suzanne M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,13,,1.0,3/7/2009,"Horrible food and when we called back to tell them our To Go Order was not very good, they could have cared less.  We told them we wouldn't YELP but after there "" I don't care attitude"" they deserve this review."
Jose D.,"Pittsburg, CA",4,31,3,3.0,3/2/2009,"i really loved the food their and MOST of the servers were nice we only had one problem with a new server who was a little Rude she made a very bad look when we ask her if we could get some more bread as we waited for our food and by mistake her trainer and her both brought a basket of bread we took the one from her trainer and she took the one basket that she brought (angrily took) and said "" WELL YOU SAID YOU WANTED BREAD"" in a disrespectful tone of voice which my family complained about to her trainer who was VERY NICE along with the rest of the staff and she came to apologize for her trainees attitude because her student supposedly felt ""apologetic"" but the food was great and MOST of the staff was very helpful and nice so i would defiantly recommend this place."
I W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,13,,4.0,5/5/2009,"This new Cheesecake Factory is so close to my house and I loved eating here. This restaurant is just beautiful. You can tell they really took the time with all the details. The place is huge with a lot of outdoor seating, but you're still going to wait an hour to get seated on a weekend, just like with any other Cheesecake Factory. There is something for everyone on the huge menu and they have many, many drink selections. My all time favorite are the avocado egg rolls - so tasty and so is the sauce they come with. The portions are HUGE and for the price/quality/great service, you can't beat this place."
corneze j.,"Fairfield, CA",0,1,,4.0,3/9/2009,"After reviewing all these negative reviews of the cheesecake factory, I'am writing this review to inform everyone the cheesecake factory has only been open for a few days past TWO WEEKS!!! It is impossible for any opening resturant to provide the service and dinning experience that they will in the near future, within their first weeks of opening. I promise you that every day they are improving tickets times, and steps of service. This will be Walnut Creeks premiere resturant, I gurantee it! Be patient! Even today walking into the factory will be an expricene in itself. Surronded by beautiful art, and smiling faces. The staff is very friendly and warm. Food is delicious. Give them a break they still have the new car smell if u know what I mean."
