Mario A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",77,13,,3.0,3/12/2009,"2nd time to the Cheesecake Factory, 1st time to the one is Walnut Creek. Went on a Friday night and it was crazy. They took my name and said about an hour to an hour and forty-five minutes. Took a walk eslewehre to have a drink since it was packed, in and out. Came back and still had to wait about another 15 minutes. Doubt that I would go back, wait is much too long and although the food is OK, don't think the wait is worth it. They should have at least provided a free drink for the long wait yet since their new, it's all about breaking even for now. Maybe when all of the hype is over with and the crowds and lines aren't as well, I'll re-consider....."

blue S.,"Oakland, CA",0,11,,1.0,2/19/2012,"we went to dinner with the kids and my sister in laws family all total there were 11 of us.  first of all it took three hours to get a table.  we arrived at 545p and didn't get in until 830p then we got served water and our waiter disappeared.  he was a nice guy and very kind but his timing sucked, I mean sucked every time he left he wouldn't come back for 45 minutes.  I mean the table behind us changed people three time before we even finished our appetizers.  The lemonade was syrup and mixed way too sweet.  everyone's meal was either bland or wrong.  Oh yeah the salt bombs they call mashed potatoes were a heart attack on a plate.  we finally left at 1104pm. This was supposed to be just dinner not  a fu&%#ing  marathon of waiting.  Never do this to yourself, the food I had was orange chicken that tasted nothing like orange chicken it was more like orange chicken jerky it was soo dry. we got served water one time and we learned that if you don't ask for everything at the same time they can't produce.  This place F-ing sucks NEVER GO HERE, TELL YOUR FRIENDS.  i GUESS THEY THINK BECAUSE ITS WALNUT CREEK THEY CAN PULL THIS CRAP.  They didn't dare have a comment card on the table or at the door.  who is running the kitchen anyway. we didn't dare get coffee because they would have had to go to Columbia and get the f-ing beans.  I blame the orgainzation of the kitchen staff, they must have been keebler elves and couldn't reach the pots and pans.  because we ordered cheesecake and icecream and it took 45 more minutes.  realllllllly what is it to do cut the cheesecake put it on a plate and bring it out. Nope wait wait wait.  I just had to do this while it was fresh in my mind.  I have to be to work tomorrow.  But please don't ever go here for a quick meal or any meal save yourself the torture.  I wish I could give no stars and just the big red X to keep you away from this time trap."
Angela L.,"San Francisco, CA",1,13,,2.0,3/10/2009,"I am very willing to give them some slack for the fact that they have only been open a few weeks, but the chain as a whole has been open for quite a while so I am still surprised by the complete lack of service.  Our party ended up being served by three different waiters, each one worse than the one before.  They never let us know they were changing our waiters either, they would just show up and ask us to place our orders again.  The restaurant was not that busy as it was a Tuesday night, but there was more than enough staff standing around doing nothing.  I am usually the most forgiving person when it comes to slow or bad service, but this was beyond belief.  When we finally tracked down one of our waiters to pay, they disappeared with our credit card for 20 minutes.  I like the food here and the selection is great, but I am sure it is not worth the hassle.  I hope they work out their kinks."
Linda G.,"Concord, CA",34,1,,2.0,2/27/2009,"4 friends & myself went to restaurant on a wednesday, 2-25. 3 of us were a little early, so we went into the bar. It took 10 minutes for us to be ""noticed"" another 15 for our drinks to be served. Mistakes were made on 2 of our drinks, and we were paged for our table before they arrived..we asked that they be brought over to the table..never arrived!  We were seated for about 20 minutes before anyone took our drink orders..waited approx 30 minutes for them, again, 1 was wrong..(additional 10 minutes b4 that drink came!). After waiting again for abouit 20 minutes, FINALLY a server came to take our orders..(oops!!forgot the bread..came during dinner)..about another 15 minutes passed then server came back & said they were out of what I ordered (fish & chips)..she didnt have a menu, so waited another 5 minutes while she found one and gave to me..finally made 2d dinner selection..then came ANOTHER 25 min wait for dinner..A bright spot..food was very good..lots of it..but we have now spent over 3 hrs in this place, and upstairs parking was for 3 hrs only, so we rushed through eating dinner, took desserts home..It didn't seem to be server's fault..young & very eager to please..cooks and bartenders need to be brought up to speed..and 3 stalls in ladies bathroom..really!!! Probably won't go back was the consensus of my friends, even the good food didn't make up for the long wait and mishaps!"
