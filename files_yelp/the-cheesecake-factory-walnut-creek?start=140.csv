Miriam C.,"Kingsville, TX",56,6,15,5.0,6/16/2017,Love this location. It has easy access and garage parking in any of the adjacent buildings. We ordered gluten free meals and everything was delivered perfectly.
Heather O.,"Antioch, CA",243,88,790,5.0,4/12/2016,"If youre in the area where there is a cheese cake factory... Gooooo!! Seriously this place is off the hook. The interior is beautiful very classy. The atmosphere gives me a wonderful vibe and thats everything. The hosts are friendly. The waiters are always makin sure you dont have an empty cup and asks if everything is ok. This place has delicious cheese cake different varieties of flavors. Great place to have some drinks with your friends, also across the street is a theater so you have the perfect date."
Roxzelle M.,"San Francisco, CA",50,2,,1.0,8/5/2017,"If I can give this location a 0 star I would. First, HUGE fly inside the cheesecake display ( I should've call health department than telling them and getting more and more attitude) -  Second, poor customer service at the front register. Didn't hear not even one apology instead they gave us more attitude!"
John S.,"Pittsburg, CA",1381,125,84,5.0,6/12/2017,"Great location for a date night when you wanna be a little fancy but not heeella fancy. Honestly the decor of this place alone gives it 5 stars. It feels like if the Palace of Fine Arts was a restaurant, it would be this. Great place for when you and bae want to dress up a little. But not too much. 10/10"
Gene D.,"Mountain View, CA",3,740,71,4.0,6/19/2016,"We came here for dessert...And, the cheesecakes did not disappoint!  We did not have a long wait and were quickly seated inside the main dining area.  Our server was friendly and attentive to all of our needs.   Their complementary bread was a hit as always, even though our main reason was dessert.  We all thoroughly enjoyed the Red Velvet, Smores, Mango Lime, and White Chocolate Mac varieties.  Man o man were were ever in a ""food coma"" after it!"
Author G.,"Spring, TX",80,17,5,1.0,8/4/2017,"Guest Services asked me to contact them, so I'm giving them one star for effort. I contacted them today via the website today. Now I'll just sit and wait if they actually get back to me regarding my awful dinning experience at the Walnut Creek location."
Talilah D.,"El Cerrito, CA",189,7,,1.0,10/19/2017,"Today I was so saddened by my experience at the cheesecake factory. I have been to this particular location many of times with small groups and large groups and never had the experience I had today. I came all the way from El Cerrito just for my favorite item the kale salad. To my surprise they no longer offer the salad. Instead I got a beet goat cheese salad. I tried to eat but the combination of the bitter arugula mixed with the beets that taste semi dirty I just couldn't take. Instead of the manager offering compensation for the bad salad or offering apologies  instead he came across as condescending and rude. I ordered my second dish which were the Tex-Mex egg rolls they were dripping in oil and covered my hand. When I mentioned it to my server she said ""that's how all of our fried foods are""...I question her because I've had food here before that was fried and never had it cover my hands with oil.  She responded by being rude and not saying anything...she just looked at me with a strange look on her face. I told her i eould just order a cheesecake to go. I sat an additional 10 minutes or so as she walked all around me making sure every other  customer had what they needed. She finally came for my cheesecake order but I was over it.  I was certainly ignored by the manager as well as the wait staff. Disppointed in poor service. It ruined my self care day lunch"
Maggie F.,"Vallejo, CA",11,25,25,5.0,5/16/2016,"I'd like to think my boyfriend & I frequent here quite a bit & for many reasons. To start off, the seating usually isn't too bad as long as you're not in a rush. They're a very popular place so don't expect to be seated immediately in the middle of a dinner rush or a weekend evening. They take your name down & give you a buzzer to let you know when your table is available with plenty of seating to wait & you could even wait outside without missing your chance to be seated. You can also grab a drink at the bar! The interior is beautiful! Very high ceilings, awesome lighting depending on the mood of you & your guests. Plenty of seating both inside & outside, we've eaten at both places there's a fire pit & heaters outside if you end up out there. The menu itself has PLENTY of options no matter what your preference may be. I'm personally a huge fan of the Chicken Madeira & their pasta is also good. You're also served bread & butter when you're seated. As far as drinks go, the menu is just as extensive. The Asian pear martini is my favorite, introduced to me by my boyfriend & I'm never disappointed! I've always received good service here & that just about rounds out the reasons I come here so often. Just expect to spend some bucks if you come here, you definitely get what you pay for though!"
Veronica S.,"Patterson, CA",0,47,45,2.0,4/13/2017,"Bad service terrible server Lissette. So listen up Lissette (Idk how to spell your name, my apology)! First of all we get seated to a handicap booth; my friend who's not as skinny as me gives me the eye of this is so embarrassing because she's a bigger girl. So I told them there is a lot of other open boothes, I know you not gunna try to squeeze us in this booth. So they agreed to give us a normal size booth. We where seated and asked for drinks from our waitress Lisette who grabbed them in a good amount of time. Now she gave our drinks to us backwards and I said politely oh here it's like this no worries. She then disappeared we did not see our waitress Lisette for quite sometime,maybe 15 mins to take our order. So I got up to the station of the cashier little booth by the bar and asked for her. Weird enough she was in the little booth behind a gentleman who was working there. So it took her 5 mins more which was a while granted because we where the boothes closest to the bar. So I gave her my order that she didn't apologize for the 20 min wait or even show one sign of sympathy or even a smile. I told her my order and she didn't write it down or acknowledge me if that was it, just super awkward. Then off like a flash she ran away kinda like a mean girl that she didn't want to talk to us lower class subjects haha. My friend who has worked as a manager for restaurant told me how sad they didn't give her enough trainer and how she didn't look like she even taken care of her self.Like she should  fixed her pony tail and maybe someone should tell her to lay off the blush but I'm not here to poke at her image god knows I had no makeup on with ugg slippers lol but No excuse for Lisenette she is at her job so let the record show : you should present yourself at work a bit higher on the spectrum. So she disappeared for all of the meal and I had to call over the manager tell him about my situation and on top of that I had a really bad bent butter knife as well. After that the meal came after waiting a hour for fish tacos and a turkey sandwich ; didn't help that the server that wasn't even our server spilled my friends fries all over the floor! I felt bad for the guy but it's like another yet embarrassing thing to happen to us. The manager did take care of our desert which was fabulous but he should train his staff better. Oh that's right what happen to Lisnette or Lisette, she never showed her face not even once! Disappointed and I left no tip to my ghost server. So Lisette or linsette I will discuss what you need to work on help you out because I was a cocktail waitress back in the day!  1. Smile  2. Be friendly and usually have a opening Example: Hello good after noon how are we doing today? Good me to! 3. If you mess up or are late with you customers Say: I apologize for the inconvenience I'm very busy and let me get started for you on your order or if the customers food is late go over say ""hi can I refill your drinks?""  4.Don't let your customer ever wait always check on them! Update on food is always so helpful!! 5. Ask them if there's anything else they can do after serving your food! 6. Check on them while they are eating  7. Tie it together at the end with desert and the bill 8.Appearance this is kinda like judging a book by the cover.Sounds bad but hey it's the truth. If you look like a hot mess people tend to not want that person serving food thinking maybe a loose hair will find a way in your food or the girl with too much makeup is distracting to look at. Always have a tight clean pony tail and natural makeup on it shows the customer you take care of your self and reassures their food will be handle with care with no hairs in it. Your tip should be excellent! I may look like a 14 year old little girl but I'm that undercover boss that will tip you $20 to $50 usually that's lunch tips for 2 girls haha image dinner tip! I had to tip 0 never in a very long time has this happened. So I hope this was helpful to the worst server Lisette or linsette. Sincerely the two girls at the booth. 2 stars for the manager that gave us complimentary cheesecake lol"
Giacomo S.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",364,13,2,2.0,11/7/2016,"Where's the Chicken  Ordered the southwest chicken sandwich. French bread tasted fresh, salad mixture tasted good but too much dressing and chicken too small for bread. At least half the sandwich had no chicken. Did mention to server not to recommend it."
tai t.,"Oakland, CA",12,67,,1.0,5/16/2017,After many years of eating high quality food and coming to dine here I realize the quality is very poor! Nothing is organic and all the protein is farm raised. It is not cheap for what you are getting. I don't think people realize how much they are paying for this low quality and low standard food. I am so done with this pretentious big corporation restaurant. Good bye forever cheese cake factory!!!
ChampaigneMami C.,"Oakland, CA",13,33,47,5.0,6/24/2016,"The food, always yummy! Love it here. My food always arrives in less then 15 minutes i love it! They give you bread wheat & white with butter. Service, amazing!! Every single waiter is so very friendly, i dont know how they do it, they are just great. They never mest up my order or food. The place, We get seated fast, lovely place! Very clean and pretty. Deserves 5 stars! I RECOMMEND you come her if you havent yet!  Pleaseee get red velvet cheesecake! Its the most yumy one!"
Danielle B.,"Antioch, CA",96,58,27,3.0,5/16/2017,We went here for mothers day and it was ok. Long wait which is expected for this holiday. However the service was spotty and our food came out at different times. I get the same dish at the Pleasanton location and it taste much better there. Overall ok experience but overpriced for the mediocre food
Sean C.,"Pinole, CA",32,1,,2.0,8/1/2017,"Really don't appreciate the seating policy and bumping us back. FYI, policy is 80% of the party has to be present. 50% of our party is outside talking. It's not like we all are not going to eat together. I would like to sit down, order a drink, and look over the menu. The only thing this place has going for it is the cheesecake."
Max H.,"San Francisco, CA",1,13,,3.0,10/27/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory offers restaurant-goers an exciting alternative to the typical eating-out experience.  Menu items are perfectly placed between moderate pricing & enormous portions, therefore making it a ideal for the hungry patron. The Walnut Creek branch, however, has slowly slumped their level of excellence.  The superb service that I personally raved about amongst all the Cheesecake Factory properties is fading away.  Walnut Creek is unfortunately falling victim to a growing company.  Unlike other branches like San Francisco which have managed to keep their game strong, there is now the sensation that they letting things slip through the cracks.  In the past, they clearly only employed the upper-crust of good people.  This is no longer the case.  It seems to me that management needs to tighten up the hatches; then they will rise up to the level of superiority we've grown to expect from them."
Jason K.,"Pittsburg, CA",58,11,2,1.0,9/30/2016,"Went for lunch today with a good friend. Entered and got seated right away. Host was great. After sitting in our seats for 10 to 15 minutes I grabbed a host and and asked. If we had a server. I asked ""have you not been greeted yet"", I said no. He graciously took our drink and food order. Then we waited 5 more minutes till finally a server came up to us and told are drinks and food would be right out. As we sit and wait the salad that was ordered first never came. As the food was delivered the salad came with our entrée. Was kind of perplexed on how the service was. I have been in to this place multiple times and never had the type of serve that was given today, or should I say lack of service. Spending $70 dollars on lunch and screwing it up from the beginning is kind of ridiculous. I'm not sure if I will returning to this establishment. Highly disappointed."
Leonora B.,"Union City, CA",1,19,15,1.0,6/25/2017,1 hour and 15 minutes wait just to be seated.... I wonder how long is the wait to get the food! Well.... wish me luck!
Kelly M.,"Antioch, CA",0,4,1,1.0,7/30/2017,"You go here expecting great service! i got anything but that when I visited here about a week ago so first off our server hands us to another server who clearly wasn't her section, then we get our food the server who go us handed off to her let's us she's going on break we'll then the server we go was clearly totally outta her section and so we get ignored we have to have our meal without any refills! But who's to blame here the server who handed us off? Other  server who went on lunch or the server who was suppose to be watching us,none of them clearly management gives their employees free range to do whatever they want! I can't believe a server just can give away tables as she pleases! Defiantly will not be returning here. I spent well over 200 for what horrible service next time I'll just stick to what I know!"
C C.,"San Jose, CA",0,14,,3.0,7/7/2017,"It's one of the nicer Cheesecake Factory's that I've been too. Staff was friendly all throughout. Waited about 10 mins for a table right before dinner rush. I ordered a regular burger and my husband ordered the Thai chicken dish. We ordered egg roll sampler as an appetizer. Our apps came out before our drinks came to the table. And then the basket of bread after the drinks. A bit out of sequence but that was okay. However, my husbands plate came out 10 mins before my plate which I did not like. I repeat, staff was nice but the food was just blah. Will not come to this location again."
Zehavit C.,"Brentwood, CA",197,163,1285,5.0,9/15/2015,"Love everything about this place!!! Location, atmosphere, design, service and of course,the food and desserts  Very big variety of food to choose on the menu. I like the skinny menu too, which offer lees calories dishes and still very tasty."
