Andy L.,"UC Campus Area, Berkeley, CA",91,31,,4.0,7/16/2017,A lot of people like to rag on this place but they have a great selection of food and drinks. For the price you get a massive amount of food and that's definitely worth it. Can get super crowded at times so you may have to wait a while.
Angel L.,"Oakland, CA",261,19,8,1.0,4/29/2017,They where not really that busy. We had to wait 30mins for bread after our meal came. So once we got the bread still till no server. Stopped one of the servers ask for a drink again 15mins later nothing. The kicker was getting the check we had two servers than. The topper was the rude you man where you will you purchase the cheesecake he was very rude and disrespectful I had to wait when no one was at the counter and additional 10 minutes for a slice of cheesecake with him walking back and forth just looking at me very interested I need a fork and no customer service skills whatsoever you guys need to do better all the way around the board
Christine K.,"El Sobrante, CA",146,54,49,4.0,5/21/2016,"I came here for the first time, the only cheesecake i had been to was the one in San Francisco.  First of all the location is beautiful, the inside ceiling and the outdoor atmosphere. I came here for dinner, around 5:45pm. it was super busy, and I was with only one person and they told us the wait would be 40min. we actually only ended up waiting around 15-20, was super surprised! I got seated outdoors around this huge square fountain they have in the center of the outdoor seating. it was a little chilly but it was a super nice day in walnut creek.  I ordered something super original, spaghetti with meatballs. but it was delicious, probably one of the best plates I've had. I had a Hershey chocolate cheesecake for desert and it was phenomenal. I couldn't finish because I was so stuffed but I took it home for later ;)  overall our service was good, our waitress was attentive to us considering it was a full house. I do think it's weird how cheesecake doesn't take reservations so whenever you come here anticipate a wait. the last time I attempts to eat here I didn't because the wait was 2+ hours.  I'll definitely come back here and try some other good looking things on the menu!!"
Judith A.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,42,,4.0,7/13/2017,"I ordered the Mexican salad on the skinnylicious menu and it was delicious. HOWEVER, while the chicken strips buried in the middle provided just the right amount of protein for one serving, the cabbage/lettuce/corn mixture was enough to feed a whole family. I left more than 3/4 of it there. So all the good stuff, (beans, chicken, tortilla) were kind of buried under this huge quantity of ""filler"". It was a turn off to see when it arrived in it's 12"" bowl. If I had been heading home after lunch I would have asked for the leftovers to go but would have had to add protein later, of course. But it tasted good! I sat at the bar and the bartender was efficient and friendly. I hope Cheesecake Factory considers the size of some of the things they serve and cuts back (and adjust prices)--this part of their reputation isn't good."
Amber D.,"Union City, CA",18,5,,2.0,6/9/2017,"Giving them 2 stars not due to the food but for the service. When you call-in order and they tell you 15 to 20 minutes and it winds up being 50 minutes it's very annoying and inconvenient .Not to mention when you talk to what you believe is a manager and they blow smoke up your a** saying yours is the next order however 15 minutes later is still not out .Really need to understand the process of under promise and over deliver. Totally understand if it's busy, but then tell the customer that so they don't waste their time standing around."
Jazzmine N.,"Oakland, CA",0,13,1,2.0,3/6/2017,"I walked on a Monday afternoon around 1PM. I was told that I would have to wait 15 minutes for a table of two. That was fine with me and joined the others that where waiting for their tables. What was beyond me was that there where plenty of tables open. Maybe they can only seat as many people as workers they have during the weekday? After I was seated our server came by within minutes. Asked us for drinks and if we were ready to order. Everything was fine up to this point.  After waiting 30 minutes our server walked by and noticed that we did not have our food. She informed us that it would just be a few more minutes. We talked amongst ourselves for about 20 more minutes. Then finally a gentleman holding one plate comes to our table without saying a word points at our food indicating where should he place the plate. He never said anything else or even smiled. He did not even recall what the dish he placed was or said anything about the other dish. He walked away with a smug face. Okay dude, what's your problem. He comes five minutes later with my food, and you know the jelly like film sauces get when it sits out because of the oil. Yeah I had that. My food was not hot or warm. It was room temperature. They did not even care enough to clean the plates as I saw sauce and butter around the edges. My boyfriends burger was slightly warm as well. He ordered a burger with mac & cheese. The mac & cheese ball was placed in the center. I guess they cut the center of the beef patty and replace it with the mac and cheese. It was hard to find someone to ask for condiments and it was hard to find my server as she only came to our table about 3 times. (To order, to tell us our food is coming, and for the check)  The food was not outstanding. It's as generic as food can get. They list the calories on the menu. I'm wondering all the calories go to. The protein to starch ratio is beyond me. They put a huge portion of mashed potato with a small piece of protein and whole bunch of buttery oily sauce. & the fries are hard and not even warm!  The ambiance is nice, I guess. That's what I give the stars for. The cheesecake is alright. For the price, people do not deserve microwaved food (basically). BYE"
Tracey T.,"Fairfield, CA",1,12,60,5.0,10/8/2017,"Good food,  good service and great Cheesecake!  Clean and modern with a large menu to choose from.  The Lemon Meringue Cheesecake, Pumpkin Pecan, Strawberry and White Chocolate Raspberry was what my family and took to go after being to full after dinner.  Sometimes Togo items are not as appealing when packaged and opened when you get home.  They manage to over come this.  They package them in a small container and garnish with fresh whipped cream.  They still looked eye catching when we were finally ready to eat them. Of course it is Cheesecake,  how could you go wrong,  right? If I can get passed the Lemon meringue I would like to try some of the other varieties.  Until then I just have to mooch a taste off of my families."
Carrie C.,"Alameda, CA",0,6,,2.0,2/27/2017,"I wish the service was better. I like this place, the food is reliable, it's great for kids. But service is hit or miss. I ate here Sunday with my son and a friend. Pretty sure our waitress forgot to order our food as it took almost 45 minutes to get our salads. Also, my friend's salad had no dressing on it."
Julia P.,"El Sobrante, CA",75,10,,2.0,4/3/2017,It was as if they forgot we were even there. We had one waiter but for water and every thing else it was a different person every time. Never refilled our waters. Had no ice. Bread came super late. Appetizer came late. Luckily the food was ok. Service is a hit or miss. I get it it's a busy place but you still have to give 100% every time. We almost always get dessert but decided to skip it this time. Plenty of options and what not and at some point we will be back but they need to slow down and focus on all of their customers not just large parties where they know they'll be making bigger tips.
Ian V.,"Brentwood, CA",129,45,8,4.0,9/25/2016,"#Update 9/25/16 - With the help of a fellow Scotch Addict, I successfully escalated this issue to another manager. He was deeply apologetic about the mix-up and offered a gift card for the chance to eat there again. The manager was concerned about the social media impact, but I assured him that I would update my reviews and post the resolution. An apology was welcome. However, TCF need to teach their new managers more about conflict resolution. My issue was not about the price, but the deceptive manner it was introduced. Thanks TCF, I will try you out one more time."
Vinh V.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,3,,4.0,7/2/2017,There is always a long line but one you get in it's worth it. The food here is always consistence and the service is good.
Sondra A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4,5,,1.0,10/14/2017,"We ordered curbside to go because I didn't feel well. We sat 30 minutes waiting for our food which was obviously cold. He ordered a ribeye, I ordered filet mignon. He didn't want to warm it up because he thinks it ruins the meat. My filet didn't have the shape, texture (it was tough) or flavor of a filet so I paid $30.00 for a few green beans and gave the rest to the dog."
Kristin L.,"Concord, CA",1,4,5,3.0,7/17/2017,"We were given a buzzer and had to wait for about 40 minutes to get called in. When we went in they made us wait again to be seated, BUT they forgot about us so we stood there for a long time until we brought it to their attention. A full hour had passed when we were finally seated and I was starving. I ordered the Chicken Picatta and it was pretty good but I got full really fast. If the service was better I would've added another star, but since the food was good I decided on 3 stars."
Anne Marie P.,"Hayward, CA",154,142,33,1.0,8/25/2016,Update- Cheesecake Factory did respond here and accepted that they messed up. That was very honorable for the viewing public. I did as they asked and sent the response to their customer service which was a complete waste of time as I've heard nothing again since. Another blooper to add to the already very dissapointing experience. I don't even know why they responded as no follow up after asking me to write in. Fail!
Melanie B.,"Brentwood, CA",525,413,1536,4.0,4/1/2015,"I'm a fan of the Cheesecake Factory in general, so when they opened up this location in Walnut Creek back in 2009, I was ecstatic.  They are generous with bread (if you finish, they always ask if you want more). Their menu options can fulfill any cravings you might have whether it's asian food or pasta, etc. I have never experienced bad service or anything problematic during the times I've had lunch or dinner at this location...yet. The hostess, Laila, is very welcoming and greets you with such enthusiasm!"
Melissa B.,"Lafayette, CA",0,14,,1.0,9/24/2017,AWFUL customer service . Marco is one of the managers and he did a horrible job with a door dash order I had placed . It took over 2 hours to find out that Cheesecake Factory did not put my door dash order in - this was after they confirmed my order via the app. Marco did not care at all that I waited or that the dasher waited and that Cheesecake Factory just never placed the order . For whatever reason Cheesecake Factory can NEVER get it's to go orders correct nor can they utilize a platform like door dash . NOTHING was done to amend this and Marco (a manager that claimed he has been with the restaurant for 13 years) did not even apologize for his restaurant's mistake . Take your money elsewhere . This place is trash .
Dafna C.,"Oakland, CA",421,80,7,1.0,9/3/2017,"I tried to order their curbside service. They transferred me and put me on hold for 20 minutes (not an exaggeration, my phone showed I'd been on the call for 21 minutes). Thinking they might have forgotten about me, I hung up and called back. I told the guy who answered that I'd been on hold for 20 minutes and could he make sure that someone was available to take the call so I wouldn't wait another 20. He assumed a very condescending, snotty tone and said that maybe I shouldn't hang up because they're very busy over there and if I hang up they don't know I'm waiting. I was taken aback -- there was no reason for him to treat me that way. I'd been pretty patient. It's reasonable to assume after such a long wait they might have forgotten they had someone on hold. He didn't apologize or even acknowledge my wait and worse, he got attitude with me. I never did get to order my cheesecake. I waited another ten minutes, fuming the whole time about how rude that guy had been, and eventually decided to go to Shari's instead."
Ivana V.,"Brentwood, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/12/2017,"I've been here a lot of times and this time was my worst experience. First it took forever to get sat especially when it was not that busy at all. Second when my server finally greeted my friends and I, we had enough time to figure out what we were going to order. Our drinks took a while to come as well as our food. When my food finally came it was very saucy, the waiter who brought my food out didn't even offer any cheese and every time i've been here I always get offered cheese. My pasta was very saucy and had barely any noodles as well as about 4 pieces of chicken. My server did not come back til after my friends were half way finished with their meal. The sauce was very milky, almost tasted expired. When my server finally came back to ask it we were done I had told my server Cecelia that I did not like my pasta and explained why and she gave me a disgusted look on her face and said ""Mkay i'll just take it our of your way."" Didn't apologize or offer anything all she did was walk away. Then when she finally came back with the bill she still didn't apologize and told me ""Well next time you don't like something you need to let me know ahead of time.""  Well excuse me how could I possibly let you know anything when you hardly attended to me?? She then told me ""I could give you a free cheesecake but I'm not going to do anything about the meal"" she the proceeded about her business.  She had seen our check was ready to be settled but proceeded to attend another table and take their orders. So I went to the host stand and asked if she could give the manage my tab and she then told me ""No I can not I can grab your server but if you just go wait that's faster."" Then thankfully a server named Tyler came and had great service for the 3 minutes he attended to me. He settled my tab and got me a free cheesecake.  My server Cecelia and her service was very horrible.... Very disappointed."
Shante G.,"Vallejo, CA",167,41,76,5.0,11/7/2016,"Our Food was delicious and our waiter Bernard had Amazing customer service. Bernard kept are water glasses filled, came back to check on how things were. Very pleasant smile & patient! Great Food & Great Customer Service equals a five star plus a new customer. We had Chicken Piccata & Chicken  Costoletta which both were amazing!!! Whoever the chef is today, KEEP THEM!!!! AMAZING SERVICE! Hostess could put a better smile on her face though"
Heather P.,"Suisun City, CA",1,3,,2.0,7/11/2017,Don't expect cheesecake for your birthday celebration if you are an adult. They brought out ice cream and sang happy birthday. The table next to us with 11 year old girls got 2 big slices of cheesecake!
