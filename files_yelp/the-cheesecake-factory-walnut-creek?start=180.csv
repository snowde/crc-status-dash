Ron L.,"Concord, CA",393,716,439,3.0,2/14/2015,"""Chickie restaurant"".  That's how I've typically viewed The Cheesecake Factory.  Now that I've been there, I now see it as . . . well . . . a chickie restaurant. Don't worry, I wasn't the only dude there.  We celebrated early Valentine's Day here, and it looked like others did too.  The wait wasn't that bad, we were told 15 minutes and we got our table in only 8 minutes.  They really did up the building inside & out with high ceilings, weird lights, and fake plants.  The menu was several pages long, a third of that was appetizers.  The lighting was pretty low both inside and out, made it hard to read the long menu.  We were outside near a, um, ""fire island"".  Prices were typical of a place like this. Me = Cajun chicken nibblers, Hunny = smokehouse burger, girl = cheese pizza, hit to wallet = under $50.  We did NOT have dessert;  hunny's not having it right now, girl doesn't like cheesecake, and I'm not a dessert kinda guy (I know, we're missing the best part).  Response to food:  Girl = ""It makes my mouth water.""  Hunny = ""Juicy, I have to keep wiping my hands off.""  Me = chicken was pretty dry, succotash was tasty. Service was tremendous!  We got Brittany, she was attentive without being overbearing, always smiling and helpful.  I noticed that the other wait staff was just like her.  She earned her tip, and I made sure she got a big one. So who else was on the patio outside?  Couples celebrating early V-Day.  A few families.  Seven girlfriends having a Friday night on the town.  Yeah, the kind of people who would come to this place. Basically, The Cheesecake Factory is a huge production, and the food is okay but doesn't really live up to the hype.  Not the kinda place I'd go again;  but then, I'm a guy, not a chickie."
Rhiannon D.,"Oakland, CA",75,371,78,5.0,4/6/2016,"I literally come here, buy nonsense off the menu, and ask for 1000 of those complimentary brown breads togo. I don't even care, I'll pay for it. I want that bread! Service is always good. For such a big menu, food is always good.  The brown bread is ALWAYS good."
Bud O.,"San Francisco, CA",0,6,,2.0,7/7/2017,Waited 50 minutes to be seated on Thursday. Only three beers on tap. I ordered a burger because it's usually a safe bet. Fries came out burnt to a crisp. I sent the food back and left without eating. There's so many better options in DT Walnut Creek. Go literally anywhere else.
Stacy L.,"Concord, CA",0,41,1,1.0,3/13/2017,"One of my favorite restaurants but yesterday it was very disappointing.  Thought I would try something different and got the Pasta Davinci and it was AWFUL! Bone dry, 3 pieces of chicken that were burnt and the size of a quarter and maybe 3 mushrooms. This was the worst dish, not even the salt and parmesan cheese made this good. Also had the lettuce wraps as an appetizer and they had one piece of chicken in each. Was there a chicken shortage and The Cheese Cake factory yesterday? Won't be back for a while because this was the worst meal I have had in a long time."
Eddy P.,"Richmond, CA",17,270,370,4.0,10/3/2016,"Can't go wrong with this place. Every time I've been here, the service has been good and friendly. Place is clean and spacious .  I've had the spicy crispy chicken burger which was filling. Milkshakes and cheesecake are also very good! This place is my go-to when I'm with friends and can't decide anywhere else to go. Outdoor seating is nice as well. Parking could be an issue on weekend nights."
Lynn T.,"Vallejo, CA",234,154,223,3.0,4/9/2017,Be prepare to wait if u are going during lunch or dinner on the weekends. Services is very slow...... employees look unhappy. Our dinner was approximately  3 hours and half that time we probably spent just waiting. Smh
Catherine U.,"Livermore, CA",71,17,3,1.0,5/24/2017,My review is based on the actual customers that frequent this location. Apparently this is not a kid friendly environment. If your child makes any type of loud noises customers freak the F out. My child doesn't cry when out to eat but gets very excited for food and will make a loud yell to let you know he wants food (he is 10 months old). Some of the older customers had issues with this and told us to take our meal to go. I could have sworn this was a family friendly establishment. And mind you this happened at opening time.
Claudia A.,"Richmond, CA",33,3,,1.0,7/2/2017,"This place is overrated and overpriced. My plate had a very poor presentation, I had the specialty half shrimp scampi and half steak Diane. One of my shrimp (out of 3 total) was on top of my mashed potatoes and they were a couple degrees away from being cold and some of my mashed potatoes were in my shrimp scampi, my plate literally looked like leftovers. I would much rather go eat at a little hole in the wall restaurant than come here again."
Tara L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,35,,3.0,7/2/2017,"If they actually seat you in 10 minutes like they say, give them an award lol. I was told the wait was 10 mins which turned into 25. The server was nice but not as attentive. I got her attention after 10 mins and asked for another Blueberry Mojito and she said okay and forgot about it. Twice . The last thing people want to wait on is their drink for more than 10 minutes.  Especially after having to asked twice and wait longer than told to be seated. The food was okay, nothing too special. Drinks are usually pretty good and is best to order 2 at a time so you don't have to flag your server down for 10 mins. By the way Jennifer, this was 3+ months ago. Not everyone writes a review the second they leave."
Kenneth D.,"Alamo, CA",0,14,,3.0,3/13/2017,This place isn't the worst but far from the best. Food is ok I mean this place is about the dessert anyhow. Cheesecake is amazing never had a bad one yet. Customer service is pretty bland. Nothing memorable but not that bad either. Biggest complaint is the price of everything is outrageous. I mean I get your located in downtown walnut Creek but even the happy hour is is pushing it's limits.
Charlene S.,"Moraga, CA",0,18,1,4.0,6/30/2017,"I've been a long time fan of the cheesecake factory and not just for convenience. NBA players aren't the only big fans of this restaurant chain The cheesecake factory has consistently great food and great service; however the weight can be quite long, especially if you come at a peak hour. I guess for a popular restaurant in downtown Walnut Creek they should be expected. I love that they offer many healthy options in addition to there are many tempting platters and of course there cheesecake. And who can turn down that brown bread!!"
Cynthia B.,"Concord, CA",3,10,,1.0,3/6/2017,"Wow! I stopped going here due to the outrageous prices and slow service. I went today after many years and I never thought restaurants could get worse, but behold they can and did. I gave 1 star because there was no option for a minus star which they deserve. Waiter slower then a tack, manager could care less of the food preparation or lack there of and for a soup / salad lunch took over 45 minutes??? I guess I finally learned my lesson to never go back and spend a fortune on crap!"
Tiffany L.,"Concord, CA",9,55,11,5.0,4/12/2017,"Been here many times and today we had the best waiter we have ever had, his name is Jose and he was on top of everything he definitely made you want to come back! You will not be ignored with Jose."
Sasan S.,"Martinez, CA",29,186,67,1.0,7/28/2016,"This weak ass Cheesecake Factory gave me food poisoning like a mothafucka man I'll never go back into this POS the only reason why I ever went in the first place was because my options were extremely limited due to the fact that it was past 10PM on Wednesday night & not many places are open in this situation.... I was out for 3-4 days throwing up, diarrhea all that nasty shit you can imagine oh boy, oh boy oh boy I ordered the tacos that night too & just thinking about them now --- 6 months later makes me cringe will never go back to Cheesecake Factory anywhere it's Denny's 3.0 and if you were wondering BJ's is Denny's 2.0."
Teri G.,"Fairfield, CA",0,9,1,3.0,5/14/2017,"Mothers Day - started out great. Drinks, appetizers and dinner. Chicken piccata good, shrimp scampi yes, burrito and honey chicken - good. Mom had to wait 20 minutes for dressing for her Cobb salad. Steak medium - came first time well done. Second time - I think they seared it on both sides - completely raw. Hmm."
Angela C.,"Benicia, CA",124,5,2,5.0,12/18/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants to eat at and I'm so happy to talk about my experience this time. Natalie was our waitress and I want to start by saying she was the most perfect example of GENUINE good customer service, not only was she incredibly sweet she was prompt and kept not only my table but others as well in the loop about what was going on. Her communication with us made us feel like a priority and that's something that I value greatly. It was also all of my groups first time here and she set the perfect foundation and example that they left extremely impressed because she set a new standard for them.  I am excited for my next meal here  Not only for the DELICIOUS food but for hopefully the same five star service I received this night.  Thank you so much Factory staff  And extra thanks to you NATALIE  HAPPY HOLIDAYS  -A very satisfied customer"
Alix T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,2,1.0,5/9/2017,spent $60 on birthday lunch that made me violently ill. I have eaten countless times at The Cheesecake Factory locations all over CA and this was the first time I've been sick. Alexis K offered me mediocre service at the pick up counter that was hardly the friendly energy I am accustomed to. I will never dine at the Walnut Creek location again.
Marvin R.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,5,3,1.0,7/19/2016,"By far the worst dining experience I've ever had at the cheesecake factory....  It started off strong with the waiter introducing himself but i guess not strong enough because i don't remember his name. Anyways he explained a couple of specials that they were having and recommended the fish. He then got our drink orders and came back maybe 5 minutes with the drinks and bread basket.  Then we sat for the next 15 minutes waiting for him to come back to take our order, but sat there instead as he took another tables order who was seated after us. Another server came up to our table with out any introduction and asked if we were ready and finally took our orders.  We sat for another 25 minutes for our appetizer to come out (by the way we ordered spinach and cheese dip... Nothing too complicated). As we began to eat the chips and dip a man in a dress shirt approached our table which was by far the most awkward interaction i have ever had at a restaurant with the restaurants manager... He began to apologize for how slow the appetizer came out and said ""it normally doesnt take this long and i do apologize for the wait but we had to make it from scratch which is why it took longer than normal...""  On a side note i know this probably sounds very petty but i ordered a factory burrito with no onions and when the server dropped off the food he even said heres the burrito with no onions.... And with the first bite i tasted and saw a bunch of onions fall out of the burrito.  After a few minutes the server came back and asked if we had spoken to the manager and if he took care of us which i replied ""well he said hi and apologized"" and the server responded with ill speak with him and make sure he'll take care of you guys. Which got my hopes, i was gonna give them a 2 star if they had comped the appetizer that they made from scratch and when received the check the rest was history... Shoulda went to chilis instead... Ill never make that mistake again..."
Alo A.,"Oakland, CA",95,162,7,3.0,7/23/2016,"Pros: This location is located by so many other stores so it's in a great walking area. The menu items have changed in price over the years but I've notice the quality is still the same. It's not the most amazing food but it's not the worst either. I always get the chicken strips or one of their salads. The bar has great options as well. Not sure if there is a happy hour but I'm sure there is. Incase you just want dessert or dessert to go they have a counter right at the entrance to purchase and leave. If you circle around there is valet parking, self paid parking or free parking.  Cons: When it gets busy they always seems bit chaotic. Almost like there are too many people in charge. It can get real busy and packed so if you plan on going at a busy time make sure you're ready to wait."
Andrew M.,"Fremont, CA",169,517,257,3.0,9/12/2016,"It is a chain restaurant that has decent consistency. I try different dishes each time and it goes from ehhh to yeah that was good. I wish the service was consistent, but hey its waiter life, I know everything can't be perfect. The portions are good, like if you get a lunch pasta, that's more than enough for 1 person, dinner pasta would be for 2 or more. Only go to cheesecake for other people, on my own, would never choose this."
