Marissa D.,"Fairfield, CA",470,140,231,4.0,3/10/2015,"Been here plenty of times, and I've never left unsatisfied.  The menu is pretty big, filled with options from sandwiches to pasta!   Their Sunday brunch is my favorite!  This past visit we started out with calamari (yum), then I ordered the crab hash (light, but delicious), and ended with a caramel white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake!!  It's definitely on the sweet side... But it was just what I was craving!  This place is one of my go-to's for birthdays, graduations, or just a fun weekend lunch/dinner with friends :)"
Michael V.,"Sacramento, CA",46,3,,2.0,9/13/2016,"While Cheesecake Factory as a whole is a fairly decent establishment, in a city full of amazing restaurants don't waste your time here. The service takes a long time on a Tuesday there are barely any customers here and quite a few staff on duty. I read around on reviews hoping that this particular experience was just an isolated incident and that I was simply here on the wrong day but it looks like my crappy visit is nothing new here. The place gets two stars for having decent food and my particular waiter was a fairly nice person, but the loss of a dish for a guest at my table as well as the long waits makes me very disappointed in this location.  One star for the waiter being a good guy, and one star for the decent food. Nothing more and well deserved in that regard."
Karen N.,"Concord, CA",52,48,4,2.0,12/30/2016,"While many others adore The Cheescake Factory I found it to be loud, busy and just uncomfortable. We visited on a Wednesday night and the service was slow. We ordered cheeseburgers and fries and they arrived to us rather cold and it appeared uninviting. Then we took our first bites and it was bloody. Yes, we ordered them medium. I then asked our waiter to take them back and we went back & forth until we finally waited such a long time that we ended up taking our food home where it was cold. I'm not really a fan. I'd like to give it another chance but the prices prevent me from returning for yet another bad experience."
Rachel T.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,4,1,1.0,8/20/2017,"Came here as a party of 7 during the time they had the half off cheesecakes. We all decided to just get cheesecakes since most of us had eaten before. When we were seated it took 10 minutes for our server to show up and greet us. We ordered 5 cheesecakes total. The server left and didn't check up on us for the longest time, as we watched her tend to tables beside us instead. I really don't care if we just ordered cheesecakes, that doesn't give a server the right to ignore us, we're still paying customers! In fact, that was probably the easiest order she had during that time! We were very polite to her and after an hour past with no drink refills or any updates on the status of the cheesecakes, one of us had to go up to her and ask what was going on. Then she proceeded to say that the cheesecake area was backed up and would take 25-30 minutes. But she wasn't specific if it were 25-30 minutes after we initially ordered or from when one of us went up to her to ask. We waited another 30 minutes with nothing and she did not come to us to see if we were okay. She only came to our table 3 times the entire time we were there. I don't believe it was backed up as bad as she said because the table next to us when we decided to just leave had bagged up cheesecakes with them which I know they ordered after we did. Plus, if they were doing orders in a first in first out manner, that shouldn't have been a problem. It seemed like she didn't even go over to the cheesecake area to check on our order and was just hoping the employees in that area would bring it to us. I know restaurants are hectic and I understand that was a busy day for the cheesecake area in general and things can go wrong, but to get no update or apology from the staff before we even ask for info is not cool at all. The server should have known that seeing us sitting there with no cheesecakes after an hour would make her want to come up to us herself and apologize and make it right in any way she could. But instead she chose to ignore us and tend to tables by us right in front of our eyes and did not apologize until one of us had to get up and talk to her to get her attention. We felt ignored, for sure. So, to spend almost 2 hours just sitting there and having a waitress barely come to us with updates or an apology, I had a terrible experience here."
Grace D.,"Brentwood, CA",29,43,30,1.0,12/13/2016,Tuesday night 7:30pm. Phoned in an order of a slice of an Oreo cheesecake and a slice of a chocolate cake and it took 30 mins! It's dessert! Pre-made at that. They said that curbside was backed up and I was sitting at curbside with empty stalls next to me. It never fails. Regardless if it's pick up or dining in. Service is . Food quality at times (compared to other Cheesecake Factory franchises) is crappy too. So sad that this is the only location within the east bay area. So doing the extra drive to Pleasanton from now on.
Katie K.,"Concord, CA",79,37,6,2.0,1/1/2017,"Food: pretty good, but so overpriced for the quality.  Drinks: meh. Nothing special but generally well made.  Service: OH MY GOD where do I begin??? Let's start with the long wait time. I get that today (New Years day) was a holiday and not many places are open, this funneling more people than usual into this place. They should have been ready for that and scheduled more staff.  All of the servers looked so stressed out. They were running in and out of the kitchen, three of them almost knocked into me while I was walking to the table we were being seated at and didn't even apologize or excuse themselves. Our particular server wasn't awful but he wasn't friendly either. He checked on us the minimal amount of times needed and refilled my water a few times but seemed put out that I didn't order one of their overpriced drinks.  I remember why I hate coming here. Pay for parking, walk forever cuz let's face it, the garage right next to them is always full, and get mediocre service, food and drinks? Ugh. It'll be a long time before I go back that's for sure."
Dee S.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",1,31,,1.0,6/7/2016,We have family visiting and wanted a nice dinner for eight.  It took so long for our meals to come out the manager came and apologized for the delay.  Then the meals slowly started coming out but 6 of us were halfway through our meals before the last two finally appeared.  One meal with steak was overcooked; the fish tacos only had one VERY small piece each; the pepperoni pizza was overcooked and very unappealing.   For a $246 tab it was SO disappointing.  We certainly won't go there for our next family get together.
Nicole F.,"Bay Point, CA",88,11,9,1.0,9/20/2016,"Do a favor to yourself and do not go to eat in this location!!!! The food was cold,our servers didn't know anything about the menu when we ask them ,they keep asking the kitchen which was very  unprofessional.  I will never go back to this location again I am very disappointed  and felt like I didn't get any worth for my money ."
Carol C.,"Alameda, CA",198,883,6321,4.0,11/25/2014,"My girlfriend picked me from the Walnut Creek BART Station to dine on late lunch at this Cheesecake Factory. We were both celebrating our birthdays - mine is tomorrow (November 26) and her birthday is on November 28. My friend and I don't often get together for birthday lunches, so we decided to make it a tradition to dine at different restaurants in the future. As usual, we were somewhat undecided as to what we wanted for late lunch. The menu is extensive, making it a difficult decision to hone in on what we felt like eating. The waitress, Jenna, gave us ample time to decide. She was attentive in filling our water glasses, and occasionally checked to see if we enjoying our meals. We started with appetizers - mini crab cake bites and sweet tamale corn cakes. Both apps were delish, but I wished they serve more than 1/2 dozen of those crunchy seafood delight. I probably could have eaten a dozen of them. My girlfriend never had the sweet tamale corn cakes, which is one of my favorite apps. We agreed not to have any pasta dishes as entrees - more carbs - even though chicken fettuccini is a tempting dish. I should have went with the salmon Genovese, which my girlfriend had. She enjoyed it very much. I decided on the shepherd's pie. The dish was a tad too salty for me, so I only ate about half of it (3 stars). The waitstaff came with our ""birthday"" cheesecakes - slice of pumpkin for my friend and a slice of mango key lime for me...oh yum (4 stars).  Service was a little slow, but that's okay. It gave us time to digest the food and relax for a few hours. The drawback: street parking can be difficult. There is a public garage about two blocks away.  I like this Cheesecake Factory better than the one in Macy's Union Square (SF) because it is less crowded during the weekdays, less tourists and more spacious."
Tricia N.,"Walnut Creek, CA",71,170,116,2.0,10/19/2015,"Cheesecake Factory...*fast food* 1.  I really like the employees here.  Everyone is kind, they deliver great customer service, you can tell that everyone is working really hard. 2.  They have a wide variety of selections on the menu.  Gluten Free options, Appetizers, Dinner, amazing Bar/Drinks.  The serving size = HUGE.  You  can order 1 thing and share 3.  I ordered a Factory Chopped Salad (something like that) - the chicken was like RUBBER.  I has to spit it out.  My boyfriend ordered Factor Nachos - those were much better than the salad.  Although, the chicken sill had a rubbery chewy consistency.  They must not use quality ingredients and meats. I must not expect great things from chain restaurants.  However, My bill was $29 and I threw away my entire salad.  I hated it.  Get it together cheesecake!  Smaller portions with quality food for the same price = much better than larger portions of disappointing food."
Kat D.,"Pittsburg, CA",53,270,62,3.0,1/26/2016,Server Becka was very nice. No negative on service. All 5 stars.  Minus two stars  1.) lack of steaks. Ordered a filet mignon and they didn't have any.  2.) Ordered a herb crusted salmon and it was over cooked.  The server was so sweet. She had the cook remake one right away. I asked her to just wrap it to go. I was full. Tipped well because service was good. But I'm disappointed in the kitchen. They should be doing better than that.  I didn't even want them to remake it. I just wanted to let them know my fish was overdone. Otherwise the food was yummy.
Brandon K.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,26,12,1.0,8/14/2017,This place strikes me of a teen hang out but not much of a restaurant. Sat on the phone for almost ten minutes until I hung up. Now waiting 30+ for two salads to go. Menu is large.
Lela T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,17,,2.0,12/31/2016,"The food was good but the service was very poor. We had to ask for the complimentary bread 2 or 3 times before we got it. Additionally, the tables around us got served faster than us. We also had to asked for the dessert menu 2 or 3 times a well. This is by far the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been too."
Terrence P.,"San Leandro, CA",4,79,2,5.0,1/15/2017,"I met with a group here tonight, and it reminded of all the previous visits here. The service is always top notch. This is one place that is always busy and I'm sure with the amount of stress placed on them is overwhelming. However, the staff here never disappoints. The servers always has a smile on their face, and do their best to accommodate the needs of the customers. I'm sure they don't get the credit they deserve, so I am hoping they run across my review. I truly thank you for your consistent service. You all are an amazing and elite group of professionals. Keep up the good work."
Leticia L.,"Perris, CA",1,6,1,3.0,1/2/2017,"Its so sad that this place is hit or miss. It took 40 mins for us to be acknowledged. So we immediately ordered appetizers, it then took another 30 mins and the main dishes came out at the same time  with  the appetizers I had the worst experience and ended up calling the manager who only un genuinely apologized. It was to late our dinner was ruined."
Minh-An C.,"Long Beach, CA",1078,979,3147,3.0,11/5/2014,"My family and I came here to celebrate my nephew's 11th birthday. We parked in the free parking structure nearby and walked to Cheesecake Factory. This is one of the bigger Cheesecake Factory I've been to and for a Saturday afternoon in August, it was pretty packed! We waited about ten minutes for a table for seven. After being seated, we all placed our orders and drinks and food slowly came out. I got the chicken piccata and it was decent, nothing too special. Everyone at the table seemed please with their food. When it was time for the cake, my sister wanted to order a whole cheesecake for my nephew but unfortunately, they didn't have any whole cheesecake ready so we had to get a frozen one. We were all too full to eat it right away so we just took it out for pictures and put it back it in the box to bring home. Overall, like any Cheesecake Factory restaurant, I think it is overpriced but it is a place you can rely on to have big parties. I absolutely enjoy their bread though!"
Stephanie C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",303,90,354,3.0,2/3/2016,"Came on a Sunday night around 7:15pm. Finished our meal and left around 9:15pm. Food - 3.5*** - you can get a decent quality meal with big portions for about $20/person (including tax and tip? Menu is huge so theres something for everyone. A little overwhelming if it's your first time. Yummy complimentary bread to start off. Restaurant - 4**** - decor is beautiful. Feels like I'm in a fancy las Vegas casino. Bathrooms are clean and a good amount of space to wait to get seated. Fire pits outside look cool. Service - 2** - there seems to be a lot of staff, but wait time for everything was slow. 30 minutes to be seated. 30 minutes to get our orders. Not a place to go for a fast meal. But if you have at least 2 hours for a meal then go for it!"
John M.,"Dublin, CA",0,11,23,1.0,12/27/2016,"Disappointing. Tried this location after several disappointing experiences at the Stoneridge Mall in Pleasanton location. Had high hopes for the Walnut Creek store but seems they share the same philosophy of mediocrity. Right from the start they mucked it up. The first appetizer we requested was the fire cracker salmon rolls but they sent it with no sauce. We asked for the sauce and were told they were probably out but looking. Sorry, why send it to the table then?!!!  I had to ask for it to be removed from the bill.  Then my wife's entree arrived incorrectly. She ordered the shrimp scampi with steak Diane. They brought steak Diane with salmon. The time it took to get the correct dish meant mine was cold by the time it came it out.  The waiter is a nice guy but the same dirty plates sat on the edge of the table after at least 6 or 7 visits by him. He took some but not these. Inconsistent.  Congratulations Cheesecake.  After such mediocre experiences by two of your stores I'm out. We've been to Cheesecake Factory restaurants coast to coast, north and south, and these two are hands down the worst examples. Never ever again. If more people were blunt and honest you'd be out instead of me."
Alexa A.,"Hercules, CA",117,26,56,4.0,3/6/2016,"Came here for lunch, waited 35 minutes for the buzzer only to be put in another line to wait some more (no big deal). After we were seated we were immediately asked for drink orders and given menus. Quality service, food came quickly. I ordered the factory meatloaf and food portions are always very generous so it's worth the price.  For dessert we ordered raspberry truffle cheesecake and the toasted marshmallow smores cheesecake. The raspberry truffle cheesecake was nicely balanced between sweet and tangy from the raspberries, but the smores cheese cake was VERY sweet/rich, I recommend sharing this with a friend because it's waay too much for one person (imo)."
