Izzy A.,"Downtown Oakland, Oakland, CA",0,18,1,1.0,5/1/2017,Walked in around 9:15 pm asked for a table for 3 out on the patio. Person that greeted us when we walked in said it will be about 15min. Waited for 30min went to the same person that took my name and said to wait. He said that he can not seat us in the patio because the patio is closed now. Asked him why did you not tell me this when I walked in his response was that the server in the patio is busy with the tables she is servicing and cannot service anyone else. So he said he could seat us inside in about 15 min. So we agreed 45min later and still have not been seated. Went inside to ask why have we not been called to be seated for dinner. Response was I called your name and no one answered. Management please train your employees how to run the reception area. They seem like they are either lost or don't care.
Jennifer C.,"Danville, CA",3,27,,3.0,6/19/2016,"I can't handle this place. Way too loud and crowded. But my kids like it, so that's sort of a win. I definitely have to take off stars for their menu. Information overload. So hard to make a decision sometimes. And the advertising embedded in the menu? Pass.  You'll have a nicer experience if you eat outside. And check out their menu online before you go so you can have an idea of what to order before you get there. Also, they have stellar Arnold Palmers."
Jordan W.,"Brentwood, CA",197,10,,5.0,4/12/2017,"I ordered Take-Out food yesterday from Cheesecake Factory! The same young lady I talked to on the phone, was the same gal to bring out my food. I noticed by her voice, and when I saw her, I knew she sounded familiar, she's usually the one running the front desk!! I believe her name is Bella ! Anyways She was so attentive; from the greeting on the phone, to a short ONLY 2minute wait from the  time I pulled up, and she even went back inside just to get me extra napkins and silver wear that I asked for. And every time I see her when I dine in and its busy she always offers a glass of water and gives relatively good guesstimate on wait time; to not only me but for everyone! Definitely always a good experience at cheese cake as long as she's around !"
Kristina R.,"Martinez, CA",0,16,3,3.0,3/2/2017,"Did another curbside order.  Called it in, they told me it would be about 15-20 min. I arrive, wait about 30 min, recieve my order and bring it back to work (down the street). Get to work... and my pasta is COLD, hard, and doesn't even look appetizing lol. I mean considering it's a 16.00 pasta it should not be COLD. Probably not going to do curbside again. Employee was very nice tho."
Suzi F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,52,2,3.0,11/22/2016,"Great location, huge menu. Somewhere in this world there is a real factory that makes the cheesecake, its NOT in Walnut Creek so don't act surprised when you can't cute your dessert with a fork because it's still frozen!"
Mike M.,"Clayton, CA",81,24,1,1.0,12/12/2016,"There are plenty of great eating establishments in downtown WC; don't waste your time and money here.  Service is slow and inattentive, the food is low quality. Apparently the service staff can't coordinate with the kitchen: in my group of five, a fish and chips order was soggy (heat lamp), and an order of tacos was cold. You'd think they would at least get the cheesecake right, but the piece I shared with my wife had a piece of paper/ cardboard embedded in it. Yuck!"
Tallal S.,"Vancouver, Canada",13,20,3,2.0,5/30/2016,"I've never been a fan of the food. The menu is messy, always busy, and food takes forever. The cheesecake is good though. Maybe they should just stick to that."
Alexandr D.,"Evanston, IL",0,2,7,1.0,8/13/2017,"The worst cheesecake factory I've been to. Food is terrible, salmon was full of oil and not grilled. 2 steaks were ok, third one was overcooked, got spinach side 10 min later after main dish. Avoid."
Evgeniya P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",59,1,1,5.0,4/3/2017,Love it! Always good time at the bar or at the table. Lots of choices and great food. Of course amazing cheesecake
Binyamin D.,"Concord, CA",2,5,11,3.0,6/11/2016,"I have always liked The cheesecake factory food, the only thing is the service, I feel like there is a often miscomunications because it is pretty big. I still go to that place because you wont find avocado eggroll anywhere else like the one in Cheesecake Factory!!"
Raquel C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4,70,7,3.0,1/26/2017,"I recently took my family visiting from out of the country here.  My nephews wanted Chipotle from across this location, but my sister wanted a more formal setting so we ate here.  The place is impressive but the food is ordinary.  We all had different kinds of pasta and a chicken dish plus dessert.  The cheese cake selections are really good though.  Will be back for dessert."
Paul S.,"Antioch, CA",0,12,7,4.0,3/10/2017,"Excellent food, try the mango keylime and raspberry truffle, came here on a Friday night and it was packed but we got a table immediately. Only downside is waitress service was a bit slow. Will definitely be coming back."
Nancy M.,"Diablo, CA",0,36,,1.0,8/21/2017,"Stopped here for a late(3:30pm) lunch yesterday after a movie.  Although the restaurant was not busy(1/2 full) we waited 15 min for a table for 2.  The real issue was waiting for 45 minuets for a salad and 1 chicken lunch.  The manager came by and explained ""that is only 5 minuets off our typical wait""  Really?  I have never waited that long for a simple lunch, off hours and empty labels all around.  The worst part and the reason for ONE STAR is my chicken was RAW.  I could not eat it.  Once again the same manager came by and asked if I wanted it made again.  At this point we were ready to leave.  He took it off the bill and that was it. WOW  POOR management.  He said he would ""talk to the chef""   What about the customer who waited here for how long for an uncooked meal?"
Melissa T.,"Antioch, CA",0,5,12,2.0,2/18/2017,Love the food but the service is ass. They take forever to bring out the food My husband and I waited an hour for our food to come out and he ended up getting his plate first and I got my plate 15 minutes later. A couple got sat down at the table next to us and they had their food within 10 minutes of sitting down. The bill wasn't much but they didn't even bother to take anything off the bill or give us a discount. Won't be coming here anymore
Stephanie P.,"Vacaville, CA",0,25,7,5.0,8/19/2016,What can I say this is my favorite place !! Customer service always great and the food is always fantastic. Get pretty busy though
Justin W.,"Hercules, CA",1,66,3,5.0,3/5/2017,Cheesecake Factory is an awesome choice for a chain restaurant. My favorite dish is the chicken Madeira which is always sooooo good. My wife loves the teriyaki chicken or Thai lettuce wraps. As for cheesecakes we always get the Godiva chocolate!
Michael A.,"San Mateo, CA",8,104,53,4.0,1/19/2017,I like the Cheesecake Factory because the prices are reasonable with large servings and decent quality food. You have to accept that you will always wait for table which is ok in Walnut Creek unless it is raining then you hope your able to find seating where the shelter and heaters are.
Frank C.,"Vacaville, CA",24,19,60,5.0,7/22/2016,Love coming here service is great it's always busy at this location but we'll worth the wait. Friendly waiters and.
Violet K.,"Concord, CA",12,10,2,5.0,8/28/2016,"Very good food, great waiter.  Dog friendly patio.  A+  it was a wonderful evening.  The luau salad was awesome.  The prices were very reasonable."
ZeeZee I.,"Brentwood, CA",34,27,4,5.0,1/22/2017,"Enjoyed a lovely dinner here at Cheesecake Factory with the family tonight.  I don't usually write a review for the chain restaurants but our server, Tyler, had impeccable customer service skills.  He was friendly, welcoming and funny :-).  Thank you Tyler!"
