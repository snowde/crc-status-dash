Lavitania S.,"San Francisco, CA",25,3,,1.0,2/20/2017,Horrible experience. Food took about an hour to arrive. Waited for about 20 mins before they came and cleaned up our tables.
Jocelyn S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",107,109,46,1.0,4/17/2016,"Had to update my review and change to 1 star because both myself and my hubby tried to contact management and they didn't even care to respond. I called the restaurant and sent an email through their website and after 2 weeks, I have not received a response. Really disappointing when you spend over $100 for a dinner for 2 kids and 2 adults. Will take our business elsewhere!"
K P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,15,2,1.0,8/20/2016,I have been to this location of Cheesecake a couple of times. I am afraid to say it's always a hit and miss. The last time I went there was with a party of 12 and had to wait for almost 2 hours before getting a table.  The server was barely available and when the ordered arrived after half hour waiting my order was messed up and hence another half hour wait. Sodas lacked the fizz and fries were cold; despite being replaced. I am done going to this branch!
Iona C.,"Orinda, CA",491,371,1907,3.0,6/16/2014,"One of my two younger brothers just LOVES The Cheesecake Factory (TCF).  Yes, I know, his taste is absolutely questionable. Just kidding.   I think I can KINDA get why he likes it so much.  We came here yesterday afternoon to celebrate his birthday.  There were a lot of people waiting outside (apparently a lot of fathers love this place, too - belated Happy Father's Day to all you fathers and father-figures), and we were quoted a 40 minute wait time.  They give you the option of choosing between indoor seating, outdoor seating or first available.  I didn't eat breakfast that morning so I went with option numero tres.  Instead of giving me one of the usual restaurant pagers that lights up and vibrates, the host asked for my name and cell phone number.  Afterward, he printed out a small slip of paper that had my aunt's name (misspelled - 'C' not 'S,' dear), the time we put our name on the waiting list, our estimated wait time, and a time that we should be nearby. I personally love this system.  When we went here last September they didn't have this, but I think it now makes it easier to wander off to a local shop instead of just milling right outside the restaurant because you're afraid to step outside the radius in which your pager can still function. We ended up receiving a text telling us that our table was ready at 2:16, 13 minutes before the suggested time for us to be nearby, and only 22 minutes of waiting.  Awesome! We ended up getting a table outside which was perfectly fine since it was nice and warm.  Our waiter, Jose, got us our drinks, took our orders, and got us bread and butter in no time at all.  Here's what we got (and some notes): Birthday Brother -  *Coke - 2.95 ^ BBro said it tasted like the diet version so we asked a passing waitress for a new one.   Still tasted like diet, so we had our original waiter bring out Root Beer instead.  Don't quite know what's up with that. *Fried Mac & Cheese appetizer - 9.95 ^ I thought this sounded gross, but it was actually pretty good.  When will I learn that fried makes everything better? *Grilled Fresh Salmon - 19.50 ^ Served w/ broccoli garnish and mashed potatoes.  Sizeable portions. * Red Velvet Cheesecake - 7.95 ^ BBro only ate half, but said it was good. Other Brother (lol, sorry) -  *Buffalo Burger w/ Fries - 11.95 ^ They made a mistake since he actually asked for a salad.  Oh well.  Older sibs love fries so it's ultimately a lose (for him), but win for me and the other bro. *Reese's PB Chocolate Cake Cheesecake - 7.95 ^ Littlest bro is a pretty healthy eater and took two bites of this.  Methinks the older bro advised him to order it for himself... Aunt C. -  *Mojito - 11 ^ Not overwhelmingly minty.  Decent. *Skinny Hamburger - 9.95 ^ Comes with a salad in a vinaigrette + thinner buns and no butter.  I think they should just call it a ""Sad"" Hamburger at this point. *Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake - 7.50 ^ Auntie loved it and finished it in one go! Mom (To Go) -  *Mango Keylime Cheesecake - 7.50 ^ Mom loved it! Me -  *Kobe Burger w/ Fries - 13.95 ^ Didn't really taste a big difference in the meat... I guess I'm not classy enough to appreciate it.  Whatevs. *Godiva Cheesecake - 7.95 ^ I'm a total chocoholic, but even I have to eat this in stages.  So rich! All in all, you could go elsewhere for burgers (Fudds), sandwiches (Ike's), pizza (California Pizza Kitchen), and everything else on their menu... but their cheesecakes...  Yup.  Make this the extra dessert spot on your list."
Parastoo M.,"Downtown Berkeley, Berkeley, CA",2,33,2,2.0,11/13/2016,Awful service! Rude personnel! We have been waiting for about 30 minutes fortes cheesecake slices and cappuccinos to go and we asked the waitress for a cup of water. They completely neglected us. They not only didn't give us water after asking them 5 times but they also forgot our order. How difficult is that order? 2 cheesecake slices and 2 cappuccinos. Very disappointed at the way this Cheesecake Factory branch is being managed. And they weren't even busy today and there was no wait because of the hour we are here. And there are many staff running around and being useless.
S S.,"Concord, CA",2,12,3,3.0,3/7/2017,This place used to be my favorite restaurant ever. Me and my husband used to always go here and get the same plate every time which is the spicy chicken chipotle pasta & lousiana pasta and they used to make it very delicious but lately the pastas suck. idk if it's becuz they have new chiefs in the kitchen or what's going on. Was there a week ago and the pasta wasn't even spicy like it should've been and both plates were sauceless and dry as hell.  When we asked for extra sauce due to how dry the pasta was it took them another 10 minutes and by the time the waiter bought the sauce the pastas were completely cold. come on cheesecake factory what happened to those delicious pastas ???
Christine S.,"San Ramon, CA",57,42,82,4.0,12/11/2016,"Vince waited on us and was very attentive to us. We sat outside on the heated front patio at one of the fire pits. It's a nice atmosphere and our meals were good. Pasta carbonara was very good as usual for Cheesecake Factory, but hubby tried the catfish plate and it was the best fried catfish I've ever had. The Caesar salad needed more dressing but I didn't need the calories so all good. The parm wasn't as flavorful, and my hot water for tea wasn't as hot as it could have been prepared --hence the 4 stars for the meal. Dining experience was 5 stars however, Vince was courteous and checked in often."
Nerma L.,"Overland Park, KS",0,20,,2.0,8/10/2016,"Just blah. The bread was stale. The menus and the table hadn't been cleaned properly and were dirty. The burgers were overdone and dry. And the food and coffee was cold.  Seems like this place doesn't really need to care about quality because they're going to be packed regardless. The service was OK though, and the cake and a few other dishes were tasty."
Mary J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,10,,1.0,1/19/2017,"Fake nice restaurant. Flavorless GMO food. Annoying music. Noisy atmosphere. Sour cream in everything, their ""Original Cheesecake"" is just cheesecake topped with sour cream. Gross! Took 2 hours to get 2 salads, fries, and an omelettte. The server messed up the dressing and tried to convince me it was the one I ordered, but my taste buds don't lie! Worst experience, ever. Never going back again."
Kristine G.,"Martinez, CA",26,7,4,5.0,8/5/2016,Love this place!  They are always able to get my big family (13) a table in a timely manner. If we wait there's always the bar.
Thee M.,"Oakland, CA",2,47,13,5.0,11/7/2016,"My daughter and I came here last night for mommy/daughter dinner. We had a very handsome server named Teland (not sure I spelled that right). Our food took a little long to come out but when it arrived it was great! My fettuccini was smothered in rich creamy sauce just how I like it. Teland was on it, I mean hands full but he was sure to continuously check on our table! He packed our dinner up for us, refilled our drinks and just wonderful customer service. I can't wait to go back, thank you Teland!!!!"
Omar A.,"San Ramon, CA",0,15,8,2.0,10/30/2016,"Wait time under estimated, the so called 40 minute wait turned into an hour. If it wasn't for me going up to the counter every 5 minutes who knows how much longer it would have been. The host got tired of it and arrogantly said follow me and sat us by the bar. I just didn't want anyone to spit in my food so I kept quiet , and because I already waited so long to eat I wasn't going anywhere else at that point. I gave them 2 stars only because my wife left her phone on the table and at 1:30am I was able to go back and get it from them."
mehjabeen k.,"San Francisco, CA",6,29,6,5.0,12/1/2016,"Fredo, our server was amazing! He was kind enough to move our entire table to a more comfortable one. The food was also good. Thanks Fredo!"
chel e.,"Vallejo, CA",0,1,4,2.0,10/22/2016,"Saturday night dinner with the family.  We usually love eating at the Cheesecake Factory but tonight was not our night! Our fried calamari appetizer had something fried in it and it wasn't calamari!!?$?+×?#/&! Then when our entrees came out, my son ordered the Bistro shrimp pasta (we shared) when I took my half, ate a long strand of hair that I pulled out my mouth. We all suddenly lost our appetite even for a cheesecake :( 45min long wait for some bread that we had for dinner :( I will give 4stars to our server and manager for taking care of us and our bill! Packed our left over food to go and gave it to a bum in our city. At least someone can enjoy our dinner tonight!"
Garrett D.,"Alamo, CA",0,12,,2.0,9/27/2016,"While we love this restaurant, we are having lunch across the street because of the rotten receptionists and policies. It is a beautiful day and we'd like to sit on the patio. At least two thirds of the tables are empty but there is a 20 minute wait. This happens all the time. It's like it's their way of saying ""we are so busy you have to wait"" even when we see most of the tables empty. If it happened once, okay. But it happens everytime. Fortunately, Walnut Creek has a plethora of good restaurants so there is no need to play ""The Cheesecake Factory Waiting Game."""
Czareanah D.,"Concord, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/11/2017,"Me and hubby came here for late lunch. They were busy and our wait is an hour and half. But we saw that there bar is open so we decided  to sit there instead of waiting.We were greeted nicely and waitresses are very accommodating. The Garlic Pasta with Chicken and There breads are delicious and  loved every bite. Yummy! My hubby had a Cheeseburger with bacon and it was fantastic.My pineapple mojito was good and Sangria for my hubby tasted pretty strong,but good as well. And we ordered Caramel Cheesecake to go.We would love to visit here again. This place is beautiful."
Stephanie S.,"Honolulu, HI",8,49,24,5.0,3/30/2017,"Angel is THE GREATEST bartender! I came from school, 2 hours in traffic, and he just made my afternoon. Such a nice guy, so sweet, I will definitely be back just to sit at his bar!!"
Edna G.,"East Bay, CA",574,749,8705,4.0,4/16/2015,This chain restaurant was not busy but it was a Thursday late night! It's located near many stores or considered an expensive shopping area. Good location of Walnut Creek. They have awesome customer service and food was given on time. I only ordered appetizer and dessert. It was good! I have had many things at this chain restaurant and I am rating for this one due to service. My only issue here was the lights are so dim!! I literally felt like falling asleep!! ;-)
Colleen F.,"Oakland, CA",9,24,,2.0,10/21/2016,"Might think about changing the name to ""Salty Food and too much Booze"", because they make the worst ""cheesecake"" I've ever had!  I ordered online to be delivered - it really turns me off to have to walk through a bunch of of drunks to get to a table."
Sean M.,"San Francisco, CA",70,11,10,1.0,10/11/2016,"I don't think I will ever go back to Cheesecake Factory again. The food is overpriced for what you really get. The night I went the service was horrible on what did not seem like a busy night. It was my nephews birthday and we waited for about a half an hour after we finished our food to even ask when his dessert was coming and for them to sing to him. It seemed like any request took a extra 10 minutes. The apps were the best part of the meal. All in all for the price i paid I don't think its worth it. The dessert was good though, but doesn't make up for everything else."
