Joan J.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,5,,2.0,10/18/2016,Was disappointed. Had fish and chips for lunch today. The butter that came with the bread was frozen and unspreadable. What they referred to as coleslaw had no hint of any kind of dressing. The fish was cooked well and not greasy. The fries were not crispy but also not totally limp.  Miss them in their old location. Wait staff did a good job.
Tye H.,"Vallejo, CA",1,26,44,5.0,12/24/2016,Cheesecake factory is one of my favorite restaurants. Food is always good. Nice size portions for what u pay. Cheesecake slices are huge! Only thing is they do not take reservations. But they are always surrounded by stores so u can shop while waiting.
Cherise N.,"Pinole, CA",77,161,411,3.0,6/12/2015,"I do not know what it is, but I really like the Cheesecake Factory. We came here for a graduation celebration dinner. We arrived about an hour and a half before closing. The place was be packed, but had a good number of people inside. Our wait time was roughly 15 minutes, so it was not bad. I ordered a piña colada to drink and the shrimp and chicken gumbo. The piña colada was alright, I have had better. The gumbo was good, I would definitely order it again. It had the right amount of shrimp and I had chicken pieces in every bite, it was the right amount of spice. The service here was great. The hostess, waitress and waiters were all friendly and helpful, when I was choosing the meal. I would come back to this Cheesecake Factory l, again."
Brandon S.,"Rodeo, CA",58,93,242,4.0,9/21/2015,Love this place. Food was great Cons: the service was slow yesterday when I went. Took about 30 minutes to get a seat.  About 30 to get food  30 to get the check after finishing food.  Overall experience was good. Garlic noodles for the win.
Ucsm U.,"Concord, CA",4,2,3,4.0,1/27/2017,Last night I went to cheesecake factory with my friends and family. Everything was perfect and the price of the food was really reasonable. The only thing was delay to get dinner that took about 30 min. I hope they will work on it.
Emily C.,"San Francisco, CA",26,143,77,5.0,7/24/2015,"Updating my review to give a new 5 star rating! I've visited this Cheesecake Factory a couple more times since my first review and they have continued to impress me.  My favorite dish, the BBQ salmon, was taken off the menu, but they have still been able to make it for me anyway. As usual, the wait staff is great. They must train them well because they're always polite, attentive, and are very knowledgeable of the ginormous menu. I've been to the Sacramento Cheesecake Factory and it doesn't even compare to the staff and food at this location.  Keep up the good work Walnut Creek Cheesecake Factory! I will be back."
Jones K.,"Walnut Creek, CA",199,249,1156,2.0,4/5/2015,"I had ordered for pick up , and wasn't the best experience , well 1st off the fries were very cold and not tasty . My steak sandwich was missing the bell peppers and onions .  I asked for extra peppers on the side so instead they gave me no peppers in the sandwich and just put it on the all side ... I asked for  one extra avocado eggs roll  sauce and they give me one that wasn't  even fully filled it was less than  half way full .  The bread was even hard and cold too  Very disappointing  Only thing that was good and would of been hard to drop the ball on was the dessert cheese cake I had also ordered , that was very good ..."
David C.,"Berkeley, CA",175,594,521,4.0,8/8/2015,"cheesecake factories are the same anywhere you go, this one has lots of outdoor heated seating and it is very nice.  R Bar staff is very nice and good. Host night was rude and snooty but we ate dinner at the bar.   Parking this very difficult to find and expensive so make sure to have time before to make it"
H K.,"Oakland, CA",2,56,93,5.0,5/21/2016,"I love cheesecake! These were so good. I loved the dulce de leche. My fiend got the Reece's peanut butter, which was also great, but in my opinion tasted more like normal cake. Both were amazing."
Maria C.,"Concord, CA",12,180,784,2.0,5/24/2015,"I am an avid Cheesecake Factory consumer, however, this experience has left a sour taste. Here's my short anecdote:  I use to rave about CF & their calamari. But over the years, the quality has dropped significantly. The calamari was taste-less and the plate was full of deep fried batter crumbs.  I ordered the Chicken Madeira- a dish that I usually order & ALWAYS have loved. My dish came out with golf-ball sized mushroom slices and a quarter inch thick layer of plastic textured cheese. My mashed potatoes were good, I'll give em' that.  Unfortunately, this chain restaurant has definitely evolved for the worse over the years. This will not be my go to restaurant when I'm craving some good American food.  In addition, my server was just plain slow. I'm sure she felt my death stare because a different server asked me if I was ready to order dessert....... 20 min after the original server had passed the menu. SMFH"
Duncan H.,"Napa, CA",252,159,53,4.0,7/30/2015,"The food here has always been good, they did switch my credit card out one time though, that was unfortnate. I've been here many times and each time I have to say that the food was good and the experience as a whole is consistent, which is pretty good considering that it is a chain location. The feel of this resturant is more upscale then the price would lend it, and it's one of the few chain places I come back to on a regular basis. Overall, a good place to eat."
Donna G.,"San Pablo, CA",23,151,13,4.0,4/20/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory and like this location.  The menu can be a little intimidating - it's a spiral bound book.  The first 8-10 pages are drinks.  The portions are huge, so a good place to go if you are starving or want to take home a good amount. I try to get there early enough to order off the lunch menu, where they have several of the menu items priced a few dollars cheaper and the portions are smaller.  That way, can usually get some cheesecake!"
Martina L.,"Antioch, CA",0,12,,5.0,1/16/2017,"I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory! The food is always of great quality, the selection of food is plenty, and I can't say enough about the cheesecake selection. Off the hook! I am never disappointed when I visit this place, I just wish I saw more Cheesecake Factory Restaurants than BJ's Restaurants because I'm settling every time with BJ's."
A R.,"Oakland, CA",0,77,,5.0,1/16/2017,"Like to order:  appetizers: avocado rolls, sweet corn, fried Mac and cheese balls   Soup: chicken tortilla  Salad: tuna tataki Main: fresh salmon with potatoes or chicken marsala  Dessert -- any cheesecake but I can only eat a few bites with a cup of coffee"
Christina C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",22,58,24,4.0,4/10/2016,"Highly recommend this place for brunch, however they do not have breakfast sausages. They did have fresh squeezed orange juice just be prepared for random pieces of orange peel. They have outstanding eggs Benedict and breakfast potatoes. Service was good and since in the morning around 11, it was not a long wait!"
Michelle C.,"Palo Alto, CA",1622,583,3169,4.0,4/3/2014,"Love it or hate it, odds are you've probably been here more than once. I've mostly had good service here (with the exception of the night some famous basketball player got cheesecake to go). The shrimp pasta with tomato sauce sucks. (their tomato and marinara dishes suck in general) The Parmesan crusted chicken is good. The greek salad is good. The chicken and shiitake lettuce wraps are good. The mac and cheese is unholy delicious. I usually get a strawberry daiquiri or strawberry lemonade. I don't like the red velvet cheesecake because it has too much icing. The lemoncello torte is great. That's it for now!"
Melissa H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",9,105,176,3.0,4/25/2016,"I am not a super fan of the Cheesecake Factory because it is JUST ok.  This location is in the heart of downtown Walnut Creek and is always crowded.  The wait times are not terrible despite the crowd. There are so many options on the menu that it is very difficult for indecisive order-ers to decide what they want. Which is great when trying to please a large group of people with varied tastes. I always order wine as the bartenders really can't make a decent drink. They do have great buffalo wings which is kind of a shocker. TL/DR: Go to make mom/grandma/fussy family member happy, stay for wings."
Jesse G.,"Lodi, CA",102,48,34,5.0,9/2/2015,My girlfriend and I are moving to Walnut Creek early next year so we wanted to go check out the neighborhood and downtown area. I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory so decided to go! We had our dog with us so I asked if the outside seating allowed it and they said of course! The food was great and the staff was extremely nice. The waiter asked if the dog wanted anything but we declined. It was such a nice environment that pretty much sold us on the area. We will definitely be returning many times.
Adirco C.,"Alameda, CA",69,13,2,4.0,12/17/2016,"the waitresses were friendly and caring .. the food served at the right time .. but dude they have to work on their dishes ..meet and fishes were not at the desirable level of cooking, and some of the food  had industrial taste.. the desserts were amazing though..i would come back for the desserts and the waitresses but not more than that :)"
Amanda Y.,"Alameda, CA",26,64,5,3.0,3/12/2016,"Crowded and busy most of the time. They have a great happy hour, but in terms of actual meals it's a little pricey and HUGE portion size (if you're watching what you eat it's pretty much one meal from here for the day.)  The cheesecake I'll admit is pretty awesome."
