Melissa S.,"Pittsburg, CA",142,55,181,1.0,4/11/2017,"I would appreciate a phone call or response as soon as possible regarding this weekends visit. I was unfortunately told by one of your Cheesecake Factory wait staff then told by the manager nothing can be done about this problem. I've personally worked in the food industry before and know a transaction as simple as this can be reversed and recharged and therefore fixed. Here is the situation: My waitres told me  my gift cards were ""not good"". I've had these cards for several years and I've been waiting to use them for a very special occasion, for a very long time. It was extremely disappointing to be told they are null and void, since they were a Christmas gift from my grandmother. Allowing room for error I decided to speak to someone in management. Upon explaining to the manager that the gift cards were said ""not good"" it turns out that the cards indeed  we're good and did have the said cash on them.  After finding this out the manager refused to reverse the transaction and fix it. I have 2 gift cards with $25 on them each. Totaling $50. I was told there is ""nothing i can do and that I could use them another time"". This was not than frustrating. On top of all this it was a birthday dinner for my older brother to which they nearly forgot to sing the happy bday song, (a part of the night we were all looking forward to) On 3 occasions I had my fiancé ask to tell them; First when we arrived, second after we placed our order and then when the cheesecake arrived there was no song. That's when I had him go ask for the THIRD time. Finally they came with a scoop of ice cream in a cup and sang. Unfortunately there was so much disappointment the song was just awkward. I forgot to mention how my mom had told the waitress her turtle Cheesecake was hard to eat because it was overwhelmingly peanutbutter flavored. The waitress smiled as if not to hear a word my mother said so my  mother grudgingly finished her unsatisfactory slice. I didn't want to appear forward and ask for a replacement slice. Which I feel now I should have just asked. I understand the stress of a Saturday night in the restaurant industry. However that is what tips are for ""To Insure Promt Service"". I've eaten at Cheesecake many times in the past and  have never received such dissatisfactory service. I can't believe I forgot to mention the alc beverage  that I ordered and did not receive. I'm just blown away at the unacceptable service this night. Not to mention the cob salads my mother and brother both ordered were laden in iceberg lettuce lacking the said bacon and many other listed ingredients the menu had promised. I really hope Someone takes the time to read this and get back to me As soon as possible. I would have no problem sending in the reciepts for a refund. if that is not possible at least be comped for the drink I never received & my mother and brothers birthday cob salads and possibly the  overwhelmingly peanut butter flavored turtle cheesecake (she did eat the majority of the cake slice so I will understand if the last request is not met). I will avidly be awaiting your reply. Thank you for your time."
Dominique M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1969,373,2503,4.0,3/27/2014,It was extremely refreshing being back in my birthplace of Walnut Creek!!! I took my sister out to dinner at the cheesecake factory after we did some shopping off of Main Street. The place has really changed and the city continues to well design the area.  It reminds me of bev Hills ;) I was shocked to see how beautiful the cheesecake factory looked from not seeing it for over two years... I was told by a server that the company invested over $1 million into the redesigning it... It was gorgeous and reminds me of a gorgeous upscale restaurant in Las Vegas. I ordered a goat cheese and Pear flatbread in addition to the veggie burger which was made with beets and it was so delicious! My sister had a simple pasta with red sauce didn't look that amazing but she said it was delicious!  The service was also not bad and that bread basket is always extremely tempting and never left untouched!!! I've never had a bad experience at the cheesecake factory and I look forward to coming back when I'm back in town again :)
Sylvia O.,"Inglewood, CA",159,140,47,5.0,6/1/2015,"I've been to this location many of times and just never wrote a review for it. My most recent visit here with a mentor of mines reminded me of how much I like this place, especially their cheesecakes! My mentor and I came here at 11:30am. They open at 11, so it wasn't at all crowded. In fact, we were able to sit down right away.  The menu, as it has always been, is pretty vast and took me some to decipher. I ended up ordering the salmon and stuffed mushrooms. The salmon was covered with fragrant herbs and cooked perfectly!  Our waitress was helpful and nice. She even gave us some advice on where we could get our cars serviced if we were ever In the walnut creek area. How thoughtful.  Lastly, I ordered the red velvet cheesecake, which is my all-time favorite!! I'll be back"
Scoot T.,"Elk Grove, CA",5,17,6,2.0,4/11/2017,"The scenery is very nice the Tuesday evening we were in for a little dinner. After about nine minutes we were greeted and periodically checked on about every 15 mins or so it was good n all but my lemonade isnt happy :( he has been empty for a long time and I cant help but notice the nice waitress serve others their drinks while i wait, still waiting but the weird thing is when our waiter took our order she asked me will me and my girl friend be sharing a meal ?1??? Before even asking to take my order kind of rude and felt a little judged but hey its a good night and little things wont ruin my night but ive been stalling writing this review and still no refill i would add my table host name but I do not want to get the poor girl in trouble I just will take my money else where its 9:52 and it is tuesday night and im sitting in the tables across from the Bar YAYY LEMONADE HAS ARRIVED and when we asked for more bread since our food is taking really long and our appetizer is long gone she replies one second please and takes more orders and gets their drinks and bread but not ours !! lol go figure she leaves the empty appetizer plate on our table  its been seriously 30 minutes with no food yet as im writing this still no bread after ten minutes and remember she rudely replied one second lol we are the only black young couple in the restaurant i will not be back to this one ill rather take the trip to SF"
becki n.,"Martinez, CA",0,29,1,1.0,5/23/2017,"Very disappointing. Ordered take out on 5/22/17. I ordered my favorite, Miso salmon, brown rice and asparagus. The salmon was a decent size however I barely got any brown rice.When you eat in the portions are much larger. Will never order take out again."
Travis J.,"Concord, CA",0,12,13,5.0,12/22/2016,"Great service... Food even better. Depending on the day/time, the wait can be a little long, but understandable when you're providing great service."
Steph Q.,"Antioch, CA",23,31,96,4.0,3/14/2015,"Told to wait 10 minutes, but only had to wait a little over 8 minutes.  We were seated by a very nice booth big enough for 4 people by a large window. The complimentary bread and butter were nice. Had to ask for small plates for the bread because our server forgot, but no big deal. Back to the bread, the sourdough bread didn't have much flavor, even with the butter. The darker brown bread on the other hand, was delectable! It was very soft and had great flavor, and the butter added to the flavor.  After we ordered, we waited quite a while - about 20 minutes. Our server, Cesar, was nice and addressed us as ""my ladies"" which was so nice.  We ordered the lunch specials: Pasta Carbonara: spaghetti with smoked bacon, green peas, and a Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce ($12.95) and the Skinnylicious Chicken Enchiladas: didn't get a description ($13.50).  The enchilada were on the spicy side for me, but it was nice for my mom. She had some pickled vegetables on the side which she said was refreshing. Good sized salad. My mom said that the enchilada is just a tad salty though.  I enjoyed my Carbonara. It was very creamy. Not a lot of bacon, but I also asked if Caesar could grate a lot of cheese. It was good overall!  Total: $28.70"
Jay M.,"Financial District, San Francisco, CA",64,56,14,4.0,5/11/2016,"Good place , nice rooftop , beautiful view and service . However only one soup was available. Sweet corn which is not tasty at all.  Please add more soups at least make it three . Please please please !  Thanks"
Soha S.,"Livermore, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/29/2017,"Had a bad experience with our visit last night, I ordered a Veggie Cobb salad and everything in the salad looked wilted and not fresh specially the avocado was brown and mushy. I told the waiter and asked to take out the old avocado and replace with fresh ones, he took it and came back and told me that the chef said they will replace the whole salad which me happy. Waited for 15 mins but when he came back it was the same salad, they left the brown avocado but added few new ones in top. It stated terrible and told the waiter when he came to check but gave me a bad excuse that they couldn't take the avocado out so they don't mess the salad which contradicting to what he told that they will replace the whole salad."
Caryn B.,"Alamo, CA",7,74,,4.0,12/30/2016,"I've been here twice. Once with my company for a Christmas lunch and another time on Christmas Eve. Given that they are a chain, they provide good service, good food and a full bar. They also offer valet parking but the validation stamp, I believe only knocks down the price from perhaps $15 to $10 if it doesn't anything at all. It actually might not. I was told the fee for parking in valet. I suppose I'm confused why Cheesecake Factory waste their time stamping the tickets if the fee remains the same. But that is neither here nor there. If you like Shepherd's Pie, theirs is excellent. However I can't comment on cheesecake as a dessert since I don't particularly care for it."
Trish K.,"Danville, CA",0,6,,5.0,12/15/2016,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory after a movie. Had a great server. She was quick and efficient as well as super friendly Cecilia, I believe. The food was good but Cecilia made the whole thing wonderful"
Jun N.,"Berkeley, CA",484,24,11,1.0,1/14/2016,"Man, Cheesecake needs to step it up. I called in for pick up for an entree and sandwich at 1252. I go at 130 to pick up the food, and it wasn't ready. Granted the girl at the cake counter was busy, but it not only took another 20 minutes to get my food, the order was incorrect. It surprised me as the girl who took my call asked for all the necessary details, but lo and be hold, asking for fries on the phone doesn't equate for fries with my order. I went to the hostess to correct my order.  What peeves me the most is that I called for pick up, gave the restaurant ample time to make my order, and Cheesecake still managed to screw up and give me my food an HOUR after I called. The worst part? My herb crusted salmon tastes sour as if the chef just poured the lemon juice over it. It's off putting and almost tastes as if the sauce went bad! So, if I get food poisoning we all know where it came from!  STEP IT UP CHEESECAKE."
Elisita M.,"Richmond, CA",0,10,3,4.0,12/5/2016,The food is really good they have an extended menu and offer sizes so if you're not really hungry you can choose your portion omg the cheesecake amazing there is a wait time but worth it.
Gordon B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",28,2,,5.0,10/25/2016,"Janelle was so phenomenal, it was my birthday and my wife and I took the three kids which we knew would be overwhelming, janelle went above and beyond for us and the evening went so smoothly! She fully entertained our kids and kept them busy and brought out tons of napkins and wet cloths without us asking and gave our kids these amazing sundaes! Extremely personable, the cheese cake factory is lucky to have her!!!"
Tara C.,"Antioch, CA",0,5,,5.0,11/27/2016,"Delicious food, ample choices....and of course dessert is mmmmmm. Very clean and friendly service with minimal wait times."
Yee W.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",21,187,151,4.0,12/31/2015,"Dropped my name, 20 minute wait. Got a table with two plates, but we had 3 people in our party. After our server came with the bread, I had to ask her for an extra plate. Our food came fairly quick. Everything tasted great. The salad was bomb! Stuffed our faces and had room for a slice of original cheesecake! I wish the bathroom had more stalls. Both times we went in, there was a line. One bathroom was out of order."
Maria S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/21/2016,"I went to the cheesecake factory  with my son's for my birthday on the 16th and as usual they don't take reservations and the waiting time is 1/2 hour to 45 min. Once we were seated our waitress brought our drinks but never brought us bread which after 20 min. I had to ask a buss boy for it, then 10 more min went by a total of1/2 hour of before she came back to take our orders. Another half hour went by before we got our food this was the worst service I have ever received, and it totally ruined my night and my birthday. I think that the waiting time to be seated is ridiculous and that something needs to be done about it."
Tami T.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",0,6,,2.0,4/30/2017,Took my family here for my stepsons 26th birthday...waited 50 mins for them to seat 7 adults at a table that accommodates 4 adults. It was almost impossible to get a table big enough for our party. Food and service was mediocre. Won't return.
Nora G.,"Lafayette, CA",3,7,,2.0,7/1/2016,"I have been many times in several Cheesecake Factories, mostly in the SF Union Square or in LA and Sac and I usually love the food, vibe and I hate the wait...  We moved to  Lafayette about 3 years ago and we have the Walnut Creek closer now. Well I waited about 5 bad experiences to write this review. Basically the service is Ok and the location is quite nice but the food is HORRIBLE  And not consistent at all.  NOTHING to do with the Cheesecake Factory level- The people there  cook as they feel like it... and they change completely the way they cook when ordering the exact same thing. It is such a disappointing experience to go to eat and relax ... and have to put up with whatever they serve you. ( It took me a while to learn)  Today I finally spoke with the server and he ""agreed""  with my point then a ""manager "" came to talk to us - took 10 minutes of out time and did nothing about it in the spot. What and apology?!!  Sorry, but that does not fix the experience we had AND  we paid for it! I am starting to leave reviews of bad places  (a monster business like this might not get affected but they may pay more attention after several bad reviews they have)  Still I want to save some people the negative  experience if I can. And I am trying my best to be as objective and fair as possible."
Hye L.,"Danville, CA",173,100,248,4.0,12/31/2015,"There's alway a wait time, but the good point is that u don't need to worry about the parking as its connected with the Stonebridge mall and u know the mall always have a big parking space. The plate of a food it huge; it can serve at least 2 people. Of course the desert, cheesecakes are really thick and creamy and a little too sweet especially chocolates. For sweet lovers here is the place to get some delicious cheesecake !"
