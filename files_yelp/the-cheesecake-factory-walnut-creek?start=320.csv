Hailey M.,"San Ramon, CA",256,17,24,3.0,9/18/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory because it is very diverse in its food selection with good quality food.  I ordered the rice roll wraps, and one time got 6 (was with 3 people) and the other times got four (was with two) but I paid the same price for them. Kinda a rip off. I understand more food for more people but the price should differ. Anyway the first time I got them, they were amazing! The next few times they've been hard and seemed old. The service was fine each time, but not very caring and personal. So it was minimal service. Other than that I'll still come back."
Mrs. P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,5,,5.0,11/9/2016,This place is the best!!! They have soooo many options for food and great service. My husband is gluten free and he can get tons of things on the menu! They are pretty cheap and have a great atmosphere!
Stanley C.,"Pacheco, CA",302,228,47,4.0,11/9/2014,"Classy place. Just like any other Cheesecake Factory. The food is good here too, and so is the service. Location: Nice popular location in downtown Walnut Creek. Free parking in the lot on Locust St. They also have valet. Lots to do around that area while you wait for a table. There is a movie theatre across the street too. Favorites:  Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. Not too sweet, rich chocolate flavor and not super thick/heavy like some other cheesecakes. Pasta Da Vinci - Mushroom/onion/wine flavored penne pasta. I've tried recreating this and it is difficult! I think I need a very specific type of Madeira wine. Definitely try it!"
BrianandJessica S.,"American Canyon, CA",2,4,,2.0,6/21/2016,"Normally we LOVE the Cheesecake Factory, it's one of our faves without a doubt. Tonight however it was a waste of a very rare date night. The kitchen service was incredibly slow, but our server (Celeste)was a delight, although perhaps slightly overwhelmed. Nevertheless, we were still enjoying ourselves until the main entrees came. My husbands was fine, mine was NOT. There were at least 7 chunks of sun-dried tomatoes in a dish (Pasta DaVinci) that should contain ZERO. It completely ruined my meal, and by the time I was able to tell anyone my husband had cleared his plate. The manager offered to make a new one or remove it from my bill...we didn't have time to wait for a new one and I am now heading home to my crazy kids hungry. At the VERY least he could have offered us a comped entree at another time. Customer service fail."
Miranda M.,"Fairfield, CA",0,12,2,4.0,5/1/2017,"The staff is so friendly and very attentive. The cheese cake is the best of course. The food isn't the best and my steak I ordered medium rare came to me well done. I didn't complain because I didn't want to wait another 45 minutes for my food. Also they could let us know when ordering cheese cake to go that not all of it is cheese cake. I got home to eat my cheese cake and it was regular cake. It was good, but I was expecting cheese cake. It's a beautiful place with great staff."
Andrea S.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/14/2016,"We love the Cheesecake Factory but have had several bad experiences at this location.  I rarely write reviews but after last night I figured it was time.  Long story short, we placed a curbside to go order at 6:40pm and was told it would be ready in 30 minutes.  At 7:45 (after waiting on hold and ultimately going into the restaurant), I was handed ONE of our FIVE meals and was told the rest would be coming shortly.   Unfortunately at that point, we needed to leave to be somewhere by 8:00 and couldn't be back until 8:20.  I was told they'd have to ask the manager if they could keep the food warm until we returned.   So ONE HOUR and FIVE MINUTES after placing our TO GO order, we left the Cheesecake Factory with NO FOOD and NO assurance our food would be kept warm upon our return   My kids decided it wasn't worth it to go back."
Steven W.,"Boulder, CO",257,449,20,4.0,2/13/2015,"I had not been to a cheescake factory in years but stopped here for a dinner with a business friend as he had some special coupon/deal. We are both  Big Bang fans so we kept cracking Penny jokes :) that was fun! I ordered the garlic pasta and it was actually surprisingly great!  I did not expect it to be very good so perhaps my ""taste buds expectations"" were exceeded but it was really a dish that I would order again.. Good on ya Cheesecake Factory!"
Kay G.,"Sunnyvale, CA",205,79,8,1.0,9/4/2016,This was not a good experience at all. Slow! Food was not very good. Pasta was still super hard! Slow service I think we had 4 different servers and saw your sever once maybe twice. Food came before drinks. Never to bread that was give to all other Tables. Felt like we where getting ignored.
Murat A.,"Moraga, CA",1,11,,1.0,3/18/2017,"My family had one of the most frustrating dining experiences in this particular location, from customer service to food. It was a chain of events that really turned our Friday night family dinner into a complete headache. First, getting a table... We were told there was a 20 min wait, which was totally acceptable for a Friday. Then at the 20th minute, I go to the front desk to check what's happening and learn that my name is not in the system, there was a ""technical problem"". Saying so sorry, they said now they would expedite our table. Then passes another 20 min, people who came long after us start getting tables, I ask again and they say again sorry, don't know what happened, and now promise to get a table for us right away. And in another 10 min close to 50 min mark, they say our table is ready. By that time, my 3 yr old was starving (going from a 20 min wait to 50 min) and was fussy and we all were feeling exhausted because of such a long wait. So at this point, you would assume they would try to make up for all the frustration. But wait. They show us a table for 2 people! Literally, one of those narrow tiny ones, and suggest bringing over a high chair for my kid, for which there clearly is no room. And going back and forth between the front desk, we finally get a booth, at the 1 hr mark. And the food. What a story. My kid's food, which was supposed to come asap, comes 5 minutes after our food. My wife ordered steak tacos, which came cold, tasted way below mediocre, with tiny amount of rice they put on the side, which was very very dry. I ordered a Shephard's pie. To my surprise, it did not come as a ""pie"" but was basically ground beef and veggies mixed in a bowl with mashed potatoes on top! I had to reconfirm that I got the right meal, because if looked so not like a pie. The taste was way below average, for the $15-20 price mark. We will never go back."
Khadeejah S.,"El Verano, CA",2,43,21,1.0,1/18/2016,I just don't like seeing the nasty things that go on in restaurants... What's in my salt... Come on guys... Too expensive too not get it right
Scott S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,10,,3.0,10/3/2016,"The wait is almost always long whenever you go, at least twenty minutes then another ten minutes before they even ask you what you want to drink, then another ten minutes before you get your beverage.  So if you aren't impatient like me, you might like this place. The ambiance is good and the wide selection on the menu is great but I would rate the quality of the food C+ or B-. So if you are looking for tasteful Italian or Mexican cuisine, you should really go to an Italian or Mexican restaurant."
Paul B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",9,12,1,2.0,8/31/2016,"Tuesday evening dinner was not what I expected. My dinner came barely luke warm. When spending this much for dinner you expect a higher quality. Service was OK. Come on, you can do better!!"
Alexys E.,"Antioch, CA",80,334,325,3.0,1/8/2015,"I like the Cheesecake Factory but their prices are a little steep and inconsistent with what they serve. if their food would live up to the price then I wouldn't complain. Mac and cheese balls:  Tasted good but slightly burnt tasting. Fish tacos: Good rice and beans. 4 tacos, good size, but 2 dry ass lime wedges with no juice in them? Really? Dry lime wedges? Mac and cheese burger: Looked epic, didn't try it. How can you go wrong? Though they did put one of those burnt mac and cheese balls on it... Strawberry lemonade: Bomb  Red velvet cheesecake: Bomb"
Kelly G.,"Aurora, CO",119,389,7889,4.0,2/6/2015,"I ordered the same meal as the one in Pleasanton to compare locations.  I went for lunch and ordered the Calabrian Pizza and a Caesar Salad.  Again, the pizza and salad were brought out at the same time.  This time the pizza was slightly under baked.  It could have stayed in the oven another minute.  The edges of the crust were light and airy, not burned.  But the rest of the crust was flat and heavy. The Caesar Salad had the right amount of dressing on it and was freshly tossed. The server checked on me frequently.  I will be back to use my free cheesecake vouchers."
James R.,"Suisun City, CA",167,496,658,4.0,1/2/2016,"Been here several times and this place is solid. Came here last night with my girlfriend and a friend to celebrate the New Years. The place was absolutely packed. The nearby garage was full, but we got lucky and found one spot. The wait time was 45 minutes, but if hounding mind eating in the bar area you can grab a table and seat if someone's leaving. There are a lot of people standing around in the area so it's best to ask someone sitting if you can sit there after. Our food came very quick. Within 15 or so minutes of ordering it did help we had looked at the menu while waiting to be seated as well. I ordered the bacon bacon cheeseburger with fries. We also ordered the chips and artichoke and spinach dip which was superb. For desert I ordered the Marshmallow and smores cheesecake which was a bit too sweet for me, but was still very delicious. Our waiter was very nice and my only gripe is that everything is still a little overpriced, but I knew what to expect. Overall, good place I will visit again!"
Sue D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/1/2017,"Order Cheesecake to go. There is no line, no organization, can't tell where to purchase and where to pick up. I wait ten minutes to have my order taken, not only because they are busy - but the two cashiers were missing in action for the ten minutes I was waiting. So I finally place my order. After 10-12 minutes I come back and ask the cashier, how will i know its ready, do you call out a number, he says no, we call out the cheesecake. Ok, poor way of organization in a busy place but whatever. Meanwhile there are about a dozen cheesecakes on their counter in to go packages waiting to be picked up - but no one is calling them out! I wait another ten minutes, I think I may have heard one cheesecake called out during that time, and it wasn't for me. I went to the cashier and told him, after 25 minutes now,  if my cheesecake is not ready I want my money back. He looks down and there is my cheesecake that has been sitting there for 20 minutes - I remember seeing it when I went to the cashier the previous time. So much for calling out the cheesecakes. Totally unacceptable service for a paying customer. But I do not blame this totally on the cashiers..it is primarily the MANAGER AT FAULT. If i could give a negative five stars I would. Everytime I go into this restaurant it is chaotic, completely unorganized, and the staff seems miserable. The only thing nice there was the cheesecakes. But that was my last visit - its got bad vibes and it seems the entire staff is unhappy. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY IN WALNUT CREEK. ITS CLEAR THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE A MANAGER RUNNING THIS STORE, NOR DO THEY TRAIN THEIR EMPLOYEES. NOTE TO TERRITORY MANAGER:  Are you also aware that your store offers no comment cards, per the front desk male hostess tonight - no wonder there is no opportunity to improve your business."
Briana S.,"Martinez, CA",0,1,,4.0,4/17/2017,I usually love this place it has been my favorite restaurant for about a year now. I've never cared much about the 30-2 hour wait they have because I love the food so much. Lately I feel that they have gotten a new chef or something has changed. The last couple times I've gone there have not been so pleasant. One time about a month ago me and my boyfriend went to dinner and I got a chicken entree with a pasta and the chicken was amazing but the pasta was half uncooked. I didn't think much of it other than it was the only bad experience and the main part of my food was good. Then the time after I ordered the same thing and so did my boyfriend. This time the chicken which I had loved was really bland and didn't taste very good. Also the pasta wasn't good either. I thought the chicken was just mine but my boyfriends tasted the same. I hope they change something because I love that place a lot.
Stephanie K.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,8,1,3.0,12/28/2016,"I loved the food. We sat at the bar however because it wasn't staffed properly and there was a 20 minute wait with closed sections on a Wednesday afternoon. The bartender, our server, was attentive and nice. We had gift certificates for free slices of cheesecake that we were told were expired and the restaurant refused to honor them. That has soured me on the cheesecake factory and I doubt I will visit again any time soon."
Jennifer N.,"Walnut Creek, CA",442,1068,2967,3.0,9/10/2014,"If you want to avoid the long lines here, a weeknight is your best bet. I'm simply not a fan, in general of The Cheesecake Factory. I don't get all the hoopla and hours long wait. But, when family is in town, they seem to consider this a ""celebratory"" spot during their trip. I guess on the positive tip, there should be something for everyone on the menu-it's vast. Some vegetarian options, but nothing that I'd come out of my way got. If you are veg, stick with the salads-their veggie burger was pretty appalling. It's an odd blend of grains that don't really mesh in to a patty and generally pretty flavorless. On a positive note, the service is usually prompt and friendly. The warm bread is my favorite part and the decor is interesting to look at. I don't really care for cheesecake, so that whole element is lost on me. It was a 2 star meal for me but to be fair I gave the whole experience a 3-I mean I can't fault a place with ""cheesecake"" in their name when I don't partake in their main feature...."
Terri N.,"Concord, CA",532,725,2900,4.0,5/9/2013,"With 552 reviews ahead of me, I'm just gonna keep it simple - here are my highlights! CHICKEN CROQUETTES - Put them back on the menu!! AVOCADO EGG ROLLS - Epic, definitely their best appetizer! BIKINI MARTINI - Put it back on the menu!!  The bartender was kind enough to make it for me though.  :)  THAI CHICKEN PASTA  - Put it back on the menu!! ORANGE CHICKEN - Delicious, and a portion big enough for 3! BANG BANG CHICKEN & SHRIMP - Yummy thai flavors!  While not exactly authentic, it's thai light and still very tasty.  Makes great leftovers too!  The toasted coconut is magic.   CHICKEN MADEIRA - Still so great, love the sauce and mashed potatoes!  Easily a 2 meal portion.   RED VELVET CHEESECAKE - Their crowning achievement - this cheesecake is downright miraculous.  TUXEDO CREAM CHEESECAKE - Best presentation of them all, chocolatey without being TOO heavy.   CARROT CAKE CHEESECAKE - Wow.  If you want carrot cake, get this and not the cake on its own, this is much better.  LIMONCELLO CREAM TORTE - My favorite dessert in the whole place!  Texturally magnificent, I want my wedding cake to be made of this.  Yummy as always!"
