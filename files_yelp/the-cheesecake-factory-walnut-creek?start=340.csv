Sydney P.,"Richmond, CA",21,12,39,4.0,12/20/2014,"My experiences at the Cheesecake Factory have always been so-so. I've been to many different locations but this one has got to be my favorite. The wait time was a lot shorter today (which is very odd because it's the weekend), but the service is so friendly! The unlimited, complimentary bread and butter is also a bonus. I got the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and the Lunch Special Herb Crusted Fillet Salmon. It was delicious; by far my wisest combination.  - The salmon alone is cooked well, topped with plenty of herbs. It also comes with a special sour sauce, mashed potatoes, and 4 asparaguses. - I personally think the pasta I've gotten today is their best. I've tried others before and they definitely don't taste like ""4 stars"". But this specific one has certainly outdone itself. It has the perfect combination of sautéed shrimp and chicken with different peppers. Their Cajun Sauce is so rich, that it perfectly brings the whole dish together. It says ""Very Spicy"" but I think it has more of a small spicy after-taste (which I loved, but spices depend on different people).  Overall, it was one of the best experiences I've had. The prices weren't bad, based on the portions they come in. I wish I could've changed the pasta serving size because it was way more than I needed (I brought it home)."
Philip S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",219,5,,2.0,12/22/2016,"We called in to make a reservation and then they made us wait on the phone for 10 minutes listening to garbage music. The restaurant proceeded to not pick up and tease us. So disrespectful, definitely expected better. Disappointed in my local restaurant."
Hayden T.,"Vallejo, CA",0,2,1,1.0,8/26/2017,my house burger tasted like i bit into a band aid! so gross along with my fries tasting like shrimp????
Sivilay T.,"Orinda, CA",67,735,1929,4.0,12/12/2014,"I've been to this location on many occasions, but never got around to writing a review... Came here for dinner around 6 PM with my sister and our friend last night to celebrate my 36th birthday. We ordered quite a bit of food and had a great time chatting over dinner. My sister had the steak Diana and shrimp scampi combo. I had the garlic noodles with shrimp. Our friend had the Chinese chicken salad. We also shared two appetizers, the artichoke dip and the avocado eggrolls. I didn't try my sister's or our friend's dish, but it seemed like they liked their food since none of us had any complaints. I liked the artichoke dip the most out of the three items that I did try.  My garlic noodles were just ok, nothing that truly stands out.  As far as the avocado eggrolls, I'm not a big fan of onions so that kind of put me off already and the dipping sauce was really sweet. Our server, I believe his name was Manual, was very sweet and attentive.  He's very accommodating and didn't seem annoyed by the fact that we asked him to come back and take our orders in several trips.  We each ordered our drinks separately because we arrived in separate cars, minutes apart. Their mango key lime cheesecake is definitely worth making the extra room for."
Conner W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/9/2016,"First off, super friendly front desk! They make you feel so welcome! Got there at about 7pm on a Friday with my family and the wait was about an hour. Completely understandable as I know this place is so popular! We decided to hang around the bar area and catch the Giants game on tv. Lucky enough we were able to get a high top table as someone was leaving. The busboy Lester introduced himself and quickly cleared our table! Super friendly! We decided to stay in the bar and received excellent service from our waiteress Andrea, she was so attentive and caring. I got the crusted chicken romano, my personal favorite, and it was delicious! Props to the cooks. Overall had a great experience and would highly recommend!! Oh and the music playlist here is the bomb! Got to listen to Adele at least 3 times. Fun atomosphere."
Jessica R.,"San Pablo, CA",0,12,1,2.0,12/11/2016,"We had a party of 12 for a company dinner, they don't take reservation, we had to wait 3 hours, they should have told us over the phone it would take a few hours so someone could have went in advance, finally after all that wait, it took forever to get some bread at least and or drinks. You would think after waiting for hours they would make it up with good service. Nope"
Susan D.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/2/2016,"Ate at this restaurant yesterday.  Had an amazing experience but had to do a little more to ensure a better experience.  I had read the mixed reviews and was a little apprehensive about going to this location.  We needed a central location for 11 of us to meet and celebrate a birthday for one of our family members.  Two of our members had a less than stellar experience at this location.  So I called a few days a head of time and asked a manager what should I do to make sure our experience is better given these reviews. I was told to come in an hour before the needed time and to ask for certain areas in the restaurant that would accommodate our group.  I arrived one hour ahead of my needed time, spoke to Alexis at the front and she was ever so accommodating.  She said she remembered my call and to let her know when the group got here.  Our group was delayed by crazy traffic Alexis was concerned about the time and holding tables.  I understood totally as I could see that there were so many groups coming and going over the time I waited.  We were seated and the service was wonderful, the food was excellent.   AlI can say is I am glad that I called and mentioned the reviews and got some tips on how best to work with the restaurant especially with a large group.  I am also grateful to the reviewers because I was more acutely aware of what was going on at the restaurant. But most of all thank you to Alexis at the front of the restaurant who was very professional and worked with me to make this occasion a success!!'"
Johanna L.,"East Bay, CA",128,199,849,3.0,10/14/2014,"Well it's a chain and chains are all the same wherever you go right? Actually, this location is embedded within the ritzy shopping area of Walnut Creek and seemed fancier than other locations I've been to. It was busy for a late Monday evening but not crazy packed  like Pleasanton or San Francisco always is! Service was very slow BUT I could see they only had 2 servers so that is understandable.  I ordered a couple of appetizers and it was delicious - Avocado Egg Rolls, Pot Stickers, and Thai Style Lettuce Wraps. Oh, and I was offered a to-go cup for my strawberry lemonade refill which usually never happens! It is expected that you just finish it there.  Lots of TVs at the bar if you wanted to come catch the game. Outside patio seating with heat lamps available - great for a warm night or people watching. Would love to come back to this location again next time I come to shop!"
Paul B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,22,,2.0,3/31/2017,Came here for some appetizers late at night. The brown bread was burnt. We waited for our fried calamari way too long . When it finally came it was too soggy and had too much batter.
Mark C.,"Martinez, CA",1,28,36,3.0,8/7/2016,"Look, if you are coming here for the food, you are just kidding yourself. This place makes its name off their cheesecake, not their high calorie but surprising tasteless main course meals. We come here once a year because our children like it. But nothing from the bland food or the high turn, personality-less service makes this a return destination for adults. So come for the loud atmosphere and indulgent desserts. And leave the other expectations at home"
Quynh D.,"San Pedro, CA",256,7,7,1.0,2/1/2017,"In the past, I have always loved going to Cheesecake Factory.  This location has; however, been extremely disappointing.  My boyfriend and I came in for dinner.  We had purchased 2 appetizers and the Jambalaya Chicken pasta.  The appetizers came out and everything was going well.  Appetizers were tasty and service was quick.   We were already getting quite full.  We asked for a to go box to take our pasta to go.  As we were loading our pasta, we noticed that is was way over cooked.  The noodles were clumping together and the dish tasted quite bland.  It took us over 10 minutes to flag down our waiter.  He looked it the dish and apologized to us and agreed we it was over cooked.  He took it back and got the pasta remade.  We took it home only to realize that they just recooked the pasta and put the old sauce over the new pasta.  Our new chicken jambalaya pasta just tasted like bland pasta.  Our pasta was extremely disappointing.  We didn't even eat it and threw it away.  I really hope this Cheesecake Factory gets it together because my boyfriend and I love going there.....when they can get it right."
D F.,"東京都, Japan",0,2,,1.0,9/5/2016,"I have come here about 15 times over the few months and the only hope of getting a table in less than 40 minutes is bar seating.  It would seem an organisation and restaurant of this size would move into the 21 st century with respect to reservation and seating.  I guess they can get away with the disrespect for their customers time while the economy is good. The food is okay but can be inconsistent from time to time and it is definitely not cheap! Well I was dumb enough to try again.  I came at 5:45 pm this time (very early by my standards as suggested by management.  Wait is 35 minutes and no buzzers available.  I repeat, they have no respect for their customers time."
Cal P.,"San Francisco, CA",1,38,2,5.0,9/4/2016,Great service and food! We were really impressed by how quick and responsive our waiter was and they also allowed or small pooch on the patio! They had great customer service and the ambience is amazing! Will alway go back to this location !
Rachelle W.,"Brentwood, CA",0,28,1,1.0,9/4/2016,"Went here for Sunday brunch and while we were waiting for table, hubby went to restroom and observed one of their cooks walk out of the restroom stall wearing his apron and walk straight out of restroom without washing his hands. Hubby followed him out of restroom and informed me so we watched him, he walked right back into kitchen and continued handling items and cooking, never missed a beat. We immediately returned our pager and cancelled our table request. Gross!! So sad because I totally HEART their cheesecakes but I'm traumatized Our last dinner here for family B-Day was disappointing as well, food took forever to come out and then was cold."
Savannah K.,"Brentwood, CA",0,7,,4.0,3/26/2017,"AMAZING food and dessert! I've never been torn between so many decisions on a menu before. The service is good and the atmosphere is really nice. Went here for a date night, I highly recommend for a nice dinner out."
KT T.,"Fair Oaks, CA",11,26,13,2.0,10/3/2015,"For as popular this place is, you'd think the food would be better. We sat inside, one side of us facing a mirror. I dont want to see myself eat! Anyway besides that, people stand waiting to be seating at the short wall that many of the tables are up against and can watch you eat - Really? Seriously, who wants to be watched by all these people waiting to be seated. The design is prob to encourage people to eat quickly and leave. I ordered skinnylicious chopped salad - in the darkened room, it looked like a pile of brown wilted lettuce. Tasted ok but man, it was the ugliest pile of lettuce/salad I've seen.  My husband's $15.95 spaghetti and meatballs was bland and boring. Hospital style food at it's best. Now I can't comment on the cheesecakes as we were pretty discouraged at our meals and just wanted to get out of dodge, but in the past I recall them being pretty good. Needless to say, next time if I want to go out, I'll take a pass on being watched while I eat bland food and brown wilted lettuce."
Jeremy R.,"Quintana Roo, Mexico",0,2,,1.0,6/19/2016,"Service was slow (dinner took 2h, 8pm to 10pm), didn't bring my drink, ran out of wings but charged for it on the bill. General bad slow service."
Don A.,"Antioch, CA",0,31,11,4.0,9/22/2016,"In a sea of poor reviews for all local Cheesecake Factory locations, I'd like to toss a thumbs up to the WC CAKE location, placed a order to go over the phone today, young lady that took the order was friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable, upon arriving to pick up my order, it wasn't quite ready at the time stated, 5 or so minutes late. the two ladies working the Cheesecake/ To Go area were super friendly and did a good job with my order insuring all items (Factory Burrito, Hazelnut Cheesecake, bread butter, misc. items to go on burrito) were in the bag ready to go. all in all, no major issues."
Lisa R A.,"Vallejo, CA",41,10,,1.0,8/11/2016,"We did call at 11:00 the morning to ask about accommodating our party and were told that if our party was there before 5:30 we would be accommodated. Unfortunately, your employees have a problem communicating with each other so the request was not honored."
Elizabeth A.,"Pittsburg, CA",2,18,,4.0,8/10/2016,Be ready for a wait if you come for dinner. This place is always busy whether u come on the weekend or on a weekday. They have a great selection on the drink menu as well as having an overwhelmingly huge food menu. The food tastes good and come in huge portions. Very pricey if you ask me tho.
