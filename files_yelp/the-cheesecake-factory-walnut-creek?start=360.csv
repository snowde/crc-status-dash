Eric V.,"Fairfield, CA",10,52,27,3.0,9/6/2015,"The cheesecake excellent.  The food hit or miss. On our most recent visit I ordered the stuffed chicken tortillas which were great.  They are basically chicken enchiladas with green sauce.  This not being a Mexican food place I was skeptical of what they would taste like but this instantly became my favorite item on the menu. The flavor was exceptional, meat was tender and the sides were great.   The reason why I say hit or miss on the food is because I have had some not great tasting food...  Example being the buffalo chicken sandwich the buffalo sauce is poor and the chicken was overly crispy.  I think they might do better on the food end of they paired down there menu, the menu is huge and it's difficult to be great at so many different foods.   I have never had any service problems at this location.  It can get very crowded but it's a popular location so you should expect a wait if you come at the busy times.   The Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake is epic.  Never meant a cheesecake I didn't like so good.  Definitely have dessert!"
Sandy M.,"Pittsburg, CA",48,11,19,4.0,9/12/2016,I love the cheese cake factory! It's my favorite spot to dine at but I hate how long there wait time is. So now I just don't come in on Fridays or Saturday's when I know I will have to wait 2 or more hours to be able to eat . Plus they don't refill your bread basket unless you at ask. Service is alright I would say. Sometimes you will get lucky and get a great server. Overall food is delicious!
Bryan N.,"Fairfield, CA",189,18,,2.0,2/17/2017,"Going downhill. I met my family there for lunch recently and the service took forever. I was on my lunch break so I was extra sensitive about time. I would not suggest going there if you only have an hour for lunch breaks. It took us nearly an hour and a half without waiting to be seated since we got there rather early. Most restaurants try to get you in and out at lunch time because they know working people in the area don't have a lot of time to spend for lunch. As for the food, it was OK. Not like it used to be. It seems as though they have cut portions down tremendously. I ordered the Tuscan chicken with Farro and I kid you not, there was only about 2 tablespoons of Farro and the chicken portions looked about half the size they were a year ago. My wife got the chicken lettuce wraps and also stated that the chicken portions were much smaller than they used to be. My youngest son's cheeseburger was laughable. My oldest son got the kids salmon and vegetables which seemed to be the only dish that was of proper proportions. We even finished off with a slice of banana cheesecake which seemed to be half the size it usually is. Unsatisfied stomach. I'm probably not going back."
Marc S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,5,1,2.0,3/11/2016,Line long outside. Opening was late. Doors didn't open till 7 min after 11:00am. Workers inside looked like they didn't care people have to be somewhere and are just trying to fit in a quick meal. If in a rush.... Don't go here. And don't expect it to open on time...
C R.,"Livermore, CA",0,73,,2.0,3/23/2017,"My shrimp was way over cooked, my fries tasted old. And they never refilled my water. Now at night with a huge stomach ache im thinking the shrimp was not overlooked just old. There's a hundred restraunts in the area, go somewhere else. Ugh"
Sydney J.,"Manteca, CA",1,9,11,1.0,8/26/2014,If I could give no stars I would I don't like to write bad reviews but I eat at cheese cake once a week  The manager here was very rude first off  My food came so oily cold nothing like I have ever had  My husband plate was so plain it was just horrible  The manger had a attitude prob and didn't seem to want other manager to come over I will never come to this cheese cake again  Never been treated so rudely
Morgan P.,"San Francisco, CA",11,74,40,5.0,10/7/2015,"Agin CF served us right! Tonight we had the chicken samosa small plate and the Parmesan garlic bread, both of which were super delicious!  Our server is super nice and has a great personality that's genuine and funny and he kept my water filled which is a plus!  Entrees we ordered the chicken and dumplings again because I was craving chicken pot pie, and boyfriend got the hibachi steak per the servers suggestion. Really great flavor and it was cooked to a perfect medium as ordered!  Just really pleased with our visit overall tonight. Kitchen staff: you're on fire tonight keep it up!!  Thank you for a great visit!"
Andrea P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",74,5,3,5.0,8/15/2016,Angel M. Is THE BEST server I've ever had. He's a sweetheart.  Very attentive! Seems as though he truly cares about the customer experience. He made my mom's birthday dinner very special. YAAAAAS P.s. Its only a 5 star because of him... P.s.s food was cool
Tony M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",25,1,1,1.0,5/31/2016,"If I could give zero stars I would. The service was the worst since the last time I was here. Thought I would give it another shot, bad idea. Took 20 min to bring the table sugar after we ordered iced tea. Took 20 min to bring our appetizers, well half of them. The told us they were out of the egg rolls we ordered when they told us the appetizers were almost ready. Then they came back to tell us they no longer serve my wife's dinner 40 min after we ordered. Then they offered to comp the egg rolls. I can go on but I'm sick of giving any more of my time to this place."
Saisundar R.,"Fremont, CA",249,17,18,4.0,8/11/2015,"I have been here on a few occasions now. I have enjoyed the experience everytime.  Be prepared to wait around 10 minutes if you are coming on a weekend.  The service is usually lively, and the atmosphere is noisy and happening.  They have a bar with two big screens, and the bar's usually crowded on most days.  The food is typically heavy, and we inevitably have to take home two boxes of unfinished food. . I would recommend the eggplant parmesan, the avocado rolls, the fried Mac and cheese, the pizzas and of course their cheesecakes.  It's a nice place, is very close to some happening bars and a movie theatre to boot."
Gabrielle T.,"Oakland, CA",219,258,528,1.0,6/23/2015,"So gross! Of course I know the Cheesecake Factory is disgusting and avoid it and chain restaurants of it's low-rung, overpriced caliber at all costs. But a friend's graduation lunch was hosted here and I had no choice. Out of what can only be described as an overwhelming (and clearly self-sacrificing to the point of physical and potentially gastrointestinal detriment) love for my BFF, I obliged.  I arrived and could smell the mixture of something sickeningly sweet, heavy cream, too much cheese and 16-year-old, overworked waiter sweat as soon as I entered the establishment. The place was a-bustle and a-shuffle with workers scrambling to accommodate throngs of graduates and their families and I immediately felt sorry for the staff as they hoisted ginormous portions more fitting for whole families than for one patron in front of folks. I navigated through tacky decor, oversized tables and beneath creepy imitation Vatican ceilings until I met up with my group and we began ordering. I ordered the Kale and Quinoa Salad and asked for the parm' and ""Lemon Vinaigrette"" on the side, in anticipation of what I figured would be a disgusting and muddy mess of a dressing. As could be guessed, the dressing (or horse slop, whichever you choose to believe) arrived in a silver saucer and looked to be the consistency and color of Dijon mustard. I asked the server if I could have a balsamic dressing instead, at which point she brought over a big ass bottle of balsamic and a bottle of olive oil and pretty much expected me to have at it.  This is the part where I return the salad and remind myself that I should've never expected anything other than this from the Cheesecake Factory, offenders of all things culinary and worthwhile. I would rather see all of my friends drop out of college, rebuke their Masters program acceptance offers and become streetwalkers than attend another graduation luncheon at this place. Ever."
Neila W.,"Memphis, TN",1,12,2,1.0,8/12/2016,"This is by far the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever visited. The host staff are never able to seat us in the time they say and we've actually been skipped on two occasions. While the food is typically on par with The Cheesecake Factory, this visit left little to be desired. Since when did they start leaving tails on the shrimp in the gumbo? Management and staff need to be a bit more attentive to customers."
FeriDon D.,"Embarcadero, San Francisco, CA",32,25,78,5.0,1/1/2016,Great way to start New Year with our traditional lunch at Cheesecake Factory. Great service by Matt. He Is friendly as he is efficient! Make sure to ask for him. Like always food is great and love those mai tais ;)
Alan F.,"Hercules, CA",67,383,62,4.0,6/28/2015,"A good, reliable chain restaurant that my wife and I often visit when we see a movie at the Century Walnut Creek downtown, across the street.  A huge room, its décor cheery but somewhat ongepotchket.  Covered, heated outdoor seating available. Separate bar area.  Large, mid-priced menu, nothing terribly adventuresome but everything well-executed.  Today's dinner consisted of a good, mildly-seasoned white chicken chili and a big serving of fold-your-own Thai-style chicken lettuce wraps, with peanut sauce, tamarind sauce, and a sweetish mint-chili sauce.  Topped off, of course, with the house's signature cheesecake--tiramisu and mango-Key lime--both great, though I might have streamlined the process if I had simply injected them directly into my coronary arteries.  Friendly and attentive server (though, alas, resembling Telly Savalas more than Penny on /The Big Bang Theory/).  Restrooms scrupulously clean.  Free parking in a three-level city structure across the street, though this is sometimes full; valet parking service also available.  In short, a place we'll keep coming back to; wish it were closer to home!"
NoraLesa C.,"Vallejo, CA",122,20,7,5.0,10/22/2016,Came here with some co workers after work to have a fun Saturday night it was packed so we were prepared for a long wait but we were able to be seated right away at the bar which was a plus. Mike Banks was our waiter and he was awesome very attentive and had great customer service even though he was obviously very busy. We weren't satisfied with our artichokes the first time and he was more than happy to get our order right and accommodate us while we waited for it to be fixed and still kept a great attitude. He kept our drinks full which is a must when going out after a long day. Thanks so much for the great service mike you should be employee of the month and if you're reading this my blonde friend Shanna thinks you're very cute.
Chad W.,"Lake Havasu City, AZ",295,25,,5.0,9/7/2016,My favorite place ever! Great food! Best service! And a very nice building! You must eat here! It's soooo good!
Corey B.,"Oakland, CA",9,21,9,5.0,4/17/2016,"One of my favorite Cheesecake Factory restaurants. Service is usually good. Been coming to this one for a long time and I have only had one major issue with my food, and the manager was really cool and handled the situation extremely well. He gave me my food for free and included a free slice of cheesecake for myself and my fiancé. The wait can be long sometime, but that's depending on when you come in. I usually order the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and the cucumber lemonade. My favorite!!!"
Mouang S.,"San Pablo, CA",11,5,6,3.0,8/15/2015,"This wasn't my first time dining in at this particularly location. I immediately made my way to the front to put in my request for a table for two and was seated about 5-10 minutes later. Which is great!  Now, the only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because the young woman that seated us was a bit snarky. She led us to our table and upon arrival she drops our menus, picks it up, and just leaves. We were then served by another young lady (thank goodness) that made the whole experience much more pleasant than it originally began. I went with their Chipotle Pasta, which wasn't as good or flavorful as I wanted it to be. I then ordered their Mango Key Lime Cheesecake which was a little too sweet for me, but it was tasty.  Overall, I would say the dinner ended on a good note. Let's just hope next time I choose a more appetizing dish."
Lisa Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",76,350,1326,4.0,7/2/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory is pretty huge. Less waiting time and better than the sf and pleasanton locations. I was literally in and out of there in 1 hr! Service was great! They gave us a lot of complimentary bread (the wheat w oatmeal is the best!) Virgin piña colada - OMG SO DELICIOUS. I could drink this all day everyday! Pasta - I always get the shrimp angel hair or the Louisiana chicken pasta (today I had the latter). Chicken was kind of dry but overall, the pasta was great. I was tempted, but forwent the Parmesan for a ""tad bit"" healthier pasta dish ;) The Steak Diane was okay in my opinion. I've had better before but come on, it's Cheesecake Factory so what more do you want? The $19.95(!)dinner combo w the Steak Diane and herb crusted salmon is a really good deal! My friend ordered that and it came w a generous portion of mashed potato and asparagus."
