Marisa K.,"San Ramon, CA",27,20,7,5.0,7/15/2016,"Consistently great food, service and drinks. Can count on getting a dish I enjoy and not being let down. I would say WC Cheesecake is MUCH better than Pleasanton."
Peter H.,"Martinez, CA",166,40,,5.0,8/17/2015,"Macaroni and Cheese Burger. When you take the first bite, close your eyes. Boom, thank me later."
Maya L.,"Pinole, CA",308,67,,3.0,10/31/2016,always a big wait....but it's ok....the food is decent like the chain....I just feel like it's kind of slow....
Melisa R.,"Vallejo, CA",2,14,1,1.0,7/10/2016,Service is horrible. I seriously stood at the take out cashier for 10 mins for someone to help me. I then went to the host and asked If the people currently standing behind the cashier could help. She said yea yea yea miss they can help. Twice.  Like i was bugging. I can't dine here because the wait is way to long and service is hit or miss. I can't do a take because the wait is too long. Order 2 lunch salads to go and I've been waiting for 30 mins. Food is good but pricey. I rather take my money and spend it else where for good service!!!
Jordan B.,"Vallejo, CA",52,305,471,4.0,11/24/2015,"Went here for a friends bday! Ordered the dynamite shrimp, calamari and the baja chicken tacos with rice and beans. Great service and good food. Restaurant is very beautiful, the lighting's a little too dim for me though. Anyways great place to go with friends"
Douglas L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",790,16,86,5.0,6/29/2014,"I like the Steak  Diana, Chicken Balaggio etc Good SERVICES, Good ambiance, nice Bar  Good for Parties"
Myranda B.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,6,,4.0,1/19/2016,"Let me start by saying I was not expecting a chain restaurant to wow me like this. The building is beautiful, inside and especially out. Service was excellent, very friendly and not too invasive. The food was delicious! I ordered the Crusted Chicken Ramano and I'll more than likely be ordering it again next time. Loaded Baked Potato Tots on the small bites menu was perfect as an appetizer. Drinks were also delicious, could use a bit more alcohol.  Deducted 1 star for bathroom cleanliness being below average and not stocked well. All around, will definitely return and suggest to friends."
Linda A.,"Vallejo, CA",0,8,,1.0,8/10/2016,"Horrible, horrible place.  We were basically refused service.  We called ahead and said we had a wedding party of 30 people and the person on the phone said if we got there 30 minutes ahead of time, she could seat us.  Different story when we got there.  We were told it would be 1 1/2 - 3 hours before we could be seated although there were empty tables in the bar area.  When I asked why we couldn't be seated there, he said those table were for people waiting!!  Never going back to Cheesecake in Walnut Creek."
B A.,"Oakland, CA",0,8,8,1.0,1/16/2016,"I ordered a chicken & avocado club to go and brought it home 25 minutes away, only to find the sandwich had no avocado present.  I called the restaurant as soon as I opened the container and asked for a manager.  I knew on a busy Saturday night it might take 5-10 minutes for someone to pick up, but not 50 minutes.  The manager seemed apologetic, but this is an unacceptable amount of time anyone should have to wait.  The manager will be sending a gift card to make up for the sandwich mistake, but I hope someone reads this and uses it as an example to their staff and management.  No one should be made to wait on the phone for this long.  Draft a process on phone handling an escalated call or install a phone system that alerts the attendant that the caller on the line has been waiting for an extended period of time."
Robell N.,"Angwin, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/5/2017,"So when we came here, with a relatively big group, they said we would have to wait an hour even though I saw open spaces. So we waited and then when we finally sat down it took us 15 minutes to get drinks. The service was extremely slow and has only gotten slower and they forgot to put in some of our orders. The food, that we did receive, did not even taste good. The service was not only slow but evidently overwhelmed and rude. This is a horrible establishment."
Gg t.,"Martinez, CA",0,60,49,3.0,8/6/2016,"I've been here a few times. Like it.  Food is always pretty good.  Friday after work it was busy but not on full yet so not a long wait. Server was mediocre.  Mom asked for coffee, she came back to table twice without it???  Ordered a passion fruit Mojito. It was not worth the $12.95. Taste like a regular Mojito with wayy too much mint. Had to fish out the Forrest before drinking.  Tried the Linda chocolate cake, pretty good"
Andrea P.,"Concord, CA",4,76,12,2.0,6/11/2016,1 star for the bistro shrimp pasta that I love 1 star for the cheesecake that always hits the spot -3 stars for the customer service that has seriously declined within the last year.  Management please get it together and train your people better than this!
Dree H.,"Oakland, CA",2,24,8,2.0,6/11/2016,I came here it was an hour wait so we waiting at the bar area for open seating . We have been waiting 45 minutes and a couple is hounding over a table to sit when someone is up. That seems a little rude if you ask me. I wouldn't want anyone hounding me rushing me to get up. I was next in line to sit down told the people at the front desk and nothing has been done they said they would get the manager and I am still here waiting. Good customer service ? I think not ! worse service and I love Cheesecake Factory never again
Don W.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/16/2016,"Wow... Very disappointed with the food at cheese cake factory. We were a party of nine and arrived early Saturday night.  Food took a long time to arrive which is understandable on a busy Saturday night-that is not my complaint.  Finally, everyone received their food except for me.  I ordered a spinach, bacon, mushroom and cheese omelette.  When my omelette finally arrived it was cold.  The spinach was not even cooked (like eating a salad in your omelette).  Also, the wrong type of cheese was in the omelette.  I could only eat the surrounding egg.  I never complain; it was the worst omelette I have ever had.  Another family member had the mushroom burger and said that it tasted horrible as well. I must give credit where credit is due.  The waitress was very nice.  The manager came over, listened to me and threw in a couple of slices of cheese cake for free to compensate.  It was a nice gesture and I thank him for that.  But I will not be going back..."
Ryan H.,"Danville, CA",224,17,,2.0,8/3/2016,"I feel like The Cheesecake Factory is over-hyped. Im not sure if any other locations are better, but the one in Walnut Creek needs improvement. Its been a while since I've been there, but some negative things Ive found about the restaurant were: Customer Service was a bit of an issue; employees spilling drinks on people (only happened once), drinks and food take for ever to come out, some employees can be somewhat forgetting, and 50% of the time, the food comes out the wrong way (either under/over cooked). Prices are fine due to the portion size and food quality (if it comes out the right way). The atmosphere is also a wow factor. I enjoy the multi-level seating. If you don't mind waiting a decent amount of time. Overall, this place can use some work, but it has the potential to be the best eatery in Walnut Creek if they put in the time to make sure everything is in check."
Lauren C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,19,2,1.0,7/12/2016,"After waiting for over 10 minutes to even be acknowledged, my husband and I ordered. I ordered the chipotle chicken pasta. My pasta was missing the bell peppers and had hardly any sauce. My husbands BBQ smokehouse burger was missing the onion strings on top and the ranch he asked for. It took over 45 minutes for us to even get our food. And then after all of it we ordered cheesecake and the server brought me the wrong kind, that I hadn't ordered. Overall pretty irritating experience to say the least."
Greg T.,"Walnut Creek, CA",489,38,122,4.0,9/16/2014,"3.5/5 Caution: arrive early, this place gets really packed!! The complimentary bread they give you is delicious!! Homemade Pumpernickel and Sourdough i believe.  Waited a bit long for the food but the place seemed really busy and at least there was bread to nibble on, that always makes it a little better. Chicken Pasta with Scampi Sauce - very big portion: lots of chicken cut into bite sized pieces, spaghetti noodles, creamy scampi sauce, basil, diced tomatoes, and roasted garlic chunks. Very refreshing taste even though the sauce was creamy. Not too heavy. The chicken was seared to a nice golden brown but was definitely lacking flavor. If the chicken was more flavorful this dish would have been perfect."
Amber P.,"Brentwood, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/20/2017,"Very Disappointed!! We got seated and I took at least 10 min for the server to introduce himself and ask for drink orders. We ordered drinks, and he gave my husband a different beer than he asked for but my husband didn't want to deal with asking him for another one since the server seemed annoyed as it was.  When we ordered our food, I thought he would come and bring bread/butter like everyone else and he didn't, so I had to wave him down to ask for some and all he said was ""ok"". Not ""sorry!"" let me get that right out for you!. He brought it, then we didn't get our meals for another 40 min. We had an appt to be at so when we were half way through lunch I waved another server to ask for our bill so we could leave because our server wasn't around. We rushed through our food, didn't even get to enjoy it, and leave. It sucked. Mind you, it was not a busy day at all. It was a monday, and we didn't even have to wait for a table. But man the service sucked. I will not go back to that location. I also want to add that I have been in the service industry for 25 years. And if I treated a customer even close to that way at my job, I wouldn't have one. I KNOW HOW HARD it is to deal with people, but this was a case of a server miserable at his job. Guess what, don't work in this industry if you hate people."
Teeny D.,"Lafayette, CA",0,35,,1.0,6/16/2016,"What a disappointing experience! We called in for a carry-out order and were immediately put on a 10- minute hold. We almost hung up and called another restaurant. We finally placed our order with Paul (?). We gave our order and explained that we waited on hold for 10 minutes.  When we got to the restaurant for pick up, our food wasn't yet ready. We asked if we could pay our bill. The clerk, who seemed like a new kid, didn't yet have the bill. There was a lot of back/forth involved from the moment we got to the restaurant: 1) for the cashier to get the check 2) for cashier to check if we got some compensation for waiting on hold for so long! 3) for cashier to go back and get our food  4) manager offered us a free dessert--which we don't eat!--so we asked for a % off the bill--had to wait for that to get authorized  5) for manager (Paul?) to come to front with our food and then TELL THE CASHIER to make sure our order had all the sauces/dressings included (i.e., ketchup, dijon, etc.). Uh, why would he ask THE CASHIER (who was trying to be as helpful as possible--not blaming him--blaming the sad response by the manager) and not check it himself or tell the person who assembled our order back in the kitchen?!  More time spent waiting....... By now (20 minutes later!) our food was cold, and I should also mention that we wanted to catch the beginning of the Warriors/Cavs playoff game 6! Too bad we missed it because of ALL THE WAITING!!!!!  Plus our food, besides being cold, was nothing special (except for the salads-those were great!). NOTE: This was around 5:40pm--and normally very busy restaurant was NOT busy during this time at all--probably because of the NBA Finals.  Terrible experience, and we won't be coming back to Cheesecake Factory."
Katrina R.,"Pinole, CA",17,19,3,5.0,4/20/2015,"My husband & I went out for lunch yesterday at The Cheese Cake Factory and it was the best lunch! We were seated within just a couple minutes after giving them our name. We started with the fried zucchini (a favorite of mine) & calamari. (both were delicious) I had a chicken garlic pasta and the hubs had a dip sandwich. We were both very pleased. Oh and of course we had to die for cheesecake for dessert! YUM!  Our waitress Shelly was just wonderful! Very prompt and friendly, and she had expansive knowledge about the menu and ay alterations we could make. We'd love to request her when we come in again =) Great outing and can't wait to do it again!"
