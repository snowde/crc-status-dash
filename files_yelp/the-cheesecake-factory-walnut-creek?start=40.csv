Marygail S.,"San Mateo, CA",163,40,315,4.0,11/6/2017,"Love going to this place especially on weeknights. We only waited for 5 minutes for our table. Our server was extremely pleasant, and the food was great. Pumpkin pecan cheesecake! Yumm!"
Miyako M.,"Danville, CA",39,114,135,2.0,6/19/2017,The wait time at 10 pm to be seated was 30 minutes for a 2 top table.  Hubby ordered the chicken parmigiana which was tasty. I ordered the orange chicken which came out cold with burnt rice.  It's a good place to go with kids since its incredibly loud. Your kids won't sound loud themselves.  The bathrooms are gross! They definitely need someone dedicated to bathroom duties.  2 stars because the cheesecake is awesome.
Rachel Ann C.,"Irvine, CA",416,303,1459,4.0,12/2/2016,"Whether it's a hit or miss, you can't help but love The Cheesecake Factory. You've probably been to one a dozen of times (or more) and I've been going to this one ever since it opened up during my high school days. Birthdays, celebrations, girls night out, holiday weekend, family dinner... There seems to always be an occasion to treat yourself to a little ""fancy"" here. I get it, the food is overpriced. I can never deny me their Farfalle Pasta with Chicken and Mushrooms (my all-time favorite dish -- bow tie pasta in creamy garlic, oh it's dangerous!). Though their dishes can come at $15-$25 a plate, they can be tasty. Their salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes is ALWAYS a classic. (They serve up a little something for everyone.) If you're trying to save a little money, their plates are always big portions that are perfect to split with a friend (thank you Mom). You can hardly ever leave here without buying a slice of cheesecake. (Or else you're weird.) I'm a simple girl and go for their classic Fresh Strawberry cheesecake. Every. Darn. TIME. Classic cheesey cheesecake flavor I love topped with luscious strawberries, strawberry sauce and some whipped cream. Take it to go for later if you so please! Their bread for the table is always dangerous. That brown rye bread with some butter... Carb overload! But so yummy! Just think when's the next time you'll come here? Probably in a few months. Maybe even a year. Do it and don't look back. (Taking home your entree was never bad.) The Walnut Creek location has always been a home location for me. The area has significantly gotten more ""upscale"" in recent months, but it fits the area well. Classy, nice ambiance, generally friendly and courteous waiters. Plus, you're in the middle of downtown Walnut Creek, so you can walk off your meal with a bunch of shopping or just lounge out at the movie theater. You can't love TCF, but you can't hate it either. It's got all the goods and ambiance and everything you'd expect from a sit-down eatery (love their outdoor patio for a nice day out). You will be spending a bit much for food that doesn't always wow, but it's an experience here. And I've never had anything really bad to say about them here! P.S. It's almost always dark in all Cheesecake's I've been to. Thus, your photos won't look great. (I wonder if they do that because their food won't look too great in the light too...)"
Sabrina J.,"Fairfield, CA",94,123,652,2.0,11/19/2016,"Let's talk about the worst dining experience for a second....or two.... To begin, I don't understand why The Cheesecake Factory does not allow reservations or call ahead. For a party of about 12 people, we waited 1.5 hours to be seated. Keep in mind, seating in the waiting area is extremely limited. Upon being seated around 8:30PM and ordering drinks, it took at least 10 minutes before our waitress came back with our beverages. It took over an hour for our food to come out and by the time it did, I was not only HANGRY ( hungry/angry), I was equally disappointed. The Salmon and Shrimp Scampi combo ($22-$24) was laughable. 3, yes, 3 Shrimp were accompanied by a sliver of a piece of Salmon, it wasn't even 4oz at best. A clump of flavorless mashed potatoes and dry garnish were pretty much the feature of this dish. Our server was horrible! She wasn't very attentive and her overall attitude just wasn't friendly. On several occasions when we attempted to get her attention, we were ignored. Did she offer extra napkins? NO! Did she ask how dinner was? NO! Did she offer anything of value to our overall experience??!!! HECK NO! By 10:20PM, I just wanted to pay my tab and be gone, but of course that took our server forever in a day to do. I get it, it was busy, you may be tired, but if you can't provide decent service, then don't bother coming into work! The Cheesecake Factory is a place that serves virtually EVERYTHING, but doesn't even master at least one thing!!!"
Kanani K.,"Maui County, HI",19,95,134,5.0,6/10/2017,Janelle M is a gem...she had me at hello. No seriously though. We have 2 toddlers and she brought them cut up bread and bananas right after she brought our drinks out because she is awesome and knows kids need distractions so their parents can look thru the pages and pages of food that they offer lol. We love the Cheesecake Factory and had spent the day in San Francisco celebrating our daughter's 1st Birthday. We were tired and wanted to head back to Walnut Creek where our hotel was. We also figured this would be a fun place where they would make her birthday special. They sure did. Service was exceptional. Janelle was a sweetheart from start to finish. The kids even gave her hugs at the end of the night. Great food. Great service. Great memories. Mahalo!!
Nina N.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,63,8,4.0,11/10/2017,"Always packed and always a wait to sit.  Large menu, so deciding what to pick can be a chore. Food is okay. Pasta dishes are too heavy with sauce. Salads are too heavy on the dressing, so ask for dressing on side.  But the varieties of cheesecakes *YUM* plus they are all delicious.  Waiters and waitresses are friendly and service is good."
Rae S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,29,79,5.0,10/28/2017,One of the only places with late night eats in Walnut Creek. Arrived at 11:45pm after a concert and was seated right away. Super friendly waitress. My food came out fast and everything was excellent. Not sure what all the bad reviews are about. I've been to Cheesecake Factory countless times. This was my first time at this location but the service was excellent as always. Will definitely go back again.
Sonnia P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",218,99,115,4.0,6/25/2017,"The food is always good here and we love the variety of choices on the menu.  As we're locals, we frequent CF and find the best service we've received is between 5pm - 7pm. As with all CFs they do not take reservations; so if you're looking to eat here Fri-Sun expect at least a 30 minute wait. We don't mind it as much since we always go here on a whim.   Our favorites are: the sangria, dolce de leche cheesecake, gumbo, turkey burger, and their free wheat bread with butter yum!"
Sally A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,5,1.0,9/7/2017,"I've been there at least 5-6 times. Every time it got worse. My one star is mostly based on how the food tastes.  Pros -waiters/waitresses are nice -the place is nice, and also the location is good -menu (just like all cheesecake factories) has a lot of options -cheesecakes are good Cons -everything tastes bad, literally. (except for desserts) Every thing on that menu is bad. Specifically for Walnut Creek location. They really need to start buying fresh ingredients and hire someone who can actually cook! -they don't bring their trade mark bread and butter if they don't want to, you might be sitting there watching other guest getting their bread. And when you ask for one, they don't apologize for forgetting. Makes you feel like you're asking for a favor when it's simply not a favor it's something everybody gets (except for you) -they make you wait to be seated when there are tons of available clean tables. In my opinion it's just to make it seem like people are lining up at their door, but the truth is, it's because they're being lazy, or careless. It is definitely not because the place is packed, because it's never packed, but you always have to wait to be seated. -After they take your order you wait really long time, really really long time, at least half an hour, to receive your non-edible low quality food. First of, how can you fail at guacamole? It's simply avocado and some other veggies. Even their guac was not edible. It tasted horrible. I tried all the pastas, fried bar food, appetizers, main dishes, they all tasted super bad. I rarely leave food on my plate, but at this place I can never finish because it's always tastes bad. It's either super stale, or burnt, or prepared with real bad/cheap ingredients. They overcook the meet and undercook the pasta, then burn the mushrooms, ends up being a horrible dish.  I really liked everything I tried on the menu in the SF location, but in Walnut Creek I never ever left the restaurant happy. I strongly recommend trying the SF location, although the waiting time is always at least an hour to be seated. Still at least the food is edible and it has a view. Where walnut creek, to me it has nothing."
Ashley F.,"Honolulu, HI",354,92,75,2.0,10/5/2017,"This place is nestled nicely in the middle of Walnut Creek but unfortunately the staff is not so nice. Amy the manager was horrible. We went for dinner on a weeknight and even with a small amount of patrons. They estimated 1 hour and we were waiting for 90 minutes before we approached them. The manager was not very accommodating nor apologetic for her lack of communication with us. Next time, I will likely choose another restaurant to dine when in Walnut Creek."
Ramona G.,"San Diego, CA",3294,1439,1446,5.0,4/10/2017,"Seriously?! How the hell am I only writing a review for this place now?!?! I grew up in the East Bay and as a teen I would always always always come here on the weekends for dinner with my friends. I went here so much back then LOL. It was either Cheesecake Factory or PF Chang's. The Walnut Creek location is 10x better than the Stoneridge location. This is honestly my favorite CF, I prefer it over the San Francisco store and even the two CFs down in San Diego where I've been living the last few years. There is always a long wait here on the weekends. Expect about an hour wait. They have gorgeous outdoor seating, bar seating and their normal dining room.  I most recently came here last week with my sister after work, they don't have a happy hour but they do have bar seating with a small plates menu. We got their crab wontons, fried macaroni and cheese and flatbread pizza. Everything is always good here. Service is always on top as well! Can't wait to come back again!"
Mike B.,"Oakley, CA",13,4,,3.0,11/4/2017,"Started off with out ability to make reservations but wait was small Our tableware was encrusted with someone else's food particles , but our server replaced  Seared Ahi tuna was not available after we ordered  So we had to reorder  Our server brought us more bread which was delicious and the smokehouse burger was good. Cheesecake was delicious"
Chula T.,"Martinez, CA",35,7,20,2.0,8/10/2017,"Upon walking in I noticed a lot of people waiting to be seated, but the odd part was I could see at least 15 available tables... We put in our name, and the manager just told us that it will be a 20 min. wait? I confirmed 20 mins? He said yes because he doesnt have a lot of wait staff. I dont know about you, but Ive been here on much busier nights and at least was seated with my drinks and bread. Perhaps it's time for new management and more wait staff."
Aaron S.,"Fairfield, CA",101,5,6,1.0,4/16/2017,"Easter Sunday morning and an hour wait only 20 min after opening. They slowly open one section at a time.  I can see only two parties seated and yet there are a ton waiting.  One star. 50 min later and still not seated.  MANY tables still open.  I'm about to go to the Sacramento location, I can probably drive there and get seated before here.  And I've had nothing but good service there."
Jonathan R.,"Pinole, CA",42,5,,1.0,11/19/2017,"Waiter completely forgot to put in our appetizer order.  Of the five entrees, two had hair in them.  I'm traumatized."
Slava C.,"Pleasanton, CA",7,68,105,3.0,7/8/2017,"Busy, busy, busy! Great location and nice menu selection, which common for this type of restaurant.  Was slightly disappointed with the appetizer looks, as well as overfried calamari's. However local wine did a bit of a positive surprise.  Will try something else next time though!"
Sarah C.,"Alameda, CA",141,15,32,4.0,9/27/2017,"We have been to this location many times. My favorite is the Lousianna chicken pasta. It's a little spicy and very flavorful. We also got a special of carne asada medallions which was a first try. Probably won't be ordering that again, we asked for medium rare but it came out medium well. This plate was basically six medallions a scoop of rice and a scoop of corn. As an appetizer we ordered the avocado egg rolls. Yum! Cheesecake Factory is a nice place to go when your party can't decide on the cravings for a certain type of food. The menu is like a maze."
Christina G.,"Walnut Creek, CA",134,447,2556,3.0,5/15/2017,"We were able to take our dog we were dogsitting on the patio, but that was pretty much the only good thing about the Cheesecake Factory. My fiance's factory burger was sad and dry. They use the same free sourdough bread they give you at the table to make the burger, and they don't even put lettuce or tomatoes on it. The server kindly gave us a bowl of lettuce, which was really nice of him. The pot pie was delicious but oh my gosh so rich (I mean, it's Cheesecake Factory, but still...). I ate all the puff pastry, took half of the rest home, added pasta to it, and made a delicious brand new dish. The appetizers were brought out after our entrees and were not great. The summer rolls fell apart as we ate them and the tuna appetizer was fine but very bland. To conclude the meal, we spent forever trying to get the check."
Anthony S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",331,19,,1.0,9/3/2017,"I had a pre-order for just a club sandwich and cheesecakes. I arrive at the restaurant and I'm told that my cheesecakes are ready, but they're waiting in my club. That's fine, I thought. The guy at the counter leaves to go check, never to be heard from again. I wait 35 more minutes, nothing. It took 40 minutes AFTER arriving for one club sandwich. This particular Cheescake Factory has done this before, so this isn't a one-off. They are operationally inefficiency and leaderless up front."
Daniel T.,"Walnut Creek, CA",5,10,7,1.0,9/4/2017,"This is the second time I have been here. I liked the price and service on my first visit. Location was convenient; However, In my first time, my wife's order was wrong and I waited 30 minutes for them to change it. Guess what, my meal was cold already when they finally brought my wife's order. I didn't mind it due to being first time here. Today, I decided to give another shot to this location. Hostess who welcomed us took us to a table which was entrance of both door that everybody gets in and out. I asked her that if it would be possible to move us to table just a table away. She replied that there is no server for that table which didn't click on me. How could every table surrounded by that table have server but this doesn't? Anyways after 10 minutes of waiting in the hall she took us to another table which was similar to first one which we refused in the beginning. At that point, I just didn't want to bother anymore and sat wherever she showed us. After 10 more minutes guess what happened? Another couple came in and sat in a table that we wanted, the one that had claimed to have no server, and by the same hostess. This is an outrageous customer experience with no excuses."
