Rachel S.,"Pleasanton, CA",757,547,284,4.0,3/23/2014,"When is a good time to go to Cheesecake Factory? Tuesday after 9PM...because all of suburbia is sleeping then.  My girl friend and I came here after YEE's Ladies Night Out at the Shane Company down the street. I knew that they would be open for sure. We didn't want a huge meal and decided this would be a good place to come for some appetizers and a cocktail.  I ordered the fried zucchini and crab cakes. She ordered the egg rolls. I didn't have any of her appetizers, but mine were on point! Their fried zucchini is actually one of my faves. I've never tried the crab cakes, but the waitress said that is one of their popular appetizers, when I was hesitating. I'm glad I tried them, they were great!  I've been to CF before...this location is bigger (or it seems) than the Pleasanton one. It's really pretty at night with the lighting throughout the restaurant. It's a good place to come when there's not a five hour wait."
Kati P.,"Salt Lake City, UT",18,98,88,5.0,8/4/2014,"This was the first Cheesecake Factory that my husband and I have ever been to. We weren't sure what to expect based on the reviews, but it turned out great. The building is enormous and it was a busy night, but our server was extremely friendly and helped us out by giving recommendations (since the menu is huge). I had the Louisiana chicken pasta, which was delicious. My husband had the Santa Fe salad, which was also wonderful. For dessert we shared the Reese's peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake. It's a calorie bomb, but it was as rich and delicious as it sounds. At the end of our meal, we appreciated that they took our food and boxed it for us rather than giving just giving us a box."
Gene B.,"East Bay, CA",251,648,993,2.0,8/2/2014,"We dined here on a Friday night and the place was busy! Wait time for a table was about 20 minutes. The wait was expected and wasn't a big issue. * Seared Tuna Tataki Salad Excellent salad to have. It was a great complement to an ice cold glass of Pyramid Hefeweizen. I've tasted better, but nonetheless I was happy. * Hibachi Steak Overly marinated which takes away from the main ingredient. I prefer to taste the steak rather than having it overpowered. I do find potential in this dish with a slight change. * Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo This is probably the best they have offered me. It's not often to taste a creamy gumbo. I give it originality. Our waitress was friendly as well as the bus boy. Our dining table was fairly clean, but the seats and under the table was filthy. Overall I was happy, but had better from equivalent competitors."
Kam H.,"East Bay, CA",56,268,741,2.0,8/2/2015,"Two stars only because the cheesecake made up for the lousy meal. I ordered the Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya pasta and there was 80% pasta & then 20% of the chicken and shrimp. The meal itself was very very bland..I understand establishments use less salt but Hey Mr Chef do you NOT taste your food like your supposed to before it gets served? Anyways , the server asked me if I wanted a togo box..ugh no for what endless noodles for the weeks leftovers. She asked if I wanted anything else in replace of that meal I said no why even bother."
T K.,"Oakland, CA",0,1,,3.0,9/30/2016,"The wait time is always long, which is OK but they should provide WiFi while people are having to wait an hour plus."
Adrian B.,"San Ramon, CA",4,3,,5.0,5/12/2015,Kendall was the best!!!   My girlfriend and i came in with our 1yr old and usually servers are upset wen they see they get a table with an infant i know because i bartend and see this all the time but she was the total opposite she greeted us with a plate of cut-up bread and bananas for our little one she was really proper and kind. Its rare that i write reviews on here but i felt like i had to !!   Management you got a keeper if come back to your WC location it because of her. Thanks
Devina S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",5,20,,1.0,3/16/2016,"Very upset by their curbside ordering. We first arrived and called the number posted on the parking spot. The phone rang and rang with no answer. I then tried their main number. Same issue. No answer. After a third attempt, someone finally answered the phone and said they'd be right out.  10 mins later, still no one comes out.  We call once more and they acted like it was the first they heard of our arrival.  5 mins later, someone finally arrives with our food.  The girl was very nice, but there were no apologies for the long wait. Very dissapointing."
Ashley Y.,"Hercules, CA",1,10,,3.0,3/30/2016,Great food and service but took way 2 long. My dad lost his appetite after waiting for so long.
G B.,"Union City, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/25/2016,"This was my second time here. First time was good, second time was a different story. So my group of place our orders, some meals included some sort of pasta, including 15 mins later waiter/server came back saying the pot to cook long noodles broke and asked us if we would be ok with a different type of pasta/noodle, we were ok with it. We finally get our food.  So I ordered the shrimp scampi and steak elaine combo, another person orders shrimp scampi and salmon combo. When we get our shrimp scampi, there are NO noodles, just about 4 shrimp and sauce.  Upon asking about it from 2 different people, they both said  ""the noodles come with the shrimp scampi when you order the scampi plate, but not the combo."" Our waiter/server never said anything about that when taking the order, nor did it say anything on the menu. When ordering any scampi, shouldn't you get noodles? The waiter wasn't around much and had to ask twice to refill our waters. Good tasting food when it's on the plate, but I know for sure that I am NOT going back. By the way, this was my last meal for my birthday weekend. Thanks for the memory, a bad one."
Kristine D.,"Fairfield, CA",61,340,159,5.0,3/2/2016,This place is always good. Every time I get a great waiter. The bread is complimentary. Every cheesecake I have had was amazing. And every dish I've had here is amazing! Would be nice to have manager tabletouches. And a happy hour. It is a bit expensive. But I love this place and will def come back when I have money
Phantom Of Yel P.,"San Francisco, CA",1,70,10,4.0,6/21/2015,"If you are staring at the Encyclo-menu having trouble deciding what to get, let me help you: Miso Salmon ( my dad think's this is Michelin worthy .... he also thinks Jack in Box nuggets equally worthy, just be fair) Chicken Marsala Pasta Thai Lettuce Wraps Bang Bang Chicken/ Orange Chicken Do not pay $10 dollars for chicken potstickers. They are 2.99 at Trader Joes. Good luck!"

Erica N.,"Concord, CA",190,277,234,5.0,7/3/2015,"How can you go wrong with this place! Delicious food, huge portions, nice staff and great atmosphere."
Sal M.,"Anaheim, CA",252,190,230,3.0,2/14/2015,"With long waits most of the time, I have been getting to go orders a lot from here lately.  Not so much because of past service issues, it's just more convenient and just about all the main dishes end up being two meals for me.  You can go in to pick it up or try the curbside to-go, both are good options either if you are in a hurry or just want to avoid the crowds. Two of my new favorites from recent visits include the factory burrito and the shepherds pie, with veggies and Parmesan crust."
Shannon L.,"San Francisco, CA",135,381,29,4.0,7/18/2015,"I'm not a chain food hater like some people. I like The Cheesecake Factory because of their huge menu and big portions!!  Yesterday, I had the grilled fresh salmon with broccoli and green beans instead of the mashed potatoes. Everything was good and I would order it again in the future. Then, my wife and I shared the fresh strawberry shortcake. It was delicious!! The shortcake was different because it was dense and had decorative sugar crystals. We both agreed that the strawberry shortcake was the star of the night! It was soooooo good! It came with ice cream, strawberries, and whipped cream. Overall grade: B"
Christina P.,"El Sobrante, CA",180,20,11,4.0,5/11/2016,"There's a little bit of a story behind my review. I brought a large party (15 adults) for a reunion on a Saturday evening. The busiest time of week. While I came almost 2 hours early to put in a table request, I knew it was going to be a hassle to figure out (and Cheesecake does not take reservations). My group started out split up in booths, but were able to switch to open tables so we could mingle together more. The waitresses were kind & accommodating (even on this crazy Saturday), and took care of splitting everyone's checks. If I could remember their names I would make a shout out to them. Keep up the great customer service - even with the possibly irritating young adults!"
Heather S.,"Brooklyn, NY",502,314,69,3.0,2/25/2015,"It's the Cheesecake Factory. It's always busy and service is rarely great. Sometimes it's ok and sometimes it's horrible. I will never forget that it was my birthday like legitimate Birthday and I went there and showed my ID and everything and the waiter said that they don't do anything for birthdays which is the biggest lie. I thought he was kidding but he was serious. Basically he was lazy and didn't want to do anything for me. Never again am I spending my birthday here. Regardless, my go to plates are the miso salmon and chicken piccata. For appetizers- I highly recommend the avocado egg rolls. Sooo yummy! I love all heir appetizers really. And nothing beats their brown bread"
Lisa E.,"Concord, CA",1,8,2,1.0,6/23/2016,"Horrible. I live in Walnut Creek and am so disappointed.  Every Cheesecake Factory I have visited across the country has been outstanding. Now the one in my own backyard is terrible. The hostess is completely incompetent.  Never smiles, never explains the wait, never updates on the wait. In addition, when we have a reservation we arrive on time yet are told it will be 15 min before we are seated.  Why bother having a reservation. The hostess should set the tone for the experience and she does...in a very negative way. The food on more than one occasion has come out only lukewarm.  The initial wait for drinks is way too long, as are subsequent drink orders. Completely disappointing and sad. Love this restaurant in every other city. Walnut Creek, get it together!"
Andrew C.,"San Francisco, CA",334,59,15,4.0,3/2/2015,"My gf and I came here for a late valentines dinner, and as expected, it was crowded. If you don't already know about their food, alcohol, or cheesecakes, come here immediately. Big portions at a reasonable price. But I'm going to share with you our night.  We were people watching at the bar and this group herd came strolling in. The herd consisted of 3 girls and 1 guy. I was thinking to myself, ""am I all caught up with a Workaholics?"" At first I thought the guy was 4th wheeling on a gal-Entines date but that wasn't the case. This guy had game, and had no intention of becoming a citizen of friend-zone. Laughs could be heard from over yonder, pheromones were pungent to the surrounding populace's nostrils, and alcohol being devoured.  It was a dope, chill night. You're probably wondering about the golden question and the answer is yes, I am all caught up with workaholics."
Chris H.,"San Francisco, CA",2,556,,3.0,5/13/2016,"We arrived for lunch at 3pm, empty tables galore both inside and out.  We were told it would be a 10 minute wait.  25 minutes later we asked how much longer it would be.  We were told that they had let servers leave because it was slow.  Great.  Another 5 minutes and we were sat outside where we ordered immediately because we were starving.  Another 30 minutes goes by.  Again, lots and lots of empty tables.  Not sure why it took so long.   Food was ok at best"
