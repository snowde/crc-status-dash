misty o.,"Martinez, CA",70,26,6,3.0,8/10/2015,"Enjoy the food the service is not up to par as it used to be which is disappointing. Went for a birthday celebration with 12 people, called to make reservation and then was told they stop reservations at 530 ! What's the point of that most people are off at 530 and don't eat until 6 or after. So you're telling me when people need reservations is when you stop taking reservations ?! How does that make any sense? Not sure I care for that very much, where's the customer satisfaction there?  Service not that great had to wait to get a table for 12 people  which meant going earlier than planned and hanging around as if dinner wouldn't be long enough..... Could do some serious improvement and revision work on their over all planning here!"
Marina A.,"Concord, CA",192,7,,5.0,7/3/2016,"No complaints, Cheesecake Factory has always meets my expectation. The waiters are always great and the food is delicious. And there cheesecake, is the best (I stick to the plain cheesecake with strawberries)!  The only downfall is the wait on the weekends, but I always get a drink at the bar, then sit by the fire pit."
J B.,"Antioch, CA",5,30,,1.0,4/14/2016,"Went there for my birthday dinner.  Very disappointed!  We had to send the salmon back, due to it being under cooked!  The best thing there is the cheesecake."
Rajeshni N.,"Antioch, CA",0,18,,2.0,5/8/2016,"I usually love this place, but today the food was extremely bland. Perhaps because of the holiday they were too busy to put more attention to their dishes, but almost everyone's order was either cold or poor tasting. Our server barely came back to check on us. Hopefully they get better about customer service on busy days."
Jan Jeric M.,"Sacramento, CA",167,45,48,4.0,5/2/2014,"Franchise is franchise when you eat at places like this: same food and same decor. However, what makes this location stand out is the service and the quality of the good. This is my 4th time eating at this Cheesecake Factory, and every single time, I am met with professional and kind service. Wether it's slow or rush hour, the waiters; waitresses; and hostesses have always been top notch. My girlfriend and I always get the chicken fettuccini with sun dried tomatoes. It's definitely a safe bet. Today, I got the shepard's pie. It was great. Definitely going on my go to list. On top of the food, we got two piña coladas. They were perfectly made, not too much alcohol or smoothie. Overall: you won't be disappointed when you come to this Cheesecake Factory location. Yes, the food is the same as every other location, but they hire some quality service. Will be coming back for sure"
Christina C.,"Lafayette, CA",0,54,7,3.0,8/3/2015,Few good things on the menu. Service is ok I feel like every year food is getting worse and worse because they are making budgets.  I used to love the artichoke and the last 3 times it was crunchy and well overcooke/dried out. Cheesecake is of course good :)
Angie D.,"Davis, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/29/2016,"I am a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but this location was just disappointing. My boyfriend and I went for dinner 3 days ago and were treated very poorly by one of the hosts. He told us the wait time was approximately 15 minutes and to wait on the side of the host table. He never gave us a buzzer because he said our name would be called when a table was available (which is complete bs because the manager said they're required to give you a buzzer). 20 minutes had passed and we noticed that several people were being seated before us, so we asked another hostess how much longer we had to wait. She looked at her list and told us there were 5 more parties of 2 that were before us. We said okay and continued to wait on the side. More and more people were getting seated and we realized that 50 minutes had passed. I finally stopped the host who gave us the initial wait time and asked him what was going on. He asked for our name, talked to the other hostesses, and came back and told us that someone had messed up. He then walked us to a table while we kept asking him questions about what had happened. First, he said someone else messed up and then he said our name was put on hold because he called it out 4 times. I was furious at this point. We waited right next to the host table for 50 minutes and not once did anyone call our name. Shortly after, he changed the story and said that he didn't call our name, but someone else did. So in other words, he lied to our face. Twice. He then said in verbatim, ""Well, here's your table."" He did not apologize nor take responsibility for his actions. Instead he gave us attitude, tried to make us feel like we were the ones who were wrong, and failed to provide at least decent customer service. This was all on top of giving us a completely inaccurate wait time.  We were so upset that we decided to just leave. We spoke to a manager and she apologized and reserved a table for us. We were so over it at this point and waited long enough so we decided to stay and eat there. We had a great server so that was the only good thing out of this whole experience. While the manager did try to compensate by giving us free dessert, it did not make up for the host's behavior and inability to do his job. I understand that people make mistakes but he could have just apologized and not lied. I would have been much more forgiving and probably wouldn't have even called for a manager. Anyways, I will NEVER be returning to this location and I hope others will not be treated in this manner."
Katrin M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,3,1,5.0,6/16/2016,Food and service are great. Especially about the avocado eggrolls. All my experiences were great can't wait to go back.
Daniell B.,"Stockton, CA",0,11,,5.0,5/24/2016,"My favorite place to eat!!! Love the service, the location, and the FOOD! Make sure to try the lousiana pasta :)"
Rochelle S.,"Oakland, CA",39,34,3,1.0,1/1/2016,"Horrible wait!!!  The hostesses in front were rude and two out of four of them look like they haven't showered! I was ready go  just based of my first impression. My hubby wanted to eat here so bad so i stayed. The estimated seating time was 30 mins. It took an hour before we were seated!!! Then the utensils were dirty, the bread wasn't hot. I ordered the skinny enchiladas and my hubby ordered the spicy chicken strips food and it was just nasty and dry looking. It took 45 minutes to come out. I'm never going to eat here again!!! Oh and let's not forget the bathroom, it was really disgusting!!! Someone needs to mange this restaurant!!!"
Briana S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",11,47,46,1.0,12/3/2015,Got pasta with shrimp in it and THEY DON'T DEVEIN THEIR SHRIMP. See my photo below- the POOP TRACTS ARE EXPOSED AND HANGING OUT OF THE SHRIMP. This is extremely dirty and disgusting and I hope health inspectors follow up on this. If they're too lazy to devein their shrimp who knows what else is filthy in their kitchen.
Tynesha B.,"Pittsburg, CA",2,40,16,4.0,7/11/2015,"Ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp, which was not my fav (shrimp weren't deveined). But the Crab & Artichoke dip was pretty good. Buffalo strip were delicious."
Jaleel H.,"Oakland, CA",730,173,589,4.0,5/18/2014,"The food at this place was really good. I had the garlic noodles and jumbo shrimp dish. For appetizer I had the buffalo crispy poppers. For libations I ordered the Moscow Mule which tasted nothing like a Moscow Mule at all however it was very strong so I was happy with the alcohol buzz. My garlic noodles were very good, I did expect them to be more of an Asian style garlic noodle but the Italian American style they serve actually hit the spot.    The service here was mediocre at best, long long wait times to be seated and a very young staff who seemed more concerned with gossiping with each instead of actually helping the customers adequately.  The ambience is great, food was great, and the place was very clean I'd go with 5 stars but since the staff ruined the overall experience I'm going with a generous 4 star on this one."
Janina M.,"Little Rock, AR",302,333,338,4.0,10/27/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is probably my favorite restaurant to go to when it comes to celebrating special occasions, a nice meal with family, or to just indulge yourself in dessert when you don't want to spend an arm and a leg.  I favor this location because I like shopping in the area of Walnut Creek.  :) The menu items are the same as you would find at other CFs; lovely decor and it can get a bit chilly inside.  I've never had to wait long for a table, and if the restaurant was crowded, I'd just find a place at the bar if there's a game on.  Sometimes the service is excellent and sometimes it is OK.  That's what knocked this rating down from a 5 to a 4 for me.   You can never go wrong with the cheesecake.  Definitely share a piece if you don't want to feel like you're eating too much sweets.  ;)  Then of course bring a slice home to enjoy later.  I highly recommend trying the dulce de leche cheesecake at least ONCE."
Ryan A.,"San Pablo, CA",173,22,14,4.0,8/8/2015,"My husband and I have been going here for years. He gets the factory burrito which is HUGE ), and I get the chicken di pana with asparagus instead of broccoli. We usually share the fried zucchini and the stuffed mushrooms, the small plates are great and so good! And of course, THE BANANA CHEESECAKE to go. Its light, fluffy and it comes out with a side of fresh bananas and whip cream...it's the best."
Sina V.,"Concord, CA",0,2,1,5.0,10/26/2015,I am not much of a fish eater BUT!.... Just tried their Miso Salmon and Gosh!... mmmm!. Yummy!!!!.
Honey C.,"Pittsburg, CA",147,29,82,5.0,1/11/2016,I love this place. I came in just for the Mac & cheese balls but ended up staying for lunch. The line was crazy but they got through all the wait and sat everyone down with ease. Even if it's packed it's worth the wait
christina m.,"San Francisco, CA",99,3,4,5.0,5/21/2016,"Nicest guy ever! Sergio was our server, he made sure we were well taken care of !! I'm thinking he should be the manager"
Mocephus S.,"Livermore, CA",120,4,,5.0,9/28/2015,We had Julie Anne and she was awesome  and  on the ball  I have spent two decades in the service industry and can honestly say I would put her to work for me
Sabrina S.,"Vallejo, CA",1,9,4,5.0,8/14/2015,"I always have a good experience when i come here! Although, i'm sad they don't have the Chicken katsu anymore w/ the white spicy sauce. But its ok. I tried new dishes and was very satisfied!"
