Suzannah S.,"Fairfield, CA",22,1,,3.0,5/17/2016,I ordered a crab and spinach dip that was very salty and my girlfriend ordered a Asian salad that was bland and the lettuce had a lot discoloration in it overall the food suck!!!
sharon a.,"Martinez, CA",0,32,32,2.0,12/10/2015,"A disappointing experience from the moment I arrived. Service has highs and lows, the food isn't bad, but there's nothing particularly special other than huge portions, and the atmosphere is exceptionally noisy.  When I arrived I asked for the Jane Doe party. The hostess turned her back to me and gestured toward the back of the restaurant. I explained that I have trouble hearing and she repeated this useless performance. Isn't it the hostess's job to seat guests? I spent five minutes wandering around looking for my party. Multiple wait staff nearly ran into me but nobody offered to help. Plus: Our server was pleasant and very cheerful about accommodating one of our party's very specific requests, checking in to make sure the meal had been prepared properly. Minus: One person ordered a couple of starters for the table and our server failed to ask if anybody else wanted anything. I did. Minus: The hibachi steak was cooked perfectly but it was a bunch of small pieces of stir fried meat, not a steak. There was no discernible wasabi in the wasabi mashed potatoes Plus/Minus: the beet and goat cheese starter had wonderful flavors but was drowning in dressing This is nothing more than a big noisy chain restaurant with average food and average service."
Mina S.,"Antioch, CA",0,17,6,4.0,6/27/2015,"Great cheesecake, good food and good customer service. We will definitely be back for more!"
T N.,"Martinez, CA",0,15,8,1.0,11/9/2014,Complete failure lack of timing lack of understanding on how to actually make a decent breakfast. Management should make sure they're really watching the quality of food coming out of that kitchen.
Angel S.,"San Francisco, CA",1517,698,1234,3.0,11/19/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is Applebee's with a 50 minute wait.  Service is always cheeky with a smile, the menu extensive, the prices fair, and the quality a hit or miss.  I did enjoy their fish tacos."
Henry W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,29,,2.0,5/8/2016,"The foods are good, and the place is well decorated. But unfortunately, the eating silverwares were dirty (and we wiped them clean ourselves), significantly lowering our dining experience."
Ozzy I.,"San Ramon, CA",106,37,,4.0,2/22/2016,"It's Cheesecake Factory, what can I else do i need to add? It gets packed very quickly, its nice and expensive, and the girls really love this place for some reason. To this very day I don't understand the appeal. but almost by definition taking a date to the Cheesecake Factory is synonymous with taking a date to a ""Fancy Restaurant""."
Taylor D.,"Concord, CA",106,5,,3.0,11/3/2016,"I'm a server so I'm usually pretty lenient with restaurant service, but I was pretty disappointed with Cheesecake tonight. It took our server 10 minutes to get to us (which isn't the end of the world but still 10 minutes) and by that time we were ready to order. We waited an average time for appetizers and food. My brother ordered a cheese pizza that came completely burnt on the bottom, like enough that you could see it was burnt through the cheese. Obviously, he requested it be re-made. It took another 15 minutes for his new pizza to come out, when everyone else was basically done eating. He had to ask a third time for Ranch. And we would've ordered cheesecake but by that point we were pretty much done waiting and ready to go. We didn't get comped for the pizza, which isn't that big of a deal but it would've been nice considering how the experience went. 3 stars because I'm in love with the chicken Parmesan sandwich, but let it be known that was the only redeeming part of the night! Nights like these make me rethink my frequent visits here..."
Kwesi W.,"DeSoto, TX",99,1,,2.0,5/5/2016,"Tonight I ordered orange chicken and shrimp. My chicken was cooked just right, perfectly plump and tender. My sea crustacean was an all crust, hard, worst-cooks-in-America-could-have-done-better thing that was once a shrimp. It was well burnt and covered in sauce. I honestly think the cook forgot the shrimp in the fryer for oh, about ten minutes. The waiter was apologetic and sought out his manager to rectify the perfectly burnt situation on my plate. The manager couldn't be found. I mean, I don't blame him, I wanted to run and hide from the atrocity on my plate as well. Finally, the cook explained to the waiter that sometimes they are just crispy. Yes, sometimes shrimp are enjoying the hot oil treatment so much that they decide to refuse to leave.  Meh, I've experienced better,  every other time I've had orange shrimp. Officially the worst ever."
Katy R.,"Danville, CA",22,22,,4.0,3/26/2016,"Wait time can vary dramatically. The food is so good though! I am not a salad person, but I love the Chicken Caesar salad from here. The dressing tastes different from other places. I do recommend coming here, but if it is a busy hour, expect higher wait times whether you are at the table or not."
Catherine B.,"Fremont, CA",318,147,64,3.0,3/17/2015,"This is the largest&one of the nicest Cheesecake Factories that I've been to. There was a super long line but they told us that the wait was only 20 minutes, which wasn't bad at all. They gave us the buzzer, which went off after about 6 or 7 minutes. We gave it back to the hostess but then we didn't get seated for another ten minutes??? Why would you buzz us if you're not even ready yet? Our server, friendly enough, seemed really busy&had his hands full. We had to ask two different servers for bread&it took a while to even get us our drinks. I ordered the spaghetti&meatballs but they ran out of spaghetti?? It was kind of better with rigatoni pasta instead but still bland. They meatballs were just average too. The best things were the sausage flatbread&the Oreo cheesecake. Those were both really delicious. I'm a little on the fence about my experience but overall it wasn't terrible."
Maria S.,"Citrus Heights, CA",14,4,,5.0,1/5/2015,"I have been to this location over a dozen times. It's what you'd expect, it's big, with huge decorations hanging from the ceiling and a crowd waiting for seating almost every evening I've come by.  I must say, their food is great. For such large scale production for such a crowd, I'm pleasantly surprised.  If you have not already come by here, I would suggest two dishes (my favorites). The 'steak diane' is always well done. I'm not a fan of steak by all means, but I loved this one. Either their chefs have come around or I just keep getting lucky, I don't know! Their chicken castoletta is also divine. The lemon infused sauce is tart and fresh. Yum!"
Kelsey J.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,19,30,2.0,9/21/2016,Kinda annoyed. We got here when it opened at 11 and it took 45 minutes to get seated. We came here specifically for their Belgian waffle only to find out it is only served on Sunday. That was a bummer. The food we ordered instead was still good though
Rachel L.,"Oakland, CA",61,242,274,4.0,10/7/2015,"I always get the lemon herb chicken. Nice zingy sauce with perfectly cooked carrots and mashed potatoes. Huge plate. Plenty of chicken. Quality and quantity are worth the price. Miso salmon has nice presentation and also flavorful but not overwhelming for your taste buds. If you want something heavier go for steak Diane. Oh, and bomb milkshakes. But personally the desserts aren't for me. Too sweet and half a cake is quite filling without even eating entrees. Service can be a hit or miss."
Bijal R.,"Long Beach, CA",0,6,3,1.0,6/19/2016,"Terrible, terrible, terrible. I should have listened to the negative reviews and never bothered giving this place a try. Waited over an hour for our food to show up. Never thought I'd be here for 2 hours before having desert. Trust me, don't come here."
Patty S.,"Citrus Heights, CA",22,17,7,4.0,11/9/2014,"So I went to CoCo county today and my girlfriend suggested the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. I am not a big fan of chains and have never been to one but was willing to try it.  We shared an avocado roll, French country salad and some kind  of corn fritters.  We finished with the pecan/pumpkin cheesecake. That was really good.   I must say I was very impressed with both the food and the service.  So you must ask why only gave it 4 instead of 5 stars?.  They lose one star because its a chain,  Sorry Cheesecake Factory :)"
Michael W.,"Lafayette, CA",0,5,18,1.0,1/4/2017,"My review is based on the way this restraunt is run and NOT so much the food. My hope is that someone from corporate will read this and try to make some changes because my family and I are HUGE fans of the food there. I have called to place togo orders there at least 10 times and ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS I wait on hold for approx 15-20 minutes. The last 2 times I have called I have waited on hold for over 30 minutes...the last being 37 minutes. One might ask, what kind of idiot would wait that long on hold...well ME I guess. But the reason is, I call from my house or business, get in the car and wait on hold. Last week I walked in while STILL being on hold (34 mins of hold) looked for a manager, couldn't find one and then left to go eat elsewhere. It is AWFUL and at least 30% of the time my order is wrong if I do get to order and pick it up. Second, when we eat IN the restaurant, ALMOST always...our food will come out at completely different times. Sometimes upwards of 5 to 10 minutes different. So half the table is either eating while the other half waits OR their food gets cold while we wait. And the CHERRY ON TOP...This year I decided to have them cater my xmas party....So I called (and yes I waited on hold for EVER) got a person...ordered close to $800 worth of food for pick up 2 days later. Was told I would get a call back in 15 minutes to verify the order, amount and pick up time. 2 hours later I had no call. SO, I called back...(yes, waited on hold) got a person, my order was found, UN COMPLETED (pricing etc) in the system. I re-ordered, verified the entire order TWICE with the lady and verified pick up....On the night of the party December 11 at 4:30 when the order was to be ready, I showed up and .....wait for it.....YEP....NOBODY COULD FIND THE ORDER AND IT WASN'T COOKED OR READY!.....Now, I had over 40 people waiting at my business waiting to eat, drink etc. And I now have NO food. After finding a manager and explaining my ""problem"" she found my order in the system and after her doing all she could, I ended up waiting over an hour PLUS..I had people waiting at the party venue, cold, hungry, etc....my kids in the car and my year end xmas party was officially a ball of stress. So the head manager, who didn't even have the decency to come talk to me told the VERY NICE and pregnant manger to ""take of the price of the Apps....."" I was soooo disgusted AND had people waiting that I couldn't say anything or dispute this any further, I had to rush to the party....I talked with the manager who was doing what she could in her capacity and she essentially said, her hands were tied. I am a business owner and do NOT like negativly reviewing businesses but I feel like this one just needs to get SOMEONE to take charge of management down there and get it fixed. Because the food is great and the location is perfect but whoever is running it from a management point of view would be fired 5 times over in my business. I HOPE this finds SOMEONE in corporate and they do something to fix these VERY fixable issues. And Thank you to the pregnant manager who did what she could to solve the immediate issue that fateful night.  Here's to hoping!"
Chadd B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4,1,5,5.0,12/22/2014,My husband and I love this cheesecake factory not only is it beautiful out but the service is always incredible. Yesterday was my birthday and we went to this location to enjoy a dinner with some friends we got there at 10 o'clock and whether having such a great time didn't realize that the restaurant had closed already an hour and a half ago and they never said anything just let us enjoy ourselves. Our server was just now she was amazing and was making our experience and my birthday incredible they came with cheesecake with my name written on the plate and sang happy birthday and traditional way it was amazing. Always love this place!!!
Charles K.,"Alameda, CA",370,226,1279,4.0,7/1/2013,"Ahi carpaccio (tuna) is a must have! I don't think I have ever been here without ordering it! The service is hit or miss, depending on how busy things are, and what the mood of the servers are. There are plenty of servers around, but trying to get one to stop and give you service can **sometimes** be difficult. Usually they are pretty friendly, but when they aren't they miss by a mile, it truly ruins the whole meal.  Chicken Bellagio, Chicken Madeira or the Cajun Pasta are my usually ""go-to"" entrees. For a lighter fare, their walnut, goat cheese salad is very good. Don't be fooled, it can be pretty pretty pricy depending what you get. Even when you try to be budget friendly, you'll spend between $15 - $20 per person.  When it's cooler (not ICE cold), they have a gas fireplace outside. If you are lucky enough to sit by it, there is not better feeling. I had the Cajun Pasta this past Sunday when it was 105 degrees outside. We sat outside and there was a very nice breeze.   It's pretty nice sitting outside! (Just ask for a table away from the wall.)"
Sean M.,"Fremont, CA",204,4,1,2.0,10/14/2015,"Pick-up Veggie burger was $12.50 and tastes like its from the $1 menu at McDonalds.  You can recognize price tiers when eating. CF prices itself at the 12-15 dollar range when it should be in the 8 dollar. Bad deal, poor quality food."
