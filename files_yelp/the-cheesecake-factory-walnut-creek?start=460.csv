Precious D.,"Pittsburg, CA",4,13,1,1.0,10/3/2015,"Our experience today was horrible! NEVER again will we come back to this place!!! I would never recommend this place to anyone, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE PETS - unprofessional management.  My sister, nephews, and I decided to have lunch at the restaurant after taking my dog to the park. We wanted to enjoy the patio seating outside of the restaurant, but we called ahead to make sure dogs are allowed - which they are. (Other Cheesecake Restaurants we've been to we're very accommodating to my dog EXCEPT the one in WALNUT CREEK.)  As we sat down, we were given horrible looks from the table across from us (a man and an older woman) because we had my dog with us. Note, my dog is a blue nose Pitbull. He is the sweetest dog but due to the Pitbull reputation, ignorant people discriminate right away.  As the waiter approached me, my dog was under the table and slightly growled but stopped immediately after I commanded him. Then the woman across made an unacceptable comment ""That's why you shouldn't bring dogs at restaurants"". Moments later, a manager named Cassandra came up to our table to let us know ""that people were complaining because your dog is barking"". First of all, my dog did NOT bark at anyone. If she didn't come to our table, then the other people wouldn't have noticed. She stated that many people were complaining, and that my dog was barking a lot, which was false. It was just that one IGNORANT person across from us that couldn't handle seeing a pitbull. This manager was accommodating to that one customer but NOT US. She basically made a scene and made us and the people around us feel so uncomfortable. If that's what you call a manager, then they should reevaluate her again.  We requested another manager to speak to, and AGAIN he was against our dog! He said that the other manager said my dog was barking at so many people including her which was such a big lie. The only thing that caused this commotion was the growl (which was immediately stopped) and the complaint of the other customer (that was not even part of anything - my dog did NOT bark at her nor even LOOKED her way) so I don't understand why they would cater to her and avoid our needs as customers also.  My sister and I decided to take our food to-go instead because we just felt unwelcomed!  But on a lighter note, we had two servers approach us to comfort us and let us know that they love my dog - a Pitbull.  This management could have handled this situation more professionally. Puts a shame to this restaurant."
T C.,"Oakland, CA",112,791,313,3.0,6/4/2013,"Seriously, this location is almost too big...it's ridiculous. But, it's gorgeous..loved the lighting and ceiling art. But, you could lose someone in here..or get lost..or hide in one of the many nooks and have public sex.  The hostess was super friendly but, it was like she had ADD..she would ask how many in everyone's party as people came in and would take off with someone else..and since this place is like 700,000 square feet, she would come back hella later and would then take someone else and disappear into the abyss. It was a little strange but, whatever, I wasn't mad at the chick. While I still love their skinnylicious shrimp tacos, I found the service at this location to be stale. Our server was a ponytail dude who never checked back in on us once we got our food. Then he had the audacity to ask us, not just once, but twice if we wanted dessert. Mother fucker, didn't you see us BOTH order from the skinny menu? What the hell is wrong with you? Get that cheesecake outta my fuckin face. Idiot! We get it, we aren't spending enough $$  by simply ordering 2 lunch entrees, no drinks, appetizers and desserts. Whatever man. Great lunch company, good food, OK service and the most confusing parking situations all around this place, so good luck with that."
Terri L.,"San Jose, CA",200,262,225,2.0,9/24/2013,"This place is overhyped. The restaurant is beautiful, but the food was meh. Too expensive for the meager taste. I got a turkey burger and it was delicious at first, but it lacked in taste the further I bit into it. The salad was gross too, but that was because it had arugula (arugula is the worst salad green ever). The vinaigrette was too much.  I should have just gotten a cheesecake slice...."
Andrea M.,"Alameda, CA",16,51,43,4.0,2/7/2015,"Really like this place. My boyfriend and I frequent both this location as well as the one at Stoneridge in Pleasanton. The service is consistently friendly and professional, which I very much appreciate. The food is terrific too. I recommend the avocado rolls (my favorite item on the menu), dynamite shrimp, fettuccine alfredo, and pretty much any of the burgers. My boyfriend loved the fish tacos. The drinks are awesome! Asian Pear Martini & Caribbean Cooler are my faves. The restaurant itself is beautiful, both the interior, and the outside patio with the fireplaces. The place is often EXTREMELY busy - be prepared to wait, especially on the weekends - but there's a reason it has such a strong following. Only thing I would change would be decreasing the portion sizes on most dishes - they are unnecessarily huge. Overall a great place that we will continue visiting."
Susan H.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",134,74,14,1.0,11/29/2014,"Well my husband and I have been faithful supporters for cheesecake factory since grad school days 10 years ago. We happened to be in walnut creek today and thought this would be a good place to end the day with.  So I ordered the grilled salmon and he ordered angel hair. The salmon turned out to be super dry, like those overcooked chicken breast that i had to chew quite hard in order to swallow. His shrimps were fewer than usual and overcooked super dry as well.  I finally decided to talk to the waiter after finishing the second bite. The waiter was nice enough to redo the order for me. Their manager also came out to do a simple apology. i thought that was a nice gesture. we waited a long time for the second one.. in fact i finished the rest of the food and decided to pack up the new salmon piece when it arrives. When it arrived. it was super small.. about half of the original order. compared with this picture, the previous apology did not seem genuiun at all.  By then, I did not think it was fair for me to discuss this matter further and wasted more time over a properly cooked, fair portion of salmon.. this incident was very disappointing that we even decided to skip our dessert and just went home.  The reason that I wrote up this review serves as a reminder to the restaurant not to compromise their quality standard even though it is a busy holiday season. if you are understaffed, hire some seasonal help! you can't let customer bear the cost like this.. not sure if  this is a cheesecake factory problem or just this location..."
Melody K.,"Brentwood, CA",154,274,395,4.0,5/4/2013,"I have been here twice, once for lunch during the week and once on a Saturday afternoon and enjoyed each time! First time I had the Wedge salad and a flatbread pizza from the Skinny Lunch menu (so glad they have this) and really liked both. Service was very good and the food was served promptly but so so quickly that you felt rushed. 2nd time I came here was with my two teen daughters..I had the vegetable salad which was pretty good but the best item was what my oldest ordered...Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp....OMG...so TASTY!!!! Service was OUTSTANDING!!! I wish I knew our servers name so that I could give him credit. He was very pleasant (not fake OR robotic) like someone here commented about.  Would I come back, you bet. Yes, it is a chain but it is successful and for a good reason. AND for the poster that complained about the servers being too nice...Are you kidding me??? Too nice?? Get real."
Irene L.,"Orinda, CA",203,566,71,3.0,1/10/2016,"I try to stay away from huge chains, but sometimes you can't really help yourself. My best friend was in town and she was craving Cheesecake Factory (gifts cards don't help), so we decided to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. It had been a while since I've eaten at a Cheesecake Factory, so I had forgotten a few things. There was a long wait, the menu is absolutely enormous, and the portions are huge. After standing (no seats!) and waiting, we were finally seated - thankfully, we were seated at a lovely private booth. Our waitress was pretty attentive, which was nice. After perfusing the menu, we decided to order family-style. We ordered a few different appetizers to share. We were absolutely stuffed, but, since we were at the Cheesecake Factory, we had to have cheesecake! We ordered one of the more low-key cheesecake options, but still left the restaurant with quite the sugar high. My best friend even ordered three more desserts to go (her siblings had demanded she bring some home!)."
Joco F.,"Concord, CA",286,311,93,3.0,2/9/2015,"I've had many experiences at this Cheesecake factory since my first in 2012 and I'm happy to report they are back to being satisfactory.   It's easy to hate the corporate chain feel of Cheesecake Factory but it's also hard to hate the variety in the menu and if you go enough eventually you'll find something you like.  Now my favorite thing on this menu has been gone for some time now so each time since I've tried to find a new ""goto"" item. Though I have nothing that has come close to the Farmhouse burger they used to have, everything I've had since then has been pretty solid. Just not quite a home run with me.  Though their Sunday brunch items are all very good.   Service has been much better since my first experience though the wait times always seem to be in consistent.  It would be nice to be offered bar space if available right out  the gate. We always seem to have to ask.  I know it's nit picky but to me that's a sign of a host/hostess making the extra effort.  In the end it's hard to go wrong here when you're with folks who can appreciate Cheesecake for what it is and not try and compare it to anything else but other chains around.  For my money Benihana, Cheesecake, and Chili's are the best in the business and it shows in their staff and their food. The bazillion people willing to wait in line for 90 minutes to eat here on a Saturday can't be wrong."
John G.,"Concord, CA",0,76,4,1.0,7/3/2015,"Just had a very poor experience. Ordered a salad with dressing on the side for lunch extra avocado. Salad arrives. Drenched in bbq ranch every layer. Sent back asking for the salad I ordered. Comes back with about 2 inches of new lettuce on the top and bottom layers still soaked in dressing ala minus extra avocado. I try to eat a little and get nauseous . Push it away . Waitress asked how it was . I told her it was soaked in too much dressing I couldn't eat it. She takes it and walks away. Shift manager comes by and asks ""was everything satisfactory?"" I say ""no I ordered a salad with dressing on the side and they brought it soaked in dressing. I sent it back. The new salad had puddles of dressing. In the bottom layers and none on top. He says ""well hopefully it will be better next time "" walks away. What?"
Sofia L.,"Richmond, CA",0,26,10,3.0,7/2/2015,We came here three weeks ago in the time where everyone was graduating from high school. The place was packed. We had called in advance to make a reservation but when I said there was 8 people we were told we couldn't do a reservation. When we got to the restaurant we were told that the waiting time would be two or three hours. I asked that I had called before but that all did not matter. I was s little upset but I wanted our party to be happy that's all. Ok so about the food. I was actually surprised by the variety of flavors that they have! They had a Jamaican dish among other different dishes. We were actually pleasantly surprised as our waiter was very patient. Now the price is a little steep but it shouldn't be to bad. If you are around the are and you would like to eat well and don't have large part then come to cheese cake!
Vikkie N.,"Ogden, UT",36,223,40,2.0,8/9/2013,"It was someone else's choice to go there and there was a second amongst the group, so who was I to rock the boat... I'd had a late lunch (but that's another rockin' review) and I wasn't starving so I ordered 2 appetizers from the ""Skinnylicious"" menu.  I now know why you are skinny afterwards!  The Ahi Tuna somethingorother was TINY.  The Ahi was not that fresh either.  The beet and goat cheese salad was nice though and the only one of the two items that I ordered that was worth the money I paid! My friend paid a terrific amount for what amounted to 4 large shrimp and a small piece of salmon. Take your money elsewhere peeps."
Veronica S.,"Martinez, CA",0,24,19,2.0,9/14/2016,"This may be the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to.  I've gone multiple times hoping it would get better, but it never does.  The workers at the front desk have no interest in being there, they are all awful.  I waited for an hour with a hungry 5 year old when they told us the wait would be 20-25 minutes.  The food has come out wrong multiple times. I'd rather drive to Pleasanton and get the service I'm looking for"
Alexis L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",191,80,22,5.0,8/19/2014,"I finally came here for dessert recently, I know kinda crazy that I never had had Cheesecake Factory before but it was worth the wait. We came mid day so seating wasn't a problem, our server was kind and the dessert was amazing. I ordered the Godiva Brownie Sundae and my boyfriend ordered the Strawberry Shortcake. It not only looked appetizing but had rich taste. It certainly was a large portion and worth six bucks. Next time we'll remember to just share though."
Christopher T.,"San Francisco, CA",3,20,,2.0,11/24/2015,"Don't like it much here. Wait is to long to get food, The mashed potatoes are always so hard and not at all tasty. Mostly I get my food lukewarm, at best. It's not bad, but it's not good either. I think the music is to loud, the restaurant over all is to loud. MEH!"
Lesley M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,9,,2.0,9/10/2016,"My husband and I went to have dinner last night, and when I checked in with the hostess, I was told it would be a 35 minute wait, which was fine.  She told me to come back in 15 because there were no pagers.  Being on crutches made it difficult for me to do so, so my husband went back over in 15 minutes and was told it would be another 26 minutes. No pager was given to him.  After we waited for an hour, watching other guests get called by name in front of us, I finally hobbled up to the hostess and asked what was going on.  She said ""We called your name, but you didn't respond"", to which I said ""My name was never called. I've been sitting here waiting for an hour watching others called.""  She then said we'd have to wait another two or three minutes.  And then she handed me a pager.  When I hobbled back to sit down, my husband was fed up and went back to her and told her the next name called needs to be our name.  We finally got seated.  This hostess was simply incompetent, inconsiderate of my physical condition and rude.  The redeeming person in this whole experience was our waitress, Rheena, because she asked how we were, and when she heard our frustration, she asked what she could do to make us feel better. We asked for a complimentary cocktail, which she could not do but she offered us a complimentary dessert instead.  That simple gesture made up for the sins of the hostess.  And our dinner was very good too.   I think last night's hostess needs better training - she was in over her head on a very busy night.  She is the first person a customer interacts with in your restaurant - it should be imperative that the initial customer experience be flawless.  For us, it wasn't. Plus you need more pagers."
Meri K.,"Salinas, CA",0,4,,4.0,5/8/2015,"Had lunch here in April 2015 with 3 others. The restaurant is gorgeous! Beautiful paintings, spectacular hanging lamps, & a lovely Italian ambiance.  We each ordered a different entree and for the most part we were all satisfied. My daughter's gumbo was the best meal. I thought the other meals were a little blah. Three of us ordered cheesecake. The vanilla bean, dulce de leche, & caramel pecan turtle. Most definitely my daughter's plain vanilla bean was the best. I'll try that next time with the chocolate sauce.  The service was terrific. Our server was quite attentive. He gave us a pitcher of ice to satisfy my needs. He also gave my friend & SIL a large block of cheese + a grater. The guys were astounded by all that cheese & ended up taking the remainder home with their leftovers.   The nicest thing about this restaurant is the location. It is in the gourmet ghetto in downtown Walnut Creek, where parking is problematic. Luckily, there is a 3 story garage attached to the restaurant. Since I am disabled we used the valet service. It's only $7 with validation. Or you can self park for free on the upper floors.  I've heard so much about how great the Cheesecake Factory restaurants are for decades. I was just a little disappointed that the food didn't live up to the hype. I'll try again, maybe dinner or Sunday brunch. And definitely at the Walnut Creek location."
Its a S.,"Concord, CA",6,46,1,2.0,2/6/2015,My review has to do with take out service. I was told 30 minutes. Showed up then. Called at curbside...nobody ever came. Went inside to get it myself. Long story short ended up waiting another 30 min. I will NEVER EVER do take out from this place ever again.  It's a good thing they have good food because each experience I have here has gotten worse and worse. It's too bad.
Tom H.,"Philadelphia, PA",58,61,2,4.0,1/23/2016,"A magical experience! Came for drinks, ended up enjoying a meal. Incredible selection, gargantuan portions, and entertaining service!  Excellent drink menu, but knowledgable bartenders can make you anything you like. Try the Bulleit rye! Ask for Jason."
Emma C.,"Brentwood, CA",1,3,6,4.0,12/7/2015,"I don't know how many stars to put because I have now been here yet. Everything looks so delicious. All the pictures of the food look very good. I used to think cheesecake actually had cheese instead of cake. Now that I know it doesn't, I can't wait to try it! The chocolate Tower truffle cake looks and by the way they describe it, sounds really good. I really want to try their Alfredo pasta! They have soo many things on the menu that sound good it would probably take me longer to decide what to get than it would to get the food. I like places that have bread before your meal. The bread looks really good."
Shruti R.,"Fremont, CA",137,119,357,4.0,8/9/2015,"I've been here three to four times.  The wait time is usually around 20 to 30 min to get a table.  The service is pretty decent here. What makes me come back here  again and again is the food.  Their appetizers are all really delicious.  I've tried their avocado rolls,  fried Mac and cheese,  and corn tamale cakes.  All of them were excellent.  For main dish, I've tried their egg plant parmesan and vegetarian pizza.  I wouldn't say that's the best I've had but the food they serve here is pretty good. The ambience is noisy because of the crowd.  But otherwise,  the place is really nice.  Overall the experience is good!"
