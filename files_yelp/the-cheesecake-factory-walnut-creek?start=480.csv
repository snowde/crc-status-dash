Jaydee B.,"San Francisco, CA",708,163,715,4.0,1/25/2013,"I walked in and was mesmerized by the over-the-top grandeur :-) A bit cheesy ornate - but so much so that it felt like I had been teleported to Las Vegas. The ceilings are 30' high, there are ornate Venetian light fixtures everywhere, huge pillars that are hand painted - wow. Am I still in sleepy suburban Walnut Creek? Yes, it's the Cheesecake Factory.  But what an amazing little piece of real estate they've transformed in downtown Walnut Creek. I sat at the bar area and admired the wall 'o alcohol - an amazing array of everything you can get at BevMo. My waiter didn't seem too knowledgeable on gluten-free.  When I mentioned gluten, the response was: ""hmmm.  wait, is that like wheat?"". So I played it safe, and went for things I knew would be gluten free. First up was the ""Boston Salad""  which is a savory salad topped with chopped bacon and blue-cheese.   I ordered it with the Citrus Honey dressing - it was a small portion, but very good. I also ordered some sweet potato fries, but with no Chipotle Mayo Dipping Sauce - a quick google search on my phone showed that it has gluten.  Overall, it was a solid 4-star meal that did the job. For other gluten-free peeps out there, please note that they don't have a gluten-free menu.  No allergen menu even.  So you are on your own.   The menu is about 14 pages long, so I see why - what a nightmare it would be to do a gluten-free version. Note these sleeper items are NOT gluten-free: * Ranch Dressing * Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing * French Fries * All Cheesecakes But these ARE gluten-free: * White Bean Hummus- If ordered without Warm Flatbread * Little House Salad- If ordered without Balsamic Vinaigrette * Quesadilla- If ordered without Corn Tortilla and with Simply Grilled Chicken * Fire-Roasted Fresh Artichoke- If ordered without Spicy Vinaigrette * Ahi Carpaccio- If ordered without Soy-Ginger Sesame Sauce and Togarashi Aioli * Thai Lettuce Wraps- If ordered without Spicy Peanut Vinaigrette, Thai Peanut Sauce and Sweet Red Chili Dipping Sauce * Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes- If ordered without Tomatillo Cream Sauce * Tossed Green Salad- If ordered without Croutons * Caesar Salad- If ordered without Croutons, and with Simply Grilled Chicken * Boston House Salad- If ordered without Croutons or Ranch Dressing * French Country Salad- If ordered without Balsamic Vinaigrette and Shallot Vinaigrette * Fresh Vegetable Salad- If ordered with Simply Grilled Chicken * Factory Chopped Salad- Order with Simply Grilled Chicken and without Balsamic Vinaigrette * Cobb Salad- If ordered without Balsamic Vinaigrette * Chinese Chicken Salad - If ordered without Wontons and Chinese Plum Dressing * Herb-Encrusted Salmon Salad-without Balsamic Vinaigrette * Gluten free salad dressings:  Caesar, Citrus Honey, Lo-Cal Mustard Vinaigrette * Factory Burger- If ordered without Sourdough French or Wheat Loaf. * Classic Burger- If ordered without Hamburger Bun * Grilled Turkey Burger- If ordered without Hamburger Bun * Fresh Grilled Salmon- If ordered without Tartar Sauce * Fresh Grilled Mahi Mahi- If ordered without Tartar Sauce * Grilled Pork Chops- If ordered without Honey Mustard Glaze * Grilled Rib-Eye Steak- If ordered without Onion Rings and Au Jus * Petite Filet- If ordered without Onion Rings and Au Jus * Filet Mignon- If ordered without Onion Rings or Au Jus * Sweet Potato Fries- If ordered without Chipotle Mayonnaise * Sautéed Snow Peas and Vegetables- If ordered without Soy Sauce"
Jenny L.,"Danville, CA",187,36,33,4.0,2/1/2015,"PRO - Super yummy food and cheesecake, more details below.  - Great free bread (the dark brown one is super good!) :) CON  - The waitress was worried that we weren't going to tip her well since we didn't get two lunch entrees and because we had two coupons for free cheesecake slices...so she  had a note of irritation in her voice when serving us. Even though she pegged me and my boyfriend as cheapskates, we still gave her a generous tip (which we planned to from the beginning!). I guess it's hard to communicate that as a customer though before the bill is paid so I figure it's better to let it go. (Elsa style?:) haha jk.  The food was delicious and since we split a big entree for lunch, reasonably priced. We like to split the factory grande burrito and we got the lemon mousse cheesecake and carrot cake cheesecake- both were scrumptious!! We'll definitely go back for the food:)!"
Scott H.,"West San Jose, San Jose, CA",9,245,63,2.0,8/28/2014,"I taught my kids at a young age to avoid 'factory food' and I am glad I avoided this 'factory' until now.  I am a foodie, a locovore, and I care about what I eat. This restaurant is the anti-foodie. We all know this chain is at the top of every 'least healthy places to eat' lists.  I give them two stars because they make no pretense about having good, healthy food and I get it, this is the place you take your little league team after a game or hit because you are hungry at the mall. But for a guy whose favorite foods come right off a plant in my garden it's tough for me to give them much positive feedback."
Alexandria M.,"Concord, CA",29,16,4,3.0,10/23/2015,Our server Timothy was great! He was super nice and helpful and personable. Chef wasn't so good. Sticky pasta but we sent it back. Tim was awesome though. Raise time lol thanks Tim!
Irene L.,"Milpitas, CA",62,1348,4,3.0,1/9/2016,"Mediocre food and somewhat friendly service, but lacking attention. I never think this place is worth the wait, however my friend wanted to dine here. The waiter made a couple errors during dinner. My friends order a bottle of wine, but the waiter brought 2 glasses and then later my friends just asked for the bottle unopened. The waiter later showed up w/ the bottle opened and if you offer your customers a taste you open it in front of them and then give them the bottle. You don't show them an unopened bottle, disappear and then reappear w/ the bottle open because then you could just be serving them an previously opened bottle. I'm not sure if that was the waiters intention or he just didn't know better..."
Jenna T.,"East Bay, CA",419,620,1266,4.0,10/28/2013,"4 stars for the food. If I could, I would give our particular server a big fat ZERO.  I ordered the skinnylicious chicken tacos. It was delicious with the chili sauce and moist. I was actually surprised how good they were. My bf and I shared an ""everything"" pizza. The dough was thin and it was overly greasy. He ordered the wild mushroom burger which he devoured.  As far as our server? I think he needs to find a new occupation. He was not personable, he did not look happy to be there, he didn't introduce his name, and he was not fast enough. It took 20 minutes, if not longer, to get attention and order drinks. If I wasn't a nice person, I would've left him ZERO tip. He didn't deserve a penny."
V G.,"Monterey County, CA",23,70,273,2.0,11/17/2015,"They get three stars because they were slow serving our food. We were seated and after us, two groups were seated in our area. We waited 30 minutes still no food. The two ladies seated received their food. Another 20 minutes and the women had finished their food and the people next to us (table of four) were midway through their meal and we finally were served. Unbelievable! Luckily I don't live in Walnut Creek anymore and won't have to suffer second class service. No thank you Cheesecake Factory. You should get your kitchen act together!"
Benita G.,"Oakley, CA",42,25,8,4.0,1/13/2014,"Sooooo I went on a double date with my brother, sister-in-law and my love....For all four of us we spent $126, not including tip. So yes, it is bit pricey, but I say if you don't have the money, don't go out.  Our dinner included, burrito (my brother), tacos (sister), porkchop (my love) and Miso Salmon (me). spring rolls (appetizer to share), firecracker salmon (appetizer to share), caramel macchiato, 1 draft beer and 1 slice of cookie dough cheese cake to share. Everyone said their food was good, so there are not complaints in that department. My only complaint would be the wait....they said our wait time was 45 mins. It was about an hour and 15 mins.....not too bad. We did expect to wait about 2 hours originally since we went on a Friday night.  Our waitress was amazing! So overall, we had a great time and I will definitely be going back!"
Michael Y.,"Moraga, CA",0,1,,3.0,8/6/2015,"We reserved by phone and were told we could only reserve if we could come at 5:30. We made the reservation for 8 people and were at the restaurant at 5:20. The front desk asked questions about our phone number, name etc. then I was asked to step to the side. A little later the manager came over and said there was no record of the reservation and there would be a 15 minute wait. No apologies until I reiterated a reservation was made. We were disappointed by the front desk customer service.  We ended up waiting 10 minutes and the person serving our table was very good. Food was pretty good also.  In summary not a great start, but decent ending. Further to my comment. Our server was Philip M. He was fantastic!!!  If you get him as your server, you will be very pleased."
Rebecca K.,"Oakley, CA",0,8,,4.0,8/19/2016,"I'm surprised with the low reviews.  This is my favorite restaurant. I've never had bad service here.  Some trips may have been better than others. But no server has ever been bad enough to be memorable.  I always get mac and cheese balls and then random appetizers or share entrees. Chicken Lettuce wraps are really good as well.  Some of the food I have had here is just okay and nothing to rave about and some I have really enjoyed so for how many times I've been here - I'm never disappointed with a meal overall. There is every kind of food you can think of. My favorite cheesecakes to get it are the Fresh Strawberry or Smore's. It gets really busy during regular normal busy restaurant times and its Walnut Creeks so not being able to make reservations is a little annoying, but I just choose less busy times to go lol."
P. H.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/31/2016,"We went to the Walnut Creek Cheesecake Factory on Saturday for breakfast. We waited for 30 minutes and finally were seated outdoors.     Within 10 minutes, we ordered drinks and soon afterward, orders were placed. After waiting for another 40 minutes, we asked for a status. The server apologized, stating that the kitchen was busy and backed up. She refilled our lemonades  but didn't offer to refill the orange juice as a courtesy for the long wait. Shortly afterward, one order was served. We waited another 10 minutes for the other two orders. We immediately saw that the breakfast potatoes were burnt, and that the grilled ham was missing on one order. We notified the server who apologized and went to follow up with kitchen. The kitchen manager came to our table and admitted the potatoes were ""a bit over cooked"" so I asked him if he would eat them as-is and he agreed that he probably wouldn't. Within 10 minutes the potatoes and ham were served. We were shocked however to see that the bill was not even adjusted to reflect this poor service. An apology was hand-written on the bill. To make matters worse, we were overcharged for the ham which was added as a 'side order' instead of being part of the original order. We made a mental note to take our business elsewhere in the future."
Be C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,12,3,2.0,8/17/2016,"Pasta carbonara was horrible. Spaghetti was not well-cooked , plate was hot but then pasta was cold..? I expected more delicious one than i ate here."
Mona L.,"Las Vegas, NV",122,46,54,2.0,9/4/2015,"The quality of food has gone down over the years. They are really trying to squeeze every dime of profit out of everything they serve now. I didn't find anything on the menu that wasn't the cheap version or overly doused in salt as restaurant food often is. I send to really like Cheesecake Factory. Nothing wrong with the service I received, food no longer worth the $$$ price."
Danielle D.,"El Cerrito, CA",51,17,,1.0,6/6/2014,"Really disappointed.  I came for dinner tonight to celebrate my mother's birthday, who requested this restaurant because she's never been. We had a small party of 3.  It's Friday night so very busy, and we were fine with the 40 minute wait. We put our name in, got a buzzer and some drinks and sat outside to wait. Very nice ambience outside so we enjoyed ourselves until we noticed the waiting area clearing out and our buzzer never going off. After an hour we asked about the status of our table. The girl had to ask someone else and then took the buzzer back and said we would be seated shortly. After 10 minutes more we were finally seated. Nearly double the time we were initially told. No apologies for the wait.  As we were being walked back to our table, the hostess asked if we were celebrating anything. I mentioned it was my mom's bday and she asked her name so they could come sing. That never happened.  We got our menus and our server took our order. Our food came fairly quickly and we ate. My mom loved her food (miso salmon, although she said it tasted more like teriyaki), but my sister and I were not crazy about ours which were absolutely drenched in sauces that weren't very good (lemon herb chicken and shrimp scampi/steak Diane combo).  Then we sat and waited for our server to come back and check in so we could ask for boxes and possibly order some cheesecake. And we waited. And waited. For over 30 minutes where he was nowhere in sight (and he'd already been on break and back because another girl was introduced to us and helping during his break). Finally he came back to box our food and we asked for a dessert menu. He disappeared again so we decided to have my sister get the cheesecake to go from the front while I tried to get the check. That took another 20 minutes or so. We got there around 7 and didn't leave until after 10. Never once did anyone apologize for the long waits. I work in customer service and little things like that go a long way.  All in all I was displeased with the LONG waits and the service. Food really wasn't great either, especially for the price. Overpriced and overrated."
Marg L.,"Dublin, CA",0,21,,1.0,5/30/2016,"I'm so done with this restaurant chain. I keep promising I'll never return and then an out-of-town guest or family member (under 12) invariably talks me into giving this place another chance. But it's always the same disappointing experience. First of all, this place is outrageously overpriced for what you get, especially the cocktails, which are not even priced on the menu, so you get major sticker shock when the bill arrives later! Wth? I didn't even think that was legal. The bathrooms are always nasty and out of paper supplies or soap. The food is salty or bland (nothing in between); the bread is often hard; the tables and floors are always greasy and slippery, and they dim the lights so low each night for ""ambiance,"" that the seeing-impaired need to be assisted because they can't see the menu! If making a public place this dark isn't illegal, it should be! At least let me see the greasy, slippery floors I'm skidding across in my heals. Ugh. One of the worst chain restaurants ever. SO over-rated."
Michael T.,"Concord, CA",366,59,154,5.0,8/3/2014,Great first experience... Service was on point and very attentive. Food was good and flavorful. I ordered the combination of Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon and both were good. The Steak Diane was cooked to medium just how I ordered it.  I was full so I couldn't order any dessert. Maybe next time I'll endulge on one of their many flavors of cheesecakes.
Vanessa K.,"East Bay, CA",130,1017,485,3.0,8/8/2013,"This is a really beautiful cheesecake factory. I don't think I've gone to a cheesecake factory as decorated as this one, with such high ceilings too. The menu is massive. You need about 15-20 minutes of silence to digest it. Seriously.  Don't expect to catch up with a friend at the beginning, figure out the menu, what you're going to eat, order and then catch up.  The food is cheesecake factory. So it's usually the same across the board. I'm not a cheesecake person. Their cheesecakes are EXPENSIVE though. I wish they sold some with half the size and half the price."
Bob M.,"Discovery Bay, CA",1,61,,5.0,8/10/2014,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory yesterday with my wife and cousin. Hadn't been there in several years. Had their Kobe beef hamburger which I've had before and it was absolutely fantastic. My cousin had the same thing and she fell in-love with it...and she's NOT a ""hamburger person"" by any stretch of the imagination, so that's a compliment! My wife had  the ""everything pizza."" And she stated that it was one of THE BEST pizza's she had in a very long time.  We're lovers of Aladino's pizza and have been for several years. She said that this pizza was FAR BETTER than Aladino's, so it MUST have been really good because she's extremely picky about what she eats. The Highlight of the meal though was when I tried their new Lemon Meringue cheese cake.  That was a multi-orgasmic experience, and it's the only way to describe it. I'm sure it had a bazillion calories and fat grams, but it was worth every bite!  If you're a cheese cake lover, this is a MUST-EAT dessert item! AWESOME! Though the place was packed with probably 20 or more people waiting to be seated by the time we left, the service was over-the-top. Overall...a 5-STAR EXPERIENCE!!!"
Lily S.,"Antioch, CA",9,6,2,5.0,9/1/2016,This is my favorite restaurant in Walnut Creek!  Huge menu and great customer service!
Kira G.,"London, United Kingdom",53,114,5,4.0,8/4/2014,"I've only ever been to one other Cheesecake Factory before, but this was definitely the better one. It was clean, spacious and the service was great. Note: I went for a late lunch, so it wasn't particularly busy. French country salad thing was delicious. I keep trying to recreate it at home and somehow fail every time, so will have to just go back to the Cheesecake Factory, I guess. The restaurant is pretty big inside and there's also a nice outdoor seating area."
