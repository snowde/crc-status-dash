Stacey F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,18,2,5.0,8/4/2016,Victor and Helina are life savers! I dropped the ball and forgot to pick up a cake last night.  I called bright and early this morning at 8am and they don't open until 11am. Victor the manager was willing to let me pick the cake up at 9am (again before they open.) When I arrived the door was lock but Helina greeted me with a warm smile and had everything ready for me. I then left to realized I ordered the wrong cake. I ran back and Helina and Victor greeted me with a warm smile again and switch it out without a problem. I am an event planner and Victor & Helina made my job and morning a little less stressful and enjoyable. I truly appreciate your williness to go above the call of duty. You both showed great costumer services. I can not thank you enough. You made my week!
Patrick T.,"Walnut Creek, CA",6,203,3,3.0,8/2/2015,Was lured to Cheesecake Factory for a late late late dinner as it is one of the only places open super late.  Had a pizza.  It was average.  Had some wine.  It was average.  Service was great.  Prices are expensive. Generally not a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory in general and my exercise was in line with the average food.
Alex P.,"San Francisco, CA",243,55,15,3.0,4/25/2015,"I went to this place number of times, the food is average.Cheese cakes are better  but not custom made  they probably keep them frozen and heat up in the microwave or something like that.Nothing really special and overpriced too.You have to wait for the table if you coming like on the weekend.Bigger the amount of people ,you wanna seat, longer you have to wait. Service is OK, but it got to be even better for the price they charge. I went there once with a big group of people they switched waiters in the middle of the order  and the second waitress brought us order from the different table: all wrong.I don't blame them is a hard work, but if you running a place like that managers should stay on top of the things."
Ray A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,59,4,4.0,7/10/2016,"The best Cheesecake Factory I've tried in the country thus far. I love Cheesecake Factory and I've visited multiple locations around the country.  The food is great here. I hit them shy of a star, because they crumble during rush hour. They have to adjust to the service rush like bigger cities."
Therese D.,"San Francisco, CA",43,15,11,2.0,1/3/2016,"Customer service was not up to par. I mean this is cheesecake factory after all. The receptionist was very unfriendly. Im not sure how she got the job. It was just my husband and I and she didn't even offer open bar seating. There was an open spot but we got beat because I got distracted by her attitude. We had to wait 30mins. Food was expected but boy, by the time it came we were stuffed with water and bread. Would I come back here? Not anytime soon."
Joseph M.,"Pittsburg, CA",77,35,1,1.0,7/27/2016,"My experience at The Cheesecake Factory was horrible.  It was my boyfriend's birthday.  We had our first date and this location and he wanted to go back to celebrate.  The food took an hour to come out and the waiter said it was probably the well done burger, but it was actually the salad. How does a salad hold up a dinner by an hour.  After speaking with the manager he stated it took so long because the chicken was bad on the salad.  The fries were cold, and still cold when they brought back new fries.  We spoke to the manager about the horrible experience we were having and he offered cheesecake, but at this point the dinner was ruined.  We declined dessert and suggested he take the meals off the bill especially since he admitted the salad was the challenge with us waiting an hour for our food and the food was not good. He declined and said he could only offer cheesecake.  I informed him he was making our experience even worse.  He just walked away.  The manager took the cheese burger off the bill, but no one ever came over to even apologize or tell us they were taking anything off.  I really like the Cheesecake Factory and feel at this point we are not welcome here.  I do not think we will ever be returning to the Walnut Creek location again.  I feel we were treated not like customers, but like we a nuisance.  My boyfriend's birthday was ruined by this experience and we will never get that evening back again.  There are many other great restaurants within the area.  I recommend trying those instead."
Danielle V.,"Concord, CA",56,12,12,1.0,6/25/2015,Just went in there. Almost empty and there was still a 5-10 minute wait. After 10 minutes we left because the restaurant is nearly empty and there are a bunch of employees working!
Eric B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",2129,5344,4760,4.0,8/9/2012,"With its over-the-top Vegas-type decor (inside and out) and emphasis on large portioned gluttony, my visits to The Cheesecake Factory have been far and few between. For many, those features are exactly the point, and the Big Bang Theory TV series references probably help (eh, Wil Wheaton?). There's also a movie theater across the street and all of Downtown Walnut Creek beyond, so a dinner and movie date night seems to be an excellent option (among others). Then there's the matter of my Teenage Son and how much he might enjoy the many choices of food and of course dessert. On that note alone, I'll probably be back.  I was here for Lunch today as part of a Service Celebration. A colleague had reached a significant milestone of working for our Company for 30 years, and this meal was on us as a small token of our appreciation. We had a great time and very full meals, so much so that my Cheesecake slice will be coming home tonight for Family consumption.  I even thought that I had ordered light, but even a half sandwich (turkey), soup (chicken tortilla), and Caesar salad (The Renee's Special, same as Toni) was two enough for me. The interior space is huge and custom built for groups of all sizes. There's also a full bar up front, but unfortunately there would be no alcohol today as this was a work-related function. The food was surprisingly very good and the service was even better in terms of folks being friendly, helpful, and fast. So even though I still consider Cheesecake Factory to be a 3 Star dining option (e.g. OK, but I wouldn't go out of my way), our experience today clearly exceeded the sum of its parts."
Diana V.,"Walnut Creek, CA",811,543,2161,3.0,5/29/2011,"My parents got a gift card from my sister. This was their first time here. Yes, my parents are some of the last people in the Western World not to have ever eaten at The Cheesecake Factory. And they liked it : ) We showed up here at the appropriate time (check out my previous review) at 10 PM. The waiter was friendly and polite, and suggested several items from their extensive menu. We had a Fried Calamari Appetizer with Garlic Dip and Cocktail Sauce for the table. Quite tasty -- crisp and fresh, with great dipping sauces. My mother chose the Lemon-Herb Roasted Chicken with with Mashed Potatoes, Carrots, and Watercress with Lemon Garlic-Herb Sauce. My father had the Fish and Chips with Cole Slaw, French Fries, and Tartar Sauce. Both really enjoyed their dishes and were surprised at the huge portions. I had the Mahi Mahi Mediterranean with Penne Pasta substitued for the Mashed Potatoes, a suggestion of the waiter. I wasn't a big fan of the dish, and wouldn't order it next time. We topped off the night with the Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake. It was a big hit. Looks like I'm getting them a gift card for their second visit : )"
Gabe C.,"Downey, CA",60,10,17,4.0,10/16/2013,Great time and food at the Walnut Creek Cheese Cake Factory. Service good.  Thank you Big Gabe
Megan D.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/12/2016,"His Cheesecake Factory seems to have a ""too big to fail"" mentality. The manager doesn't seem to care when you have a problem with your order or get bad service and certainly doesn't do anything to fix the situation.  So far every time we've been to this Cheesecake Factory we have gotten the wrong order or were missing food altogether. The manager seems to think that since the restaurant is named ""Cheesecake Factory"" that people will just continue to show up to eat. I'm sad to say that this is probably the last time we will come to this Cheesecake Factory for a very long time.  The food is always good if and when we receive it but as mentioned above the service is abysmal and the staff think they can get away with anything. Hopefully the franchise owner realizes how bad his staff is and does a complete make over."
Jason S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/14/2016,This is the worst Cheesecake Factory in the country. I don't know how anyone in management still has a job. Three consecutive times to this place have been absolute disasters. There won't be a fourth.
Carlo J.,"Vallejo, CA",165,30,2,3.0,8/27/2013,"Went here for lunch. Ordered the Fettuccine w/ sun dried tomatoes. First time ordering that dish and it was very bland. I kept adding salt. The calamari was good. Salad was very bitter. The red velvet cheesecake was on point tho! Service was ok. This place is very nice tho. The high ceilings and art around and inside the building.  Also I would like to add that there was too many flies landing on the table, on the food, and in our faces."
Jessie O.,"Danville, CA",52,213,81,3.0,3/26/2016,"We came to The Cheesecake Factory around 8:00pm on a Thursday evening. We waited about 30 minutes for a table along with about 20-30 other people. I think we hit the end of the dinner rush. In hindsight I might have made a reservation. They have a great waiting/sitting area outside with heaters and a fire pit where you can sip drinks while checking your buzzer for a table every couple minutes. The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite chain restaurant for a romantic evening. The ambiance is great with the dim lighting and fancy aesthetic. I feel like I'm high rolling while I'm there. It feels like I'm dining at a high end resort. Unfortunately, the prices are fairly comparable with high end resort dining without the dining room views over a lake or golf course or the option of retiring to your luxury suite after the meal. My husband's mediocre salad was about $16, the same price as my fettucine alfredo (without the additional meat, which is extra). Both entrees seemed priced high. That's why we don't come here very often. It's a treat. My husband's barbeque ranch chicken salad came with frozen (yes, FROZEN!) tomatoes. That was the tip off that the tomatoes weren't fresh or hand chopped. Everything tasted like it was from a can he said and that he would feed the leftovers to our pet chicken. My fettucine alfredo was fine. We ordered the Adam's Peanut Butter  blah blah Ripple something cheesecake to go following our meal. After a couple days since we dined, it's still untouched in the fridge so I can't yet comment on it. But, it's the same cheesecake I always get when I dine at The Cheesecake Factory. It's my favorite, so hopefully they didn't screw that up. All in all, I enjoyed our dining experience for the most part, but since my husband already has to compromise to come here since he doesn't like it, it didn't help that his salad was so awful. I'll have hard time convincing him to come back.."
Haley A.,"Lafayette, CA",0,2,4,1.0,1/17/2016,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory numerous times, but this was by far one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. We showed up at 6:30 and we were told that the wait would be 40 minutes. 40 minutes later and our buzzer hadn't gone off yet. 20 minutes later (60 total) we were still waiting. Finally after an hour and 10 minutes, we were finally seated. It was 7:40 at that point. We were starving and irritated.  Our server was nice, but it took 20 minutes after I placed my order for her to come back and tell me that they were ""out of the teriyaki chicken"" (how do you run out of chicken??) So I had to order again and my food came 10 minutes later than the rest of our group. Some of us ordered wine during our meal which came when we were done eating. Overall a horrible experience. It took us a total of 3 hours to eat dinner. We will NOT be back."
Michael C.,"Alameda, CA",89,257,59,4.0,4/15/2013,"Love the cheesecake experience.  The menu has 1 zillion things on it, a full bar, great desert so what more could you ask for... how about less tacky decorations, less columns in the middle of the restaurant just for show and better prices, I am just saying. I am not a tourist so don't charge me like one.  A nice nature meeting place for a date (for easy get away if need be).  Bring our appetite, the serve good since portions and you will leave stuffed."
Nineveh S.,"Hanford, CA",5,33,3,1.0,11/9/2015,Service sucked!!!! It was so loud between the music and sitting next to the kitchen our server got half of our order wrong. I won't be coming back!
Katrina F.,"Concord, CA",116,55,8,1.0,7/29/2015,I walked in after work after 10:00 pm more then half of the restaurant is open and I asked for a table of one and was told it would be a 10 min wait. It's now been 10 mins of waiting and I have not gotten a table. Why can't you sit a party of 1? It also happens to be my birthday present to myself to have a fancy dinner but I guess your not allowed to eat by yourself? They called my name 12 mins after for a party of two how rude. Way to lose business.
Manzy A.,"Hercules, CA",3,17,4,5.0,10/16/2015,"I always come to this location and everyone is awesome there. I usually come in around lunch and always see familiar faces but this time we were here on a Friday night and it was packed. 30 minute wait time, no biggie. I was thinking hour and half. Exactly 30 minutes, awesome. For being as busy as it was the food came out fast. Servers taking orders, refilling drinks, even clearing plates back to back. Usually I always settle for their pizza, Ikr pizza.. But tonight I had their Steak Medallion medium rare.. For appetizers, cheese balls, mushrooms, and lettuce tacos (omg, their dark vinaigrette or w/e it was). All i have to say is I've been missing out all this time. My girl ordered some kind of pasta but she ended up eating half of the steak, 3/4 my mash potatoes of my entrée usually that would of made me annoyed but it was good I had to share it with her lol!  + ask for extra croutons on the dish :) I only had like two!!"
Dennis C.,"Vacaville, CA",0,8,,3.0,10/16/2016,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek for brunch with my wife and sister. The restaurant was very crowded and noisy when we got there, but we were seated after just a short wait. That was when things went south. It took 10 minutes after we were seated for out server to come over and ask us about a drink order, which we gave to him. It then took another 15 minutes to get our beverages (Iced tea, bloody mary and chardonnay). It then took another 10 minutes for him to come back and get an order from us. At that time, we requested a smaller cup for my sister's iced tea and some sweetener. A quick fix, right? Well, after waiting for a substantial time, my wife went to an adjoining table to retrieve some sweetener and asked one of the busboys for a small cup, which he immediately retrieved. When our server came by and saw that the cup and sweetener had been taken care of (by someone other than him, he apologized, and said our food would be right out. It took another 15 minutes for the food to arrive, and it arrived in three stages, not all at the same time. The food itself was very good, but all the extraneous problems that had preceded it had left a bitter taste in our mouths about our dining experience. Customers, especially those not complaining about long waits, need to be a primary concern in a restaurant, especially one that has so much local competition. As far as the future for us attending this restaurant, I think i will have second thoughts about eating at this establishment."
