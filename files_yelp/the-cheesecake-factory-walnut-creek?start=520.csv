Tracy L.,"San Ramon, CA",195,825,207,2.0,9/3/2012,"VERY SLOOOOW service, mediocre food.  Compared to about 10 years ago, the food at The Cheesecake Factory has declined.  The food is not great, but just okay.  But coupled with the super slow service and you get a place that you'd rather not revisit.   Although we did dine here on Labor Day, we arrived early enough to get a table ASAP.  But after that, the waitress took a long time to get to us - to order drinks, order food, bring boxes, and the check.  I used to think Cheesecake Factory was child-friendly, but it's not b/c with a toddler you need your food fast, and you at least need the option to be able to find your waitress and get the check fast just in case your little one acts up."
Kimberley S.,"Broadlands, VA",20,38,64,1.0,6/26/2015,"My family went to this cheesecake for dinner on 06/26/15 at around 9:00pm. I ordered a dinner entrée the consisted of the Herb crusted salmon and shrimp scampi. This is a 20 dollar entrée. I received 3 pieces of shrimp and about a 3oz (doubtful ) piece of salmon. It honestly looked as if half my salmon fell off. I also received a couple stalks of asparagus and an abundance of broccoli. I was appalled that this plate left the kitchen and was presented to me. I sent it back. That manager came over and almost rudely offered me the missing piece of my salmon. I declined because the dish was insulting and shows a lack of pride in the establishment, the manager was insulting as well, and the price was insulting for that ridiculously presented meal."
Kitty D.,"Alamo, CA",64,756,913,4.0,3/25/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is a fun busy place. I love the fire pit outside and the buzz inside as well. Staff are friendly and I love the lettuce wraps or huevos rancheros plus the dessert sampler! Lemon drop is good too,! Garage parking. Be prepared to wait for the always long queue but be entertained by looking at the dessert case."
Miranda C.,"San Ramon, CA",57,17,8,2.0,7/10/2016,"I work in the area, and I usually order by phone and pick up in the restaurant. I used to do this pretty regularly, and I loved picking up from here! But the past 5 times I have ordered, something has been wrong, forgotten, or even when I have arrived they don't have any record of my order! There are also many times where I call, and when they go to transfer me so I can place my order, I am on hold for more than 5-10 minutes, and I end up just hanging up because I don't have time to wait any longer since I would still have to wait 20+ minutes for my food. The bad experiences have been an ongoing trend for the past 5-6 months, and I kept giving them more chances because I love the food so much, but I think that they need to be aware of the fact that their reputation is going downhill. Only on the occasion where they had no record of my order did they apologize, and they also gave me a free cheesecake slice, but every other time I never even get an apology, or a thank you for your patience. I just want to be confident about dining here again, so fingers crossed they can improve their service!"
Hans J.,"Livermore, CA",30,4,,1.0,1/1/2016,"Ordered a Caesar salad, but asked the chicken be substituted with shrimp. They bring the salad w/ no shrimp. We had to ask again for the shrimp; Then they bring 6 small shrimp for the entire salad and charge and extra 9.90 for the 6 shrimp. Also very few refills on water. Almost ignored most of the time. Very poor service. We are not coming back here and recommend others don't either."
Joann C.,"San Jose, CA",1,4,,2.0,7/26/2016,"We had the worst service here yesterday by Cesar.  We had ask twice for someone to come to take our drink order.  Then when our food came one of the orders wasn't ready so they gave her a ""comp"" side salad while she waited. Then, we ordered a piece of cheesecake to share and it had a piece of plastic in the cake which we were told was from the cake covering.  Asked for the manager and he just apologized and I told him to take the cheesecake off the bill which he did, but I tried to talk to him about the poor service he showed no interest in what I was saying nor did he comment.  Will not go there again."
Julie R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",5,3,1,1.0,10/15/2014,"The service was terrible!! Took 20 minutes to get our drinks and another 25 to get our food. I really liked this place but now I will tell my family and friends not to eat there.  At one point there was only one bartender. My friend kept ordering and the waiter kept telling her they were out of it. If you are a restaurant you should have what's on the menu.  Again, I will never go back and I will tell anyone that ask not to go there!!!!!"
Remie M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",864,652,525,4.0,2/13/2013,"i've ALWAYS been a fan of Cheesecake Factory, no matter what city Im in! I love their food! I came here with my BFFs. . . this was midpoint of both of us.  Wait time was 40mins.  This is located rt across the Forever 21!!! It had a fantastic fountain in the front.  Service was great! Portions are always big! I ordered the spicy chicken sandwhich with sweet potato fries.  Delish! Most definately coming back 2 meet my BFFs, next time im in town."
Nakul B.,"Emeryville, CA",237,141,144,4.0,4/22/2013,"This place is MASSIVE! This is the largest Cheesecake Factory I have ever been too. The decor is really nice, and very fitting for the posh culture of walnut creek. Now onto the food, we started with the avocado crunch rolls, which were really good with their pesto sauce. Then for the entree, I had their famous Cajun Jumbalaya. It was just as good as always, and the portion is pretty massive so go there hungry! Their service was very friendly and helpful in making decisions. We also had mojitos for the table, and everyone agreed that they were really good and quite strong. The servers were missing at times, and would not come by the table often enough to check if we needed anything (which we did), so that would be the only flaw. My entire group  agreed that their food was cooked well, and the dishes were delicious.  TLDR: Great food, massive restaurant, and good atmosphere!"
Daniel V.,"Oakland, CA",6,6,,4.0,2/2/2016,i take my wife once a week to cheesecake factory  in walnut creek. and we love it is nice location and great service
Sonya W.,"Benicia, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/10/2016,"On Monday, I made a 5pm reservation for Friday.  I get here, and staff indicate I have no reservation.  The manger then comes over and ask, in my opinion rudely, with whom I spoke to and any other information that I got from the host.  So, after talking to him, he said he could get me in at 5pm so long as the rest of my party was there. 5 pm comes, and then they tell me that our server is not coming until 5:15pm, and that we can be seated then. What, my reservation was suppose to be at 5 pm.  Staff gave us a pager at this time.  5:25pm, they call our party via name not buzzing on pager.  The manager then indicates that he told me to talk to him when our whole party was here (we were all here at 5pm).  We then asked why then were we given a pager and he didn't know.  Poor customer service. Staff seems throughly confused.  Only reason why we stayed to eat was because we had a gift certificate.  Not coming back here, we were treated poorly."
Christina S.,"Oakland, CA",68,118,88,3.0,8/27/2012,"Well I gave it a 3. Had to ask my boyfriend for help... 3 stars or 4...? Problem is we come here a lot and we wont stop coming here because we like a nice sit down place and its close to my work downtown.... Here's the breakdown: Drinks: 5 stars Food: 3 Service: 3.5 Cleanliness: 4.5 Cheesecake: OMG 5 I'm always strangely optimistic about ordering food here. What sounds good on paper is always better that what you get. Maybe it's because its such an enormous menu, they can't spend too much time making every entree special and perfect. Maybe they should stick to drinks and dessert. Speaking of drinks: I love cocktails,here  they're strong and flavorful and they always come out to the table looking beautiful as ever. We've started ordering slices of cheesecake to-go, as we are usually too full for it after dinner or lunch. But just as I remember from many many years ago, their cheesecake is TO DIE FOR. It's called the cheesecake factory for a reason. If you have a drink and dinner and leave, I'm sure your review of the place would be SIGNIFICANTLY different than if you had cheesecake too :)"
D H.,"Alamo, CA",0,14,,4.0,12/10/2015,We're trying  again. Their food has been declining. But their cheesecake is stll delicious.
Tina A.,"San Francisco, CA",247,796,297,3.0,8/21/2012,"Cheesecake factory is generally consistent, but this one is a little below par in comparison to san francisco (which i used to go to every month) Firecraker Salmon Rolls - super yummy, small portion appetizer as always, but over here they make the salmon well done instead of leaving the center raw, so it was drier than usual but the sauce was still super yummy and they gave a HUGE amount of red cabbage, which made it look like it was more than just a garnishing, so we ate it and it was not bitter at all Tex Mex Eggrolls - mexico meets china wonton wrappers, it was pretty awesome and probably my favorite of the night.  corn, cheese, chicken, and other goodies packed into an eggrol. Cajun Chicken Jambalaya - the same delicious large portion of seasoned chicken and pasta, however it was SUPER salty compared to what i'm used. Shrimp Scampi - the sauce was a delicious heart attack of butter waiting to happen, but the shrimp did not have that crispy hot battered crust that i'm used to having, it was a little undercooked and soggy, but everything in that sauce is just too awesome Cookie Dough Cheesecake - YUM!!  is all i have to say.  my personal favorite is the white chocolate raspberry truffle but pretty much all the cheesecakes here are amazing being consistently safe, cheesecake factory is always a good choice when no one knows where to go for dinner"
Brad L.,"Discovery Bay, CA",1,252,39,5.0,11/3/2015,Our server  HOUSTON was absolutely fabulous he brought me a soda refill every five minutes leaving it to go away because I was so hot and thirsty.   I have the turkey club and the potstickers they were amazing.  The flatbread pizza was a little burnt and was considering three or four stars but David our server  made up for it and earned a five-star overall rating.  Thank you !!!
Jash P.,"La Mirada, CA",436,299,793,4.0,1/31/2013,"I didn't think our venture into Walnut Creek would include a familiar restaurant: Cheesecake Factory. Well, it was worth it, especially when we took our friend for her first time, and also sneakily surprised/embarrassed her with a birthday cheesecake at the end of the meal! Wait Time: None. Excuse me?! Are we at the right place? Usually, we wait at least 45 minutes to get seated at our local Cheesecake factory in the City. Context, we did go on a Tuesday night around 7:30pm. You'd think more people would be going out during dinner time. Food: We split deep fried macaroni and cheese balls. YUM! Ever since my friend introduced me to them, we must always order that appetizer. I had the shrimp scampi pasta. It was definitely on the rich side, and very filling! Their brownie sundae was disappointing. I must have had high expectations; I was expecting something akin to Ghirardeli's sundaes, but nope, the brownie was not chewy, and the presentation was spread out on a plate rather than in a cup/bowl. Thus, ORDER THEIR CHEESECAKE for dessert; you won't be disappointed with that. Service:  Our waiter Billy was super helpful! Hah, he definitely understood my subtle hints on reminding him of our bday surprise! Validation: If you parked in the parking structure near SF Creamery, you are in no luck. They won't take your parking token. They even asked me what was I giving them/where I got the token -_-! For those that parked valet near Cheesecake Factory, they will validate your parking ticket! Price: It's cheesecake factory. On a budget? Split with a friend. Done deal."
Addrianna G.,"Antioch, CA",0,6,,5.0,1/15/2016,Great customer service .Food is awesome. Will come back for sure. Lot of options for veggie lovers.
Kat S.,"San Ramon, CA",27,83,2,3.0,8/24/2015,"Kind of sad salad. Honestly, a salad from Rocco's is much much better, and half the price. Cheesecake is all that is good. Always along wait, even for the sad salad. They should do some cheesecake samplers..."
Dasonda C.,"Vallejo, CA",55,6,2,1.0,9/27/2015,Went to eat for my daughter's birthday and the food was nasty. I even brought my husband home chicken fettuccine and it was dry with no taste.  Will never go back there. This was the third time this has happened at the walnut Creek restaurant.
Andrew P.,"Oakley, CA",2,14,2,5.0,9/21/2015,"Came in just for a cheesecake to go. The first person I saw immediately helped me figure out my options, then handed me off to another very helpful person who prepared the cake quickly and I left with clear instructions for serving it at home."
