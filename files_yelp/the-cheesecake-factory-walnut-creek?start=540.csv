C C.,"Tracy, CA",1,15,3,5.0,10/5/2013,"We went to cheesecake last night and it was pretty yummy! I started with a mango Melon cooler and I had the shrimp scampi&steak diane. My bf had some sort of coconut shrimp.. He liked it. Although, the most fascinating part of our experience was watching about 15+ servers pass our table before we were helped. We both work in the industry, and thought it was interesting that not one of the servers stopped to ask of we had been helped. When our server, Kristina, came to our table she was awesome. I hate going out to eat bc I always give better service than I get, although she was great! We will be back bc of her and turns out we're glad all of the other careless servers didn't help us to begin with. Request Kristina!"
Kira I.,"Vallejo, CA",30,62,46,5.0,8/29/2012,"I am Cheesecake Factory obsessive, but I am extremely picky of the actual restaurants I choose to dine at. This has to be my top bay area spot, other then one I went to in LA. I love the location and the service. The food has NEVER EVER disappointed me. Sometimes it can be a bit pricey, but I think it is a great upscale spot for lunch dates, and dinners.  They have a beautiful dinning area out side with like a fire pit to keep you warm. My go to meal is the 3 cheese penne and a fresh strawberry shortcake. Also if their main menu seems to be a little outside you budget the have a great lunch menu for like half the price, and they serve til 5pm. So you can get great lunch or an early dinner.  Last but not least they recently added a new skinny menu, so they offer most of the same great foods, but they cut down the calories and carbs. I haven't exactly tried this menu, though I have heard good things; I am still all about fat and calories. Pound them on(;"
Tiana A.,"Antioch, CA",3,30,14,2.0,7/21/2014,"After 16 days of works (& counting) my fiancé and I finally decided to ask my sister to watch the kids to get a Mommy & Daddy night. We decided to try the Cheesecake Factory after rave reviews from family and friends. As we arrived, we were in awe how beautiful it was.. Inside and OUT! Fire fountain in middle of the outside waiting area (which was filled) and then all the beautiful lights and structural masterpieces within the building.  We arrived at 6:42pm on A Sunday. We put our names in, only 20 min wait for two, no problem! We went outside enjoy the beautiful view of the fire fountain and street. Now, in Cheesecake Factory when your table is ready they text you! Wow, way to blow our minds.. I mean in a world no one really talks on the phone, pretty amazing. We got our text at 7:05, we went to the front & was told ""Great! Step to the side & your waiter will be back to walk to your table!"" Well, SIX other families also got that same text AFTER us and went to their tables before us. FOUR other couples stepped to the side AFTER us and when to their tables. All along after, another 20 min wait, we received a table. (Almost an hour now)  We got a small booth in the back, which was overlooked by another booth. Awkward..  It was NOISY! Kids screaming, people chattering, silver wear clanking... Not as intimate as we were expecting!  We ordered Orange chicken & Angel Hair Pasta with Shrimp. My fiancé loved his chicken. My shrimp was OVERcooked to the point it was chewy. Gross. I didn't even eat the angel hair pasta because the ""touch"" of marinara was covering the plate. (I'm not found of marinara sauce, on any dish.) either I misread the description of my plate, or they winged in the kitchen.  Overall:  Somewhere we would not visit again. Pricey, loud, not the best service, but great cheesecake. That's about it."
Amy S.,"Concord, CA",881,1788,13506,3.0,7/8/2012,"I like the Cheesecake Factory and I feel like service there can be really great or really disappointing. It's pretty inconsistent. Typically the food is really good.  My fiance and I had an important meeting (6/6/12) with my boss the other night so we wanted to take him and his wife to dinner.  We all met at the restaurant and I ordered a grilled artichoke as an appetizer ($5 for Happy Hour) - my fiance ordered the spiniach artichoke dip $5 HH menu as well).  I have to say, 9 out of 10 times the food is excellent. The artichoke on this particular evening was awful. I am not sure they boiled it at all before grilling it: Tough, unflavorful, almost inedible  :(  The spinach dip was great - but we had a semi-smaller table in the bar area (though, it was regular seating - not bar service) and the spinach plate and chip plate were huge. It overwhelmed the small table and our limited space.   For dinner my fiance ordered sliders ($5 HH menu), as did my boss' wife. They both seemed pleased with the food and finished their smaller plates.  My boss ordered a huge sandwich & salad combo. I actually didn't pay attention to what the sandwich was but he said it was good - except that he ordered his plate with NO cheese, and it arrived with cheese. In the salad AND sandwich.  He's extremely lactose intolerant and had to be careful while eating.  I ordered the lettuce wraps - very good, except for the 3 sauces it came with.  P.F. Chang's serves this on their HH menu and they make a spicy, soy sauce type dip to go with it - I asked for hot sauce but received Tobasco. Can I call the weak sauce patrol? Not really thick enough for dipping... All four of us ordered (non-alcoholic) drinks. My boss and his wife had a sweetened tea, I had unsweetened tea, and my fiance had a Coke. Before the dinner was over, my fiance's half-full Coke was filled.... with tea.  Yes, tea - and he hates tea. My unsweetened tea was also filled at one point, with a sweetened tea. I drank it but I felt the server really messed up big time here. His lack of attention to detail was annoying and it makes you think twice the next time you're picking a place for dinner. AND we were never offered dessert or cheesecake at the end. I don't know that I would have accepted for sure, but my boss said something as we were walking out - and often if other people order dessert, I do too. The dinner was $59.27 before tip. Not terrible for a group of four - but having to pay even $1 for service like that makes me grimace."
Jessamyn W.,"Oakland, CA",161,524,165,3.0,7/17/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is fun because they have so many choices, there is something for everyone. This location is huge and the interior is beautiful and looks like a fancy hotel. The outside eating area is pretty nice, too, though a great deal quieter than inside (TURN DOWN THE MUSIC!)  The Cheesecake Factory is best for comfort food. Though they do have a diet menu, something I cannot say of other chain restaurants, nothing on it really appealed to me. The burger I had was delicious and the Oreo shake I had was okay, but not as thick as I would have hoped for. They are also one of those restaurants that serves HUGE portions and then asks you if you want dessert afterward (um, no thanks. I'm stuffed after those HUGE portions of food).  The service was decent up until we got our food, then it got sort of strange. The servers we had were friendly, but at times a bit too friendly. I declined on a slice of tasty sounding, but caloric and fattening, piece of cheesecake and got a ""but it's the Cheesecake Factory!"" from our server, which I felt was a teeny bit rude. Before that, a server made a comment on my food (""a cheeseburger and a milkshake. That's a lot of food!""), which I felt was also a bit rude. I understand that they were trying to be friendly, but they were trying too hard in my book and it made me feel self-conscious about what I had ordered.  In general, this is a pretty good restaurant and I'll probably be back because the food is so freaking tasty."
Michelle M.,"Belmont, CA",197,1852,605,2.0,3/25/2012,"Don't get mad at me Yelper's, but I didn't have a great experience here.  Walking in I was astonished by how grand this specific Cheesecake Factory was.  It is freaking HUGE!!!  Probably the largest I've been to yet.  So I was expecting the best experience ever, plus the fact I was in uppity Walnut Creek.  Rich people don't put up with shit.  Well, am I wrong.   1) Service was not at all up to par.  Waiter served tables that got there later than us and gave them bread before us.  We were hungry women dammit. 2) Again waiter, we had to like wave our hands just to get his attention.  This was even for the bill. 3) Bathrooms were like a war zone.  Nasty water all over the floor.  Toilet paper rolls empty, with spare rolls on the toilet bowl. Leaving I just didn't feel happy.  My recommendation is if you come here and you are hungry, don't!  Be slightly hungry, because it will be a while before you are seated, have you order taken and when your food is placed in front of you. *Bonus:  The outdoor seating!  That looked so cool.  There are heated lamps and a beautiful fireplace."
Savannah S.,"Davis, CA",45,73,188,5.0,7/6/2012,"I've never been disappointed with any of the food here. My ""usual"" would be the Chicken Bellagio. Though somewhat salty, it's absolutely delicious!  The atmosphere is always nice and the service is always friendly.  Definitely a place to visit if you haven't before."
John S.,"Alamo, CA",0,27,2,1.0,5/8/2014,"I hate that their menus now have advertisements. This is ridiculous, a restaurant is supposed to be a escape from the stresses of life. If there are ads, then the ads should be discounting the food that we purchase right..?"
Lisa C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",250,285,366,4.0,8/13/2015,"Wonderful brunch! I loved the Georgia Peach cocktail I had. We also ordered the pretzel crusted chicken and they gave us a selection of sauces, peanut was my favorite...All the dishes were delicious and elegantly presented. I had the endive salad, which was a bit overdressed  but flavorful and fresg and avocado rolls, as well. They were welcoming to my son. I was also told by a cuban sandwhich conneissieur that they have an exceptional cuban. Nothing special about the fries or service. I like that the waoter does not brng the food, the chefs hands do. Their water measured at an 90TDS parts per million. This is not awful, but best to be 10 or below. The parking is very accommodating. The place is well conditioned so the temperature is perfect. They have the option for outside or inside seating, although the hostess qas a bit of an airhead. We ordered three cheesecakes to go, they look very promising and well presented. The cookie dough, salted caramel and reeses cup cheescake. They did not offer crayons or coloring for my son, but the waitress was friendly. I thoroughly enjoyed the avocado egg rolls and they were able to conclude that the avocados came from ventura California. This is good. I would give them a 4.5 if I could. It was a very enjoyable brunch, however  the menu can be a lot to take in. It is a BOOK. This can also be part of the fun experience, though."
Kimberly S.,"Concord, CA",4,84,19,5.0,5/31/2015,"Came here after work at about 10 PM, our servers name was Candice. She was absolutely amazing! It is so refreshing to have a server so passionate and upbeat with their customers, especially that late at night. She recommended several dishes and helped us pick out dessert. She was just so sweet and has the best customer service! PS. the corn cakes and the Thai lettuce wraps are the best..also the lemon raspberry cheesecake! You rock Candice!"
Megan M.,"Lafayette, CA",358,376,197,4.0,4/9/2014,"I like the Cheesecake Factory even though it is a chain. The decoration and light fixtures in this place are beautiful. The menu is extensive and I like how they have a skinny menu now too. The portions are huge and even my salad from the skinny menu was plenty. I love the bread they bring especially the brown bread.  There is all types of food there, but I usually get the same old salad because I love it. It's the endive salad without chicken.  The drinks are good and of course the cheesecake mmm. This is a special occasion place and good for celebration dinners or parties even though they don't take reservations. Plan on waiting awhile, but there is a nice bar area so grab a drink and make the most of your experience."
Nasus W.,"Fairfield, CA",1,36,23,5.0,4/22/2014,Great food!  The kale quinoa salad is fabulous... Even if you don't like kale. WOW...I'll be back
Joe B.,"Turlock, CA",0,78,15,3.0,8/23/2015,"Good food good service as usual. We went to 1515 , service sucked so came here Cause we knew we were getting good food and service. Buttttttt takes forever to get the food. Already been here for hour still no food. 30 min wait and 30 mint sitting at table . So maybe service isn't the best lol ."
Jacqueline J.,"San Francisco, CA",173,117,553,4.0,6/29/2014,This cheese cake factory is really good! Great service and selection of food! Also their cheesecakes are delish!! So many assortments :)
Janet R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,10,3,2.0,9/20/2015,"I enjoying coming to cheesecake, but the wait time in Walnut Creek is unacceptable. I have been waiting over 30 minutes for my food. Our waiter has not stopped to let is know anything. Horrible customer service today.  The food is exceptional most times, but the wait time is way too long."
Cristian A.,"Concord, CA",0,9,4,3.0,12/8/2015,"We were seated pretty quickly which was nice for a busy Friday night. Our waitress came by shortly after we were sat down and offered us drinks, we initially asked for water while we looked at the ~16 page menu (wtf, cut down on that CF). She took a good 15 minutes to bring two glasses of water and some bread & butter, and the bread was cold and slightly stale. For what I ordered, I asked for the Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork burger. It was very tasty, and the fries that came with it were perfectly done! Overall the service was meh, the food was good."
Ono A.,"Contra Costa, CA",7,17,1,1.0,8/17/2014,"One star for the host & hostess desk when you ck in! We told the hostess, party of three. When the host called us he had a party for two. WTF?! They said oh 15 minutes for first available. Yeah, right! Get it together hostess ck in. They are so disorganized taking reservations. Then they line up tickets that print out along the counter. On one by one someone comes by calls out a name and good luck if you can hear above the noise. No PA to hear your name called. Good Luck...then your table is given away!!!  Oh but the food 4 Stars!!!"
D A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,7,,4.0,9/14/2014,"THE GOOD: Good cheesecakes, appetizers, pasta. Affordable kids menu for the Kiddies (all else not so much). Super friendly servers.  THE BAD: Long wait times (no reservations - one time we had to wait 45 mins; with reservations - we still had to wait 10 mins); Decibel level can be pretty high with the loud music plus everyone else's conversations and can't blame them as I seriously think you need to speak loud to hold a conversation in this location."
Stacy B.,"Fairfield, CA",40,17,,2.0,9/12/2015,"Server was unpleasant when asked if anything was vegan on the menu, the sauces are all pre-made and can't be tweaked. The fries are fried with their fish and chicken (in the same oil, not good news for vegetarians). So above all the service was sub par and server was irritated when I customized my entrée to fit my dietary needs. The food however was pretty delicious just wish the service was better!"
Anja A.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",81,22,9,1.0,9/11/2015,Oh my god!! I dont know what happened but this place went downhill. Our salads were wilted. The steak was fatty as heck and my chicken had zero flavor.  It was awful.  I will not be returning.
