Sonya L.,"Vacaville, CA",68,5,14,2.0,10/14/2014,"I knew it was going to be a bad experience from the moment  the host hold me it was going to be a 20 min. wait and it turned out to be 40 min. Double the time...  As I am ordering my food, I was asking questions about the crusted chicken Romano and I asked if I could substitute the tomatoe sauce with marinara sauce...she said yes but when got the food...it was a total different plate than what I had asked for.... idk who's fault it was but I certainly didn't want to wait another 30min for my food. I attempted to eat it bit it was just gross....note I had order the exact same plate at the location of Corte Madera and it was amazing.  For drinks... I ordered water...just water but when my bill came in it had 3 sprites....it was only a party of 2 so not sure if the ghost was drinking sprite with us... Not sure if it was just a bad day to be there but I hope next time is better...."
Miss R.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,83,44,5.0,7/18/2014,"Their patio is dog friendly! The bread is yummy! The Chicken Bellagio is amazing, I order it every time I eat here, in the Bay or in Thousand Oaks. But, I wish the calorie chart wasn't on the table. I don't want to know that my favorite dish has over 2,000 calories! Oy! And the lemonade is too sour for my taste, but it's fresh so that's a good thing. I've met the guy who started this restaurant chain. He is a very nice man, and because of that I enjoy coming here and spending money. He takes care of his employees, and he himself treated me very kindly too, 5 stars!"
Betsy W.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",21,53,4,1.0,5/4/2014,"Worst grilled fish  tacos I've ever had...topped with bland tomato chunks,   no hint of guacamole or sour cream.  Not spicy, not warm, just boring....yuk."
Brandon W.,"Antioch, CA",45,14,2,4.0,1/20/2013,Had the Orange Chicken and got the sauce on the side and thank god I did cuz it wasn't that good. It was warm but looked like FRIKEN Jello. Other than that I must say our server Fernando was great and on top of it we never had to ask for a beverage refill. That's a big deal in my book! Plus it helps that he was kinda cute!  Cheers!
M S.,"Hercules, CA",1,23,,1.0,4/13/2015,"Went on a Saturday night and put our name down for a party of 8 which they were adamant in telling us the wait would be 3 hours long. A three hour was would put us at 11:30 and the restaurant closes at 11. That's weird. Anyway, we decided to go elsewhere and 20 minutes later I receive a phone call from the hostess saying our table was ready and that Henry the Manager chased after me immediately when I left. 1) No he didn't. 2) They were abrupt and adamant on it being a three hour wait. So why would I wait? I specifically told them we had three out of town guests that were diabetics and yet they did nothing to resolve the necessity to get these people fed!  We went right down the street, told the hostess the same thing and were immediately given drinks and a complimentary appetizer until a table was ready.  Anyways 1 star for at least calling us to tell us our table was ready. Thanks for not accommodating us and for trying to lie and cover it all up that you attempted to reach out. You did nothing whatsoever to accommodate us. I think Henry needs stress, management and customer service training. He was really short with his customers that evening. Not good for being a front line man...just saying."
D O.,"Waikiki, Honolulu, HI",0,16,4,1.0,10/4/2015,"Honestly the worst customer service ever. The food is ok(just ok) , they're not very attentive and seem to get orders wrong quite often. If you want to wait 50min for salad so be it. I actually tried to give the benefit of the doubt but this time it's I got the same result , bad service. I don't know if it's because they hire young people but if you ask me they're not very professional.."
Breonna T.,"Marina, CA",0,24,4,1.0,3/28/2015,"I went here for a party. I bought 5 or 6 pieces of cheesecake to go, but when I got home they had given me all of the wrong cheesecakes. I called, waited on hold for over 20 minutes and they told me they would send me a gift card for the value. I provided my information and they never sent me the card. When I called to follow up three weeks later they told me ""I'm sorry, but we don't send gift cards for incorrect orders."" I was very disappointed when I paid $37 for slices of cheesecake, got the wrong ones, was told it would be corrected, and it never was. I won't go back to this cheesecake factory. I am very disappointed by the service I received and the fact that they never followed through with correcting their mistake."
Nicholas T.,"Pleasanton, CA",1,12,4,3.0,8/27/2014,"Good place to go when you get off work at 10pm! It's the only place open that late during the week. A big plus.  I always sit at the bar because they serve full menu, plus constant service. Who doesn't love that? (And the bartenders are really friendly, especially Ryan)  Downside though: the menu is so overwhelming. I've been going for years and still haven't tasted all the pastas. And the quality of the food doesn't match the prices. The food isn't anything special. But just good.  Mondays - Thursday nights customer service is spot on. Friday-Sunday nights, you'll be lucky to see your waiter at least every 20 minutes. Definitely suggest going earlier during weekends or daytime. But I always eat here weekday nights so I never truly experience the Friday night rush, which is completely understandable for a popular restaurant like them."
Lisa S.,"Brentwood, CA",6,53,8,3.0,7/7/2014,"My family came here after a long day at Kaiser Walnut Creek. I ordered the ""Chicken Afredo fettuccine with sun dried tomatoes"" and that was okay. The chicken was a bit dried. My kids ordered the kids slider and bow tie butter and parmesan pasta. The sliders was okay. My husband ordered an enormous Chinese chicken salad which he loved. My mother ordered the sandwich combo. Everything was okay. Nothing extraordinary from any other restaurant. I give two star for the food and another star for the Godiva cheese cake. I will return back only if we crave for a cheesecake, other than that...I rather explore nearby restaurants in Walnut Creek."
Jerrold U.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,3,,5.0,5/2/2015,"Had my bday dinner there tonight came early 6:00 got a booth right away great food rib eye steak that was very tender a country French salad lemon meringue cheese cake an coffee. Add great service, for a good night"
W B.,"Cathedral City, CA",21,81,19,2.0,5/23/2014,Great atmosphere friendly staff. Mediocre food and inexperienced waiter. Food was over cooked and obviously not eaten. I was not asked why my food was untouched.  He brought a box which I ha to fill myself. It was literally for my dog but it was a messy job and I was wearing white.  Come for a drink go down the street for food lots of options.
Judi V.,"Lafayette, CA",5,9,16,5.0,5/1/2015,"There is more to the Cheesecake factory than goey, sweet desserts. In fact, I didn't think I would leave the restaurant without eating dessert, but the lunch I had today was so filling and delicious that I didn't have room for a sweet, tasty treat. Trying to decide on what to eat is challenging as there are many choices, but when I saw Miso salmon on the lunch menu I had to try it! The whole wheat bread was served as an appetizer while I waited for my meal and truthfully I could have been satisfied with a meal of the bread. Straight from the oven and slathered in butter it was wonderful. The waitress asked if I wanted the lunch or full size meal and I got the lunch size. The miso salmon was served on a round bed of brown rice(my choice...I could have had white), with a creamy white sauce and the miso/teriyaki sauce on top of the good-sized salmon was scrumptious ! If you visit the Cheesecake Factory and have a craving for salmon then definitely try the miso salmon. You won't be disappointed! A side note....the staff is helpful, friendly, prompt, don't rush you and are very professional. Good job everyone!"
Geno R.,"Berkeley, CA",8,3,,4.0,9/27/2014,"4stars, waiter was nice. However food came out slow, not her fault.  The place is very well kept. Everything else was cool. Nothing too crazy or special but definitely not bad or terrible. 4 stars was given only because the food was slow, it still tasted excellent! Big ups cheesecake!"
Jady H.,"Sacramento, CA",1,9,11,3.0,8/19/2014,"I don't come here often because there's always somewhere new to try. Today I decided to come after class with my cousin and it was just eh. We were there for a late lunch so it wasn't busy at all. We had wonderful service, our waiter came to check up on us here and there and made sure our drinks were always topped up. What got me was the actual food. I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and my cousin just the plain meat sauce. Neither of us were entirely impressed. It lacked a simple ingredient, salt! The meat was good, but the sauce was just so bland. Overall, it wasn't bad, but wasn't great either."
Vivian L.,"Oakland, CA",53,85,666,4.0,5/26/2014,"Obviously known for their cheesecake. It's pretty great! Try it out! I also usually get the salmon miso & lua* salad. I would recommend these dishes to try. There is a better price during lunch time, too, which is the same portion served during dinner, too. It's my favorite!"
Cole R.,"Brentwood, CA",17,3,,5.0,6/9/2016,My mom and I went in today there today our server was amazing and Paul (the manager) went above and beyond to make sure my mom was happy. 5 stars for sure
Shannon H.,"Brentwood, CA",749,1031,606,4.0,11/23/2011,"I have been to quite a few Cheesecake Factory's over the years and most recently got to check this one out. It was friday after work and it was only about a 15 min wait to be seated. They first offered me a small awkward table next to a large group of people which just felt uncomfortable so, I put in a request for a booth and with in a moment I was seated in a nice large comfy booth perfect for me and my hun. The decor is just as magical and beautifully decorated as all the remaining factory's however, I particularly like this on for it seemed more spacious then others. Anyone that has been to any cheesecake factory knows the menu has quite the selection of items to choose from which can tend to leave you indecisive of what to order. We were given some time and finally made the decision on the Herb Crusted Fillet of Salmon in a creamy lemon sauce with green beans and mashed potato's. I opted for no mashed potato's and just ordered  a little side of mac and cheese. We were given fresh bread and butter while waiting, which I passed on as always. As packed as it was ( as it always is) we still received our meals within a reasonable amount of time.  Large in portion, as part of the signature of the Cheesecake Factory's which also looked pretty appealing. Salmon was cooked perfectly , the sauce was nice however, slightly too lemony for my liking though, the creamy consistency along with the salmon was a great combo. The mac and cheese was nothing special but still quite Delicious. Overall, most Cheesecake factory's food entrees are about a 3 start 4 rating however, the desserts far surpass that. The service we received from our waiter this evening   was  extremely on par, professional and friendly, adding a great deal to our visit and with all the cheesecake factory's that I have visited, I still find the ambiance of the restaurant quite intriguing . I will definitely be back again!"
carissa b.,"Walnut Creek, CA",212,10,,5.0,8/15/2015,"I just had to stop by and leave a compliment to Michael. His customer service today (Saturday, August 15th) was impeccable. He was extremely well-mannered and friendly. Five stars for sure!!!"
Sasa S.,"Fairfield, CA",23,70,102,5.0,6/4/2015,"I love this location, in a very centralized area. After going GF, eating out is hard. Cheesecake Factory has GF options which is nice, but my pasta dish came out under cooked. After I complained the manager apologized for the inconvenience and replaced it with another dish,and then comped my cheesecake and fruit.I appreciated the good gesture.I love the Cheescake Factory!"
Luis L.,"Oakland, CA",1,25,42,5.0,7/11/2014,"I love this place. I bring my family here frequently. We are always tasting different foods and desserts here and so far have liked everything. The atmosphere is wonderful with great service. The wait is usually not bad, which I like a whole lot. Definitely not the long wait from the San Francisco location. If you have not tried this location I highly recommend it."
