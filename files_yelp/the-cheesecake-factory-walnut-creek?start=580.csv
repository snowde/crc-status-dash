Ron W.,"Raleigh, NC",791,913,5920,4.0,11/1/2009,"I'm not a fan of cheesecake but I am a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, go figure! And even though I'm a food snob who favors one-off restaurants with a personal touch, the Cheesecake Factory does a fine job of delivering a tasty (and huge) meal in a pretty cool environment.  They're all pretty much the same: high-ceiling, sumptuous space, long waits and huge plates.  But the Walnut Creek location takes it one step further.  Built in the old Andronico's supermarket deep in Walnut Creek Center, you would never guess what it was in its previous life.  Outside there's a patio/lounge area complete with gas fireplace.  Inside it's cavernous with ornate blown glass lighting, gilt gold decor and large columns.  Both a bit retro and roaring 20's, the space feels upscale and unique.   What makes Cheesecake Factory a cool spot for a large group is its broad menu spanning pizzas, pastas, burgers and chicken cooked 2,000 ways.  Food is typically american and italian classics in HUGE portions. But given the prices ($15 - $20/entree), it's no surprise.  We started off with a nice plate of fried calamari in a very light coating.  Nicely done, the calamari was tender and nicely fried, way better than the typical rubber bands you get.  Main course was Chicken Romana: two pan-fried breast fillets coated in a parmesan-romano mix on a large plate of al dente spaghetti.  Simple stuff but again, well-done and delicious.  You might be able to finish the whole plate if you're a sumo wrestler or NFL lineman, otherwise just bring the leftovers home for tomorrow.  As you can guess, we never made it to dessert!   Service was quite good, they train their people well and go above and beyond to keep you happy.  It's a team service so others will jump in to bring you your drinks, meals, etc.  And given the wait was quite short, I was pretty happy and pleased with the whole experience.  Part of me wants to dislike the Cheesecake Factory but every time I come (I've visited the SF, Raleigh and West Palm Beach locations), I go home happy and content, damn you!  So what can I say, I'm not a chain restaurant guy but the Cheesecake Factory does a nice job delivering a mainstream yet upscale dining experience for the family.  If you can avoid the 45 minute wait, it's well worth the effort, bravo!"
Karen W.,"Pittsburg, CA",36,8,2,1.0,8/2/2014,I have been to this cheese cake restaurant before very beautiful and the service had always been very good except for this one day. My mother and I went for lunch on July 31 2014 and the service was awful. We came in the host were very nice and said the wait would only be about 10 for an outside table. They were right however the 2 waiters that were serving that area neither one acknowledged my mother and I sitting there. I did manage to get one of the waiters attention he said he would get that person for our table but no one came. Now 15min later I got up and told the host that no one came to our table and I would like to be moved. He graciously apologized and said that he would get someone over to our new table to take our order. I ask for a manager when she came out she was very apologetic however offered us nothing for our in convenience. Our new waitress was excellent. Needless to say I will never go back to that Cheesecake Factory again
Tara S.,"Hercules, CA",59,17,6,1.0,2/28/2015,"The restaurant is clean and the employees are very nice. We had a few issues on our visit though. I went with my husband and 2 kids.  First issue was us having to ask for our bread when they are supposed to just bring it.  In my waitresses defense she gave us the rundown how tired she was though because she had been there since 7 am going over the new menu. This was around 4pm so I sort of understand her exhaustion.  Second issue I ordered my turkey burger without mushrooms and about 20 minutes after I ordered my waitress very politely told me the mushrooms are cooked into it and they can't leave it out so I need to change my order. I wasn't offered a menu to make a new selection so I had to quickly try to remember something else. Which was the grilled chicken with avacado club.  Third issue my son got his food and realized he ordered fruit not fries and she very kindly brought him his fruit.  Fourth issue my son started to eat and realized that the chicken sliders he had ordered were not what he was eating. Instead he got burgers.  Which he wasn't a big fan of. We were pretty annoyed at that point so decided not to send it back and my son just ate a little bit and left not full.   Fifth issue was when I finally got my plate, after the rest of my family had already been eating for a bit, it was extremely greasy. The bread was soaking wet in grease. The chicken was super chewy and I couldn't even eat it. I did not let me waitress know that I was displeased with the food but was a bit surprised she didn't ask when my whole sandwich sat there as we paid our super overpriced bill. If the food was good than it wouldn't be too overpriced but it wasn't. Our check for the 4 of us was around $70 NOT including tip (which with all that happened we still tipped her 20%) and we didn't leave satisfied at all.  It was a pretty crappy experience and we will not be going back."
Ariel H.,"Port Saint Lucie, FL",0,10,1,2.0,9/5/2015,"I was with a group of coworkers on a night out. I ordered a Caesar salad with chicken and didn't get the chicken. The waitress kept asking us if we wanted water and then left, returning 10 minutes later to ask if we wanted a refill. This repeated 4-5 times. Why ask if we want a drink and then refuse to give us one? Towards the 4th time she asked, she was getting sarcastic and snarky towards us.             At this point, the waitress then ignored us again walking past our table (even though we had our hands raised like kids in school asking a question) and another waiter came and commented about how he 'saw how the waitress ignored us'.           He refilled our drinks, then I asked if it was too late to get a side of chicken. He asked why and I explained I didn't get any even though I ordered it. He offered his apologies, then asked if we'd like to see a manager. I said yes, but the manager never came. BUT I was given a side dish of chicken towards the end of the meal, free of charge. (A negative review all because of chicken? Stupid, I know, but it gets worse)     !!!    This review was only two stars because when I was contemplating getting soup early on in the evening, the spoon I was provided with had dried up bits of pasta severely stuck to it. The spoon itself had spots that were gray and murky. (I cant upload the image, the app isnt allowing me)             All of my coworkers and I work in the service industry, so we know how stressful work can be/that sometimes things slip through the cracks and customers complaining is the worst. But ignoring a group of paying customers and asking us if we wanted a refill then forgetting to get us refills multiple times is.. Wow. Food is good, environment is nice, but when we left a tip at the end of the night, it was for the employee who noticed us when we had our hands raised like kids."
J H.,"Oakland, CA",1,61,,5.0,7/30/2014,"We celebrated the National Cheesecake day here.  This is the place to be to officially celebrate this annual event.  :-) My better half had a medium rare cheeseburger, it was cooked to perfection with grilled onions, along with a side of french fries.  I had the catfish, with delicious sauteed corn, string beans and real mashed potatoes. Our server suggested the lemon meringue cheesecake.  Boy oh boy, this was on point.   Another terrific meal!!!"
Jason P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,12,,1.0,3/3/2015,"Beautiful building and location but everything about this place sucked.  Well I guess I can't say, since we never got served!  My wife and I randomly were walking around downtown Walnut Creek and decided to go, we figured it would be good, we've been to other locations and while they aren't the greatest when it comes to food, they have a wide variety and are decent.  Even though the restaurant had customers, it was not busy enough for us to be completely ignored.  After waiting for 20 mins without receiving any service (no water, no menus, not even acknowledged by any of the staff including the manager) we decided to leave.  We will never go back to this place!!!"
Ale G.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,78,8,3.0,5/9/2016,"Came here one evening for the 1st time after spring cleaning with the family. They do not take reservations so that sucked because once we got there you would think they were giving food away! Soooo many people! The hubby got a buzzer thingy and the daughter and I went shopping across the street. The wait was 30 minutes or so but it wasn't so bad because we were shopping. Hubby called us and off we went to meet him out in the patio. It was cold and the heater was not working or something so that didn't make me happy. Food was OK. Dessert however was AWESOME! Service was ok too. Our waitress kept forgetting little things like a spoon for my tea, 1/2 our drinks, silverware for my son. She was sweet though and it was her first day without her supervisor. She was also the waitress to a huge group behind us so she was a bit frazzled. Anyway I got the lemon raspberry cheesecake and it was so yummy. You get a huge portion so it's nice so you have some to take home. I do want to add how yummy my sons pizza was. A thin crust and not too much sauce. If I ever come back I will defiantly get that pizza and lemon raspberry cheesecake."
Vera M.,"Antioch, CA",7,15,2,4.0,6/4/2014,"Few nights ago I went to dinner with a friend and we had an absolutely perfect evening. 1) park next to the Cheesecake Factory, the parking lot on the same street not the one in front. It is free on the second floor. 2) sit in the patio if you come at night, we got the table next to the fountain - gorgeous ! 3) chicken Madeira was on point! Highly recommend it!"
Sahar H.,"Berkeley, CA",46,41,5,4.0,1/21/2016,As I approach the Cheesecake factory for the first time a few days ago I noticed the exterior of the restaurant was exceptionally beautiful. I was quite taken aback a little and I really enjoyed the fountain inside. Since my boyfriend and I decided to park in the garage we entered the restaurant from the side entrance. As we walk down the corridor I enjoyed the interior and it was beautiful. It was really nice. The ceiling was really high. I really did enjoy the interior as well. The wait to be seated was pretty long. The lady told us 20 minutes but we almost waited an hour. My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday and it was really nice. Once we got seated we were helped by Amanda. She was a great waitress. We started with crab wontons with peanut sauce which was really delicious. I didn't want to eat too much because I didn't want to spoil my appetite for the main dish. The strawberry lemonade was something so sweet and delicious and I never had anything like it before. I ordered the chicken madeira it was really delicious. The only small problem I had with it was that the mushrooms and asparagus weren't cooked to how I usually like them.Very soft and flavorful. I will definitely be coming back soon its a good place! We tipped Amanda and ordered our cheesecakes to go. I got toasted marshmallow cheesecake while he got raspberry white truffle. Yumm!!
The Wendy B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,67,25,1.0,1/3/2015,"This review is strictly concerning the To Go Cheesecake Bar. I don't even know where to begin.  We walk into a crazy crowded lobby and immediately go towards the cheesecake area to decide what we plan to get (take out).  After a couple of moments of browsing, the cashier asks us if we are ready.  She lacks any kind of personality and we can tell that she just wants to take our order and be done with us.  We order and pay.  There is absolutely NO instruction concerning what to do next.  Do we stand idly and wait?  Do we go to a pick up area?  How will we know when our order is ready?  She didn't take my name.  There's chaos behind the counter of workers packing up cheesecakes and plating others, and the cashier simply stands there and waits for the next customer to arrive.  We wait a remarkable 15 MINUTES before asking the cashier if we are in the right place to pick up or order.  She says yes, just stay here and she'll let us know.  We continue to wait.  Another 5 minutes goes by and by this time it's clear that the people behind us in ""line"" (if you can call it that) have already come and gone.  We ask her again, and she confuses us with god knows who and asks if we are waiting for a full cake.  No, we just ordered 2 slices.  We repeated our order and she rolls her eyes as she find that our cheesecake slices have been sitting out.  No apology.  She just bagged them and handed them over.  So very rude!  Our order has been sitting out of the cooler for nearly 15 minutes and there wasn't even an apology or offering to get us fresh slices!?!?!"
Darryl M.,"Richmond, CA",40,23,3,2.0,1/25/2015,"Been here before, but even with a big party, the wait usually isn't more than an hour. It's been three hours on Saturday night. We were told 2 to 2.5 hours when we got here and we were ok with it, due to how busy it was. the food is normally good, but without some type of reservation system, to realistically estimate wait times is both unprofessional and dumb. Seems like customer service and efficiency isnt a top priority here. After 3.5 hours, we find out after their ""system"" of texting or calling your cell, the host didn't communicate to his replacement, we were still waiting and when she verbally called the name for our group, she couldn't find us because it was loud and crowded. So this lady gave our table to another large group. So we had to wait another 15 minutes for the hosts to get another table ready. They gave us appetizers free, but they should figure out how to organize the seating area, and the waiting area especially for the weekends. If you don't want to starve yourself for a few weekend hours, come here."
Philip W.,"Oakland, CA",31,78,13,4.0,8/26/2015,"This place remind me of a Vegas restaurant very big with high ceiling and painting. The service is always good, I always order the chicken lettuce wrap taste so good had the burger too. Always have left over because the portion are huge!!"
Victoria L.,"Berkeley, CA",231,180,12,3.0,7/5/2012,"Okay, it's the Cheesecake Factory. You don't go to the Cheesecake Factory expecting miracles. I've been to dozens of Cheesecake Factories in the states, and the one in Walnut Creek is usually good. Sometimes, the bread is hard and crunchy, which is a little disappointing since I love the bread at the Cheesecake Factories. The service is always good and the waiters/waitresses are always very polite. I noticed that the food isn't very consistent. I used to order the pasta carbonara a lot, and sometimes the sauce would be watery, and other times extremely thick. The steaks are okay. I like the calamari and sweet corn tamales (so good!). The French fries are also yummy. Oh, and you can pass on the clam chowder - it's not the greatest. I love the Tuxedo and red velvet cheesecakes! The strawberry shortcake with vanilla ice cream is also really good.  Don't come here during peak hours if you want to talk peacefully with the people you are with. It gets really loud. I do like coming here with large crowds though, or people I don't know very well because they have a large selection and there is always something for everyone."
Niki H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,78,1,1.0,4/15/2016,"Our weekday lunch took over half an hour to arrive, the $17 salad I ordered had old lettuce and shrimp that hadn't been deveined. My husband's sandwich was burned. A manager stopped by to apologize for the delay and offered free soup or salad (with my salad, yum) which we declined. Ended up ordering cheesecake but they didn't take it off our bill. Probably our last time ever eating at a Cheesecake Factory."
Ninet M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",61,117,119,1.0,12/13/2015,"We recently moved to walnut creek and so far we have been in this location 3 times in the past month. The last visit on 12/12/15 around 10 p.m. was horrible and made me sick to my stomach . We went there and asked for a booth and waited for about 20 minutes which is not bad for a Saturday night. We got a booth which was right next to the exit so every time the door opened we froze to death. We asked them to change the table and they did, so far nothing major and everybody seemed very understanding. We ordered food and we got our food. After eating some of my food I found hair in it. it was almost 6 inches long and white.when the manager came, he did not apologize and instead he was explaining that when they looked at the hair in the kitchen it was blond and they have no one with blond hair working in the kitchen. I got the feeling that he was trying to say that it was my hair which by the way is curly and almost 10 times longer. What really pissed me off was the fact that the one waiters who were serving us where blond and so were quite a few others and the manager was making it look like it is my hair, no apologies , bad attitude like I was a freaking liar. when the waiter brought the bill tossed it on the table and left, not a thank you or good night. My husband and I were so pissed and furious when we left there but since I am pregnant I said screw it i am not going to bother ruining my day for some stupid people who have no clue what customer service is. I believe people get better service at the Jack in the box and the manager was the worst."
Gabriella P.,"Lafayette, CA",76,82,15,3.0,1/11/2015,"Not fine dining, but a lively, opulent (in a Vegas way) restaurant that has plenty (if not too many) choices to suit pretty much anybody's taste.  I like that they offer lower price ""lunch size"" pastas and salads--still so big that I've never known anyone who could finish them in one meal.  Not cheap, not expensive, but in between.  Service is decent, but this is a giant place so don't expect your waiter to be standing in the corner waiting to see if you raise your eyes seeking service.  However, the people that work here are generally really friendly and they want to do a good job.  PS  BEST CHICKEN WINGS EVER!!!"
Julia D.,"Livermore, CA",79,68,22,4.0,5/5/2014,"The outdoor seating is beautiful. I met a friend there on Sat 05/03/2014, for a late dinner/appetizers and dessert, of course. We spent a great deal of time catching up with one another while the wait staff was great, she would check-in with us to see how we were doing but wasn't overly pushy.  I ordered the Fried Mac and Cheese. I have been really good with watching what I eat, but this is my downfall. I knew what I wanted when the restaurant was suggested.  After my friend tried a bite of the Mac and Cheese she ordered her own serving. I told her she would be hooked.  We ended up staying until they closed, but the staff was professional and didn't kick us out, they just began to clean up the outdoor seating area and we got the hint. Thanks again for a pleasurable experience"
Crystal H.,"Hayward, CA",0,3,,5.0,10/27/2014,"Executive chef, Jason ! Enough said.  He is new to this franchise,but you can tell he is a pro and loves what he does. I live in hayward and I travel to walnut creek just to eat his food."
S Y.,"San Francisco, CA",285,387,5880,3.0,8/30/2011,"If there's anything that any Cheesecake Factory location has proved to me, it's that they're good for groups, wait times can take forever - esp. during weekends but their menu offers a great selection from apps to drinks and dessert!  My cousin, the birthday boy came in about an hour before our meet up time just to get his name on the list. That's the best strategy for most locations, come early before you're even hungry!!  Food was average but came in good time... Pineapple Mojitos are pretty good! We passed on dessert... who does that at Cheesecake? 13 of us that wanna try the Kitchen Sink at The Olde San Francisco Creamery down the street!"
Daniel B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",133,5,,5.0,8/18/2014,"Thank you Cheesecake for making me love you again! I've been coming here for at least 2 times a month and haven't disappoint me anymore. Food has been as incredible as always, and the service have improved SO MUCH! I highly recommend to ask for Irene, she's one of the best servers I have ever had! Luckily she has been our server on our last two visits!  I always get to order a different entree since they offer so many different options, and this last Thursday I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken (add mushrooms) and it turned out to be my new favorite entree ever! Also the strawberry margarita on the rocks yumm yumm... Couldn't ask for more!"
