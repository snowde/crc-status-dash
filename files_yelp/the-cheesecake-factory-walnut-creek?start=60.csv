Victoria L.,"Orinda, CA",232,434,1832,5.0,8/13/2016,"Food: 4/5        Price: 5/5        Service: 4/5       Ambience: 5/5 I love Cheesecake Factory!! This location is always busy and the waits are generally long, but today (Saturday 11:45am) a table for 5 took less than 5 minutes - yay:)  While you're waiting for your meals, they offer bread basket and butter - the honey wheat bread is to die for!!  Great attentive service, beautiful comfortable ambience, loved it!  Amazing delicious food, huge portions, and tons of options to choose from. The lunch portions are smaller, or I should say ""normal"". My all time favorite is definitely CHICKEN PICCATA, and all of their cheesecakes!   Favorites: * lunch CHICKEN PICCATA ($12.95) - Sautéed Chicken Breast with Lemon Sauce, Mushrooms and Capers. Served with Angel Hair Pasta * THAI LETTUCE WRAPS ($? ) - Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew. * FACTORY NACHOS ($11.95) - Crisp Tortilla Chips Covered with Melted Cheeses, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Jalapeños, Green Onions and tomatoes. Others: * lunch FETTUCCINI ALFREDO with CHICKEN ($13.95 + 2) - A Rich Parmesan Cream Sauce, with Chicken * GRILLED STEAK TACOS ($15.95) - Soft Corn Tortillas, Chargrilled Steak, Avocado, Tomato, Chipotle Sauce, Crispy Onions and Cilantro. Served with Rice and Beans."
Gabrielle C.,"Oakland, CA",9,12,,4.0,11/4/2017,I love this location way more than the San Francisco one. The staff are very nice and seem to be in a better mood than in San Francisco. Less busy too. Great food! Big selection. But quite pricey.
Denise F.,"Napa, CA",0,2,3,2.0,6/2/2017,"Hate to leave such a terrible review but... I have now learned that before I leave with a to go order I need to double check my order before leaving for home 40min away! This is the third time taking home a piece of lemon meringue cheesecake I found the meringue burnt!!! Yes you can remove it but that's one of my favorite parts. We did call this time because our to go order was also missing dressings for the salads. They were kind enough to be sending a gift card to equal our loss. I just hate having to know I can't forget to check my to go orders before leaving for home. Update... we've waited to receive the promised gift card since the 21rst!! I'm pretty sure it doesn't take 12 days to arrive 40 miles away! Husband is on the ph now waiting for a manager again to find out where the promised gift card is. Come on Cheesecake Factory we love eating there, but this is leaving a bad taste in my mouth!!!"
Mario L.,"Richmond, CA",0,11,6,5.0,2/22/2017,Amazing!!! Just give it a try and you'll come back!!  Don't tell to many of your fiends or the place would get crowded LOL
Ruby B.,"Fairfield, CA",74,11,21,4.0,9/23/2017,The Cuban egg rolls was awesome I can eat that all day. You cant leave this place without having a dessert
Greg S.,"Chattahoochee Hills, GA",136,32,2,5.0,11/11/2017,"Exceptional service here. We came in without reservations after a Diablo Ballet performance, party of 8. From the front desk, to the bar, to the table, we were treated with care and efficiency. The food was great, then we stayed quite long and were again treated with kindness and patience. The ""Evelyn's"" pasta dish was exceptional, and the low-carb cheesecake is always a winner. It's so nice when management and staff know how to be gracious. They sure do here! We'll be back regularly."
Jeff K.,"San Francisco, CA",0,40,2,1.0,7/4/2017,"We have been to this Walnut Creek Cheesecake Factory a number of times., and usually enjoy the food and service.  However,  there must have been a change in management or something. Yesterday (July 3, 2017),  we arrived at 4:15pm.   It was not yet busy, many tables were empty.....yet we could not be seated until almost 5pm. More importantly, the cleanliness of the restaurant needed a lot of attention: 1) tables were not wiped clean adequately 2) we watched food scraps being wiped direct onto the seats and floor by the busser 3) several eating utensils were dirty 4) a lot of food scraps on the floor under the tables 5) men's bathroom had not been cleaned.....for hours?  ( see photos) Is there not a manager to oversee these things?   The customer service and housekeeping has dropped off considerably......And dinner service was just beginning!"
Moua L.,"Concord, CA",179,356,434,3.0,3/6/2017,"The three-star rating is for the wait time (1hr, 20 min) for a table if you arrived at ~7 PM on a Sunday night. By the time we sat down at the table, my 5-year-old son looked at his watch and said, ""mom it's almost 9 PM, which is bed time."" Yes, it is.  On the other hand, our server was great and gave us extra bread since we were starving. We had a nice dinner with our relatives from Oregon and left around 9:30 PM with three slices of cheesecakes."
Catherine R.,"Oakland, CA",5,44,34,2.0,8/17/2017,"I wish I read reviews on this place and overall I wish we didn't have stomachs running on empty coming here. We never had an issue with CF until we came to this location.  Parking is either street where you pay or you can go all the way to the top of the parking structure across the street where they give you 2-3 hour parking (don't remember which it was)  We come in and I'm obviously very pregnant and ask for a table because I know for a fact my watermelon belly will not fit in those booths I gave up in those by month 8.  They told us 45 minutes and we said yes, half of our party arrived after waiting 30 minutes so we were glad we kept our names in. We get called and low and behold we get a BOOTH. Not only that but we waited an extra 27 minutes for a table that was empty the whole time!!!! After that we were over it and so hungry it sucked that we had to wait an extra 40 minutes for our food to arrive. We didn't even get drinks for 15 minutes. Service was extremely slow we were so disappointed even when we got the food it wasn't seasoned we all left our plates and were full on bread at least that always stays consistent...."
Rachel L.,"Concord, CA",455,325,816,4.0,12/29/2016,I always have great service when I come here.  My go to order is definitely the pasta carbonara.  Probably one of the best I've had.  Even better that it comes in a huge serving so I can take it home. Park on the 2nd floor for free parking up to 3 hours.
John W.,"Pacific Grove, CA",4,28,2,4.0,11/2/2017,"Went here on a Sunday at 1:00, group of 4. 10 minute wait. Still had time to order brunch menu items. Everyone enjoyed their meals. We had spicy chicken nachos, chicken and waffles Benedict, an omelet and eggs w/bacon toast and potatoes. The potatoes were crispy. Maybe too crispy. Some pieces were hollowed husks due to being fried too long. Everyone enjoyed their meals and also took a couple slices of cheesecake to go."
Ahmed K.,"Sacramento, CA",8,59,28,1.0,6/26/2017,Where do I begin. Came here with a group of 8. Took us an hour and fifteen minutes to get our food on a Monday night. Only one person at our tables food was decent. All other orders were tasteless. The best part about this dinner was the free bread!!! Never coming back.
Etelih G.,"Antioch, CA",0,12,,4.0,11/11/2017,"Food is good. Comes out slow. Understand it's a busy restaurant but kind of ridiculous. Waitress I had, was not pleasant. Would rather visit another location."
Solo S.,"Merced, CA",1,52,22,5.0,7/3/2017,"This location is definitely one of the nicer ones. We visited on Thurs, June 28th around 10 pm after our movie across the street.  Wasn't too crowded, we had a 5 min wait time for outdoor seating.  So we ordered two drinks to start our night.  A dirty martini and a Strawberry Martini w/ grey goose Perfect We sat outdoors next to the firepit.  Our server Angel was incredible. For dinner we had crabcakes and I ordered calamari appetizer as my meal. Can you say ""heaven?"" These were so good.  The banana cheesecake was light and delicious. We shared a slice because it was so big.  But all in all, the overall experience was wonderful and the ambiance was lovely.  5 stars straight across. We will be going back again."
Michelle K.,"Danville, CA",5,37,,5.0,11/19/2017,I am hooked on the grilled artichoke and ahi tuna tartare. We sometimes indulge in the calamari!  I don't miss an opportunity to stop by when in the area. A trusted pleasure.  Especially before using our Movie Pass at the WC theater or shopping in the area. We always sit at the bar or high top tables. Great service.
Linh P.,"San Francisco, CA",160,43,6,1.0,10/22/2017,My family and I waited for two hours for our table last night. The manager was not friendly and didn't care even if We got up a few times to see when we will be seated. The food was alright but the waitress  is very proficient and shows enthusiasm about her customers. She was very understanding and went above and beyond.
Falisha W.,"CA, CA",1,5,8,3.0,8/26/2017,I love the dim lights and someone what of a romantic atmosphere.  My waitress was very nice and in training. I ordered the jambalaya.  She warned me that it was not what I thought it was and it was not! No flavor just shrimp and noodles with a few bell peppers.  The quality of the food has gone down! My cocktail was awesome!
Margo O.,"Concord, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/15/2017,"A host told us that there would be a 5 minute wait until we would be seated but we sat there for over half an hour and were seated in part of the restaurant where there is ""open seating"" and could've seated ourselves at anytime (completely unknown to us). This table was open the whole time we waited as well.  As we sat there the host would give us awkward glances and then finally seated us while the kitchen was only open for three more minutes. This was my friend's first experience at Cheesecake Factory and I must say that I am extremely disappointed with the service and I don't think I will be returning anytime soon."
Jason G.,"Pasadena, CA",4426,2425,5439,4.0,10/19/2016,"This is a chain and yet it is very popular.  It is one of the few restaurants in the downtown Walnut Creek area that is open late.  The place is quite large and can seat lots of people, yet due to its popularity you might still wait in line. I've had most of the food off the menu and I particularly like the appetizers and small plates.  The cheesecake selection is huge and pretty much all of them are yummy."
Jose C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/11/2017,"After the usual wait to get to the restaurant, around 20 minutes, we proceeded to order a grilled artichokes appetizer. After a while our waiter came back to let us know they were out of artichokes. For main dish we order fillet after a few minutes we were informed they were out of fillet, we changed to ribeye, a few minutes later we were informed they were out of ribeye too. We had a party of 8 so 2 people ended up having Chicken and Fish. No beef!!!! We changed plates and had to wait a long time for our food... over 25 minutes. The waiter brought more bread after we started to complaint however the food took another 10 minutes. TERRIBLE Service... really disappointed. Not coming back!!!!"
