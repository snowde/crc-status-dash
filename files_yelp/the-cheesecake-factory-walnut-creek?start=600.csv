Lovegood F.,"Morgan Hill, CA",57,63,,1.0,7/29/2016,"I really wish there was less than 1.  Went last Saturday night, yes they were busy, no excuse they sat us.  Arrived at 4:40PM, sat us down a few minutes after 5.  Waiter greeted us and took drink orders.  We ordered food as well, chicken pasta, garlic pasta with shrimp, chicken and biscuits, and a veggie burger with a salad.  Nothing exotic, right?  Food arrived about 30 minutes later, only not all 4 meals I should say. The veggie burger was MIA.   We waited and waited to start eating.  I left to the restroom, which took a while, line, came back still no veggie burger.  I asked a waiter to check, he never returned.  When I finally saw our waiter, who by the way did not come back to check on us. I asked him to check on the missing food, again nothing.  Went and asked for a manager and got some trainee with attitude.  When I expressed my disappointment, he laughed at me and told me I had better go sit down.  He too never returned.  The GM finally delivered the incorrect veggie burger.  Fries no salad.  Now all our food is cold, nothing is as advertised.  When I told the GM about the Jr. Manager with attitude, he actually did not seemed concerned.  The entire experience was not up to par with the Cheesecake Factory I am used to.  I have been to many locations inside and outside California.  The manager wrote off the veggie burger and mine, I did not eat it, cold and tasteless.  The chicken and biscuits were terrible, rock hard biscuits, gravy you say???Watery sauce!  Final conclusion, it was not so much that it happened, which was not ideal, it was the attitude and the way it was handled that would prevent me from going back.  Corporate if you are listening, this location needs some attention, seriously."
Angelica M.,"Denver, CO",3,12,4,5.0,8/9/2015,"Last night, my bf and I went to visit the restaraunt. It was around the time of the dinner rush on a saturday so it was pretty busy and there was a wait. We were seated pretty quickly and the server came right over which was great. Our experience there turned out so much better than any other time we have gone in the past. The server was attentive but not pushy at all and even when another staff member served my bf the wrong food she quickly returned the food and in no time at all brought the correct food.  She was very nice and said to us ""take your time"" which not many servers do. A lot of the other places I have gone the servers feel scripted and she didn't. Thank you Jessica N for a very great night and I hope you get more compliments!"
Jenny G.,"Concord, CA",31,110,25,2.0,5/12/2015,"So I ve been here about 4 times now and the only time I felt the food was even noteworthy was the Sunday brunch about 4 years ago. Now you could call me a food snob I you want however I eat out a lot so I know good food. Each time I've ate here the food was just okay, kinda like step up from dennys. But thought since the atmosphere is nice I'd try it for lunch once agin. So I ordered the veggies onlet, and the eggs tasted old and my fruit was brown as if it had sat for awhile before coming to my table. Just not impressed. The two stars are beacuse they do have excellent cheese cake and well it is the ""cheese cake factory"". I will say the service was good today."
R J.,"San Ramon, CA",0,13,,3.0,4/5/2016,"The food quality seems to vary quite a bit.  Visiting on weekends seems to be a fail, weeknights tend to be better food quality and service."
Tia M.,"Fremont, CA",119,11,,4.0,5/15/2016,This LOCATION is set to appease the ones who normally enjoy nice ambiance AND good food.  There is a movie theater directly across the street so if you would normally enjoy dinner and a movie or movie and dessert this is the perfect place.  Not to mention outdoor shopping!
Kim P.,"Hayward, CA",10,27,48,5.0,5/29/2015,It was really nice here I liked if and are waitress was really nice. I have a 3 month old baby and she ask if she can get milk or even hot water for me to heat up the milk. Most of the time I have to ask but she was really on top of thing
Yoshihiro K.,"El Sobrante, CA",0,15,,4.0,7/31/2014,I have always heard so much about the Cheesecake Factory but only decided to eat  there two days ago with my family.      The service is great! Our waiter was very kind and attentive. The inside of the restaurant was a lot more fancy than I expected. Overall very nice first impression.     I ordered the factory burger but shared some other entrees among the table. The food wasn't outstanding but the portions were large. A huge selection to choose from the menu makes this place attractive to come again.
Yoo Y.,"San Francisco, CA",0,10,,1.0,5/10/2016,"I was at this cheesecake factory, about a week ago, thinking it is the same as the one in Marin or Top of Macy's Union Square, but what a terrible experience. We waited for 25 minutes to get a table on a Sunday evening and were seated at 8:30 PM at the back of the restaurant, where the service staff was dropping trays on the floor with noise while waiting for a waiter/ress to show and no one came to our table for 15 minutes. Then one server approached after I flagged a few of them, right after I suggested to leave the place, and took drink orders and we ordered a bottle of wine for our table. The server returned  again,  after 10 minutes with the bottle already opened. Requested that the bottle we ordered be open at our table, when the server said he just opened it. The server left to get an unopened bottle to be opened at our table when another server who was helpful and greeted us while waiting for our table, came by with a new bottle, opener, opened the bottle and poured for us and went back to the lounge area that was her station.  Our Server returned and took our order after yet another 15 minutes. He took our order and returned 10 minutes later to tell us that the app we ordered was sold out. I just laughed at how everything was ridiculous and having had a fun birthday all day, I was not going to let the evening be ruined. So we ordered an alternative. He took the rest of our dinner order. One of our dinner order was not done right, but by this point we just decided will pack the food, of course everyone knows the portions, finish our wine and leave, and from my point never return. It was such a place to take a group, but there are plenty other ones a step away to take people  The food was nothing to write about, ordinary, bland. I will not recommend it to anyone."
Ivy R.,"Martinez, CA",137,1779,4674,3.0,7/4/2009,"Since so many of my Yelp friends have reviewed this place, I felt that I should follow along.  Surprisingly enough I agree with them. This is definitely a 3 star place. You walk into one Cheesecake Factory you have walked into them all.  The only thing different I noticed was the large outdoor seating area in the front. It was hot as hell outside when I was there so no one was there. Also, the back entrance is cool, the hallway was like you were about to walk into a fantastic castle that you gay uncle just moved into.  I had the Luau Salad. It was pretty, pretty good. My husband had the Chicken Primavera sandwich. He really enjoyed it but it was just to big to eat. Great leftovers!  We drank a Peach Bellini. It was perfect for such a hot day. I ordered that because I'm reading American Psycho and they were drinking them in the part I was reading. I liked it and am glad I ordered it. I wished I was in Hawaii drinking one.  Their drink menu was kind of disappointing as a whole. Really lame drinks and nothing stood out. That was obvious because our check was like $50. That is a rarity for us at restaurants.  No Cheesecake for us, we just weren't in the mood.  Go on a Sunday because it didn't seem that busy and park in the garage behind the place near the top. Plenty of parking, and it's in the shade."
M L.,"Hercules, CA",0,52,144,4.0,6/14/2015,Avocado egg rolls are a must here. Every dish I get here is delicious. Recommend the red velvet cake cheesecake.
Lauren P.,"Benicia, CA",26,15,15,5.0,11/20/2013,Houston is the baddest bitch this side of Oakland. He kept it so real I can't even- Thanks Houston 10/10 would be served to again
Mike M.,"Belmont, CA",111,451,909,5.0,4/15/2012,"Yummy Yummy Yummy!!!!  Met up with an old buddy for lunch in the WC and decided to go with Cheesecake Factory since it had some interesting foot traffic.  First off, this location is in the heart of downtown with tons of hotties EVERYWHERE.  Second, they were serving brunch at 2pm (score).  Third, the steak and eggs were DELICIOUS!!!!  Fourth, service was fast and very accommodating.  Fifth, the design/layout of this location was very modern and stylish (somewhat like a museum but with more swag), more than any other location I've been to yet.  Looking forward to coming back!!!!!!"
Greta R.,"San Rafael, CA",60,522,57,2.0,10/30/2013,"I like the Cheesecake Factory's food and I've given 4 stars to other locations.  The problem with this place is the service.  The lady up front said ""10-15 minutes"" and after 30 minutes we were still 5th in line.  Luckily there was space at a high-top in the bar area.  Practically had to hurl myself in front of the waiter to get attention.  He seemed miffed that we weren't getting liquor.  He took our appetizer order and then disappeared.  Someone else dropped off the appetizers.  NO ONE ever checked back to take our order for entrees.   No refills.  No ""can I get you something else"" even though we told the waiter we wanted to order more.  So they sold us some appetizers and we gave up on waiting for entrees and just left.  The table next to us ate apps and entrees and paid and we hadn't even had the waiter take our entree ORDER."
Xavier R.,"Oakland, CA",242,21,12,5.0,4/17/2014,ALBERT was a great host! No complaints at all. Got some fish special and it was perfect
Mik H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",62,103,9,4.0,4/15/2015,This place has great value for the money. Decent prices and huge servings. The staff is well trained and friendly. The cheesecake is great of course.
Areena B.,"North Oakland, Oakland, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/7/2015,The worst Cheesecake I have ever been to poor service and extremely slow I will never give this cheesecake my time ever again I felt so disrespected and my waiter was horrible he didn't care in any form or fashion it was more like let me hurry up and get you our product so you can get out and we can receive our money
Asad J.,"Danville, CA",5,52,,2.0,12/24/2015,"Very bad experience overall. Service was horrible, they got our order wrong, didn't refill drinks unless you found someone passing by and the drinks were flat. Food was below average, overly salted and tasted ok. The only thing good was cheesecake, they should just sell that and nothing else. Not going back here again!!"
Mara T.,"Concord, CA",22,16,3,4.0,5/29/2015,Good food. Good prices. Good cheesecake. Will be back. Love their red velvet cheesecake totally recommend!! Have many different favorite plates! The chicken and biscuits and the chicken Alfredo my husband and my favorite of all has to be the chicken and shrimp jambalaya!!! It's the best with the nice warm bread and butter!! Try their strawberry lemonade!!! Overall nothing but good experiences here!!
Angelica M.,"Oakland, CA",331,139,24,2.0,1/29/2014,I usually don't write many reviews on chains but after 3 pretty bad experiences at this particular CCF I decided to turn here...15 mins after being seated we finally received or water minus the lemon we requested... 10 minutes after still no drinks we ordered...10 additional minutes later my drink and food arrive but no bread. My food was way to hot to eat and my co-worker almost started reheating her food underneath the heating lamp. Poor time management and listening skills is all I can say. Get it together WC Cheesecake! Pros $20 lunch for Resturant week.
Liz H.,"Vacaville, CA",58,22,2,2.0,9/19/2016,"Let me start by saying I love Cheesecake Factory, however I did not have the best experience at this location. We  came in on 9-17-16 about 9:00pm it was pretty busy but we got seated pretty fast. We ordered two appetizers a drink from the bar and two meals. The bar was backed up so we didn't expect it to come out fast. We waited a while for our food our meals came out and still didn't get our appetizers. A little while after our appetizers came out while we were eating our food. At this point our 3 year old was getting by restless due to 1 of the appetizers was for her. Our server asked us if we still wanted our appetizers since our food was out already... of course we do. She didn't offer anything else. Our stuffed mushrooms were over cooked. The fried cheese was cooked perfect. Normally I would have sent the mushrooms back but we were already irritated from waiting so long. Our meals were good but again the whole experience could have been better. This was my first time at this location and it will be my last time. I'll stick to the Arden location."
