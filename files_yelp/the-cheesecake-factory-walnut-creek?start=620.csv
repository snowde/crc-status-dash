Brandi W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",589,541,625,2.0,6/9/2013,"Well, at least the interior is pretty (in that faux-European/ Vegas casino sort of way). If artificial chic is your thing, you're going to be a happy camper.  The Cheesecake Factory is not exactly a vegan-friendly establishment. The name alone kind of sets the tone for the food you're going to be getting. My mother chose this place, and I reluctantly agreed.  First impression? The hostess was frowning and did not perk up as we walked in the door. Her sour expression made us feel really unwelcome. Strike one.  The place seemed to be full of snobby white folks and their out-of-control toddlers. If you're looking for a peaceful Sunday lunch, this is probably not the place for you. Screaming kids and uptight suburbanites aren't my favorite.  There was only one soup option (nothing vegan). It was a Loaded Baked Potato soup. My mom is on a diet and can't have potatoes. Basically, it was ""NO SOUP FOR YOU!"" Strike two. We took a second look at the gigantic menu. Mi madre opted for the Herb Crusted Salmon entree with asparagus and a salad instead of the mashed taters. She said it was excellent, although the filet was cold. Obviously the waitress had waited too long to deliver it to the table.  I selected the Veggie Burger. It sounded awesome: ""a delicious 'burger' made with brown rice, farro, black beans, fresh beets, and onion"". I ordered mine sans cheese or mayo, with sweet potato fries. The portion of fries was very small, but they were FANTASTIC.  The burger patty was a disappointment. I don't think they grilled it enough, or maybe it was sitting around at the expo counter. It was cold and falling apart. The taste was also bland and mushy. It reminded me of a  Plant Burger, but lacking all the flavor and texture. At least the veggies were fresh: pickles, lettuce, tomato, and red onions.  I should have ordered it off the ""SkinnyLicious menu"" (yes, that's what they call it). It comes with a side salad instead of fries, but it would have been 2 dollars cheaper. If I return, I'll probably go for the Kale Salad and a side of vegetables. That sounds miles above what I had today."
Wanugee N.,"San Francisco, CA",4204,1933,9293,3.0,5/14/2011,"This Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek has different things for different people, especially on a Friday night. And I am not talking just about the menu, which is huge and has something for everybody for dinner.  No, like a scout evaluating a prospective athlete to recruit, I am talking about the intangibles.  This is your place if.....you like to cozy up by the fireplace! Problem is, it is an open pit, outdoor gas fireplace in the chill of night, with hard benches to sit on.  You will have to wait here to try and keep warm,  because on a Friday night you will wait for 45 minutes just to eat here. (They don't take rezzies!)  This is your place if.....you want to get noticed! Problem is, everyone will notice you while they are wondering how long have you been waiting. And if you walk around inside, everyone will notice you because there is nothing else to do but watch people while you wait. And they will really notice you if you get a table before they do.   This is your place if.....You want a night out with the girls! Problem is, don't expect to meet any guys. You see,  there are a hundred other women in packs of 6 who come here for Cheesecake, while thinking about Beefcake,  but the only beef around here is on their dinner plate. Well, there are some Beefy men, but that is around their belly and they are all here with their families.  This is your place if.....you want to dress up and go out! Problem is, this is the suburbs, so everyone over 30 who lives nearby are in their jeans and jogging suits.  People from farther than 15 miles east or west, well they are wearing their Sunday -go-to-meeting clothes because this is big portions and a fancy night out.  Women under 30 have to compete with the fake ID Teens who think this is the closest thing to Las Vegas, and dress that way.  This is your place if.....you are a player! No problem here! Yep, packs of a half-dozen ladies at a time, trying desperately to be hot and looking for action in the boring, sleepy suburbs, having just finished cheesecake and too many sweet adult beverages, thinking about Beefcake while wobbling in their 5 inch platforms. Easy pickens! I think next Friday I will come here recruiting for a prospect with great intangibles."
Tuan N.,"Walnut Creek, CA",185,162,261,4.0,10/31/2013,"Here are the highlights: -Buffalo Burger: Came with Buffalo wing hot sauce, topped with onion rings, blue cheese dressing, pickles, lettuce, and tomatoe. The burger patty was juicy and flavorful. Juice was oozing out of the burger when I bit into it.  The pickles were not as good.  -Fries: Skinny and crunchy, my favorite. There was a large portion of it too.  -Pumpkin &Pecan Cheesecake: Absolute heaven. Pumpkin is sandwiched between two layers of pecan. We finishes the entire thing! -Service: The waiter was very friendly and gave us great suggestions for dessert. Everything was delivered at a good pace."
TY S.,"Hercules, CA",1,32,1,2.0,8/12/2013,"This place isn't good anymore. I was so disappointed :( The first time I came here the food was good. I haven't been back in a few years but when I recently went back, I was so disappointed! Not only was the food I ordered warm.. not hot but warm! but the CHEESECAKE was nasty and didn't even taste like cheesecake! I had the S'MORES one, which is the new cheesecake flavor they have now. I've wanted to taste this for a while and when I did, I couldn't believe how NASTY it was. All I tasted was chocolate mousse and some gram cracker! I will not return to this place! a waist of money! BTW I had to go to Nations to get an actual Cheesecake that I would enjoy."
Alex K.,"Saratoga, CA",142,484,20,5.0,3/1/2012,"Man, a good Cheesecake Factory that never disappoints, and the critics are harsh! I've had nothing but good experiences here, so I'll give it a five star showing. The food is consistently good (and plentiful), so what is there to complain about. However, I do have something to YELP about. DULCE DE LECHE CHEESECAKE. o m g - I thought I didn't have any room, but this was seriously delicious. I can't even describe the decadence, the soft mixed with the crunchy, the melt in your mouth goodness. TRY IT!!"
Toni M.,"El Cerrito, CA",115,2277,24,4.0,5/3/2011,"That's 3.51.  This was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory.  As a rule I normally shun chain restaurants, but Tam, whose taste I trust, likes this place so I was interested in trying it.  Yesterday Alan and I met her here for lunch.  The menu is extensive and a little overwhelming so I stuck to the lunch selections.  What appealed to me was Renee's lunch special, which offered half a sandwich, either turkey or chicken/almond salad, the soup of the day, which was a thick lentil w/ bacon and either a green salad or, for a little more, Caesar salad.  Alan ordered a pulled pork sandwich w/ sweet potato fries and Tam ordered an appetizer of fried zucchini to share and a miso salmon lunch plate.  I had a special dirty martini and the two of them ordered Paradise iced tea. The martini was well mixed but was pricier than expected.  I ordered it w/o noticing the price on the menu, if indeed it was there.  The fried zucchini was excellent, crisp and greaseless w/ a ranch dipping sauce.  We all liked it.  Alan liked his pulled pork sandwich and the bite I had of Tam's salmon was very tasty.  My chicken/almond salad sandwich was good, although there was too much mayonnaise and too few almonds for my taste and their idea of a half sandwich was about double what my idea was.  The soup was very tasty and the Caesar salad was bland, lacking notes of garlic or anchovy.  Basically boring.  I think next time I would order the salmon.  Service was warm and attentive.  The space was huge, w/ high ceilings.  Decor was generic glitz.  I had the sense it would look the same in Memphis, Kansas City or Bumfuck Idaho."
John V C.,"San Francisco, CA",125,1,,1.0,12/29/2015,"I have never seen a display of racism that has been displayed tonight. At the The Cheesecake Factory located in Walnut Creek, the manager, who is Asian himself, (update: his name is Jason Shum) just clearly stated that my family and myself are Asian so we all look alike and that is the reason why we were not seated right away.  After we were seated, everything seemed to be normal. We were a table of 14 and when the manager told us that we were Asian and we look alike, he said it to one half of the table, the side where my parents, aunts and uncle, and I were seated at. The other side of the table was unaware till we told them what had happened. My sister, who was on the other side, then complained upon hearing this and the manager was in full denial that he had ever said anything. Later in the evening, the manager then came to our side of the table to check up on us and I told him that we did not appreciate his comments. He then tried to ask us which one of his employees said the comments (seemed like he was ready to throw one of his employees under the bus) and we told him it was him. He then got all defensive and started to argue and deny everything and he would not leave the table, even though we told him to leave several times, he just stood there and said that he never said that and that he has been in the restaurant business for 6 years (pointless to say, but whatever). He eventually left after standing at the edge of our table like an idiot for almost 10 minutes harassing us with his denial while we were trying to finish up our dinner. He clearly had no idea on how to handle the situation. The manager (Jason Shum) is clearly not fit to hold his manager position and should be release due to his incompetence and racism.  Other than the manager's incompetence, this would've been a typical Cheesecake Factory experience, nice services from the servers and good but overpriced food. However the manager ruined the night for my family and myself. I have called and filed a complaint with his senior manager and the corporate and will be following up within the week."
Rev. M.,"Hayward, CA",0,86,,4.0,12/17/2014,"The appetizers are teeny tiny, be aware of that.  The crab and artichoke dip, you might get five bites and the $6.99 zuchini fries, mushroom and avocado fry appetizer, not worth the size, was so small it threw us for a loop.  They were okay.  The fries were great! The bread served with the molasses inside the dough was superb.   Salmon in lemon sauce, mashed potatoes and brocolli special $20 absolutely marvelous!  Chicken Romano Pasta $11.95, yum.  Thai Chicken Satay Lettuce Wraps, very good.  I switched out the chicken with shrimp $17.90, the shrimp was way overcooked and dry.  :(   I'd still get it again, just have to tell the cook to have al dente shrimp.  The peanut sauce a bit salty this time. Parking was horrendous.  I was dropped off while my ride walked 1/2 mile back."
Ashley K.,"San Diego, CA",69,171,2,1.0,1/14/2015,"So I come here a lot. I love the food, but UGH THE SERVICE. The waiter forgets my friend's salad. By the time he shows up again, lunch is over. So we just ask to have it taken off the bill. But then the manager comes up with our take out boxes. Get this.................. he gallantly offers to throw in a few hot fries into my leftover fish and chips box. 1. This is take out. The fries are going to taste like soggy crud tomorrow... so hot fries does nothing for me. 2. You screwed my friend over, not me. Giving me a few fries does nothing for her. And what was most insulting was that he had this benevolent act going on, like he was doing us such a favor????"
Iridian R.,"Vallejo, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/20/2017,"let me just start off by saying that this place is going down hill. when i got here i gave the hostess my name like usual she said it was gonna be about 25 minutes. i said ok and sat down, she gave me a buzzer and all and half an hour went by.. then 45 minutes go by and i started noticing that people that came in after me were already being seated. so i asked the hostess what the hold up was and she giggled and said oops. i have a table outside i can seat  you there. once again i said sure. waiter was nowhere to be found for about 10 minutes and finally stopped by and said he'd be back with waters and bread, 15 minutes go by and we still haven't ordered drinks or food. once he finally comes back with the waters he forgets our bread, finally once he came back and took our orders he ignored us for the rest of the night. didn't come to check up on us nor our food until it was time for us to pay. not only did i feel disrespected but i also felt ignored. my needs were def not met. i was better off going to a mcdonald's."
Jeromy G.,"Foster City, CA",602,660,1032,4.0,8/12/2013,"It's a normal cheesecake factory, it's nice because there are free parking lots everywhere. Very roomy and the space seems real open probably because of the high ceilings. If you've been to any cheesecake factory you know the deal. If you have not, pretty much good food all around depending on what you get. Cheesecake. It's the cheesecake factory. So go get some of that."
Mark M.,"Fairfield, CA",61,33,10,4.0,7/25/2015,"Although my steak Diane was a little undercooked, the servings and the service were generous. The taste was also very good as my combination was very good. Too bad I enjoyed it so much that I didn't have enough room for cheesecake. My bad. Also, the menu was larger and had more variety than casino restaurants. If the quality of the other menu items match what I had today, then this restaurant was devious in providing huge rationale to return many times."
Alexander E.,"San Pablo, CA",355,636,830,3.0,6/2/2011,"I was enjoying my Cheesecake Factor dinner until I received ""Osama bin Laden is dead and US has body, says person familiar with developments"" via Associated Press App. Even bin Laden's death can't mess up my diner, I'm at the Cheesecake Factory, son! I'm fairly familiar with The Cheesecake Factory and have visited several of their branches including their Vegas location. The nearby parking garage guarantees ample parking and makes you want to skip the San Francisco experience at the Macy's building.  The three minute walk to The Factory is refreshing and lets you take in downtown Walnut Creek.  The Spanish style architecture and decor of The Factory is welcoming and nicely suites the restaurant name. I visited the restaurant before seeing a movie on a Sunday night around six or seven o'clock and had a five minute wait.  I got myself a cold Cornoa at the bar and by time I was served my beer, my pager was ringing.  The menu is standard at every location and resembles a short book with pages of American offerings. My party and I ordered their nacho appetizer, which is topped with guacamole, house salsa, sour cream and jalapenos.  The nachos were good, but not great and weren't as fresh as I'd hope.  The chips seemed as if they sat under the heat lamp a little too long. As for my main entree, I went with their Spicy Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with fries. The chicken fillet is deep fried with melted cheese, on hamburger buns with lettuce and tomato and slathered with their buffalo sauce. The sandwich wasn't as epic as my previous experiences at their other locations, but did manage to give me a food O.  The fries were pretty standard and served as filler.  All in all, I love The Cheesecake Factory, but I was left a little unimpressed, given this is a new location (two years old).  I'll give The Factory another chance and give this visit the benefit of the doubt."
Gabrielle F.,"Lafayette, CA",10,94,22,3.0,2/9/2015,"There's always something new to try and for the most part, I'm always pleased with what I order. (Except for the cheesecake! I'm always disappointed by their cheesecakes.) I ate here the other day. My husband and I split the crab and artichoke dip, which was very good except for the hair in it. And it wasn't a hair that floated out of the ether and landed on top, but a tight black curly hair buried close to the bottom... I'm telling myself it's an arm or chest hair. At first I thought an eyelash had fallen into the dip (maybe, hopefully mine) but when I plucked it out, that little sucker came twisting from the dip, obviously very mixed in. Eeeeeew. We let the waitress know nicely...it wasn't her fault and hair is that evil beast in the kitchen that's hard to keep completely out. It happens. Just wanted to let them know so they could check their dip for possibly more rogue fuzzies. (Why do I always feel guilty for letting a restaurant know about an issue?!) The rest of our meal arrived. I ordered the lunch portion of the salmon genovese and my husband got the chicken sandwich, salad and soup special. Both were very very good. We went home with plenty of leftovers. The portions are out of control huge here which is tough for me because I like trying a little bit of everything rather than eating a mountain of the same thing. The bites menu somewhat satisfies that desire, but I honestly don't come here that often because of the portions.  The two things I don't like about this place would be the indoor dining area and the cheesecakes. I only like eating outside, the interior is boring and makes me feel uncomfortable. Most importantly, somehow, they manage to screw up all of their cheesecakes. The last one I tried was the white chocolate, caramel and macadamia nut cheesecake. It would have been delicious if it weren't for the crust. Imagine a bite of incredible perfection only to get to the bottom where your taste buds are assaulted by a very burnt caramel flavor. Stomach churning. I ate around the rest of the crust but couldn't shake that burnt flavor. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. I would hope the quality control on cheesecakes would be better since that's the name of the chain. Alas, no."
Egean B.,"Berkeley Hills, Berkeley, CA",0,10,,5.0,4/16/2016,"Friday or Saturday  nights you can wait minimum 1 hour,no big deal because  employees  so kind and dishes delicious. Ambiance is professional for restaurant and impressive."
Liraz L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",207,29,32,4.0,6/23/2013,I love the cheesecake factory '!!! the food is delicious the atmosphere is great sometimes its take too long to get the food overall its all good I love to go there .
Scott A.,"Dublin, CA",38,70,30,2.0,3/29/2015,The food was great...the service was great...sitting outside was great EXCEPT for the dog they allowed in. I'm sorry...the only dog allowed in a restaurant should be a service dog. I like dogs and will go to lengths to be kind....but NO DOGS in the dining area!
John O.,"Walnut Creek, CA",70,18,,2.0,6/2/2015,"Slow Service, Dirty Utensils, So loud, you can't yourself think! Who could ask for more?"
Ann D.,"Honolulu, HI",1,33,2,2.0,12/29/2014,Food is not great...!!  Presentation is poor. Not nutritional how they serve. Disappointed!!
R C.,"Lafayette, CA",0,20,47,3.0,3/23/2015,"We went for early dinner around 5 pm on Superbowl Sunday. Called a couple of minutes before we got there and was told the waiting would be 10 minutes, however we waited 20 minutes for a table of 3. When we walked to our table, there were so many empty tables, made us feel they made you wait on purpose to make them look busy. Seriously.  Food was good, not bad, nothing special. We order the lettuce wrap appetizer, which was pretty good.  Shepherd pie was decent.  Chicken and Biscuit was horrible.  Our waitress was very nice if you could see her. Not sure how many tables and how big the territory she covered, but must be big as it is hard to find her.  If you come for the decor, then it is a good place to eat. If you come for the food and do not have a lot of time wait for your drink, wait for your bread, wait for your food, and wait for your bill, then try somewhere else."
