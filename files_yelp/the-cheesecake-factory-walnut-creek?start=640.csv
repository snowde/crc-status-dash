Tina D.,"Davis, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/20/2016,"Horrible service!  Waiter was Thomas S. and not only was he very rude he provided horrible service. When we first sat down it took a while for him to even come over, which was a bad sign to begin with. We ordered Sunday brunch which turned out to be a huge mistake. I wanted a refill on my coffee and had to ask for it then I had to ask for cream and waited a long time for him to come back with it and by that time my coffee was cold.  My boyfriend ordered a side of toast which never came and he waited for the waiter to come back again to remind him about the toast but we didn't see him again. His food was cold at that point and he didn't even get to eat it. Overall the worst service, period!"
Grace Anne D.,"Concord, CA",266,364,623,4.0,7/2/2011,"Girlfriends + late night dinner = Cheesecake Factory. It was around 10:20pm and my friend said this places closes at 11 so rushed to get there. I immediately  noticed how dark it was. The walls were a dark maroon and the lighting was very dim, I'm surprised they didn't have a flash light to guide us to our table. Our server was Jessica and she was energetic, sweet, and patient. Gave us the daily specials and didn't mind giving us olive oil and balsamic vinegar for our bread. I ordered the old fashioned burger: medium-rare burger (or your choice cooked), lettuce, onions, pickles and tomato served with a side of french fries (I got the sweet potato fries $1 more) so w/ regular fries = $8.95.  I wasn't sure if the burger was supposed to taste peppery, but mine did, as if they spilled a lot of pepper on it :(  I ALWAYS check if our waiters fill up our water, it's a MUST for me haha and Jessica stopped by our table several times to refill our water; love that! Good experience :)"
Sara A.,"West Hills, Los Angeles, CA",315,328,1239,5.0,12/30/2013,"This review is for the service Dmari gave us... Not sure if I am spelling his name right. He was awesome... He knew my parents would want extra bread and butter, he brought extra condiments, he was so attentive. Cheesecake otherwise usually never really fails honestly. This location has a really cute front location with little fires and is really cozy."
Julia B.,"San Pablo, CA",6,30,,5.0,7/6/2015,"Mango cheese cake is AMAZING! Of course, other foods this place offers i.e. burgers, pasta, etc. is amazing, but as the name of the restaurant suggests, it has the best cheese cake ever.  The place has an average noise level, with classy decoration inside and outside.  Mushroom burger was hands-down one of the best burgers I had, while the cream pasta was quite salty, yet full of other flavors with well-cooked noodles. The free bread that gets served continually is also great."
April M.,"Livermore, CA",294,90,213,3.0,5/30/2013,"TIRAMISU CHEESECAKE! GET SOME! That's it. That's my Review. hehehe. If you like tiramisu & you like cheesecake...Uhm HELLO!? YUUUUUUM! Came here with my new bffgf ;) to celebrate her promotion into the 6-figures. (mainly because I obviously make A LOT less than 6-figures)...Walked in & it was COLD! lol- I guess it's better than it being muggy & hot...so we opted to sit outside next to the fire and directly underneath the heat lamps... Great Service & awesome portion sizes. As Andrew I. pointed out earlier-I have yet to experience anything other than yum eats in pretty huge portions (even off their skinny menu) & decent enough service.  -2stars for a dirty fork in my flatware bundle. bleh...I know not to expect much when going out to eat but, come on now cheesecake factory...don't make it blatantly obvious... I know you see them foodstains on the flatware-do you think wrapping it up in a pretty white linen napkin will make your clientele completely oblivious to dirty flatware?!  ANSWER: NO!  IT DOESN'T-IT LOOKS EVEN WORSE!   I ordered the veggie burger off the skinny menu that is made out of beets and other such yumminess (I highly recommend it to those of you that don't partake of the carnivorous diet). & a Skinny Red Sangria- YUM! We also ordered the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio as an appetizer along with the Fried Mac & Cheese balls. LOL..Yeah-Irony on our table- I know.  It's called going out to dinner STARVING. Both were ok and well if you hadn't had some Fried Mac n Cheese yet- Well-The Cheesecake factory is the place to try 'em:)  Final Verdict-CHECK your FORKS! hehehe...no, but really tho...check your flatware. Try something off of there endless menu & if you are in a dessert mood...Just stop on in for dessert & an espresso."
Alessandro B.,"Washougal, WA",1,45,,3.0,4/12/2014,"This place is OK I guess. The service is good, and the place is fancy, fun atmosphere, lot of space. The food is acceptable and won't disappoint, but it won't impress either. Luckily, there is a lot of variety in their menu and the portions are huge. Cheesecakes are delicious, and they also offer several interesting drinking options."
Mandi K.,"Fairfield, CA",374,186,553,3.0,9/4/2014,"I've been here a few times and the experiences have been decent but nothing really amazing stood out. The name is really just part of the hype and yes they do give really nice portions for food, however I haven't tasted anything where I was like WOW! I have to go back.      I have tried a few of their pasta dishes, chicken, and Chinese food items and all were great. Only one experience was terrible. I specifically asked for no tomatoes in my pasta dish and the server says okay. Plate comes and there are bits and pieces of tomatoes there. So I point it out to the server and she says sorry and gets the manager. Manager comes and states that it's not tomatoes but it's red bell pepper. No offense but I have such a reaction to tomatoes that I KNOW. Plus I made my friend eat some of them to check. LOL. So finally they take it and replace it and I specify NOT Tomatoes and no bell pepper please and Comes back within a few minutes. I check again and there is still red crap. Looks like they dumped it on a new plate and sprinkled extra cheese and that was about it. Bleh      Luckily my other experiences have been decent. You win some and you lose some."
Ba W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,5.0,4/5/2016,"All I need to say is ""Adams penut cup fudge ripple""!!!!  It is great. I also like the order ahead and parking in the back!"
Colleen K.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,4,,5.0,6/27/2015,"To say the service, food, and atmosphere are exceptional would be an understatement. Every meal as varied as they have been, has been terrific, both in presentation and quality."
Rouzbeh N.,"Walnut Creek, CA",35,34,8,5.0,4/8/2014,This place is always fun to go to!  Very fun atmosphere! You can wait outside (sitting by the fire) until you are called in. The food is always great!
Dennis B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,52,,2.0,3/12/2016,"Great service and amazing cheese cake but the food is miserable.  Two of our party had $29 ribeye steaks that were too dry to eat.  The spicy blackened shrimp was awash in sugar.  The fried macaroni was soaked in grease.  Nuff said...the food was terrible.  Can only conclude that people put up with the crowds, noise, and long waits for the the desert.  You are better off just getting cheese cake to go."
Bill R.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,18,5,1.0,3/12/2016,"Usually enjoy this place but have to say that the only good thing tonite was the coffee and the server. Wife's potato soup was nasty, did not taste like potato soup. My fish and chips was straight out of the sea. Barely cooked. Wife had cheesecake that was so soft it was like mush. Also her toasted sandwich was soggy. Salad was nothing but lettuce, not even a crouton. Very disappointed as we usually have a nice meal. Friends said it was going down hill but I was skeptical. Not anymore."
Jasmine N.,"Benicia, CA",200,30,47,3.0,1/18/2016,"Sure, it's a chain restaurant, and prices can be high for what you get, but sometimes I'm just in the mood for Cheesecake Factory. They have a large menu, from Italian to American to Asian, so it might help to have something in mind beforehand. The ambience is dim and nicely decorated, and it's a big place. There's usually at LEAST a 30-minute wait, although chances are it could be closer to an hour at dinner time on any given week day. I would come here for a special occasion, or a casual meal with one other person so we could sit in the bar area, which is first come first serve. Since the restaurant is pretty much always busy, it seems to take a toll on the food. We had to send multiple dishes back to the kitchen. There was not enough chicken in our sandwich, then when they sent us more chicken, it looked undercooked and was not fully cut through. If your meal comes with sauce, the sauce can be pretty skimpy, so you may want to ask for more on the side. However, our waitress was very patient with us if we weren't happy about something. I do come here regularly, but when planning a meal here, I would definitely factor in the wait time, and expect the food to be hit or miss."
Monica B.,"San Rafael, CA",95,14,2,5.0,4/5/2013,I love cheesecake factory so much. I can say no matter what you order you will enjoy it. You will enjoy the atmosphere in it. You will love the service and I believe the quality  of food and service you get worth the price you pay. I had hibachi steak with mashed potato and loved and enjoyed eating it.
Tafadzwa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",85,2,,1.0,12/7/2014,On a positive note the food was good and the server was really nice and would have been more attentive if he hadn't been working so many tables in his section. I went on Saturday night between 7pm-9pm. SERVICE was really SLOWWW!!!It was terrible and I really want to attribute it to the fact that this was a high volume night but on reading other reviews this seems to be a running theme. First it took about a 1/2 hour to get a seat on the patio...that's OK there were packed so that was reasonable. Second I did not love the fact that the only section that has access to any kind of heat is close to the fire pit...everyone else is left to fend for themselves in the cold. Granted nights aren't frigid but it would be nice to have heat lamps throughout the patio to ensure that all your patrons are comfortable when seated outside. It can get breezy and chilly. third it took more that 45 min to get our food and that was after I had to talk to the manager. Management apologized profusely and I was offered a free cheese cake but I don't ever remember service being that awful. Please make a change... hire more staff or restructure  your server:table ratio
Tim D.,"Lafayette, CA",51,21,5,3.0,4/28/2015,"I have been to several other cheesecake factories in my life that were significantly better than this one. The atmosphere, Decour, and massive menu are all the same at this one, but the food did not match up to the quality of other ones.  Great location, and friendly waitstaff."
Corey B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,18,8,2.0,8/4/2013,"The portions here are HUGE and the food is very good. The service here is so bad though that I had to deduct two stars for my multiple bad experiences at this restaurant. I used to love curbside pick-up. It seems however that the service has gone down hill and each time I have to wait longer and longer. The last time I used the service I waited for 20 minutes in my car before having to go inside to track down a staff member to let them know I was still waiting for my food. Then, I waited another 15 minutes before going back inside again to further complain. Finally after waiting almost an hour my food  it came out. During this whole wait no one answered the phone (hence why I went inside so often). When the food finally arrived, the staff person was gruff and didn't offer any compensation for the wait and hassle. Overall, Cheesecake needs to step up their service quality for me to come back again."
Patty G.,"Edmonds, WA",8,40,11,5.0,7/3/2013,A must stop if you're ever anywhere near Walnut Creek. If you go on a Friday or Saturday evening be ready to either get there early or wait.
Andrew I.,"Pittsburg, CA",472,221,394,4.0,2/15/2013,"Actual rating: 3.7/5 stars I've never had a bad experience here. You must make reservations here if you can. Sometimes they don't allow reservations, though. On a busy weekend night you will be waiting at least 30 minutes, unless you are fortunate and finds seating on the bar area, which I find the floors to be really really slippery, idk about you. It's fun to look at all the waiters/tress' white shoes. Some of their shoes are sooo filthy, I though they were donated or something. But they say that it just gets dirty in the kitchen. Really? Because it looks like you just climbed off Mount Diablo. Lol.  Anyway, for lunch my favorite is Kobe beef burger. For dinner, everything is good, and I usually stick with the pastas. I've been here with 2 people, and with 16 people. The service is always great, they are so friendly and funny here. They greet you, try to make small talks with you, nothing is awkward or pretentious here. I really really love the decor of this Cheesecake factory. The huge pillars, tall ceiling, intricate lighting. Very cute outside eating/hanging out area, large fire!! is so romantic.  The food always come in humongous portions, or maybe it's just the plates. Eitherway, free bread, of course, a little on the tough side for me. Pasta is always good here. Prices are expensive, though, but it never stops so many people of all ages from coming here. This place is always loud, and even with all this space, They could use more tables. One downside is the small bathrooms. But usually it's clean, so that's positive. Parking can be a hassle but there are a lot of garages within a 2 block radius. Beware of rowdy teenagers!"
Kendra C.,"San Francisco, CA",74,45,126,4.0,4/21/2013,"As you walk through the dazzling double doors, dressed in your mini dress and bedazzled with every kind of pink rind stones, you feel this high that you can only associate with one city.... You take a sip from that oversized plastic tube-of-a-drink, with the words, ""Imperial Palace"" plastered on the side (you know, the drink that others doubt you can finish without getting alcohol poisoning. Yes, those). Well that's how you feel when you walk into Cheesecake. The decor truly makes you think you are in Vegas! And some even think they are (check out the scene on Friday nights) Glitzy and well-kept, this Cheesecake is by far the most visually impressive of them all.  Anyways, the food is delicious. The Louisiana style chicken pasta is to die for if you like a small kick to your otherwise decadent entree.  Skinnylishess Menu I have also had a lot of experience with the Skinnylishess menu (under 520 calories, right?) from the enchiladas to the turkey club. Overall, I have not been impressed with that menu, although I'm probably asking for too much. It's like ordering the vegetarian option a a steak house. Just done do it. They tried. So to be specific, I was not a fan of the enchiladas (it may be a matter of preference, mine being green sauce over red) but the vegetables on the side (zucchini, cauliflower and carrots) were not cooked and made to serve cold in vinegar. It was utterly inedible! It's not even bunny food worthy! Next time I will ask for streamed till soft vegetables. Problem solved!  I love this place for too many other reasons to give up on it! To stay on the safe side, I would just suggest ordering off the regular menu and taking the other half home! Noteworthy Plates Appetizers: Spinach Artichoke Dip with chips! Heavenly! But equally as mouth watering is the Crab Dip served with bread! Incredible! But words of caution: who needs appetizers when your entree is so big and rich, right? No reservations and no exceptions! Pick up a buzzer and take hike while you wait."
