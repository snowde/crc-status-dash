Henry T.,"Portland, OR",320,366,114,2.0,4/27/2011,"Food was decent. Portions are rather large. Service is okay once seated. I would give it a three, but upon arriving, they told us it would be a 10 minute wait. We were actually all in a rush with places to go. My party of 5 waited patiently and took 40+ minutes to finally be seated.  My friends pressured me into ordering the Kobe Burger, which was just decent. Not bad, but nothing outstanding for a burger, especially with Kobe beef. The fries were kinda on the bad side. Not crispy and some tasted/felt undercooked.  My friends seemed to be content with what they had and some of them had to take the rest of their orders to-go with portions pretty large. Overall everyone had a 3ish star feeling for this place. Bumped down to 2 for the long wait after getting our hopes up for a 10 minute wait (5pm on Friday)!"
Lora M.,"San Francisco, CA",179,417,1126,3.0,1/24/2011,"It's funny to go to a cheesecake factory and not eat a cheesecake at all.  While everyone else felt guilty with what they ordered, I felt pretty good with mine, grilled salmon, spinach and green beans. All eyes on my plate when our food came to our table. Everybody wished they ordered the same thing, health-wise. I kept staring at my food and kept thinking if I would be able to finish it. It was intimidating me. So I finally dove in and had the first disappointing bite of my salmon, over cooked and of course dry. I liked the spinach and the green beans, thanks to the lemon juice I squeezed on it.   The food is just so overwhelming, huge proportion like it's going to be your last meal on earth. One order for almost anything will feed 2-3 people. Over all, I can't be a fan of this place, I'd love to give it a 3.8 for good service and nice interior."
Anna W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",7,36,8,4.0,10/19/2014,"I came in here late on a weekend, because it was the only place nearby that served food after 10. All I wanted was dessert, and i was not disappointed. The server was very pleasant. The apple crisp was very tasty, even though it was huge. There's normally a long wait during peak hours."
Mack C.,"Vallejo, CA",1,9,,3.0,3/13/2016,A huge-ass restaurant with a huge-ass menu offering huge-ass portions with a small-ass bathroom.
Ashley B.,"Concord, CA",438,9,7,2.0,3/13/2016,Horrible horrible breakfast. The worst I've ever had by far. I got the farm fresh eggs. Eggs were not farm fresh since they were not real eggs. The potatoes were about as crisp/ burnt as possible. I also ordered a side of wheat French toast and never got a side of wheat toast. Silver lining the coffee was decent.
Craig H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",159,165,197,3.0,11/23/2014,You can find the Cheesecake Factory everywhere but the one in Walnut Creek is huge and has especially nice decor.  Buyer beware:  Friday and Saturday night you will be waiting if you dare to come here between 5:30-8:30pm.  Obviously their cheesecake is awesome it's a meal in itself.  Yes they have some good dishes but for me you need to have cheesecake here otherwise you can get great food at another restaurant especially in Walnut Creek.  If you live around here you should check it out at least once!
Robert T.,"Cobb, CA",1,15,,4.0,3/31/2015,"I mean what can I say, Cheesecake Factory doesn't suck. The food and the dessert was awesome, a little bit of a wait time as expected but totally worth it. Great place!"
Raeann D.,"Emeryville, CA",0,11,1,5.0,9/27/2015,"Love this place!!! They have the best cheesecakes everrr! My whole experience was EXCELLENT( food, service, and atmosphere)...especially the service. Our waiter name was Timothy, he did a wonderful job and was very kind. Looking forward to going back again!"
Jenny T.,"Antioch, CA",2,50,12,4.0,1/1/2015,"My experiences here have always been plesasant!  Not really sure if it's worth your money because the two times that ive been here, my meal was paid for by someone else lol! But I can definitely say that everything ive ordered here have always been delicious. Even if it is expensive, it's a good place to eat for an occasional celebration for a birthday, anniversary, graduation, or something of that sort. And the cheesecake! Oh the cheesecake... @.@ I am not generally a fan of cheesecake, but the ones here are the only exception... they are SO to die for."
JMark P.,"Napa, CA",3,53,,3.0,11/27/2012,"I own a business so I try to be fair.  To run a restaurant and then have lay people (especially teens and some 20 somethings who probably should not be reviewing a business) acting like they are Pulitzer prize winners all the while being ""food experts"" commenting on their restaurants must be hard to swallow.  Again, I try to be fair and I don't try to nitpick.  I've worked in fine dining as a waiter and went to chef school so I have a little knowledge.  That said: Remember that if a restaurant isn't busy, usually the food isn't good.  This place always seems busy. I've gone there several times.  The service is very friendly.  Twice I got the curbside to go order and it was fast and convenient.   The curbside take out is awesome.  You can call the bakery and order your meals and then park for free in the garage next to the restaurant and they will come out and bring your food to you.  They will take your money, get your change and you are on your way.  If you carry cash you can pay the bill immediately and I always add a couple of dollars as a tip.  I remember they were training someone and they were very sweet and informative.  I really appreciated their speed and great attitudes!   Sometimes when it gets real busy, service anywhere can be a little rough.  It's hard sometimes for staff to deal with the diva/high maintenance mentality of some people in today's world.   One time I was eating at the bar on a Friday after work, and man was it packed.  They also had someone out sick and they were training someone.  I read the room and told the waitress not to stress about me and just do her best.  I sat at the bar and got a couple of cold Guinness while she dealt with 2 tables of drunk crazy college aged people that were making her life hell.   The meal was late but I understood.  As I left the restaurant the manager stopped me and gave me a piece of cheesecake to go on the house.  The waitress was so appreciative and said I made her night.  Sometimes not being a hot head and showing patience does pay off.   The food is mostly solid.  To not have a regular bacon cheeseburger is kind of silly but for the most part the food is good.   People think a huge menu is a good thing but it's the exact opposite.  It shows a restaurant trying to be all things to all people and that usually spells disaster.  I've tasted the pasta dishes, pizzas and the asian wraps and they were bland and ordinary tasting.  No chef can cook a great meal every time with so many items on the menu.  I'm one of the few I think that doesn't like the desserts too much.  To me they are sickening sweet.  I make cheesecakes and I cant' imagine the amount of sugar that is in these recipes.  Many like them though so I'm a rare person.  Pros: Solid food nice staff love the cheeseburger and the appetizers are good too Curbside take out Cons: Very swamped on weekends so you will have to wait a long time Menu is too big; some items are hit and miss  Parking is a big pain at times.   For a chain restaurant it's not bad.  Out of all the ones I've been to, this one so far is the best Cheesecake Factory."
Paula G.,"Concord, CA",234,58,110,2.0,12/8/2012,"This Cheesecake Factory has declined slightly since my last review.  The bread that was brought out was slightly burnt, not to mention stale.  Thankfully, our waiter was very gracious and immediately brought us a new basket. Food quality...meh.  It's a chain restaurant, so I shouldn't be expecting something super fabulous or over-the-top amazing. But the boyfriend was craving their BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad...and I wanted cheesecake. Had a late lunch here with the boyfriend and we both ordered salads and cheesecake to share.  We couldn't finish our salads (because we need ample stomach room for cheesecake obviously) so we had them boxed up to go.  Later in the day, we decided to finish our leftovers and had found that we had been totally gypped!  I know for a fact that I had finished a little less than half of my salad (likewise for the bf) and the amount left in each to go container was only a quarter of each salad...if that!  If we're going to pay $10+ for a salad, we expect to get our money's worth...even if we have to take home leftovers! A little disappointed, but at least I know not to bring back home leftovers in the future."
Jonathan R.,"Concord, CA",257,885,1047,4.0,4/17/2013,"This was the first time going to The Cheesecake Factory in years. The outside and the inside look like a palace. Prepare to feel the heat from the outside fire as you're walking up to the front door. We were seated immediately and our server was for lack of a better word, wacky. He made a joke then almost fell to the floor laughing over it. He then told us he was going to break so we would have a new server. She was great. We started off with avocado egg rolls, which I have never had before, but am certainly a fan now. I want to personally thank who ever invented these. I ordered the Blue Cheese BLT burger. It was OK. It was not cooked rare like I wanted, actually no where near rare, but it was good. For dessert we ordered the Reese's peanut butter cup cheese cake which was good, just a little too rich for us. I would love to go back and try there Jambalaya entree I saw."
Victoria W.,"Ione, CA",4,6,2,3.0,1/16/2015,"The food was good; standard for the restaurant. But what was disappointing was the service. We went in on a slow weekday lunch and the sever rushed us to order out meals, we had to ask for an appetizer after the fact. The appetizer we ordered was crab cakes and for 13 dollars and we got three tiny cakes. I had the Chicken Romano, that was very good parm crusted chicken, I recommend it."
Sara L.,"San Francisco, CA",2,67,123,1.0,8/7/2014,Worst cheesecake factory I've been to. I have gluten free allergy. I ordered a gluten free pasta and my husband ordered reg pasta and while I was eating I saw few if my husbands pasta mix in with mine. I was sick for a whole week. This place and the staff does not know the importance of gluten free food to people who has gluten intolerance/allergy.  They don't care. They cross contaminate my food and got me sick. Be careful when eating here if you have gluten intolerance/allergy or celiac disease.
Cheryl W.,"El Sobrante, CA",0,15,,2.0,4/30/2015,"Love this place..have gone many, many times, the food is always great and the staff is always nice and friendly.  HOWEVER..I went for my birthday on Sat 4/25 looking forward to having a great time. As our party of 7 was being seated the waiter ""Eluterio L""  immediately came over and greeted us and asked if we would like to start with something to drink. Without looking at the menu, as we had just sat down, most of us knew that we wanted soda or ice tea however my 2yo granddaughter was with us and I was unaware what type of juice was available as we had just sat down and had not reviewed the juices on the kids menu.   With that, I asked the waiter, ""what kind of juice do you have?""  and he replied, ""DO YOU NOT HAVE A MENU?"" We'll that just set me off. I then replied ""do you not know what kind of juice you have at this restaurant?  I went on to correct him even further and we were able to move on and have dinner---but HE TOTALLY RUINED THE HAPPY BIRTHDAY FEELING...   as this turned out to be the talk at the table.  Not sure if I will be returning but will definately ask for a new waiter if we get him again.  THANK YOU ELUTERIO FOR RUINING MY BIRTHDAY!"
Nic C.,"Benicia, CA",299,444,40,4.0,2/12/2013,"where should I start, CHEESECAKE, CHEESECAKE, CHEESECAKE.  That;s what i come here for.  Not a big fan of the food.  But I have eaten alot of CHEESECAKE from here.  The place is beautiful, nice ceilings, real clean, great part of town. Parking on the street or in the parking garage next door."
Dave R.,"Pleasanton, CA",14,7,27,5.0,1/24/2016,"My fiancé & I celebrated our 4yr anniversary at The Cheesecake Factory tonight. There was a very long line & they were out of pagers. We sort of slipped through the cracks but we were seated with apologies. No big deal as I understand they were busy. Our server was Daniele & she was very attentive & very nice from the beginning. We had another couple sit down next to us & you can tell no matter what anyone did they were just not going to be happy. Daniele handled herself in a very professional matter & even got them the manager. They moved to another table (thankfully lol) & we heard eventually just left. Daniele took our picture for us & gave us a ice cream with candles with ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate syrup on the dish dish. Way cool as I was not expecting this. After I gave her props for the way she handled her difficult table she must have mentioned it to her manager. The manager came by, apologized for having to listen to all of the complaining & comped us our cheesecake. Totally above & beyond service. Thank you for the wonderful service!  Oh BTW, the food was excellent too!"
Helen K.,"Lafayette, CA",74,378,37,1.0,12/31/2012,The only words you need to know: Tourist trap.
Jay L.,"Orinda, CA",158,24,4,4.0,5/25/2014,No wait to get a table this time. Sat at the bar and watched the giants game.  The server was super friendly. Very sweet and fast service.  Food was good.  They always have a huge menu to choose from.
Cash F.,"Oakland, CA",558,31,28,4.0,9/15/2013,My wife and I had a really nice dinner and enjoyed the new glutton free menu and food that was served to back it up. The drinks were not tasting so good so the staff took them away immediately and have us some to our liking.   Thanks for being such a good place to eat!!
