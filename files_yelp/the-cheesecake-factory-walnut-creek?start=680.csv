Fanny H.,"Los Angeles, CA",409,409,220,3.0,6/16/2011,"Surprised our party got seated so quick since wait time the last time I came here was super long.  We avoided the weekend and had a smaller party so maybe that was the case. This place is pretty pricey if you want some quality stuff and they have so many selections, I never ever can decide what to get without bouncing back and forth. Food is alright overall, but the wait time is what gets me.  SO LONG.  Each and every single time.  I don't know why.  They seem to have a lot of staff and for a Tuesday night, it wasn't busy at all.  I don't know why it takes forever to get food out. What I like most about this place is the ambiance, but for some reason, Cheesecake Factory LOVES to have dim lights.  Annoying. Cheesecake's good though...and I'm normally NOT a fan of cheesecake.  Avoid all the whip cream though, unnecessary."
Rick J.,"Vacaville, CA",3,13,18,4.0,4/23/2015,Great place to dine. The Diana Steak was excellent. The ambiance is great too.
Deana M.,"Tracy, CA",12,124,319,5.0,11/24/2014,"After a day of shopping, my mother, sister, & I decided to get a bite to eat instead of fighting traffic. We had cocktails at the bar while waiting for our table. My mother & I had cosmos and my sister a martini. They were perfect. We each had a salad and shared the Thai chicken lettuce wraps & a bowl of the corn chowder. The food is consistently good. What made this a five star was our server, Jordan B. He was the best. Professional, attentive, & accommodating. Will definitely return because the service was excellent. Thanks to Jordan B!"
Bayguy C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,46,12,5.0,1/21/2016,I come here for lunch at least one per week and always sit at the bar. Food is always good as are the portion sizes. The staff is always friendly and attentive. They also have the best carrot cake that I have ever had!
David C.,"Martinez, CA",30,497,129,4.0,10/31/2014,"A fun place to eat, beware about how popular it is though. There's almost always a wait out the door. Cheesecake just tastes better there though and they have a overwhelming variety of entree choices."
Maria D.,"San Ramon, CA",3,66,137,3.0,12/10/2014,"The two guys that created this theme restaurant were large and wanted a place with large portions like they would want and they certainly do it in style.  My favorite is the Chicken Chili.  Its in a busy mall and always very crowded so reservations are recommended, or try eating in the bar area or at the bar."
Brittany G.,"Elk Grove, CA",26,39,1,2.0,11/24/2012,"I've been here about 5 times over the last 3 years... only one time (the first time) did I ever have a truly great experience. The drinks were excellent, food was great, service great... but ever since it has just gone downhill. Granted the first time my best friend and I went it was relatively slow in comparison to its normal level, but we had a great time. I'm so sad to have to give this place 2 stars... but the last experiences have just pushed it over the edge... One thing you must know is that this place is busy... ALL.THE.TIME. I have gone at almost every hour of he day... and it has always been super busy (the exception being the first time). you ALWAYS have to wait. I really hate when places say 15-20 minutes... then you wait 45... and after the 45 minute wait they sit you outside at 9pm when its 55 degrees outside and put you no where near the fire pit... (like it would really help anyway since the wind was blowing the heat in the opposite direction) Brrrr! what good do heaters 10 feet over your head do when its your toesies that are freezing off!? This last time was just another reason not to go here again... no bread was given or even offered until i asked about it (if it had been my first time i wouldn't have even know to ask for it!!!!)... and that was only after we received our drinks and needed refills... there were four of us (we were starving) so the bread didn't last long... I asked for a bread refill along with our third drink refill... and then we ordered... granted the food came pretty quickly but the appetizer came with the entree's...  There was hardly any sauce on the pizza... so while we were eating we asked for extra marinara sauce... my boyfriends sister was waiting for the sauce to eat her pizza... and our server just kept walking by that table not even looking to see the status of our meal... his sister sat there and watched us all eat while munching on fries, helpless while she waited for her marinara... finally our server came back after everyone else had already finished to take our plates. seemed like she didn't even care or apologize that she forgot it... my boyfriends sister was just sitting there with an entire plate of food while ours was all gone....  I just ended up telling her to give us the sauce to go...and she gave us this teeny tiny cup with no more then a tablespoon of sauce what a joke!  so my boyfriends sister watched us all eat... to get this sad amount of sauce?! it was barley enough to pour over one slice!!! The server was super inattentive, she would walk all around avoiding eye contact so we couldn't get her attention. I guess I'm the picky one... my boyfriend and his family are just happy to get food... but for me? when we spend 97 dollars of our hard earned money on a LUNCH for 4 people... i expect a little better.  the food is usually tasty and the restaurant is absolutely beautiful but this is the 4th time i have been treated like crap here. The worst is how expensive it is, I don't mind paying for an expensive dinner/lunch if i get great service... but we work close to minimum wage while paying our way through college... $100 lunch is an entire 10 hour shift for us!!!!  totally unacceptable..."
Nhan N.,"Oakland, CA",4,21,1,4.0,11/6/2013,"I came here with my girlfriend on a Saturday 11/2/13. We came in around 4:00 p.m. And it wasn't too crowded. I used to work at a restaurant so I know how hosting and seating arrangements should be. But I am taking a star off because I asked the host to place us where we can be a little bit more intimate and private, but he said he couldn't. We were seated next to another couple and placed near the bar area. Little awkward, but had to deal with it. The food was great and the service was lacking. Our water was filled only twice and we waited awhile to get it refilled. I am still a fan and will give this place a 4 star, because of the location."
Amanda C.,"Antioch, CA",1,5,1,1.0,2/28/2016,If I could give a negative star I would I want to start by saying we got there on sat night at 8 with a party of 7 and had to wait till 11 to be seated we called and tried to make reservations and were told we couldn't so after waiting all that time and were never comped anything we finally got seated outside in the cold food was horrible the service was okay I can't be mad at the server it wasn't there fault but the mangers were very rude when we complained to them about the wait we asked if we could me comped a free appetizer for the long wait and they said they couldn't do that they were totally rude then are buzzer never went off when we went in to check in table for the 3rd time they told us the table had been ready ???? No one called our name or came and got us overall food was horrible way to long of a wait the only reason we came there was for my bf birthday thinking it was going to be nice only to be very disappointed if you have a large group I would not recommend coming here !! We watched couples of 2 get told 5 min wait where we almost wait 3 hours to be seated :( we will never come back
S P.,"Vacaville, CA",2,35,,5.0,2/25/2015,I love coming here ! Great customer service great food . Love the atmosphere !! Steak Diane my favorite get a different cheesecake every time my favorite crazy Craig's carrot cake cheesecake !!
Adelisa L.,"Danville, CA",333,42,85,5.0,10/19/2013,I always get warm wheat bread at this location. It was great for lunch and the service was really friendly. My favorite meal to order is the miso salmon- so delicious!!
Steve R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",3,31,2,2.0,7/18/2016,"I have never been a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory as I find it very canned and over-done. The food while serviceable, seems to border on coming out of a big bucket with just enough alteration to make it appear hand-made. That notwithstanding, my frustration with CF begins well before the dinner. In celebration of a birthday and the need to get in an early dinner, we called for a reservation for 11 people at 5:00pm out on the patio (on a Thursday). We arrive at 5 pm and are told that 80% of our party needs to be before we can be seated but our table is ready. 5:10pm and all our party arrives. We let them know we are all here and they say it will be just moment. A moment turns into 25 mins and we still have not gotten seated. We ask the host to ""speed it up, lets go"" and he replies ""your server will be here in 2 mins to seat you, but not all your party was here at 5"". 2 mins turn into 10mins. At this point, the host essentially lied and more exasperating is; the patio is essentially empty with seats galore to chose from. Two members of our party go over to where one wait staff is trying to put the table together (oh wait so it wasn't ready?), at which point we begin putting the tables together with him and begin setting our own table. We sit down. You'd thought we just told them the earth was flat, because they had no idea what to do now. They weren't able to generate that goofy little computer seating receipt and the waiter was unable to follow the CF's inane seating policy. Why is it, they can take a reservation, but they actually can't execute on the reservation? The table wasn't set at 5:30pm let alone 5:00pm. This is CF's SOP though. Come in, tables vacant everywhere and wait for 10-15 minutes. In our case 45 mins for something that should be as easy as making Cheesecake. 5:00 reservation = table ready with 11 seats and flatware, napkins etc. Everyone in our party was disappointed with their very rookie, second-rate, bush-league attitude. The food was OK... it has gotten incredibly bland though and cafeteria-esque - I would move on from CF. There are many, many other restaurants in WC to choose from. Cheesecake Factory has become a run-down Factory of a by-gone era with shoddy service."
Rachel W.,"Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong",315,516,347,3.0,1/1/2011,"I've been here a few times and had some different experiences... when you have a reservation, and are seated on time and have a decent-sized group, they do an okay job. The appetizers are yummy, good portion size on everything, but nothing is too spectacular about the food. The desserts stand out a bit, but overall, food is expensive and the same as everything else out there that is a chain. Went for a girls night before crossing the street to see SATC 2 and had SUCH a fun waiter...wish I could remember his name...some adorable gay guy who called us all by character names and was great at refilling and ordering and recommending the many specialty drinks we kept throwing at it. And did not complain when we had to split the bill a million different weird ways, which goes a loooong way in my book. So that was a good experience. Have had a night at the bar there for a few drinks, crowded, but fun, efficient. Spent a lazy happy hour on the porch, it is a great location for people watching, and our server was very gracious about refilling wine and not minding that we didn't order any food at all! Love that. One random thing that really stands out to me is that there is a really slippery walk to the restroom! I always think I am going to fall and die there. With everyone watching. Yikes."
Raquel F.,"Antioch, CA",63,51,19,4.0,9/9/2013,"Note this is for the Walnut Creek location. I think out of all the Cheesecake Factory's I have tried, this is the best ambiance. They have an outdoor section with a fire place with couches. And on the other side they have the outdoor seating.  My family and I came here for Sunday brunch which was delicious. I got the French Toast Napolean... which was AMAZING... french toast with powdered sugar, strawberries and walnuts. The Mr. got the Green Chilaquiles with Carnitas and Eggs. I never tried it before and I must saw I was ready to grab my honey's plate! My daughter got Kids' Brunch. She loved it, comes with the ideal brunch for kids... fruit, pancakes, and bacon. I really enjoyed this cheesecake factory!!"
Debbie C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",189,769,294,3.0,6/29/2013,"First time coming to the Cheesecake Factory since moving to the WC. We came here because we knew they had a giant outdoor seating area. The wait was pretty ridiculous though...our 20 minute wait turned into 45 minutes on a Friday night. I can't complain because we enjoyed some margaritas in their outdoor waiting area. The food is what you expect from any Cheesecake Factory, it's been probably 5 years since my last visit to a Cheesecake Factory so I was happy to see they had a Skinnylicious menu. Also a plus that they are extremely kid friendly."
Scott O.,"Williamsburg, VA",2,15,,1.0,10/6/2013,"First visit here they told me 35 mins wait and we left after 60.  Second visit we waited 45 mins then another 45 for food. When it came the mashed potatoes had hard uncooked potato in them and a pasta dish had hard pasta. That explains the delay - the kitchen got behind and had to rush food out before it was ready.  I spoke to the manager who gave me his card and offered a discount on my next visit but nothing for the poor quality food we received this night.  Third visit.. Nah, won't be a third. This is a poorly run restaurant."
Tamara E.,"Walnut Creek, CA",56,2,,1.0,2/16/2015,"I went here for my cousins birthday last night and we had horrible service from beginning to end! I've noticed the last couple times I've been here, the service has tremendously gone down hill. Honestly I don't even know why I go back.  First, we were being seated to our table and the hostess realized that our table had been given to someone else so we had to wait another 10 min for the first available table. Next, we were seated and our table for 4 was missing a chair and had no place settings in which we had to ask for. Our sever came over and took our drink order and at that time we were figuring out what appetizers we wanted to get and because we were taking too long to decide he decided to leave us to let us further decide and get our drink orders. (20 min later)  So he comes back with our drinks and we decide to put in our dinner order with the appetizer because we didn't want to wait any longer to eat. So one of our appetizers comes out. My mom specifically ordered salmon rolls and they brought out shrimp rolls. She is allergic to shellfish. Thank god she didn't bite into it. Our entree maybe came out in  another 20-25 after that. Our server never came to check on us to see how our food was. He was practically non existent all night. Two couples had ate and gone next to us before we were even presented with our meal. I can go on and on. I was so livid I went to talk to the manager and was offered free cheesecake or an entree taken off my bill. The manager and waiter argued their points instead of just apologizing and consoling us. When they came out to sing happy birthday to my cousin they didn't even bring her a spoon for her sundae. Until the very end the waiter kept bringing back the check without running my step dad's card so we had to send the check back 3 times to settle the bill. We spent 2 hours in a restaurant mostly sitting and waiting. This was beyond ridiculous! At least the food was good. I understand restaurants can be busy but there is no excuse for not attending to your guests and dropping the ball. It will be a long time before I return to this restaurant."
Steven D.,"Concord, CA",11,3,,1.0,8/13/2015,"If I could post a review without giving a star, I would.  We came here to celebrate my son's 21st birthday, arrived at 6:30 on a Thursday evening.  Front desk staff told us the wait would be about an hour and 45 minutes.  We decided to wait - bad decision.      Despite being told that our table was ready (they were waiting for the prior party to leave), we still were waiting at 9:00.  After repeated complaints to the front desk staff without response, we finally sought out the manager.  He had a lukewarm at best response, and seemed unaware that we had been waiting over 2.5 hours.  Finally we were seated at 9:15.  During our wait, we had to be proactive in asking about the status of our table, we offered suggestions to split our group to two tables, had to ask for water for my 85 year old in-laws, and finally had to get their manager involved.  We asked for menus while waiting, so we could save time while finally seated.  Never were offered any of these suggestions by the staff.  Once seated at 9:15, we told the waiter that we're ready to order.  It's now 9:30, and he hasn't returned to take our order.  I'd write a review about their food, but God only knows when that will be here.  I don't write many reviews, and have only submitted positive reviews when I do write one.  I asked the manager for his card, finally brought one back after 20 minutes.  He didn't have his business cards on him.  His name is Paul McDaniel.  Said he would assist with out table.  Brought one glass of water, then disappeared.  I strongly advise - avoid this place.  Poor and seemingly indifferent service."
Natalie S.,"Oakland, CA",11,34,1,4.0,9/25/2013,"I have always been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory. I have been dining there for years now. What I especially like about The Cheesecake Factory is their free freshly baked wheat bread, large menu to fit anyone's taste, specialty alcoholic beverages, large tasty portions and of course their wonderful assortment of cheesecakes. My all time favorite cheesecake is Chris's Outrageous cheesecake...this flavor is to die for. So sinfully delicious.  I usually go to the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco in the Union Square area. I like it because its at the top of Macy's, which is my favorite department store. I have only been to the Walnut Creek location once and it is decorated the same inside as the one in SF.  For a chain restaurant, I have never been disappointed with The Cheesecake Factory. I never had a meal on their menu that I did not like. I try to order something different each time I go. The only downside is that their food is high in calories, carbs and fat. I think that is why they do not display how many calories are in each item on their menu. For this reason, I only occasionally eat at The Cheesecake Factory. An average of 3 times per year. Their prices are not cheap but not expensive either. Everything in my opinion is reasonable priced. In addtion, I have always been satisfied with the service."
Yasmin D.,"Antioch, CA",22,28,18,5.0,9/5/2014,"My oh my, this is so beautiful its unreal. The environment is comfortable and the cheesecake is obviously awesome! Conveniently located next to the theatre and barns and nobles. Definitely the place to go."
