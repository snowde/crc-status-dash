Ashley N.,"Novato, CA",88,17,1,1.0,8/31/2012,"Nice outdoor patio where we sat that had a nice fire pit and great architecture and design. So everything was nice to look at. The food was okay, but definitely not worth the amount I paid.  That being said here comes the important information. First of all, our waiter was very demanding. He did not know the words please or thank you. He would say ""you better show me your I.D."" or ""give me your cup."" That's minus points for unprofessional and rude customer service. He also got some of our orders wrong. One person in our party didn't get her meal and had to reorder. My boyfriend didn't get his drinks that he ordered and also had to reorder. Secondly, we ordered mimosas and they brought us a bottle of champagne and two plastic cups of fresh squeezed orange juice (including all the pulp). They expected us to pour these big plastic cups of orange juice into slender champagne glasses. WTF? They said they didn't own any carafes or pitchers. The server tried to be considerate and pour the glasses for us, only to spill half of the orange juice in the plants near our seating area.  Lastly, we had a large group and were billed automatic gratuity which was understandable. So, we split the bill between our group. Some paid with cash and some paid with credit card. When the people who paid with credit card got their individual receipts to sign, the receipt had a tip amount already printed. BUT why would we pay tip if gratuity was already included in our bill?????? So we crossed out that extra tip that was printed on our receipts and wrote the amount we intended to pay. A few days later I check my credit card statement and they charged me that extra tip that I had crossed out!! (Extra tip that the server definitely did not deserve). Everyone in our group that used a credit card were charged extra tip as well. I disputed the charge and the credit card company resolved it.  But that was the last straw. You can screw up my food, spill my drinks, but you never mess with my money! haha SO BEWARE OF EXTRA CHARGES."
Jana A.,"Alamo, CA",1525,413,384,2.0,1/3/2013,"Unbelievably large menu, cheaper prices and nice decor. Went there last night for the first time, asked for steak ""Diane"" with no onions but got plate full of onions. I ended up taking them out myself... server apologized and blamed it on the kitchen. She also brought a check without asking if we would like to have something else. It was all very quick... I felt like this place has cheaper prices and you get what you pay for. I would come back for drinks but not food. I like more quality rather than quantity...  Big portions for those who like that..."
Stacy C.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",11,143,49,2.0,9/26/2012,"So, I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory. Everyone told me that I should, but it seemed too trendy and overpriced for me. Last night I finally gave in and went... and found that it was too trendy and overpriced for me, with the addition of staff making everything totally awkward. There were four of us. We were starving. We ordered three appetizers. Waiter comes back about 15 minutes later to take our order (4 dinner salads, a burger, 2 filets, and a ""new chicken dish you'll love"").  He explains how he's new here and that the last table he had was AWFUL. ""They wanted everything SPECIAL, and ugh, they were GREEK, too."" Then he asked if we wanted refills on our drinks, and made us chug the remaining soda in our glasses. Really. Complete with the ""Chug! Chug! Chug!"" chanting, and ""Come on, you can do better than that!"" encouragement. I am totally serious. Server comes over 10 minutes later with our salads.  Wait... our salads? Shouldn't our apps come first? Hmmm. I guess the kitchen must be backed up. The salad was meh. Mixed greens (waiter said it would be baby lettuce) that were wilted, bitter, and contained one leaf that I am sure came from a philodendron. (But their ranch dressing is awesome. Enough of it made me forget about the icky greens.) So, 10 minutes after we finished our salads, our entrees came out. Wait... our entrees? Shouldn't our apps come first? We look at the waiter and ask where our apps are. Man... if I could bottle the look of horror on his face, I would make gazillions around Halloween. He says, ""Uh, your appet... oh God. Oh God! That is totally my fault. I am so sorry. I forgot them."" Forgot them at the counter? No... forgot to turn in the ticket. Dude. You have ONE job to do. And it isn't a hard job... you ask people what they want to eat, you tell the cooks what the people want to eat, and you bring the people what they want to eat after the cook has cooked it. And shit, at Cheesecake Factory the waiter doesn't even have to bring out the food! So, yeah. No apps for us. Our entrees? Overpriced and unspectacular. The burger was undercooked, the filets were overcooked, the chicken dish was missing ingredients. It would have been a fine meal if it was half the price. The manager came over when we were 2/3 through with our meals and asked if we'd like our appetizers. I really had to tell him that they were supposed to be APPETIZERS, not DESSERTS. To top it off, the manager offered us each free cheesecake to make up for his waiter's incompetence, so we each ordered a slice to go. Then the tab comes, and he had only comp'ed 2 slices. Great, add another $15 to the ridiculously overpriced meal. Awesome."
Dustin M.,"Brentwood, CA",10,44,14,5.0,11/1/2010,"Why did I not come here sooner??!! This place is the best. I've always had great service, the food is delicious, huge portions, and you can't leave without getting a slice of the best cheesecake EVER!  My dish of choice- Chicken Belaggio."
Deniel P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",21,25,,5.0,11/26/2014,"I went in there Tuesday evening around 5ish for there happy hour. The girl who served me was Irene. I wasn't planning to write a review for the restaurant but her customer service was so good that I couldn't help myself. She was very friendly and sweet. She made sure all my food was warm and up to standard. I go there a lot, however I never found their customer service too great (food however is always delish). Irene was outstanding!!!!"
Aimee P.,"East Bay, CA",55,40,102,3.0,8/16/2012,"Love this place because of their cheesecakes and location. But service isn't up to the standards that I know Cheesecake factory to be... My friend and I came here for lunch, it was around 2:30, service was slow and our waiter didn't even come back to check up on us; even though he kept passing by our  table. If you want to sit outside, watch out for the birds.. they fly pretty low and try to eat up crumbs from the ground, plus they poop everywhere.  The food was good (if only I had water to help wash it down).  The ambiance is nice.  The service however, no bueno. Honestly, I prefer The Cheesecake Factory in SF, no matter how busy, service is always consistent, and I feel like I've been taken care of when I leave."
Jay S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,38,1,4.0,11/18/2015,"Always love Cheesecake Factory, great service and food. Our only complaint is we were there with our 11 month old granddaughter and there are no changing tables in the rest rooms. Made for a difficult diaper change."
Gef J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,56,66,5.0,1/5/2013,"I have never had anything but great food, service, and good experiences. One of the most beautiful Cheesecake Factory Restaurants."
Annimai T.,"Sacramento, CA",298,137,540,5.0,12/11/2012,Love their happy hour menu!!!   Warm crab and artichokes dip AND Avocado Eggrolls......droolsssssss... sooo good!!  Must try!!
Annette M.,"Concord, CA",3,19,,1.0,8/19/2014,"What a difference two years make, went back for my daughters 17th birthday. We were texted when our table was ready, we were then told to stand to the side our table would be ready soon.....twenty minutes later we were seated! Next out birthday girl ordered the Colette steak asked for it to be cooked medium, it arrived WELL DONE. The manager came over to apologies and someone clearing a table spilled water all over the floor and got our feet all wet. Me and my family will NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS CHEESECAKE FACTORY,"
Steve N.,"Brentwood, CA",199,453,403,3.0,7/8/2012,"Crowded and full priced!  Yay!   How can 3 dudes spend $200 at one sitting?  Before the tip?  Stay for a while, order 3 appetizers, 3 dinners, 9 beers, 2 slices of cheese cake, and a 7"" cake to go.  That's how!  Of course, the food is descent and the portions are filling.  The drinks are always FULL price.  Next round of waters is on me!   Wait.  Seriously,  wait.  Every time, you must wait.  Hang on a sec.  Ok, wait.  10 minutes or 2 hours, you will wait. If you sit at the front patio, people watching is free.  Try it. Will I go back?  Probably.  Chicken Piccata and I'm good.  One more round of waters, please.  Wait.  Ok, thanks."
A Y.,"Concord, CA",0,13,,1.0,12/4/2014,"If I could give zero stars I would.  This place has awful service.  My group of four was seated.  Never recieved menus.  We had to go up to the hostess station just to get a menu.  After 30 minutes of absolutely no service,  we decided to leave.  This was on a Thursday. Pathetic."
D C.,"San Francisco, CA",15,308,177,2.0,12/3/2012,"Ate here two Sundays ago.  We were a bit surprised about the long wait, given it was a Sunday night.  After we were seated, we saw rows and rows of empty tables in the back, so it must be that they were short staffed.   So the good: Thai lettuce wrap. Turkey burger The bad: Pina Colada had no alcohol that I could detect. Moroccan chicken dinner. Very dry and not enjoyable. Waitress brought a glass of water to the table and the glass was dirty and the water had little bits of debris (maybe leftover food??) floating around in it.  I noticed it a few minutes later and grabbed a waiter and showed him the glass.  He apologized and brought us a fresh water, but that got me thinking about all the things that you don't catch when they serve you. We've enjoyed this restaurant for several years, even with the noise and the wait to get a table...but we may reconsider given this last meal."
Valerie L.,"New York, NY",165,324,8,3.0,3/29/2013,"My family and I come here whenever we want to just have a chill time/cheap and delicious meal. Three stars because it's a cheap, good quality food, HUGE portions, beautiful outdoor patio and good service. A gazillion paged menu (appetizers, pastas, burgers, fish, steaks) Endless cheesecake flavors. That being said, it's a chain restaurant, so don't expect any of the dishes to be mind-blowing or out of this world delicious or anything."
Greg F.,"Hayward, CA",294,781,513,3.0,3/27/2013,Cheesecake factory... you always know what to expect.
Khaled A.,"Castro Valley, CA",6,109,22,4.0,11/21/2012,"I haven't been here for a while, but this has to be the most beautiful cheesecake factory in the East Bay. It's expensive, but what do you expect, it's in the center of the booming downtown walnut creek.   Overall, I'm more of a fan of the ambiance, rather than the food. The food is o.k, but I like the ambiance, especially the outdoor seating, I just like to relax out there and watch people walk by. Food: 3 Ambiance 5 Average=4"
Yvonne L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",106,43,52,2.0,5/5/2014,The food was pretty good but almost everytime i come here a waitress will almost bring my husbands food 1st and my food will be brought out much later when my husband is almost done with his meal. Just wondering if the waitresses do that to most good looking men? Its like hello there?!?! Im over here & where is my food?!?! I wished i could have tipped them of how i felt. Like 10 pennys. That was just soo messed up. I felt i was invisible to the waitresses & thats wat sucks. :(
Mike R.,"Martinez, CA",44,2,,5.0,7/31/2014,"Great food great servers, you gotta love the ambiance and a dog friendly patio! Cheesecake anyone?"
Kim B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",11,18,,5.0,2/11/2015,"Went there yesterday with a friend.  The host was courteous and personable.  The waiter was extremely helpful, polite and good at his job.  The burgers were fantastic.  All over a pleasant dining experience. Kim B."
Jen D.,"Vacaville, CA",31,25,92,2.0,6/16/2014,"Made reservations here TWO months ago for 18 people for dinner after my elopement on Friday. I even called to confirm my reservations THE DAY BEFORE. I was running late from San Fransisco but people from my party were checking in to grab our table on time. THEY TOLD US WE DIDNT HAVE A RESERVATION. ARE YOU PEOPLE KIDDING ME? Then we were told if we weren't ALL there by 530 they will be giving away our table that they didn't have reserved for us? UM OK. WAY TO NOT ACCOMMODATE YOUR GUESTS WHO ARE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY WITH A BiG PARTY. Needless to say I was fuming. Luckily we had AWESOME service and good food, but I will not be returning to this location because they obviously have poor planning. Why don't you just stop taking reservations to begin with, I shouldn't have had to stress on my wedding day because they didn't have their act together. Very DISAPPOINTED in this poor service."
