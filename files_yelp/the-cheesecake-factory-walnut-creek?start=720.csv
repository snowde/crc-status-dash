Katy P.,"Concord, CA",3,12,2,3.0,5/27/2014,"Normally, I'd give this place 4 stars, but only 3 for my last experience. I went on a Saturday with a group of girlfriends. We got a table immediately, but as always, the volume of noise was astounding. Our waiter went on break after drinks were ordered but before food. The waiter who spelled him seemed really tense and serious. The food was just meh. My omelette was overrun with mushroom juice, the burger patties were underseasoned, while simultaneously have too much sauce on the bun. Add to that balsamic vinagrette on a cobb salad, and it was just not the delicious food I'm used to."
Lisa H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",115,786,173,2.0,7/28/2010,"I've been to this location before, but last night I really did not enjoy myself.  I was there with my grandparents, who eat a lot slower than me, so I was expecting to be there a while, but the whole dinner was very rushed.   The waitress was constantly bombarding us, clearing plates before we were finished, offering to wrap up left overs while we still eating and obviously not finished....making the whole dinner uncomfortable and not enjoyable.  I spoke this over with some of my coworkers and they said that they have had similar experiences of being rushed.  I could understand being rushed on a big money night like Friday or Saturday, but I was there on a Tuesday, and so there was really no need to basically clear us out.  Overall the food is pretty good here, but if the new attitude here is to flip tables as quickly as possible, I won't be coming back."
Jo M.,"Fairfield, CA",0,5,4,1.0,11/9/2014,"Good food. Went her for Veterans Day weekend.  I'm not looking for a handout or anything but not even a 5% discount? No nothing, no recognition at all for veterans.  Even a simple "" sorry, we have no specials, but we appreciate your service!"" would have sufficed.  Although the food was good, will probably not return due to this reason, as I am a veteran and so is my wife, and we both love our country and support our troops!"
Tami M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",6,3,,5.0,12/14/2014,The Cheesecake Factory in walnut creek it's got to be the best restaurant in Walnut Creek
C T.,"Alameda, CA",1,35,7,4.0,11/12/2012,"I have to say, I've been to the Cheesecake Factory over in SF and Pleasanton, and I believe this has to be the best one I've been due to location, proximity to parking, wait time, service, and overall experience.  I came here with two of my girlfriends on a Sunday afternoon (more close to dinner time, but a little before). I don't know if maybe we made it right before dinner, but I have never been to a Cheesecake Factory where I had did not need to wait. We were seated right away.  A waiter greeted us right away and came back to check on us frequently while we waited for our final guest to come. Our food came right away. I was satisfied with my spaghetti or pasta dish, I can't really remember. But, I've never tried their red velvet cheesecake, and LADIES and GENTLEMEN if you love red velvet, you will love red velvet cheesecake here. All three of us shared one slice and we had multiple bites, but we still couldn't finish it. It was a huge slice. I love it. Now, everytime when one of my girlfriends suggest Cheesecake Factory, I won't frown about how long I would have to wait!"
Conrad B.,"Piedmont, Oakland, CA",94,314,,3.0,12/19/2012,"Will a review of Cheesecake Factory really help? Well, wisdom in crowds, OK fine Malcolm Gladwell... My personal recommendations: - Avocado Egg Rolls - Split whatever main you order with your friend - Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple Cheesecake As for the CF specifically, the location is great, with three parking garages within half a block (of course, go on Friday night and all three of them will be full). Service is good, you'll usually have to wait, you know, pretty standard CF."
Courtney N.,"San Francisco, CA",36,89,,1.0,5/6/2012,"I just do not understand the appeal of eating at Cheesecake Factory. Paying $20 an entree does not buy you class. The portions are obscenely large, the food is mediocre chain-food at best, the drinks are Big Gulp sized high-fructose syrups with a drop of alcohol, and there are far superior restaurants all over Walnut Creek. This place is an absolute scourge and an embarrassing emblem of suburban excess, conformity, and lack of originality.  Please. Get out. Of my city."
Terrence S.,"Oakland, CA",8,21,11,2.0,9/9/2014,"I have gone to The Cheesecake Factory for many years, and have always loved them. They have gone down over the years though. Recently, however, we had to walk out before our waiter even appeared. Everything was fine until the hostess seated us at our table. Most of the table was very wet. It had likely been wiped with a cloth that was too wet. As I looked more, I could see bits of wet food on the table also. I took my cloth napkin and attempted to dry the table. Looking at the napkin really revealed how gross the table was. We left. Obviously, the table should have been properly cleaned to begin with, but it is also disappointing that the hostess did not even look to check that she was seating us at a decent table. The chain is far from what it used to be. They might not be getting any more of my business."
Complex i.,"Cupertino, CA",3,14,,3.0,2/12/2015,"I like the food, the cheesecake was great, the drinks are watered down, i'll give it a 6.5 out of 10 - you would have gotten an 8 if my mash potatoes didn't have a whole hard half cooked potato with mashed potatoes, LOL."
Panda X.,"Richmond, CA",3,19,23,5.0,12/20/2012,"Our party of 3 went to our annual Christmas lunch. We arrived at 11:30 am and were seated right away. Coincidentally in the same table as two years ago...Our waiter Miguel was really nice and very attentive. We ordered a grilled eggplant sandwich with sweet potato fried, chicken teriyaki with brown rice, and chicken and shrimp gumbo. We were all very satisfied with our meals they were very nicely paltered and they were all delicious! For desert we got a Tiramisu cheesecake and Carrot cheesecake. We also had coffee... Very hot and strong. Overall we had a great experience."
Tara S.,"Gilford, NH",53,108,1,3.0,12/3/2012,This Cheesecake Factory is the Las Vegas dining establishment of Walnut Creek. See for yourself and indulge in the chocolate coconut cheesecake- you will crave it days later.
Mahvash K.,"San Diego, CA",16,47,2,1.0,7/29/2015,"went to cheesecake in walnut creek and had the nachos and my friend had the renees special...it was a lot of food, but really nothing to write home about. pretty standard food and not worth it. i am also SUPER disappointed they changed my favorite Oreo cheesecake into some complex mess :( It tastes nothing like it used to, the crust is no longer the crunchy oreo cookie and they have wayyyyy too much chocolate on it. it is so dense and sugary...don't know why they messed with perfection."
T F.,"Bluffton, SC",27,53,105,5.0,7/29/2014,This was a fantastic  I had the gumbo.  Wow enough for 2 meals.  It was great service at the bar.   I was never impressed before but I love this one.  Must go
Gary E.,"Fairfield, CA",2735,385,1414,4.0,3/14/2010,"All stuffed and nowhere to go we needed a workout... After an excruciating 3-4 blocks we ended up at The Cheesecake Factory...  Got a pager and waited. Got lucky and found a spot on the outside patio and ordered cheesecake by the slice. My whipped creamed mocha, along with the fire and heat lamps kept me nice and warm. The Tiramisu Cheesecake prompted me to walk another five blocks. Pager goes off, handed it off to a lucky family with a party of three equaled big smiles (a good deed for the day)... We had such a great time... Thanks Rod D.! ( )"
Edward C.,"Carson City, NV",0,26,,5.0,5/9/2012,Cheesecake Factory  delicious food and elegant atmosphere in Walnut Creek. The menu is huge from breakfast to dinner and small plates and snacks. The service was fantastic and they have some of the best hamburgers and french fries. The assorted salads are great.   The cheese cake Factory has a very elegant decor that you will always find something new to see. The music is kept at a very nice level. If you enjoy good food and having a good time this is a place to see and try the food too.
Ariel K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,44,41,4.0,1/1/2014,"Shrimp scampi was delicious! But it was ridiculously expensive $20!!! The cheesecake is really good, maybe a bit too sugary. I've tried the fresh banana one and the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut one. But it's small compared to the price. $8.17 with tax for one slice of cheesecake is too pricey for a student like me! But if you have money, then go for the place, because it's pretty good :)"
Angel S.,"San Francisco, CA",12,15,,5.0,7/23/2013,"I love this place , their food, their services everything is amazing. Plus, their cheese cake was really the best cheese cake i ever had."
David R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",20,18,7,3.0,10/14/2014,Just fine like any other cheesecake. And actually that's what it really makes it special. Same food same taste everywhere you go. But wish they take reservations
Marc M.,"Redwood City, CA",537,188,,4.0,9/13/2014,"After a long Bart delay this place hit the spot. The restaurant was crowded, but we were able to secure seating quickly.  Our server Taylor took really good care of us and checked in regularly to ensure we were satisfied with things. For dinner we had: Cashew Chicken Salad Spaghetti and Meatballs Drinks: Mojito  Mai Tai Good food! Though its a long way from my place I will definitely try to visit again when I'm in the area."
Mihaela P.,"Berkeley, CA",4,32,23,3.0,9/10/2015,"Very unsatisfied with our server, H*****h. My boyfriend and I came here on a Thursday night and the restaurant was relatively empty. Her section only had 2 tables, so we were expecting some fast service. Unfortunately, it took over 15 minutes to get water to the table and a ridiculous amount of time for her to come back and take our order. Maybe she was having an off day or something, I'm not sure. Overall, great food but bad experience."
