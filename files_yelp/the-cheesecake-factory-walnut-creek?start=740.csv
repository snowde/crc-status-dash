Hayder A.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",2,37,43,3.0,9/9/2014,"The food was ok, I ordered Jamaican Black Pepper With Chicken And Shrimp, it was very sweet that I couldn't finish the extras, however, the ambience was nice and the restaurant decoration feels kinda luxury, we were 4 and we ordered 4 main courses with water we paid 80$"
Doug G.,"Kodak, TN",10,98,,2.0,3/30/2014,"Ok... I love The Cheesecake Factory and have been to many through out the country.  It was my birthday and I thought I would give the one in WC a try,  My Mother and Father In-law where in town so this seemed like a good choice for dinner.             Let me start by saying the food was outstanding.  The problem was with service... We orders three beers, coke and an appetizer first.  The appetizer got to the table and was half eaten before the drinks arrived.  Now appetizer is completely eaten and drink half gone before our waiter comes to get our order for our entrées.  Our entrees arrive in timely order carried by two ""food runners"" and auctioned off at the table.  you know how it goes "" who had the pasta who had the salad""  and of course the guys were served first. Man I hate that, it is so easy to know who had what and how to serve food in a nice restaurant.  The entrée was outstanding,,, very good... Now we are done eating and waiting for our server.........and waiting....... He gets there and we order some cheesecake to go, because we have been there over 2 hours now, and a we need half a pizza boxed to take home.  We got the pizza back and then waited..... and waited....waited some more... Finally we get cheesecake and check. Hey, at least they were quick about taking our money.  Ok... to give the waiter some credit he was triple sat and he was running his behind off.  So you have a host problem...  No a management problem...because we never did see a manager.... I will not be going back there!!!!!"
joan b.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,115,,5.0,12/24/2014,"It seems that most people are reluctant to give this place five stars. I have only been to this place a few times. I have eaten at others in other parts of the state a few times also. It is a place I go to for a special occasion with family or friends as a treat or special occasion. I always enjoy it. The waiters work hard and aim to please. The menu items I have chosen and shared have been lovely. Of course, it is very kid-friendly, and I am as entranced with the decor as the children who accompany us on the special occasions."

Andy L.,"Oakland, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/9/2014,"Never come here,  for any type of food besides pasta,  their twists on Asian cuisines are horrible.  I ordered the chicken Katsu and it's atrocious,  not saying all the dishes on the menu is deliberately bad,  but ordering something like chicken Katsu is strongly NOT recommended."
Lorena L.,"San Francisco, CA",216,40,176,5.0,4/25/2012,"Cheesecake Factory really came through for me like always but specially on my boyfriends birthday. The restaurant that we originally planned on having a birthday brunch cancelled 2 days before the event so needless to say I was stressed out because I had 20 people confirmed for brunch.  Paul the Manager at Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek took our reservation of 20 people. The day of the event, both our servers were very nice and also organized separate tabs for everyone. Of course, food and drinks are always amazing there. Everyone was so happy with the service and we got to celebrate the birthday with no problem."
Princess D.,"Alameda, CA",46,16,2,5.0,9/29/2014,I love the Cheesecake Factory. But tbh this is the best location so far I've been to. The one in sf has a beautiful view but in my opinion this location is the one I'll be going to. Beautiful location and great atmosphere.
A C.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,61,,4.0,5/20/2015,"Wednesday night and this place was busy but we were seated fairly quickly. We were first taken to this very small table for 2 that was really meant to be pushed together with an identical table to seat 4. We felt really awkward & asked to grab a seat at the bar. When your waitress can only take your order from BEHIND you...that should tell you something there. The tables were so close together they could not take our order or drop anything off on the side. It all came from the back. Long story short, we are at our new seat and everything from there is great. Service was a little slow but definitley not lacking in customer service. Everyone was nice. We grabbed some appetizers and cheesecake. A little pricey, $45(not including tip) for 2 appetizers, 2 slices of cheesecke and 2 fountain sodas. Nonetheless it was good."
Hayat D.,"West Oakland, Oakland, CA",0,5,1,5.0,9/27/2015,"WOOW this place is amazing, the food and desserts were perfection. The service was beyond excellent, didn't have to wait long and our waiter Timothy did a superb job. Thank you for the excellent service"
Danna C.,"Landenberg, PA",110,427,337,2.0,12/1/2010,"Went here today for a work holiday party. We had about a dozen items to choose from. I was torn between about 8 of them. I asked the waitress for her suggestion, and she suggested the portabella mushroom burger. It was good, not great. We had a choice of vanilla bean or strawberry cheesecake. I went with the vanilla bean. It was also good but not great."
Ashley F.,"San Francisco, CA",111,58,19,5.0,5/28/2014,"I love this place!! Even though its a chain, I'm never disappointed with the food. The passion iced tea is amazing! Just came here Monday and ordered the buffalo blasts, huuuuge portions! Very tasty. I tried the eggplant and roasted red pepper sandwich. Oh my god, it was amazing!! I'm always scared to venture out and try new things cause i don't wanna be disappointed but i did and it was awesome!"
Alexandra K.,"Mountain View, CA",134,22,,3.0,10/7/2012,"My man and I came here for my birthday last Monday, as his parents were nice enough to give us a generous giftcard for here.  The architecture is astounding and it really is a beautiful restaurant. We had to wait a few minutes but that was no big deal. Very friendly hostess and staff overall.  Our waiter, Trevor, was also great.  We ordered the crab & spinach dip as an appetizer, I got the herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes, and sauteed spinach instead of the asparagus. The boy got the jumbo shrimp/steak diane combo. Now here's the BAD PART....they forgot our appetizer! We waited at least 30 minutes (which is a long time, but considering it was my bday and I was with my love, I just enjoyed being able to spend some time with him) to get our entrees, and when Trevor brought us our dishes I asked about the crab & artichoke dip. He apologized and took it off of our bill, since we didn't want it anymore.  Another NOT SO GREAT thing is that before we ordered our food, we ordered piña coladas. They cost $10 each which is fine, but they had barely ANY alcohol in it! I drank my entire one on an empty stomach and didn't even catch the slightest buzz! Oh well. It still tasted great.  Our entrees were delicious. Very decadent and filling, even my bottomless pit boyfriend had to take some home for later. Even the next day the leftovers were great.  When we asked for our check, Trevor was nice enough to get us a slice of complementary cheesecake, since they forgot our appetizer. We got the dark chocolate/coconut cake and it was DELISH.  After we paid with the giftcard and cash, we waited to get our change back but never did. We were going to leave him the rest of the change as a generous tip anyways, so we didn't really think anything of it, but come on, give us our change.  I'll probably be coming back here at some point. The food was really flippin' good."
Krissy A.,"Yountville, CA",4,2,,5.0,10/27/2014,"This has been my favorite place to eat since I first came here 5 years ago. Especially this location. Any other location has had top notch service as well but I attend this one more often. From great bread to start you out to the Pasta Da Vinci,this place is affordable,has a family friendly atmosphere and the best food and desserts! Staff is knowledgeable,kind,and always have a smile!"
Rachelle R.,"Concord, CA",0,19,2,2.0,12/5/2014,"My two friends and I dined at Cheesecake Factory tonight in honor of my friend's birthday. We arrived there around 7:20 and told the guy at the front desk that we would sit either inside or the patio. A few minutes later we noticed a table open in the patio area and mentioned to the same guy at the front that we would rather sit outside. He explained that we were next in line and that we would be called shortly. About 15-20 minutes later we received the text that a table was ready. We waited for about 5-7 minutes for the three-four young people at the front to stop chatting with each other and seat us. We were in the process of being led to our seats inside when I mentioned that we were waiting for seating outside. The girl said the wait would be another 5-20 minutes. At this point all three of us felt that we had waited enough. The manager (Mike) overheard us complaining and came over. He said that there had been a mis-communication as the guy upfront thought that we had asked for seating inside. I explained I had informed the person upfront that we wanted patio seating and that he was aware of this. The manager walked away and apparently rolled his eyes. We took the inside seating after a 40 min wait.  I was upset at that point because the manager did not apologize or offer us a free drink or dessert. The customer service from the server was excellent; the manager definitely needs some training. After telling our server that we expected a free dessert at least for the birthday girl, she received an extremely small slice of cake. We asked if this was the regular size and the server looked really uncomfortable and didn't reply. Altogether the experience was great because I was in good company. The food and drinks were great. Mike sucked. The end."
Al C.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",96,325,90,3.0,10/24/2010,"Came here for lunch one day.  Seems about on par with every other Cheesecake Factory that I've been to: decent food, OK prices, pretty good service.  The good thing about this particular location was that it was pretty dead during lunch and we were able to get seated quickly. The salmon salad I had was OK.  I was expecting a warm, grilled salmon fillet next to a plate of greens, but got a dead cold fillet with a bunch of green stuff mashed on top.  Guess I should have read the description a bit more before ordering.  I do have to say that it wasn't bad for what it was.  The portion was a healthy size, so overall, quite a success. Will probably come back here one day soon, but have no qualms about it."
Mark C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",20,62,43,4.0,5/13/2014,Food is always solid and good. Reliable. I tried the chicken marsala and it was very good. Chicken cooked well and the bow tie pasta was perfect (not over cooked). Definitely save room for a cheesecake for dessert!
Janael F.,"Antioch, CA",68,22,16,5.0,5/13/2014,The waiter's were very nice I like the food as I always had portions were big I couldn't even finish but that's good because I like left overs and pumpernickel bread! Food tasted fresh and seating only took a few minutes tables were clean and comfortable I'm definitely going back to this cheese cake factory location.
Jess M.,"Portland, OR",7,35,,4.0,7/23/2014,First time here it was very good. I love the chicken letuce wrap that was the best dish. I had the burger which is ok but the stand out dish was the wrap will definately come back!!!
Jason R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",251,64,,4.0,6/11/2014,"You been to one Cheescake Factory you've been to them all. Really. That being said their food is good. It's the perfect restaurant when my wife and I can't decide what to go get because she can have Mexican and I can have Italian, or a burger or a steak or the list goes on and on. their menu is more like a book and honestly I've never ordered the cheesecake because I've been stuffed by my entree. My recommendation is to split a salad and entree with someone and you may have a sliver of space for the cheesecake (which looks amazing)."
Analisa S.,"Petaluma, CA",297,666,7,4.0,3/7/2012,"OKay Im usually not a chain fan, but when your menu choices are a novel I can't help but go (and for some reason, my relatives always like to give me gift certificates to the Cheesecake Factory). The one in Walnut creek has the best ambiance. Its HUGE and the outdoor seating is really nice with the fire pit. There's a wait, but it doesn't feel nearly as crammed as the ones in SF or San Jose, mainly because its so spacious. Cheesecake Factory satisfies any cravings I have for deep-fried food (which happens often). The Caramel Chicken is delicious, but their Buffalo Blasts are what I'd go back for (actually, I'll go back for the Caramel Chicken too). The Buffalo Blasts are Chicken, Cheese and Spicy Buffalo Sauce all Stuffed in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Yum. I'll be back after my birthday and Christmas, when I have hundreds of dollars in gift certificates again. Hey, its better than getting Chili's gift certificates. At least Cheesecake Factory is chain food I can enjoy."
