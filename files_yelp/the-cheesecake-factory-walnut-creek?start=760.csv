Stephanie S.,"Brentwood, CA",456,251,279,3.0,2/7/2012,"As most of you know, the Cheesecake Factory is located in beautiful downtown Walnut Creek. Across the street from Century 14 Downtown Walnut Creek (one of my favorites). Less than 1 block down from the parking garage... which offers free parking (up to 4hrs, I believe).  When you walk up, you pass by the outdoor seating on either side of the walkway (one side for dining, the other for waiting). A fire pit in each seating area. I've asked to be seated outdoors on numerous occasions. I believe the wait time is less for the outdoors seating, but I could be wrong. Either way, I find it preferable to sitting inside where it can get extremely loud. Last night was my most recent Cheesecake Factory indulgence. My oldest and I stopped by while enroute to the Penninsula for a final fitting for her gymnastics competition.  Appetizers: - chicken pot stickers (highly recommend)  - fried mac and cheese (good, but nothing special) Salads:  - caesar salad (T)  - tossed green salad (mine). Really, really good. And... really, really big.  Overall, this place satisfies. I'll definitely keep coming back again and again, as I'm in love with all things WC."
Ryan C.,"Milpitas, CA",76,28,,5.0,10/14/2014,I absolutely love this place ...It is me and my friends go to place when we can't decide what to eat because anything we eat here is delicious and the service is excellent. !! We had the usual factory nachos for appetizer even though the avocado egg rolls are really good too..and then we shared 3 delicious plates ..one Kobe beef burger one Santa Fe salad and one cheese steak sandwich which were all awesome
ranjit g.,"El Sobrante, CA",2,9,,3.0,8/4/2015,"This place is just known for its name and fancy decoration. I ordered the vegetarian burger described as ""delicious"" on the menu. It was bland. It looked like a real meaty burger, but it was missing flavor! The fish tacos were also bland. I'm beginning to think they make the food bland on purpose. Do most of their target customers really enjoy bland food? I just don't get it!"
Jenny N.,"Oakland, CA",600,471,331,5.0,9/30/2012,"By far the nicest and friendliest Cheesecake Factory i have ever been to. and the food was very satisfying. All the cheesecake are the same of course, but the food was just better. and i love the Patio. the heaters.. the water fountain, just make sitting inside boring and Lame! the patio was romantic for me and my bf to have dinner and celebrate his birthday for just the two of us. and i had the waiters/waitresses sing to him and embarrass him. it was fun and funny. The waiter was Funny and kind. Forgot his name though."
Alex W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,12,,5.0,11/18/2014,"This place is awesome, and the Walnut Creek location is such a lovely spot. They are friendly and accommodating given the crazy work environment and the food is very good."
Edyth B.,"Farmington, UT",30,19,6,4.0,7/5/2014,"I come here for their salads, especially during the spring and summer.  After a long walk, a tall glass of iced tea along side a large cool salad is refreshing.  Some days it's still cool enough to sit at the outside patio.  My rating strictly for the salad selection although the service I've received has been at least a 3.8."
Dangja M.,"Martinez, CA",291,76,67,3.0,1/8/2014,Been to this place many many times. I know you shouldn't come here Friday nights because the wait is super long and the rest of the days it's pretty quick. I like the bar area. It's first come first serve like any other. The drinks can be stronger and a bit less pricey.  Service is pretty good for the most part. I usually don't like restaurants that have a million different items because it's difficult to pick what I want. The food isn't really to die for. I rather eat Mc Donald's and pay a whole lot less and probably a lot less calories here. Keep in mind you get the hard nasty dry bread as an appetizer. If you looked at the calorie guide you'll die. Butttt the cheesecake here I love. My fave is the red velvet or the white chocolate raspberry. Parking can be a pain but they have a garage next door and valet parking. I'll be back here only for the cheesecake.
Jeanette Y.,"Oakland, CA",260,516,116,3.0,4/26/2012,"Avocado eggroll and crab cake starters, Da Vinci pasta, and finished off with red velvet and white chocolate macademia cheesecake. I think anyone who leaves on that note, leaves feeling like they're at a potential of leaving with a myocardial infarction. It's greasy greasy foods, though I can't say I hated it, haha.  The avocado eggrolls came out okay. The crab cakes were way too greasy. You pretty much feel like you have a layer of chapstick after each bite, except it's a layer of food grease. The Da Vinci pasta, that was good. It satisfied my palate. It's light, and creamy compared to their other dishes and not overwhelmingly salty - just the way I like it. The red velvet cheesecake I think has to be the best of all their cheesecakes! I'd stay away from the white chocolate macademia cheesecake, two bites of that and I felt like I was on the biggest sugar high ever. It's loaded with way too much caramel. I might as well have asked for a cup of caramel and a straw... Next trip there, it'll be Da Vinci pasta and red velvet cheesecake ONLY!"
Rose H.,"Orinda, CA",112,105,4,2.0,7/21/2014,"Have always like CF, however, they are not disabled friendly. They only have 3 handicap stalls in the garage and none of their doors are disabled friendly with automatic openers to assist one who is in a wheelchair or disabled. Other than that, for a chain restaurant their food is good. A restaurant of this size needs to accommodate the disabled."
Franz R.,"Pittsburg, CA",3,160,,4.0,5/29/2013,"Great place for food and drinks. It can be very hectic in there depending on the time/day. More so when the kids are out.  I usually eat the meatloaf. If not, it is usually some kind of pasta or hamburger.  Nice outdoor area to eat with a good sized fire place to keep you warm. The finishing touch is always the cheesecake. The cheesecake has always been great for me and there is always a variety to choose. I usually stick to the red velvet one but sometimes I'll stray to have another. If I'm ever in a bind on which one I want, I can always buy a few to take home...lol."
Allan P.,"Vallejo, CA",0,18,,3.0,8/12/2015,"This place has been serving great food. I have my usual there. It was nice until the spiked prices on the menu. I was okay with that, but they were also serving lesser amounts on my plate and my cheesecake is smaller. Back then, my usual had more amount on my plate and it was enough to share one cheesecake with my girlfriend. C'mon now! Are we having a drought here?"
randy t.,"Benicia, CA",119,148,34,1.0,4/24/2012,"Food was a let down. For the price you pay, you would expect something a lot better. Chicken was very dry.  Service was ok to good."
Jeremy S.,"Berkeley, CA",28,67,25,4.0,3/22/2010,"Quality: 5/6 Service: 4/5 Value: 2/4 Total: 11/15 = 4/5 The Cheesecake Factory is a bit over-priced, but their food was good.  We got their avocado egg rolls, tamale cakes, and a salad.  This was certainly enough for the both of us, and we didn't have room for desert. The avocado egg rolls and tamale cakes were delicious, and the Flying Guerilla is still up there as one of my favorite drinks.  It's essentially a chocolate banana milkshake with a splash of alcohol (you can barely taste it) The service was good, but not perfect.  Our waiter never brought us a second round of bread, but we still had enough of our ""real"" food to satisfy our needs."
Eric M.,"San Carlos, CA",1,17,,4.0,5/23/2013,"Fast - good service - descent food Have been going a number of time since there opening. My mom loves a Shrimp pastas their. I get the new appetizer Polenta Fries, excellent (filing thought). I usualy get the Chicken Romano with Pasta, good, the evening portion is huge (for the pastas) I can never finish it. Will be back. The place is very, very loud however. Very nice for a late diner."
Chanelle N.,"Pittsburg, CA",619,185,502,4.0,4/4/2012,I'm thrilled Walnut Creek has a Cheesecake factory. The architecture is amazing at that! I love Cheesecake's food! The menu can be a bit overwhelming since there are so many options. Avocado egg rolls are a must. They come with a delish tamarind sauce. I'm not a huge cheesecake fan but this factory takes it to new heights. I usually stick to the Godiva cheesecake. It's rich and truly spectacular! You will wait for a table on the weekends. Unfortunately there's no avoiding that. Try coming after work or sit in the bar.  They also have a super cool outdoor eating area with fire pits and heat lamps.
Heather D.,"San Jose, CA",122,47,1,4.0,7/3/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is probably one of my go to spots in Walnut Creek. It's not nearly as expensive as most places that think a fancy name and a high price mean good food, which is a common occurrence in this area.  Starting with their cheesecake, I mean jeez. There are so many and they are a meal and a half by themselves, the half being all the whipped cream they slather on that bad boy. Anyway, I've tried many different types on any given Friday night with my friends and a cocktail. One slice easily feeds 2-3 people. So far the Red Velvet Cheesecake has stolen my heart.  Onto the food! The portions are monumental which I can appreciate given the slightly above average price tag. The menu is the size of a bible so choosing is never easy. One thing that bugs me is the Sunday Brunch menu, so many goodies and ONLY available on Sunday in a small time frame. That being said, I wasn't aware the first time I set my eyes on the Steak & Eggs. I ordered it with a grin and was met with an awkward...ummmm...it's Thursday sort of look. The waiter disappeared and back he came wearing the look a like, a smile. They made it for me anyway and it was orgasmic. Big props to that waiter and cook! Most of their food is pretty tasty and you'll always have Dinner 2 later with all the leftovers you bring home.  On to the service! You know, for as packed as this place gets, the service ain't so bad. Yes, it can be slow but the environment is so nice I tend not to care. Plus I haven't met a waiter yet that totally blew it on my order which tends to be picky. I guess in short, if you are in a rush, save it for a day with more time, otherwise get your hungry ass here already!  I give this 4 stars only because things can get slow and this place sort of wins by default when it comes to food choices given there aren't too many places that really knock it out of the park in good ole WC."
Michael M.,"San Francisco, CA",300,229,28,4.0,8/18/2012,"My group and I came here and ended up waiting 2 hours for our table. Kinda ridiculous because some other people in the restaurant decided they wanted to have coffee for hours on end keeping us outside hungry and waiting. But there was nothing the staff could do about rude patrons and I respect the restaurant for letting them stay there, but I was pretty ready to walk over and start cussing people out.  The food was average at a high price, but the place looked really good. My only complaint was that I felt like I was about to fall on my face over how slick the floors felt, and other people in my group agreed that the whole restaurant had a very unsafe walking area."
Tamara A.,"Concord, CA",12,11,5,2.0,2/6/2012,"We waited 2hrs for a table which was 30 mins longer than we were told. When we went to the waitstaff and asked how much longer, they acted as if they had already seated us but we were standing in front of them. They looked at their chart and then back at me and said, we have table that is just about ready for you. We were seated in the back corner of the restaurant which was fine but as our friends 3 yr old climbed into the booth she slipped and hit her head. The waitress just stood there. No offer of ""would you like ice or a cold pack"", or even ""is she ok"" or ""the tile can be slippery"". Maybe I am just asking for too much but read on as the evening get's better.  We began to order appetizers for the adults and food for the 3yr old. (PS don't keep a 3yr old hungry) Things seems to be getting better and we ordered our dinner.  The waitress came back about 5mins later and said they were out of ahi tuna. My husband ordered the ahi salad, which is what he was craving for dinner so we went to the Cheesecake Factory since it was one of the only ones he likes (except at BJ's).  So back to the menu but before he placed his order our waitress left to see what else off the ""healthy"" menu was also not available. When she came back, we played the are you out of this? game.  The evening continued to be ok but instead of a nice evening with friends, it was so late when we finally left the restaurant we were too tired and all went home."
Rachel H.,"Simi Valley, CA",132,622,,4.0,7/25/2012,"Had lunch with my cousin here recently and I thought it was pretty darned good, for a chain restaurant experience. Service was good, the food was good, the prices were very reasonable for the quantity and quality and the overall ambiance is very nice.  Restrooms are exceptionally clean and so is the rest of the space, from what I could tell.  I love the large outdoor area, great for people watching and nice to enjoy the lovely weather the Diablo Valley often has.  I had the miso salmon on brown rice, so good!!! This location isn't nearly as noisy as most of them are, so that was an added plus."
Emily J.,"Concord, CA",379,1293,166,3.0,10/9/2009,"I'm always hesitant to visit The Cheesecake Factory.  I think it is because I always expect a four hour wait.   My honey and I stopped here on our way back from an overnight trip to Berkeley for Yelp Prom ( ).  Parking: Not a problem!  There are a few parking garages nearby.   Wait: None.  We were there just around 1 on a Saturday and were seated immediately.   Food: I got one of the lunch specials. It was a half sandwich, soup and salad.  I only got through the soup and salad before I was full.  The salad wasn't very memorable. The chicken and artichoke soup was really tasty.  A little bit creamy with other veggies including carrots and peas.  I ate the sandwich when I got home and it was a pretty standard chicken salad.  I did like the sliced almonds added to the mix. Service: Our waiter was nice but everything seems to take a little longer than usual at The Cheesecake Factory...even when they aren't very busy. I think the serving sizes here are pretty ridiculous.  I rarely get their cheesecake because I can rarely make it through my meal.  Everything's bigger at The Cheesecake Factory.  Did The Cheesecake Factory start in Texas?"
