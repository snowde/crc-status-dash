Blair S.,"Brentwood, CA",1,11,,5.0,8/31/2014,Great food and great service. Never been here where our server didn't take care of us. And the lemon raspberry cheesecake is a must. Very refreshing.
Samantha Y.,"San Francisco, CA",4,65,11,2.0,6/4/2015,During all my visits it's been great except last night! Our server was a little slow and it took our food 30 mins to come out which has never happened before and it was not busy last night. I ordered the Louisiana chicken and I specifically asked for NO onions because I'm allergic. So i got my food and it was yummy until I started to feel itchy and nauseous to realize there was onions In my food when I said NO onions. I told my server and she rolled her eyes...I dunno if it was toward me or to the chef that made my food either way I was NOT happy.  I was expecting that she would take it off the bill since I took like two bites.but no I had to pay for the meal that got me itchy and sick! I always give the cheesecake serves 20% because they sees we've their hard working! But last night I gave only 15% on top of that I was throwing up all night. I know i won't be returning for the food after this horrible experience.
Mary J.,"Castro Valley, CA",408,243,5290,5.0,9/18/2009,"Ventured over to Walnut Creek's Cheesecake Factory    yesterday (Thu 9/17/09) afternoon w/ Sher K to cash in our coupon recv'd from National Cheesecake Day...another great lunch @ CF for us!  LOCATION: Downtown Walnut Creek...intersection of Locust St & Olympic Blvd. Public free parking garage in same block, else street ""metered"" parking. Restaurant size (as previously reviewed) larger than Pleasanton & SF locations; roomy, spacious, clean, & welcoming to folks of all sizes & very handicap friendly. CUST SVC: Great service once again for this location! Greeted immediately & warmly by hostess, seated in 1-2 minutes in outdoor patio, & thorough-friendly service by our waiter-Jack. Jack points out CF has added a new menu-page to their ""booklet of food"" called ""Small Plates & Snacks"" (Lordy!). Cooks did a great job on food, & overall atmosphere of service was on point. Keep up the great work team ;-)   TASTES: So Sher K & I really just wanted to utilize our coupon spend $30 & get free a free Cheesecake. Thinking we'd just share some appetizers, she picked out the perfect item...the ""Factory Appetizer Favorites"" for $28, which was 4 appetizer plates. Plate 1: Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes & Quesadilla Plate 2: Shrimp Summer Rolls, & Spinach N Cheese Dip Plate 3: Avocado Egg Rolls & Fried Calamari Plate 4: Pork & Chicken Pot Stickers *GET THESE* Everything was enjoyable & more than fullfilling; yes we asked for 2 carry out containers *tee-hee*. Only thing not really tasty to me was the Avocado Egg Rolls...U have to love avocado to enjoy this; next time I'll ask if we can substitute them for the Southwestern Egg Rolls *yummy*.  FINAL TAB: Cost us like $34 & change for 1 ice tea & 1 app (""Factory Appetizer Favorites""). Everything tasted gets a recommendation w/ the exception of the Avocado Egg Rolls. Customer service, food, & ambiance setting made for a another great lunch & a ""tasty"" Review Update for this CF location *tee-hee* ------------------- ** PREVIOUS TASTES Cocktails: The Typhoon & Cosmopolitan  Entree: Farfalle w/ Chicken & Roasted Garlic small  Entree: Sausage & Roasted Pepper lunch pizza "
James S.,"Concord, CA",0,2,,3.0,10/11/2015,"Great location! I love the outside ""reception area"" for a pre-drink while waiting for seating which always seems to happen quicker than promised. And dining outside great too. Food always very good but portions universally too large. Service sometimes a little slow. But I'll be back for certain!"
Daphnie A.,"Benicia, CA",236,113,57,4.0,6/23/2014,"The foods good, cocktails over priced and never a Happy Hour!  I never get why this appears to be the only restaurant in town because it's always too crowded?"
Jessica K.,"Carmel, CA",12,69,7,1.0,5/12/2014,"I absolutely love the cheesecake factory,  because of their amazing portions and their delicious selection of cheesecakes. I also completely understand that they are a large chain, and you can't always expect the same service, but this service was just ridiculous."
Tammy D.,"Antioch, CA",174,61,8,4.0,12/18/2011,"I love the non-generic look of this particular location, smack dab in the heart of Walnut Creek's gourmet ghetto.  For a chain restaurant, it's elegant, clean, and pretty classy. Service was exceptional and nearly all the wait staff with whom I had contact were young, energetic, and smiling. Our waitress, Hailey, went out of her way to make sure my friend and I were enjoying my special birthday outing.  Being familiar with the outrageous Cheesecake Factory portions, we wisely decided to split a meal.   Comfort food was the order of the evening and we chose the meat loaf, with mashed potatoes, and veggies.  The meat loaf was exactly the way I like it: not too tomatoey so that you could actually taste the flavor of the meat.  Mashed potatoes were piled up and drenched in a home style brown gravy that reminded me of my grandma's. Splitting the meal allowed us room for a slice of macadamia/caramel cheesecake, which was fabulous.   A nice touch was when Hailey rounded up a couple other servers and they sang happy birthday to me.   I had been feeling a little blue that day, but the cheerful, warm atmosphere and home cooking at the CF made me feel so much better. The only down side to the whole place, in my opinion, is that the ladies' room is incredibly small (obviously designed by men, lol!)  Several times during the evening, I noticed a line outside the ladies' room.  When I went myself, I felt claustrophic.  They should have known better than to build such a large restaurant and skimp on the ladies facilities.  We gals NEED restroom and sink space!"
Natasha E.,"Pittsburg, CA",1,73,30,3.0,7/19/2014,"I've been to this location several times and it always sucks. The wait is super long, the staff are never in point with orders and the food is mediocre at best. I keep giving this place chance after chance to redeem themselves but I think it's time to move on... *The cheesecake and the bread are the only things that are good."
Nic P.,"San Francisco, CA",38,65,38,3.0,1/24/2013,"What a yummy place to eat dessert. If you want a little place to eat a little something, come here. But if you want a place to bring your friends then maybe you should pick seething else. I mean after waiting in line to seat with all the date night people to have a seat. It just can take toooooo long. I find that people wait more than eating the food. Plus on top of that the menu is more of a novel than a menu. It's like Cheesecake Factory is having a hard time picking a corner of the market so they put everything on the menu. It makes it hard when your hungry and all your other friends are looking at you.  Finally this place has no privacy. Yes I understand that it is a public place. but the space is too open. I dont mind a few people watching me eat, but the whole place YIKES!!!!"
Win L.,"San Francisco, CA",7,122,59,1.0,12/5/2013,"It's like they don't want people to eat here?? It's 2013, surely there is a better way than putting your name down then carrying a giant buzzer for 45min while you wait.  At least allow call-in advance?  Create an App? Text me when my table is ready?!? So ridiculous.  In any case, when I have 10people in my party, I expect to be able to make a reservation!  Especially in the giant Cheesecake Factory!!!!"
Ann E.,"Concord, CA",0,11,,5.0,8/21/2014,"This location food and interior are just like their other many locations but what separates this location is their great service. My boyfriend and I are ate here during lunch time on a weekday with our lovely 12 pound dog. We were allowed to sit in the outside sitting and were served promptly. Without even asking our server Cesar came out and gave our a dog a bowl of water, which we greatly appreciated.  They usually get really busy around dinner time and on weekends so expect to wait."
Rebecca K.,"San Jose, CA",292,182,9,4.0,11/30/2011,"SO i think all cheesecake factories taste the same. and their taste deserves about 4 stars. its good, but it could be better. so then i base chain reviews on service and location and other things that arent the same at every restaurant. excellent location. put it right smack dab in the middle of everything great and awesome of walnut creek: DOWNTOWN! and its right next to the movie theater too which was SUPER nice because it was raining and my bf and i had a movie to catch after our dinner. we just skipped across the street and were there in no time and the water barely got us. service was also excellent. the guy came back many times to get our order... unfortunately my bf and i were arguing and we didnt even look at the menu so we kept telling the server sorry but he was patient and came back every time with a smile wondering if we were ready. finally when we did get our order ready he was there and ready to take our order. and our food came out tasting how it should. no disappointments there + they give free bread and the BROWN BREAD is honestly the best bread HANDS DOWN. i can get full off of that. SO DELICIOUS!"
Justine R.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",255,16,25,5.0,1/17/2014,"I had the best experience with the Walnut Creek Cheesecake Factory. I was disappointed I had not eaten here before. We had the nacho and fried mac and cheese balls for appetizers. They were great and the nachos were huge!!!. The marinated chicken on them was outstanding. We were seated within 15 minutes exactly how long they said it would be on a Saturday night. The menu was huge leaving you with tons of options ranging from reasonable to more pricey. My husband  and friend had the chicken/shrimp jambalaya, I had meatloaf dinner, and another friend had the medeira  chicken they all were delicious. Great service couldn't of had a better experience a must go!!!!!! By the way the cheesecake is amazing!!!!"
Jolene M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",46,108,22,1.0,2/15/2012,"I called them around 6pm and placed an order to go. Gave them my name and what my car make was so they know who I am when I pull up. We got there around 7pm. I'll admit my fault cause it was Valentines Day and people we being crazy. All the curb side parking spots were taken, so we had to park a little further down into the Valet parking area. We called in and told them we were outside.  We waited about five minutes before a car finally left and we got a parking spot. We waited another 10 minutes. Then some old guy in a Lexus pulls in behind us. This lady in a brown top and purple under shirt came over to him and asked him if he was picking up an order. She told him to go park in one of the handicap spots and she got his food! I was pissed. I was there for 15 minutes and nothing and he just pulls up and gets his food?  I called again to tell them I was out front. Again another 15 minutes go by. At this point I am SUPER pissed. My boyfriend convinces me to go inside and get it myself.  I go inside and go to the front counter. Of course no 'real' line just people standing around like zombies. I tell the guy, ""I have been out there for 25 minutes at curb side and waiting!"" He plainly goes, ""All curb side orders have to go to the bakery and they will help you."" Mind you it Valentines Day and the line is SUPER long. Three cash registers and only ONE open! What the hell. Took them 10 minutes for each person to get them a SLICE of cake. I waited in line for another 10 minutes. Line only moves up once!  My boyfriend calls me and tells me they are finally outside with my food. I don't think I have ever been this mad waiting to get a curb side pick up before. My boyfriend told me he almost went off on the lady cause of how long we waited and how others got served before us. I felt sorry for the server kid who had to deal with me. I know it wasn't his fault he was just a server. No tip, of course. We get home. The food was COLD and SOGGY. The slice of red velvet cake we had ordered, the cream had gotten so warm and soft that the cake started to sink into itself. I admit it was a busy day but still, you should have been much more prepared! I mean have a sign or a special register for curb side orders. Or maybe have a line that have rope so people know where the line ends."
Railene C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,6,1,1.0,9/28/2015,"We took our Admin to CF in Walnut Creek.  Not only did she get a hair in her Salad, there was one cooked into her Lettuce Wrapped Bacon Cheeseburger.  They Comped her meal but lost 4 customers at one time.  They need to review their prep crew."
Alittle G.,"Walnut Creek, CA",2,183,20,2.0,1/6/2015,"Its really not fair that I am reviewing this place, because I am not a fan of corn syrup or frozen foods flash fried and reheated premade sauces. Big crowds. Uninspired food pretending to be trendy. An overload of choices. I've been several times, each time, friends want to go. The firepits have nice ambiance, but the actual drinks?  If you don't order vodka on the rocks, or bottled beer, and you get something they mix, you may just want to stay home. Seriously, I think they throw in pretend chocolate  syrup dripping with high fructose GMO laden evilness, with fake non-dairy-whipped-something-masquerading-as-cream along with rot gut liquor, and you have yourself whatever it is that they are pawning off as drinks.  Think you can't go wrong with salads?  Think again.  Yes, this is chain food.  Middle America?  Maybe. But the Creek?  Come on! There are tons of better restaurants with amazing food and ambience just a stone's throw away. Don't do it. Stay away."
Zef C.,"El Cerrito, CA",0,12,,4.0,9/22/2015,I really like this location. It's a very beautiful building and the food is really good. My only complaint is the estimates on the wait time. I am consistently waiting 15-20 minutes longer than they estimate. Other than that I would highly recommend this place.
Tiffany M.,"Sacramento, CA",319,482,537,5.0,12/20/2009,"WOW. This is one of the best Cheesecake Factory's I've ever been too.. It totally beats the one at Stoneridge Mall.. 1) The location is perfect! The place used to be a grocery store (something like a Trader Joes) Now having a Cheesecake Factory across a Century Theaters? And Other Misc shopping stores....Container Store, Children's Place, etc.. SMART THINKING. 2) Although there was a bit of a wait on a wintery night - the waiting area with heat lamps above, and a fire pit toasted my boooty and  kept the guests warm. 3) For a party of 30 - their service was on point!!!! Always assisting! Always making sure we were ok. Never forgot anything - no mistakes on our orders.. Very happy with that!! *(I could only think that mistakes were going to happen, but Cheesecake Factory - WC, you totally proved me wrong.) Overall, I'm very happy with this Cheesecake Factory. It's very similar to one I had visited in Scottsdale, AZ. Thumbs Up!!!!!!!"
C. M.,"Oakland, CA",76,58,47,1.0,5/11/2015,"I took my family there for Mother's Day the service was HORRABLE!, I understand waiting two hours for a table but then we get seated & they forgot or appetizers we waited 45 minutes to get our check never got our water refilled we had our food to go they took our food they smashed it in a box that it didn't fit in, not only that they took apart my daughters burger and separated everything I don't want them touching my food. why would they not just give us the boxes and let us do that? I don't like the fact that they take your food away from the table separate everything & not give us all of our food at that?  on top of it didn't give us all of our food to go. Overall I have to say I was not pleased and after spending $200 on a check I expect way more then what we got! Let's just say we won't be back. I really felt like not leaving a tip but I'm a waitress myself and I understand how that can hurt people but that's how upset I was. Way too much going on the holidays they need to pull it together"
Bay M.,"San Jose, CA",1,113,43,3.0,8/6/2015,"Came here on a moderately busy Wed night. The hostesses and girl at the bar was very attentive and friendly. When we were seated, the seat outside has a large streetlight that casts a bright light in your eye that was very uncomfortable. We asked to be moved and the hostess was very quick and nice about it. (Noticed another table in this spotlight also requested to be moved) The food was good but the service from our waiter was not too great. Everything was very slow. We wanted to change an item on our order 5 min after we put it in and he said ""no, it's too late"" and didn't want to try to ask. When we got our food, no one offered to give us fresh pepper and Parmesan. We asked the girl from the kitchen who was very quick to get it for us. The next table also had to ask for it. Then we realized, halfway into our meal, that he never brought the bread. That's one of my favorite things here. I looked around and the tables. One had bread, one didn't. After he brought ours, he remembered to bring for the other table that had been there for awhile as well."
