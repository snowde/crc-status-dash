Allison T.,"Walnut Creek, CA",61,109,97,3.0,6/17/2016,"As with many restaurant chains, Cheesecake Factory has a certain level of quality with food and service, but they are by no means the best. That being said, their ambience is superb, and the location in Walnut Creek is no exception. The inside is richly decked out in pillars and extravagant murals, all situated nicely under a grand, high-ceiling room.  I ordered the eggplant pasta (I can't recall its exact name) but out of the numerous dishes I've tried here, this is by far one of the better ones. The pasty was rich with the taste of basil and I greatly enjoyed the fried eggplant.  While the server was friendly enough and offered up helpful suggestions, he forgot to bring the sugar twice when my uncle requested it for his iced tea, and he completely forgot to bring out my cousin's order. She was distraught (being 8 years old and saw this as a huge personal crisis in her life) and was miserably eating off everyone else's plate until the server walked by and finally realized he had forgotten an order.  TL;DR: I enjoyed my order but service could have been better. Atmosphere was great."
Frank Z.,"Walnut Creek, CA",56,21,,5.0,4/13/2017,"Cheesecake is the reason I stop here.  I've had lunch and a couple dinners here, and I remember them being good.  But I don't remember what I had nor do I care, because if you come here for anything other than cheesecake, you're doing it wrong. Morning After Rating:  Fuck Yeah!  If my gluttonous ass doesn't eat it all before then."
Matt R.,"West Sacramento, CA",2,26,4,2.0,7/25/2017,"If it weren't for the great server we had, this would have been a 1 star experience. Food was very slow and was lukewarm upon arrival. Pieces of tomato and pasta at the bottom of the bowl of edamame was the coup de grace.  So glad pie Cheesecake Factory in Sacramento is a star performer or we wouldn't go back."
Christopher L.,"Concord, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/17/2017,"Arrived at 11am one person in front of me and one behind, there was 3 workers working the counter(and they were bragging they had a lot of help) the lady who helped myself was unfriendly and was more interested in talking with co-workers and being on the phone I ordered and literally waited 15min to get 3 pieces of cheese cake(which was very good) the restaurant is very beautiful, but that experience just ruined it for me, I will never go there again."
Flavio V.,"Martinez, CA",15,2,2,1.0,10/15/2017,"Really bad customer service, they open at 10:00a.m. but they don't have a server for 11 people inside they try to acomode us outside but even tho when we told the hostess we wanted to sit inside if she can try to see if that was possible she didn't even try to, she told us we need it to wait 25 more minutes, even tho we were there for 15 minutes already, with the restaurant almost empty...people you try your best to keep your customers..."
Astrid Z.,"Berkeley, CA",497,617,1514,3.0,3/21/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my leave favorite places to dine, but I will be unbiased and compare it fairly to other locations. Food: My main reason for not appreciating TCF is due to their HUGE and over the top menu. It's just way too long and I find that because of this, nothing is truly special, nothing stands out to me. I like smaller menus, it makes me feel like they invest more time into crafting these dishes. But I think they succeed with this tactic, because they attract a wider audience since they offer so much. I had the Tortilla Salad with chicken. the Salad was HUGE, like the menu. The ingredients tasted pretty fresh, aside for the beans, which were clearly canned. The chicken wasn't the best in taste, but the portion was definitely fair. I wouldn't get it again, nothing stand-out about it. Price: The portions are big here, for the most part & quality is okay for the price.  Ambiance: Huge restaurant, lots of seating, lots of waiting too. Very clean and can be noisy during dinner and the lunch rush. Service: It wasn't good. Our waiter was not attentive and very forgetful. It was a busy time during dinner, however, I noticed her attending the people around us a lot better than she attended us.  Overall: Food is average, price is decent, but the service at this location needs improvement. I would really only come here for their stellar and wide selection of cheesecakes."
Ted V.,"Vallejo, CA",494,26,19,4.0,4/22/2017,First time I've been to the Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek and it will not be the last. I had the best pork chop dinner in a long time. The chop was cooked perfect and I know it's hard to get it right by cooking it well and keeping it moist and juicy. The applesauce complimented the pork chop well. The mash potatoes and green beans were very good. The overall service was excellent the only problem was the wait and they don't take reservations. That's the only reason I'm giving this place a 4 instead of a 5 star.
Kentara W.,"Oakland, CA",163,61,224,4.0,5/30/2017,The service was good waiter kept coming to check on us. We got out appetizers fast too they were fresh and hot. The honey truffle chicken I thought was going to be one piece of chicken  it was too it was so delicious
Christy P.,"Antioch, CA",2,25,20,1.0,5/9/2017,Every time we come to this place we experience poor service. First time we were here we waited almost an hour for my husbands food they then came back to the table and said we had to wait an additional 20 min because they ran out of steak for the steak tacos or would he like to order something else we said no and continued to wait they gave us free cheese cake so we appreciated the gesture and decided to  come again.   After placing or order the wait wasn't quite as long once or ordered came out I noticed my order had a bunch of red sauce and tomatoes me being pregnant at this moment my stomach cannot take that I called the waiter over and told him I didn't want the order he looked at me and said well you have to take it because we cannot resale the item I said well Greg I haven't touched this you can just bring me out what my husband ordered. He insisted that I had to keep the food and place another order of what I wanted and they were not taking it off the bill. I said fine please get your manager. He said ok. Manager NEVER showed his face but told Greg to remove the item off our bill and give me what I wanted. I waited 30 min before the new order arrived. It was cold and tasted awful. WE will NEVER return.
Michael T.,"San Francisco, CA",33,102,274,4.0,11/4/2016,"Haven't been here in a while but the food is as good as I remembered. Ordered the Steak Diane, which came with mash potatoes, sautéed onions and mushrooms. Took a little longer than I wanted for food to come out, even though it wasn't that busy. Must be the reason for low ratings I assume. However, the food was delicious. Steak came out nice, hot, and tender. The mash potatoes were light and creamy.  I think they could benefit by limiting their menu items though. Sometimes more isn't always a good thing.  Would I be back? I believe so"
Ty C.,"San Francisco, CA",67,327,144,2.0,9/22/2016,"Let me start by saying that I love the cheesecake factory, but the take out experience was such a let down beginning to end. I called in and was placed on hold, no big deal.  After minute 8 of being on hold (I know, I'm an idiot for even waiting that long) I had someone else call to see if they could get through.  While I'm still on hold, the call was picked up and the order was placed.  This was mildly annoying, but whatever...  was told that it would be ready in 25 mins. Arrived to pick up 20 minutes later and paid and waited for the food which was just a burger and fries (yes, I was feeling fancy and decided I wanted a burger from cheesecake).  The wait continued and continued, finally decided to ask if the food was ready or when they expected it to be ready, with no apology or anything the cashier said she would check, walked back to the kitchen and came back with the food.  How long had it been sitting there?  Anyways, 47 minutes after the order was placed (checked the call log) I finally had the food.   The burger was ordered medium and came out well done, like really well done.  It was still good, but not how I wanted it.  The fries were a really small portion.  The bag was filled up about 1/5 of the way.  Luckily they were not cold and they have a good bag for the fries that has holes in it and seems like it was constructed in a way that retains the heat, but also doesn't cause the fries to get soggy.  That actually probably earned the second star on this visit, b/c I've never seen that before and after everything else that had happened, I sort of expected awful soggy fries at that point. The restaurant was not that busy at the time and things didn't seem like they were being run very well. I will continue to go to the cheesecake factory, but probably not at this location.  I didn't walk away feeling good about spending $15 on a burger and fries."
Lila C.,"Concord, CA",0,5,1,1.0,12/6/2017,"Well this sucks. The Cheesecake Factory makes one of my favorite dishes, which is why my husband and I come here at least twice a month. The last 3 times we've ordered takeout, have been a disaster of repeated frustration. We usually pick up at curbside, and after the first call of letting them know we've arrived, we wait about 20 minutes before calling a second time. We get an apology, and continue our wait. After 20 additional minutes, we call again. Only this time the hostess says she's sorry, no one notified the bakery after our first two calls. We wait another 10 minutes, and my husband decides to go inside. Food was ready. Restaurant wasn't that busy, it was Wednesday night. Our order was just sitting there at the bakery, cold food now. Later after getting home, my husband called and spoke to the manager. He was very nice, offered to send us a gift card. We redeemed the gift card a few weeks later, had a similar experience. However, tonight's experience was the worst of them all. We won't be putting ourselves through this again, I just have to live without one of my favorites. My husband will be fine without the Cheesecake Factory in his life, it's me I'm worried about."
Alphonzo J.,"San Pablo, CA",0,1,1,2.0,3/4/2017,"They are very busy I waited for an hour for my table I waited another hour, three hours before I even got my food and I end up taking home my food very horrible Place dissatisfied with the customer service I'll probably never eat there again unless I order to go"
Brent A.,"Pittsburg, CA",11,24,9,5.0,5/19/2017,I recommend asking for Brandon to be your server. He was very attentive. Food was great as always.  We love the atmosphere here.
Melissa N.,"Antioch, CA",46,67,45,3.0,5/14/2017,"This location is a solid 3 stars. I've been here a couple of times and while service always varies, I can't say I've ever had a truly terrible experience.  But I will never come for dinner Thursday- Sunday. I can't wait 2 hours just for a table. I don't know how people do it. Only lunch, around opening times, on those days. Avoid holidays! Now the food is 4/5. Pretty much all the small plates and appetizers are great. Love: Crispy fried cheese Stuffed mushrooms Asian lettuce wraps Mexican lettuce wrap tacos Fried mac n cheese is INCREDIBLE! The entrees can be disappointing though. The pastas are a let down. The chicken is tough, chewy, flavorless, and not worth the up charge. Meatballs dry. My husband has never been happy with any of the burgers. But the real reason any one comes here is the cheesecake, which never disappoints. Our favorites are white chocolate caramel macadamia, oreo, and red velvet. The chocolate ones can be very decadent. Order it with ice cream or milk!"
Lorissa W.,"Hercules, CA",95,520,118,2.0,4/21/2017,"I used to love the grilled chicken salad sandwich but we both didn't care for it yesterday for dinner.  The bread was clearly not grilled but toasted.  My sandwich had just a light smear of chicken salad and my husband's sandwich had uneven and stingy filling.   Most of the sandwich was just a giant tomato with thick bread.  My salad had nothing in it but greens, no tomato or onion.  We paid total of 30 dollars for two mediocre drippy chicken salad sandwiches.  It wasn't worth it.  The fries were good and service was good but too bad the actual entree was no good and we waited almost 30 minutes.  No thank you.  We are not returning."
Silvia C.,"Antioch, CA",33,6,,1.0,10/13/2017,"This place is nice but beware when ordering cheesecake to go! I ordered 3 slices and thought it was $25 no big deal, slices are big. as I got in the car I noticed the slices I had in my bag are half or less than what they had in the display, why must restaurants be so greedy!! The Cheesecake Factory has plenty of business and for $8 a slice, it should be big!! Make sure you watch what they serve you because they give you old Cheesecake out of a different case."
Justin K.,"Chinatown, San Francisco, CA",4,71,39,1.0,9/11/2017,Horrible customer service. Probably the worst I have ever seen.. not worth your time or money. Be ready to wait in the to go line for half an hour. Garbage quality
Jim T.,"Walnut Creek, CA",9,5,,1.0,9/23/2017,"Just trying to order a pick-up order is a night mare! Only the cashier can take a pick up order and I was on hold for over 10 minutes! I hung up and called back and asked what takes so long to answer the phones "" oh we are a high volume store so it takes a while to answer the phones"""
Andre C.,"Danville, CA",0,14,,2.0,2/24/2017,"This is not a ""last night sucked"" review. This is a review from the last 3 visits to the good ol' Factory. Not sure what happened, but you guys are off your game. The worst part is the service. I had to ask for everything! Can I have a fork...may I have more water...is our food coming soon? I remember when the reliable servers, all dressed in white, would be flying around the restaurant handling everything. Not anymore. And my Steak Diane...my old reliable...was over cooked and dry. The worst is walking out of a restaurant with a ""that was not good"" feeling. So many restaurants in Walnut Creek...you guys better step it up!"
