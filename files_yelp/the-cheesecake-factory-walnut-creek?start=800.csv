Janeen O.,"Fairfield, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/15/2016,"I called in my order for curbside pickup. I was greeted by an unfriendly employee but she did ultimately get the order correct. Unfortunately for my daughter, her meal was inedible. Her fettuccine was doughy and the chicken undercooked. I called to let the manager know because paying $55 for 2 meals - 1 of which went uneaten, warranted a call into the manager. I spoke with Rafael who offered for me to pick up another dish - no thank you (this would pose a huge inconvenience). He then offered me a GC and placed me on a 20 minute hold. The wait was so long that I had to hang up and call back. To my surprise, Rafael was there at the front desk. I realized he either has a very bad short term memory and forgot that he placed a customer on hold OR he wasn't pleased with having to make the situation right. In any case, I WILL NOT ever be back. His poor excuse for the hold was that he didn't have a pen/paper to take down my information. I think a trip to Staples would have been quicker than my hold time. Please take my advice - don't eat here. There are far too many better restaurants in Walnut Creek to waste your time with this one."
Diane E.,"Los Angeles, CA",300,1074,28,4.0,8/14/2009,"Went for dinner here tonight after a hike at Tilden Park.  Because we got here early -- before 6:00 p.m. -- we were seated right away and we chose to sit out on the patio next to one of their fire pits...nice :-) Word to the wise...when eating at Cheesecake Factory, either share a meal or get a box upfront to take half your meal home.  The portion sizes are huge! My hiking friends each got a salad and I decided on the Avocado Eggrolls appetizer.  Just right and still brought some home...along with a slice of fresh banana cheesecake to share with my daughter tomorrow. The only drawback was a couple of nuts that were protesting outside the patio on the sidewalk.  Annoying."
Emily D.,"Oakland, CA",290,117,248,3.0,5/27/2012,"So this is your standard Cheesecake Factory. Grandiose architecture done at a medium taste level. The food is like any other Cheesecake - large portions, varying degrees of quality, excellent but calorie-rich cheesecakes.  This particular branch appears to be extremely popular, with a perpetual crowd of people in the surrounding areas all holding their reservation beepers with eager looks on their faces. It can be tough getting a table at any time of day here. Given how busy they are, I can't say I'm surprised their service is lacking, but it's still aggravating. Last time I came here it took ten minutes for our waiter to bring out a glass of sangria for my friend, and no one came to check on us throughout our meal until we were almost finished. It's tough getting any server's attention as they're running around the tables so quickly and aren't looking up. It's especially difficult outside when it gets dark as their dim lighting causes a drastic decrease in visibility.  Their restrooms are almost like a joke - just a few stalls in the women's restroom, and 2 sinks? I don't know how they can expect that to accommodate all patrons in the restaurant. I've walked away from the restroom after waiting 5 minutes behind 3 people. The location is perfect. It's located in the building where Andronico's used to be, right across the street from the Century theatre and located just a block away from Broadway Plaza. There are a few parking garages in the immediate area, and some street parking, but parking can still be next to impossible on the weekend, especially Friday evening."
Hib.zi R.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2,39,,2.0,6/20/2015,"We arrived at around 11.30, the place was not crowded and we were seated outside right away. However the experience at this location was unreal, and I should have known from the start. The bread at the table so hard and stale that my kids couldn't bite into it. We were a table of five and each ordered a plate. The plates took a long time to get to the table and then we noticed that 3 were cold and 2 lukewarm! When we called the Manager, she  arrived to the table she agreed and then reheated my husband eggplant parmigiana and kids pasta which made the plate even worse. I can't believe such any food establishment would reheat a plate after sending it cold to a table rather then doing another one. Consequently they ruined our whole meal, coz half of us ate at different time. I have always been a fan of this place but not anymore, at least not this location, what a shame..."
Paula R.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",13,126,20,4.0,8/17/2012,"It was a dream come true that Cheesecake factory came close to where I live. We used to travel to the one in Plesanton and hit the one in Vegas when we were there. I had never had a bad meal until a couple of weeks ago.  I was undecided between the Caramel Chicken and the Chicken Madeira (sp). The waitress raved about the Caramel Chicken so I ordered it. Soooo disappointed! That was my first below average meal from there and I was quite sad. Not at all what I expected.  It's ok though, I had room for cheesecake. I went out on a limb and trusted the waitresses suggestion to get the mango/key lime and it was wonderful!!  The Avocado egg rolls are always amazing!! I went back last night was was completely satisfied other than the fact that they were out of Red Velvet Cheesecake. I went with my favorite, Pineapple upside down.. soooo yummmy!!!"
Judy W.,"Oakland, CA",412,343,133,3.0,5/1/2012,"i only like three things here... 1) the brown bread (molasses bread?) 2) herb crusted salmon 3) red velvet cheesecake! that is all. I am sure there are other things here that are pretty good, but it's pricey... the service is usually pretty good. Most of the waiters look happy to be there. haha. I'll come back occasionally for the lunch menu... and just keep bringing on the brown bread!!! yay! =]"
Bee D.,"Vallejo, CA",386,541,1513,5.0,7/3/2009,"Ok, I rounded up the last star, but I couldn't help myself. I HAD A FREAKIN WONDERFUL TIME and the folks at the location were off the HOOK! Believe it or not, I attended my 30th reunion on the 20th.  Come to find out that my girl Penny who coordinated the whole event is leaving on tuesday and moving to the ATL (moving to bigger and better things, can't hate!).  Anyway, Ms. Linda calls up and announces that we all have to get together to send our girl off in style.   With the help of that wonder website FaceBook, Linda rounds up 20 of us and makes arrangements at CF.   We had this whole section roped off for us and they were even very understanding when a bunch of us were late because of the traffic.  We had two waiters that took care of all our needs and they split our checks about 8 different ways  (too cool).  Ms. Penny lost her balloon bouquet and the manager, hopped on top of the banquette and used a stick to coax them down! So let's get down to my eats - #1 - I have to have diet soda because of the diabetes, no problem there.  I have to have caffeine free because of the PKD, problem.  Brought my own diet 7-up and they provided the ice and glass and no drama!  Yeah! #2 - Appetizers - Chicken pot stickers - They were pretty yum, but there were only 6 of them and they were in the sauce already.  Kinda pricey and they were ok.  The wrapper was nice and thin.  That was a plus. Dates stuffed with goat cheese, wrapped with bacon.  - These were on the ""little menu"" and had a little price.  The concept was very good, but the execution wasn't perfect.  a tad bit on the dry side. #3 Entree - Shrimp Scampi with Steak Diane - I asked for medium and it was medium and perfect and delicious.  Mmmmm - Served with rustic mashed potatoes. Honey Bunny - Thai Bang Bang chicken and shrimp - I got two thumbs up when I asked, but he didn't stop eating to give any details.  There wasn't a drop of food left on his plate, that must mean something. #4 - Chocolate Coconut Cheesecake - Honey Bunny said it was great.  Funny thing, I'm not a cheesecake fan.  (LOL) This was a wonderful experience, much better than the one at Union Square!  Glad I had a chance to have a second opinion."
Angela W.,"Antioch, CA",369,18,82,1.0,1/1/2014,"My friend and I were shopping in the area yesterday we decided we wanted to get a drink at the bar. We went in asked the hostess if we had to wait or seat ourselves in the bar, which was NOT busy. We sat down at a bar round and waited for someone to greet us. Unfortunately that never happened we waited 10-15 minutes with not even a hi or has anyone helped you. We decided to go ahead and just leave. I wish they had better service unfortunately I don't know that I'll be going back."
Jenn N.,"Brentwood, CA",722,778,894,3.0,6/12/2009,"The first time I came here: As I drove around the block for the 3rd time looking for a parking spot, I let out a trail of expletives and cursed myself for agreeing to meet my buddies here for dinner.  I finally opted for the 4th level in the parking garage 3 blocks away.  As I tromped down 4 flights of stairs in heels (I'm claustrophobic = elevators are no good), I angrily sent out a ""WHY did I agree to meeting you guys in Walnut Creek at the CF?""  That's Cheesecake Factory, although Cluster Fack is also very appropriate. One of my friends had already arrived and put our name in for a table.  They do not take reservations and you will be lucky to be quoted anything less than an hour. I have come to know, accept and embrace that whenever I agree to dine here. The Cheesecake Factory is not a good place for: A first date. An intimate conversation. A quick meal. *High heels. *I don't know what it is.  Every single one I've been into.  They All have the most slippery floors on earth.  I don't know if they mop with Pledge or what. The Cheesecake Factory is good for: Certain dishes. Eating a lot. Overly priced but good Cheesecake. Testing for central auditory processing disorders. The specials can be hit or miss.  A lot of their regular menu items can be hit or miss. Stick with the Steak Diane, Chicken Piccata, Fish & Chips, Popcorn Shrimp, Chinese Chicken Salad and the Raspberry Lemon cheesecake is incredible. Stay away from the artichoke appetizer, fried macaroni & cheese (you do NOT want to know the grams of fat in that baby), Teriyaki, Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp, Salmon. On my last visit here, my husband and I both ordered a glass of wine.  When the server brought them out, my glass was 1/2 full and his was 3/4 full.  Fail! So not cool. They take on too much.  It's just the way it is.  The bar, cheesecake and food departments are all separate.  If you order a drink, your server has to go order it from someone else and wait in that line of orders.  The same goes for the cheesecake.  We were done and ready to leave 25 minutes before we were finally handed our dessert to go and our check. Time management just is not a priority here and I'm positive it has everything to do with their consistently lengthy  ""wait for a table list"". I do like that their take out cheesecake counter is open super late."
Mitchell M.,"Concord, CA",0,21,4,1.0,2/8/2015,"My brother got food poisoning here. Completely ignoring his advice, I brought my fiancee here for her birthday. And, here I am writing this review, sick to my stomach with bad diarrhea. My girl has thrown up twice. This is most likely the result of poor food preparation... disgusting. It's frustrating to think that a restaurant that looks as nice as this with very friendly waiters can't even control bacterial contamination. I spent 120 here, got an ok dinner, and food poisoning.  I'm giving Cheesecake Factory only one star because having properly prepared food is a must; without that, you shouldn't even be serving McDonald's."
Eugene B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",56,17,,4.0,5/30/2014,"I've been waiting for my wife for 2.5 months in California and finally she's here. This place was our first date in this area. I wanted some dessert, she wanted a salad, we both wanted a nice romantic place - so we've decided to try this one. Location is nice, we've found a parking space without any problems, although there was not many of them. Probably we just got lucky. Area with outdoors table is looking cool, like some resort-area restaurant somewhere in Southern Europe, like Turkey (it's Asia actually but who cares) or Bulgaria. These fountains with fire are really exciting. Inside... Well it's not so romantic. Interior is not bad, every table with seats are looking pretty good but not extraordinary. It's pretty loud there and organization of tables in this area isn't really intimate. So the place and feeling was good in general but not excellent. Main disadvantage - it's really loud there. If you want intimate date, either sit outside or go to other place. We expected European-sized food so we were thinking about ordering 2 salads and 2 desserts. Luckily we've decided to give it a try at first. My wife ordered traditional Ceasar + cappuccino, and I've order 30-years anniversary cheese cake with some caramel moccaccino. Well... The portions were huge! We've been eating ceasar together and still weren't possible to finish it. Salad was good, chicken and croutons also were good (but we'd expect a bit more of them), cheese was.. Hardly noticable - there was really small amount of cheese. I had a feeling that smth is missing - either cherry tomatoes or eggs. Beverages were just not bad, but not awesome. They didn't cause any negative reaction but we weren't excited. The cheesecake - well thi is smth that was really good. It was so big that we couldn't eat even a half of it. And really tasty. So in general place was pretty nice with not bad kitchen, but not excellent. Strong 4 stars."
Bran S.,"Moraga, CA",0,19,,5.0,8/15/2015,"Who doesn't love the cheesecake factory, especially for your birthday? I have only been there twice, but I must say, those two times were some of the best of times(as in terms of eating)! First time I went, I got the chicken chipotle pasta, which I highly suggest! The little crab cakes are freakin amazing! I also sampled plates of my family members and those were awesome too! The bang bang shrimp is excellent! The second time I went I got the dynamite shrimp with their sauce(no idea what it is) and the two together were such an amazing combo! The fillet mignon is really worth the price, only $30! Other places, you'd be paying like $40! Then comes the whole reason why I came here! The cheesecakes! They are big and bursting with flavor, like everything else in this restraunt! The first time I went, I got the 30th anniversary cake and that was awesome, especially for leftovers! The second time I went, I got the Hershey smores edition and that was the best cheesecake I have ever had in my life! The meals here are honestly not that expensive! For four people at the table for my birthday, we only played $121, which is not bad for all of the food here bursting with flavor! Another thing I like about this place is the service! Since I work at Safeway, I set the bar pretty low for people giving me service because I am told everyday to give quality service, which these guys are too! Both times, the waiter and waitress were so nice and they gave us really good menu suggestions! The filled the water every time and we got our food with no screw ups(All I care about)! Every time I leave this place, I look forward to coming back and I make sure to buy extra cheesecakes for all of us to snack on for the rest of the week! So folks, this place is worth the money, even though it is a chain restaurant! Enjoy the food bursting with flavor!"
Nathan V.,"Antioch, CA",0,5,,5.0,1/12/2012,"This rating and review is NOT about the restaurant as a whole.  It is about the single performance of one waiter at the Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek.  The waiter is named Miguel, and he is by far one of the best waiters I have had the pleasure of dining with.  I work in food service training and I often take the opportunity to keep a waiter or waitress on their toes - no matter where I dine. So, what did he do?  Well, first I must explain what his supporting staff did not do...  Dinner was delivered with mistakes in side dishes, entree ingredients, and although additional condiments were requested - the requests were not honored.     Miguel bent over backwards, running back and forth, collecting missing side dishes, providing additional condiments, and even replacing bent silverware.  All the time I pressed this guy harder and harder (because that's what I do for a living) and not only did he correct a mass of chaos that he did not create, he did it despite my ever increasing disapproval.  What's really impressive?  He never lost his composure, or his sense of diligence, and he maintained the integrity of our dining experience. Now, like I said, I pressed this guy hard enough to make him want me to leave and never come back.  This is what Miguel said to me when we were leaving, ""Please ask for me next time you come in so that they can seat you in a place where I can serve you."" Easily, one of the best waiters I have ever seen."
R C.,"Suisun City, CA",10,18,,5.0,4/6/2014,Super uber goodie!  We drive 45 mins for this place the Mac n Cheese is sooooooo freakin goodie!
Camille A.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",203,108,32,4.0,10/11/2011,"I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory many times, and different locations. I just want to record what I ate so I can remember what I've tried & liked! I ordered the Garlic Noodles for the first time-- definitely a favorite. I usually get some Farfalle Garlic Pasta that for some reason I order even though I know I didn't like it before. Anyway, this dish was tasty -- not too thick, filling, and the asparagus and shiitake mushrooms were cooked well. The only thing is the portion size is smaller than what you'd expect at Cheesecake. Normally, I'd have half my dish left for another meal the day after, and this time it was maybe a quarter left. But I'm just being picky. Usually I get the Godiva Cheesecake, which is amazing. But this time my bf  wanted me to try this fudge cake that wasn't on the menu anymore. Our waiter was kind enough to find someone in the restaurant who knew how to make it. The Fudge Cake was a bit dry, but still amazing!"
Teresa G.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",156,458,687,4.0,3/16/2012,Very friendly staff although they forget what order people come in and had to ask everyone their names again.  Great food and great service.
Mr. G.,"Alamo, CA",1,123,1,4.0,6/27/2012,"It's the cheesecake factory...if you've never been, you gotta go. Otherwise, everyone else already knows they do about 1000 different things, and they're all good. On my last visit, they had some debacle with my daughters meal...I think some other server picked it up off the line and delivered it to the wrong table. STUFF happens...right? So this delayed all of our meals while they had to recook it. Then no one brought it out and our waitress had to find it. All-said-and-done, between salad and main course was easily 30 minutes.  Fortunately, the line manager came out and apologized, and bought our desert. Above and beyond the expectation...but still nice to see management come out and acknowledge the mistake.  This could have been a 1 star review, but stepping up redeemed themselves."
Tim B.,"Berkeley, CA",0,32,26,3.0,3/14/2013,"Food was decent, as fancy as the restuarant was, I would expect the food to be as grand. It was just ok. Cheesecake was pretty good, nothing to write home about."
Glenda P.,"Antioch, CA",1,5,9,3.0,5/22/2015,only the cheesecakes good. how is broccoli gonna be served salty? and three other guests said their dishes were all undercooked. gross!
Tam F.,"San Ramon, CA",489,1397,253,3.0,5/15/2009,"I have been to this location 3 times now over the past few weeks. Mostly not by choice but due to convenience and the fact that the menu is vast for any type of eater (except maybe vegan).  I like the look of this location better than the one in Pleasanton, but the service has been slow and the food not quite right any of the times I have been here. It is a chain, and while there are things that are interesting, eating here to often would not be good for anyone who does not want to add more dimples on their ass."
