Lisa L.,"San Jose, CA",68,61,15,2.0,8/8/2011,"The Walnut Creek Cheesecake Factory is pretty decent but if you've been to one Cheesecake, you've been to them all. The décor is fairly similar to the other locations I've been to (Palo Alto and Valley Fair, mostly) and the menu doesn't vary. Personally, I don't think the menus need to change since they're so extensive and one can usually find something to order, no matter how picky the eater. I LOVE the Chicken Bellagio and order it pretty much every time I visit a CF. However, when my Mom and I went on July 23rd, I can't say the same. The pasta was incredibly dry and almost hard- like it had been sitting out, drying, and someone splashed water on it, trying to reconstitute it before serving it. The flavor of the dish was good but when the pasta is the best part, it's disappointing to not be happy with the quality of it. The chicken itself was cooked nicely and breaded to perfection.  Though I can't remember our Server's name, I can say that he was awesome and did everything he could to put a smile on my face, as well as my Mom (who was there celebrating her birthday). He was friendly, attentive, knew when to inquire as to how our food was/if we needed anything, and when not to. I'd come back to this location for his customer service, if nothing else.  Best part of the meal: when we mentioned to the Hostess and our Server that we had a movie to get to in less than an hour, they pushed us through to accommodate our request. I was impressed with how efficient the service was and amazingly enough, we made it to our movie 15 minutes early (which was good since the theater filled up so quickly). All in all, it was the same status quo experience you expect from CF but they missed the mark on my pasta. Good thing their awesome Server mostly made up for it."
Gergana N.,"Vallejo, CA",13,23,3,3.0,9/22/2012,"I have been there 5-6 times. I like the food, best cheesecake ever, but the last 2 times the service was not so great. First time there was a hair in my potato wedges, the manager was very responsive even though I did not want to make a big deal of it. Last time I went with my mom and we had to wait 30 min until someone actually showed up.  I had to ask the hostess 2 times before a waiter came to bring water and take our order. Same manager came again to appologize and offered us a free appetizer, which was very nice of him. But then they put 2 waiters on our table and it was getting over board. I just wanted to spend time with my mom, not making conversation with complete strangers. At the end when we wanted to get our food to go. We had the server put in boxes, at home we found out he smushed everything in two boxs and cheesecakake had no shape anymore Next time I will take out, I will not eat in."
Kirsten K.,"Berkeley, CA",9,38,4,5.0,3/7/2014,"This place was fabulous!  Service was really good and food was flawless. I got the Luau Salad and my friend got the Gumbo and later, we got a cheese cake (I forget the name). All dishes were realllllllyy perfect. I wpuld come here again, no question about it"
Bebe L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,35,,4.0,6/17/2014,I went here after a movie. The food was pretty good but my garlic noodles were pretty greasy and they didn't taste like garlic.
Astrid S.,"Danville, CA",0,4,,4.0,6/17/2015,Usually a long wait but food is always consistently good and you can beat the location. Great place to bring the whole family. They have amazing fire pits out front so you have a nice place to sit while you wait for your table.
Mr R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,166,27,3.0,5/28/2012,"5 stars for architecture. 2.5 stars for food. 2.5 stars for service. 1 star for quality of clientele once your seated and surrounded. Now, as for their menu, well, I have to say it pretty much has everything for everyone.  In fact, I don't know that I have seen a more broad and expanded menu than I have here. There cakes are just north of average. The real downside:  Don't try and come here for a quiet evening and nice meal.  It is so loud.  In fact, I think dinner in a subway or Bart station would probably be more peaceful.  And again, it's Walnut Creek -- that means little to no parking and lots of people."
Heather C.,"Sacramento, CA",263,355,35,4.0,3/22/2012,"This has to be one of the biggest and prettiest Cheesecake Factory's. Even though they can appear busy, the wait for a table is never too long. The menu is large, offering a little of everything, including small plates. Which is great if you can't decide, so then you can get a couple things and share."
Paul W.,"Waltham Abbey, United Kingdom",2,68,,4.0,9/1/2012,"Before Cheesecake factory came to Walnut Creek we'd always go visit one whenever we could, especially in L.A. or when we were over in Pleasanton.  We were so excited when this one opened and went every week or two until the novelty final wore off a bit.  But I still really like this place.  Unlike other reviews I've read here, we have rarely had bad service, normally it's excellent.  The food has always been at least good, sometimes very good, sometimes great.  My favorites are: Meatloaf (it's huge, and I LOVE the savory flavor of this, comes with yummy mash and corn relish) Wild mushroom burger (I get it medium rare, they do it perfectly) Jamaican black pepper shrimp (we got that for the first time today, not as spicy as they make it sound, but a very tasty sauce.  Shrimp slightly overcooked) but I've really never been disappointed with anything except for a really awful overpriced omelet one night.  The brown bread is great, warm out of the oven.  My g/f always get the unsweetened iced green tea (it has a sprig of mint when they don't forget), tastes really good. The wait on weekends can be pretty bad, but normally 30 minutes or so.  It can get pretty cold inside, not sure why they crank up the air. This is our go to place when we can't decide where to go.  It never disappoints."
Shawn S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",16,29,10,2.0,5/17/2013,"Expensive, Loud, too many kids, bad service and food was just OK but not worth what I spent."
Che M.,"Hercules, CA",131,19,241,4.0,3/15/2012,Review Update: So this place is one of my BFF's favorite restaurants...ending up giving this place another chance. I was craving for Chicken Marsala the night we planned to go out for dinner & she somehow convinced me to try the Chicken Marsala @ The Cheesecake Factory! She also mentioned that's one of her favorite dishes and she was right!!! That's exactly what I ordered and I couldn't believe the portion! Huge Huge Huge portions....totally something you can share or jus have Hella leftovers! The servers were great & the wait on seating on a Friday night was pretty quick! I was expecting a longer wait time....always a plus +++ So yeah....so much better than my first experience! Definitely will be coming back :)
Kim N.,"San Pablo, CA",17,1,,5.0,6/9/2014,"This place is luxurious! Best Cheesecake Factory I've been to, I wish they were all like this! My bf's plate came out a little late so they gave him a free salad then later the manager came out to apologize and gave us free cheese cake! The service here was awesome."
Ghenwa S.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",5,69,10,5.0,2/21/2014,"Amazing atmosphere on a Thursday night and the service is very good,  their nachos is to die for"
Ashiana K.,"Vacaville, CA",102,196,394,4.0,2/28/2012,"I give  this Cheesecake Factory 4 stars because I'm thinking back to all of my dining experiences and not just one. The restuarant is much more beautiful in comparison to the SF and Sacramento Cheesecake Factory locations. The decor is amazing and makes you appreciate lighting and mirrors. The food has been very good each time I've went. I have no complaints with their menu items. I really do try to order new things each time I go. The dessert is very good. You just have to be in the mood to eat sweet. The Red Velvet cheesecake is one of my classic favorites. The pecan pumpkin cheesecake is super good for those who enjoy pumpkin and/or sweet potato pies! The carrot cake cheesecake..well, after you eat this one, you'll end up in your dentist's chair not too soon after (it's way too sweet).  The Salmon dishes are always one of my faves. Their pizzas are OK. Their pasta is good and filling. Their crab wontons (appetizer) are very good. The crab/artichoke dip (appetizer) is the bomb! Their fruit smoothies taste fresh and refreshing. I look forward to future dining experiences at Cheesecake!"
Pankaj B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",21,29,,2.0,3/1/2014,"When you tell someone at carryout that it will be ready in 15 minutes and then 15 minutes later you tell them 30 minutes, then you've lost my business.  Especially when you know it's busy and everyone else at the carryout area seems to be waiting just as long."
Deanna J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",67,93,3,3.0,9/8/2011,The three stars is an average between a couple of  times I was a patron: On 9/3 - 4 STARS - I got roped into coming to this place again. This time I was prepared...I brought a book to read while waiting. However; Gabrielle was our server this time and the experience was anything but awful. Redeemed! Gabrielle is a stellar waitress! She made our experience wonderful. She was attentive and VERY friendly. My BF even took the time to compliment her on her outstanding customer service (which I had never seen him do before). If only all restaurants could have a server like Gabrielle! :) On 8/29 -  1 STAR (for Perry's assistant) - The service (meaning the service Perry provided) is horrid with the exception of Perry's helper. There was a 23 min wait just to get refills! I was adamant I was not going to come back.
P C.,"San Francisco, CA",1,219,111,3.0,4/15/2012,Its a good place for a big plate of food . It is a big beautiful room as well. The menu is hugh as you already know if you have been to a Cheese Cake Factory. This however is the biggest Cheese Cake Factory I have ever seen. WOW
Eileen H.,"Concord, CA",344,329,94,3.0,3/14/2011,"Went to this location two weeks in a row, and I've decided it's not that great.  While they have a huge menu, and generous portions, the food isn't exceptionally good.  Last time we were there I ordered one of my go-to dishes for the Cheesecake Factory, the chicken marsala, and it was a little dry, and lacking in flavor.  I was sad.  And then I had the Oreo cheesecake, and THAT was dry!  Talk about adding insult to injury.   Oh, and if you're looking for a place to have a nice, intimate date-type dinner, forget it.  It's SO loud in there, you can barely hear the person next to you. I think it's really cool that this CF has a huge outdoor seating area with a fire pit and heating lamps.  They also get one extra star because they make a mean lemon drop.  I'd go back just for that."
Rose C.,"Richmond, CA",0,11,2,2.0,11/15/2014,"I used to like this place.  In fact, it was one of my favorites.  Not today!  It was a very disappointing experience.  The food looked good at first glance but the taste was horrible.  It was too salty!  We only had a few bites but immediately felt sick. We just felt sluggish and nauseated.  By the way, we ordered the spicy cashew chicken-too salty, bang bang chicken and shrimp-not enough meat and too sweet, and tex meg eggroll-greasy and looked like it was deep fried twice.  We wont be coming back!"
Steven P.,"Danville, CA",17,260,22,4.0,3/22/2009,"Great food, excellent decor, excellent outside seating for the area, and nice staff.  Bad part...everyone else knows this also, so getting ready to wait! Waiting for an hour to 2 hours is not uncommon here. Better to get a pager about an hour before you really want to eat and go shopping. By the time you get back you might only have to wait 15 mins!  Nice entrance in the parking garage. The place reminds me of a Grand Lux cafe. Very classy and nice inside. LARGE!  Fun place to be with friends. Huge menu to choose from. Try the outdoor seating....not bad!"
Daisy M.,"Vallejo, CA",244,104,,4.0,7/31/2011,"Portions are huge as well as the variety of plates they serve here. Waits a tad long, but there's forever 21 across the street (you can shop whilst waiting). FAVES: Dulce De Leche Cheesecake Wild Mushroom Burger"
