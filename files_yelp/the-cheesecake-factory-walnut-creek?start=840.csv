K G.,"Sacramento, CA",138,14,,4.0,3/1/2014,Came down to celebrate a good friend's bday last night. Loved the thai lettuce wraps & firecracker salmon! The highlight of the night was their signature asian pear martini!! Best martini creation I've ever had & it instantly became a fav for the bday girl. Waitress was super nice even during our moments of silliness. Celebration was a success.
Daniel D.,"Concord, CA",827,462,315,4.0,7/16/2011,"B -- S -- Conveniently located in downtown Walnut Creek across Century Theaters and only a few blocks from Broadway Plaza -- Limited street parking but there is a garage connected with valet -- Menu is HUGE! They have a variety of choices -- Service is hit or miss -- Free fresh & hot wheat & sourdough bread So surprised that I haven't reviewed this place, but here it is! 5 minute wait for 2 on a Friday night around 6:30pm?! Intially we were just going to check the wait time, but we ended up staying. Our server was Jerod S. and he was excellent. Very attentive and fast, I'm sure he had at least 5 tables. He checked on us and filled up my water a few times. Our food: -- House salad w/ranch: fresh mixed greens and cucumbers, no tomatoes. should have added some carrots, but it was very good. I was happy with it and even shared with my GF. -- Thai lettuce wraps: wow what a surprise! Pretty good Thai flavors for a chain like this. My GF ordered this and out came a huge plate of lettuce leaves, chicken, carrots, noodles, bean sprouts, and 3 different sauces. I enjoyed the peanut sauce which was very nutty and had a little kick of spice. Overall the ""appetizer"" was very fresh and satisfying. -- Smokehouse BBQ Burger: Bun was a bit crunchy, but otherwise it was good. I poured the small cup of bbq sauce onto my burger. it was smokey and sweet. In general the burger was pretty delicious, a bit heavy but hey it's a burger, right?! I got a side of ranch and that topped it off. The fries were way TOO SALTY! I ended up not even eating them.  -- Lemon raspberry cheesecake: I'm not a big fan of cheesecake but this one was pretty good. My GF says its not as ""cheesecakey"" because it has some regular cake baked in. The raspberry sauce is pretty tangy and offers a contrast to the fresh lemon taste.  Defintely a very positive experience here. The $40 bill was normal considering everything we ate and it was satisfying. No complaints here, glad to have had a good date on a Friday night :)"
Christine P.,"San Francisco, CA",606,676,616,3.0,3/7/2009,"Woohoo!  Cheesecake factory in the WC!    I had been so begging my husband to take me here so I can stuff myself with what else? The cheescake!  Yumm... So Finally, after much pleading,  My husband and I stopped by for lunch yesterday.   I marched happily up to the hostess and she told me that there would be a 20 minute wait.  Not bad for a busy Friday.  My husband and I waited outside next to the cute waterfall with a small firepit on top.  The 20 minutes passed quicker than I expected and we were brought to our seats in their outside patio.   It was Freezing outside but I was fine with it.  Our waitress, greeted us and took our order.   My husband asked for hot water to keep us warm and bread to satisfy our hunger before our entrees arrived.  Like others experienced, we waited forever for our drinks and bread.  Our entrees arrived before our water, bread did.  It was poor service but our waitress apologized for taking so long.  Whatev... I was OK with it since our food was there and I was happy. My husband however, wasn't as forgiving.   The food was good - I usually order the Miso Salmon which is yummy!  And I topped it off with the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake.   I will be back but will probably wait a few more months until the staff settles in and gets it together."
Jessica K.,"Augusta, GA",366,1203,1284,2.0,3/13/2009,"It pain me to give this place two stars but it is a well deserved 2 stars considering the fact that's it's been open for over a month now... Front desk staff was polite and sat us instantly. +1 The table didn't have the proper silverware.  -1 The server didn't come to the table for 10+ minutes and I""m not exaggerating. I finished reading the menu and when I looked up, there was still no one there. -1 Iced tea came with no lemon or orange as requested. -1 Calamari and Ahi Carpaccio arrived to the table in timely manner. +1 My Scampi/Steak Diane combination was cooked rare and I was never given a choice of tempurature to begin with but assumed it would come out at least medium. Rare? -1 Server didn't bring sauce on side as requested but rather left for the day and had another server take care of us instead. -1 A crowd of servers were gossiping right in front of our table and we couldn't get out to wash our hands. -1 Our new server was a dream compared to the last and I'm happy he was the one to receive the tip. We didn't stay for dessert so I couldn't comment on the uber fattening desserts that would otherwise make me melt into the seats from joy."
Rey D.,"Solano, CA",20,16,16,5.0,10/20/2013,The food and atmosphere are good and no comment as far as the service is concern. But I would not patronize this place again since I found out the they don't honor our troops.
David O.,"Walnut Creek, CA",127,1282,937,5.0,2/22/2009,"So at long last, the Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek is officially open!   I made sure that my wife and I were there on Saturday for a lunchtime orgy of food!  :) We actually got here about 12:30 PM and the wait for a table was about 30 minutes, so we gave our name, got a pager, and proceeded over to the bar where I ordered their Well Mannered Dirty Martini, a beautiful Ketel One martini with 2 blue cheese stuffed olives.   Excellence!  My wife's was the designated driver for the day so she went with an Arnold Palmer. We actually got paged within 15 minutes, so we carried our drinks over to our table.   We were lucky enough to get a table outside right next to the fountain.   Can I say that they did some kickass job in interior design to turn what was an Andronico's into the much celebrated (by me, anyhow) opulent restaurant chain?!?   The ceiling inside looks absolutely stunning.  The only surprising thing, actually, was that they didn't opt to take the whole space left vacant by Andronico's.   I'm certain they could have easily filled it!   Who knows?  Perhaps a staffing issue... Anyhow, back at our table, the waitress was extremely friendly.  In fact, my wife remarked our spectacular that all the staff, despite the fact that this was their opening weekend, was so smiling and friendly.  Having opened restaurants herself, she said that's quite rare...  We ordered all kinds of foods:  Fried macaroni & cheese, Buffalo Blasts, Chicken Sliders with fries, and the Sheperd's pie.   In between the chaos, I managed to sneek in another Martini that got me nicely buzzed... Who can go wrong with 2 martini lunches, right?   Our food eventually arrived and, while it certainly took a little while, all of our dishes were absolutely gorgeous and we, of course, had much too much food that we ended up with 4 to-go boxes.   Perfect, we thought... Dinner's taken care of!"
Joy P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",47,62,6,5.0,6/23/2013,Lunched with my daughter today.  Her salad was excellent but mine was not.  So why 5 stars?  Because of the excellent customer service I received when I complained.  Our waitress (Laura C) immediately took it to the manager and they checked the dressing still being served to other customers to be sure there wasn't a problem with that.  They offered to either replace it or take the charge off my bill - whichever I preferred.  They were pretty busy (Sunday lunch crowd) but she took time to deal with this efficiently and professionally.
Tiffany C.,"San Francisco, CA",2,32,,1.0,3/27/2011,"1 star is pretty drastic considering I came in here fully prepared to give 5, and considering the hype plus the fact that this place is always packed. One star for the friendly hostesses and reasonable wait, and maybe a half star for the beautiful interior.  The service was abysmal for the amount we paid. Not a single ""How's the food?"" or ""Anything else I can get you guys?"" during our meal. Seriously?! I get paid more attention to at a fucking Denny's. In fact, the only time we were graced with our server's rare and precious presence was when he dropped our food off and when we got the bill. I could understand if I was with a big party and things were hard to keep track of, but it was just the two of us: one appetizer, one entree to split. We had to flag down three different people  to get more bread.  The hibachi steak was okay but really generically ""Asian"" tasting and extemely salty, kind of reminiscent of Panda Express. It also arrived without a steak knife so we made do with the butter ones. The size of the portion for the sweet potato fries was good, but we had exactly two spears of fried asparagus for the other side.  As for atmosphere, yes, it's beautiful. I didn't mind the low lighting and I loved the hanging glass lamps and murals. But there was only one word that came to mind ambiance-wise: CACOPHONOUS. Babies crying. Dishes clattering. Beyonce blaring. The preteen girl at the table next to us shrieking incomprehensibly. Mind you, I love the chatter of happy families and laughter at restaurants. But my ears are still ringing. It might just be the architecture of the building, but I haven't expierenced something like that since being in my high school cafeteria. As one Eric Cartman might say, ""Screw you guys, I'm going home""."
Ree G.,"Alameda, CA",0,15,,3.0,3/27/2016,"Came perfectly early, around the time it opened. We were greeted quickly and professionally and seated right away. Beautiful atmosphere  in the inside/outside, clean and felt comfortable over all. Our waitress was excellent, she did a great job, from constantly checking up on us, and bringing our food right away. Now as for the important part, the food was okay, basically went for some appetizers only, it felt like I could of bought something similar from the frozen section of a grocery store and just placed it in the oven or fryer. For example the buffalo wings, and fried shrimp. The fried calamari was decent, virgin strawberry daiquiri tasted good, and our cheesecake topped with strawberry and whipped was fantastic. I can't forget the bread they serve to you once you are seated is also very good, too. Will definitely be coming back for the cheese cake and will be making sure we come around the time it opens because this place gets  busy quick."
Ryan F.,"Lafayette, CA",9,16,,2.0,3/13/2011,"Last summer, I'd come here with a few friends after class/work once a week for happy hour.  Drinks and appetizers are both cheap and decent, if you don't mind simple things like nachos and fried foods.  The service at happy hour is good, if only because there's nobody else there.   Flash forward to last week - even though it was a weekend night, we managed to snag three seats at the bar.  None of the bartenders so much as acknowledged our presence.  At first, I just ascribed it to them being busy and understaffed, but when they started taking orders from multiple parties who showed up after us, who were squeezing between our seats to reach the bar, we got pissed.  There's no excuse for that.   Only when my friend literally reached out across the bar and put her hand right in front of an incompetent/reluctant bartender's face did we finally get to order our drinks.  Another ten-fifteen minutes later, we were paid enough attention to order appetizers, which didn't arrive until we were nearly done with our second drinks (which thankfully only took eye contact, pointing and 'Hey, another round?' to order).   Summary: There are plenty of better, healthier, less crowded places around WC, but why would you want all that when you can come here and get one plate to yourself with enough food to feed a starving family?  One star for filling, greasy food; I just can't deny you or your guilt.  One star for my nostalgia and summer happy hours."
Victor L.,"Concord, CA",117,43,,3.0,4/27/2014,"Usually came here for happy hours but lately service has been crappy to us and they took off the fried calamari which were out favorites. The Chicken Sliders are good but rather have some type of fried seafood since I am a big seafood guy. There is crab and artichoke dip but I ordered it before and it never appealed to me, Waiting time for table was sometimes quick or sometimes 15 mins at most. Service was good in the beginning but then it got worse and worse as if the servers didn't want to help us when we asked nicely."
Genna N.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,30,5,4.0,4/27/2014,"Their food is good. But not for the price.  The ambience is perfect for a date.  If you're sitting outside, dont let them sit you far from a heater. I was freezing. Asked my boyfriend to ball with cheesecake. It was delicious!"
Sia B.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",17,11,,4.0,4/22/2014,Besides having to wait forever outside in the cold for a table this place is great and very beautiful and upscale. Perfect restaurant to have a birthday dinner or anniversary! The service was great! Our waitress defiantly got a huge tip.
EJ N.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,96,1,5.0,12/24/2011,Been eating at this Cheesecake Factory and others for 10 years. The food and service are always good. My favorites: Cajun Jambalaya Pasta  Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna  Chicken Piccata  Burgers I'm not big on cheesecake but the Linda's fudge cake is awesome.
Estet W.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,5,,5.0,5/30/2015,"The best hamburger I ever tasted - served on a brioche bun. The quality of the meat was superb and no ketchup.or mustard was necessary. The cheese cake was out of this world delicious though we were so full we took it to go for later (I had the dark chocolate and my friend the vanilla bean). The portions were generous, service was spot-on and although a tad pricey, I felt we had received our money's worth."
Mark Z.,"Concord, CA",6,49,,4.0,6/13/2011,"Food is great, presentation is good too. Service is great, sometimes you have to catch the waitress by her dress or she will pass by really quickly. Good for dates, not so good for kids."
Ron T.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,7,,3.0,5/24/2015,"I would give the Cheesecake Factory a higher rating is it was not so loud. When crowded, for people with sensitive hearing, it's difficult to have a conversation. I know that there is a demand for loud restaurants. Not sure why. Other then that the food is good and the service is first rate. The prices are reasonable."
Alex Y.,"Sacramento, CA",3,7,1,5.0,10/4/2012,"Great service, nice waitress, good atmosphere."
Delo J.,"Oakley, CA",5,24,,4.0,2/4/2014,Foods ok but the get the stars because all there cheesecake is good top 3 1) Dulce De Leche 2) Red Velvet 3) Oreo  cant miss on any of those cheesecakes
Stizo X.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",481,55,88,5.0,5/21/2014,"Location location location.  Love the outdoor patio with fire/water feature.  Great for people watching or being seen.  Nice garden like feel.  Our waiteesa was super friendly and the dishes were delish.  Drinks were kinda soft, but perhaps I like them too strong.  Pricey, but worth it."
