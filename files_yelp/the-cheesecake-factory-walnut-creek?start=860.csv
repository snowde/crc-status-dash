Lidia A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,9,,5.0,5/14/2015,"Very impressed how friendly and accommodating for a party of five, including an 1yr old and a 3yr the stuff was. We went on Tuesday night without reservation and even if the place was busy we got in in less than 10 minutes.The service was great, the food was very tasty ( I loved the grilled salmon),the kids were treated with lot of courtesy and at the end we experienced a great treat from the stuff: they all gathered and sang Happy Birthday for the 1 yr old.It was a Wonderful experience."
Laney N.,"Antioch, CA",4,19,,1.0,1/21/2015,"We ate here for the second time this last Friday night. The only reason we came here is our family gave us gift cards. This place is a mad house! It is so crowded, the menu is overwhelming, and the food is not that good. During our wait we went to the bar and ordered drinks. On the menu, under the heading ""On The Rocks"" was a Ruby Red Sunrise drink, which we ordered since we like our drinks on the rocks. I noticed the female bartender (light hair, pony-tail, large frame) starting to blend some drinks and I said to my husband, she's blending our drinks. When she served us the drinks, I said, we ordered our drinks over the rocks. She gave us a very rude glare and grabbed the drinks and said, they are flash blended. I said, but they are supposed to be on the rocks, that's what the menu says, correct? She rudely started to make new drinks, when I said, don't worry about it, we'll take the drinks, she rudely said, I already started making you new drinks. I insisted it was okay, because I felt so bad that she was so visually bothered by this. She gave us the original drinks back.  The drink was really good, but, be sure to tell them you want it on the rocks, because the menu does not say flash blended. Oh and BTW it is so dark you need a flashlight to see the cocktail menu. Never going here again."
Sandra S.,"San Pablo, CA",206,506,145,3.0,12/20/2010,A chain is a chain is a chain is a chain.  I'm not big into chains but sometimes they serve their purpose. Chains are nothing my go to eatery because I'm a pescatarian. Options don't run thick here. But...I was at the right place at the right time. Came here with my Cali BFF for dinner. We sat at the outside patio and it was nice and warm but chilli.  Our waitress Tess was the best. I ordered Garlic Noodles w/shrimp. I wasn't too fond of the shrimp as it had that fishy taste to it.  The noodles also lacked the garlic but it was very good. It also included my favorite vegetable...asparagus. YAY!
Hannah L.,"Concord, CA",0,3,,4.0,7/31/2013,"I love the cheesecake factory, everything I have ordered is really good. Its is a lil' expensive though. I like to get the Renee's special, you get a good sized bowl of soup, a salad, and a big hunk of sandwich. I get the turkey sandwich option, and I for an extra dollar I get a caesar salad instead of a green one. All that for only 11 bucks or something. The cheesecake is super rich, so I always ask for it to go, then eat the entire slice upon my arrival home. I want them to think Im not a fat ass, cause I can guarantee you I probably ate my entire entree. Weeee!!!! Oh one weird thing, I was there today and there was a Dad like, force feeding his toddler spaghetti by just jamming it into the kids mouth, even though the lil rascal was gagging on it then crying. Wtf."
Ivan D.,"Concord, CA",28,295,665,4.0,6/24/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek really jazzed up the place with their artistic decor.  For appetizers we tried their fresh avocado and chips, but was a little disappointed.  At $10 i was expecting it to taste more fresh and tastier, but still good.  Their corn fritters from their ""smaller menu"" is always a hit, comes with a sante fe type dip that has a minor kick.  The garlic sausage w/ mashed potatoes is top notch out of all the appetizers tonight.  Very tasty, could have ordered a couple of these and have that as my entree for the night.  My main dish was the Jamaican chicken & shrimp (see my pic)  It was very tasty and also had a kick, but a tad too saucy.  Otherwise excellent dish to try.  And for dessert we went the opposite way of the cheesecake and went with the Strawberry shortcake.  This was very good!  Chased it down with a cup of coffee.. I left the place stuffed and content.  What makes this place great is their variety of food choices on their menu which is as thick as a phone book.  All types of cuisines to choose from and I've hardly found one that I've disliked."
Katie R.,"San Jose, CA",58,60,19,3.0,9/12/2013,"This is your average chain restaurant. Chances are you can find something to eat on their book of a menu, it even has ads... The service is nothing special but it is a good place to go if you can't decide on my type of food when you are going out with a group."
jamie j.,"Walnut Creek, CA",146,249,13,4.0,9/11/2011,"Got an Ice Cream Fudge Sundae for lunch yesterday....it was delicious- hot fudge was brough on the side so that I could pour it on. I was surprised by the size of the sundae.  On a side note, I wish that the Cheesecake Factory would make at least ONE gluten free cheesecake (I am allergic to gluten)"
Leigh-Anne C.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,5.0,4/21/2014,"I am giving 5 stars purely because I had a waiter at this location who was probably the best waiter I have ever had. He was so polite and he was always checking on me, not in an annoying fashion, and he had a very friendly vibe. I asked to see the manager and gave my good word. And the pancakes there are absolutely divine."
Ria R.,"Alameda, CA",84,118,176,2.0,11/29/2010,"Is it just me or is the food at this Cheesecake Factory not the same as other locations? Dont get me wrong, the menu is the same. The atmosphere is the same. Although seating is generally quicker at this location, (I've been to this one Walnut Creek more than a dozen times) the food just isnt the same. Everytime I come here, they bring out the food at different timing so usually one person in our party or group has to eat before us or gets their food later than the rest of us.  The food is warm at best, not piping hot (whereas the SF atop Macys location, the plates actually burn your hand if your not careful). After a few bites I generally dont want more and there has never been a time anyone in our group including myself, has been eager to box and take home left overs, which is strange since we usually like taking home Cheesecake factory leftovers.  I've tested this theory. I went with my sister to the SF location a couple days after frequenting the Walnut creek location and big difference. Theres a longer wait but the food is just hotter, better and more tastier.  I dont know, but I generally avoid this location now. It just doesnt feel like a place I'm eager to get back to. Hope this helps."
Justine B.,"Placerville, CA",1,15,1,5.0,3/8/2014,"Went for my 18th and 21st birthday and some other occasional event. I am always satisfied with their service. Even though the wait can be long but reserve it in advance or just hangout by the outdoor heater, fire, bar, or shopping center around the restaurant. For my 21st, I had myself a chicken Marsala mushroom, Georgia Peach and Sex on the Beach cocktail, and three choices of appetizers for my 21st, it was worth the cost plus the employees sang me a happy birthday. Be prepared for the loud noises  throughout the meal conversation."
Greg B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",89,33,16,3.0,6/18/2011,"This place has a cool vibe...almost ""Vegas"" style, well maybe.  The food is pretty good and they serve very large portions if you're in to eating a lot of food.  Good place to bring the family and kids with large booths available. Have a good selection of drinks and I find their beer to be nice and cold. I like the outside seating area and the fire coming from the water features.  I typically only go to the Cheesecake Factory if I'm shopping on this side of town or heading to a movie.  Otherwise, for me Walnut Creek has a lot of local restaurants that I find far more appealing."
Marie W.,"Martinez, CA",36,174,,4.0,6/16/2011,"Wait here sucks... They are usually very busy in the late evening, after 6pm. The food, the drinks, and the service are very good. If you don't mind the wait. I have had many different dishes, none have been bad. I like vodka and they have a really good vodka and raspberry drink I like to order.  My only annoyance with Cheesecake factory is, they have too many choices. I have been to three different locations, all with good food and service, all with the thousand choice menu. Trying to make a choice, takes time. Everything looks so good, everything tastes so good.  I have only had the cheesecake once, that was in the Fresno Mall location, we had to share. Four ladies, two pieces, so rich and after a good meal, only room for a couple of bites. Both slices were good."
Phuong B.,"Concord, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/17/2015,"Have you ever had those experiences where you give a restaurant another try thinking that this time it will be different, and the last horrible experience you had was just a one off? Well, I've given this restaurant way too many, each time hoping the same thing.  After the last experience, no more. Not only did I have to wait 45 minutes after they had told me the wait time was 15 minutes, they served me raw chicken. Yes, raw chicken wings with red juices flowing out after I took a bite. With the lights being so dim, I was lucky to have noticed it so early on. I could have eaten the whole thing and gotten sick. Not only that, when I told the server the manager came explaining to me they will over cook the replacement to ensure it won't be raw again but it may be a little dry.  Ummm...how about cooking it correctly? Anyways, long story short, I didn't get to eat dinner with my family, took my chicken to go cause it took so long, paid for all my food including the raw chicken, and did not get even an apology.  One star is way too many stars for this place."
Colleen K.,"Martinez, CA",5,15,,2.0,1/19/2016,"Arrived at 7PM on a Monday evening.  The placed was packed.  Was informed it would be 30 minutes and we were seated 30 minutes after arrival.  We were seated for 12 minutes before server came and took our drink orders. It was another 10 minutes until the drinks arrived.  At that point we ordered our food, steak medallions over mash potatoes with tomatoes and asparagus for me and fried shrimp platter with fries and cole slaw for the hubby.  35 minutes later the food arrived.  10 minutes into eating the server showed up with a steak knife for me.  The food was luke warm.  The cole slaw was dripping in mayonnaise.  We did not order dessert because we were not willing to wait given how long the rest of the meal had taken.  Not the best service, but in all fairness to the server, it appeared as if there was not enough staff scheduled to handle the size of the crowd in the restaurant.  Overall, ok food that is a little on the pricey side for the quality, slow service, and very noisy atmosphere.  Note to self:  Don't go back!"
Rochelle R.,"Sacramento, CA",219,84,55,2.0,8/30/2011,I've ate at different cheesecake locations and this one in service was the worst.  I sat for 15 minutes without a server stopping by.  Finally we tagged one down that had the 20 top next to us.  She kindly helped us and took our order.  Everything after the wait came out rather quickly.  I would have given it a 1 star if the service after the fact wasn't good.   The food was good as this was dinner and I had ordered a chicken and avocado club.  The fries weren't crispy like I had requested so they weren't good.   The location of the Cheesecake Factory is ideal if you are shopping in down town Walnut Creek or seeing a movie.  The parking near it sucks because no one seems to know how to park or drive int he parking structure.   I didn't have any cheesecake but I have at other locations.
Mitra W.,"Concord, CA",59,227,115,3.0,3/11/2013,"The service was good.  The food was good too.  We ordered the Tuna tartar and the corn fritata and burgers.  Like I said, everything was good.  I did find a hair in my burger.  The staff was very apologetic and the shift manager made it a point to come by and say they were very sorry.  They promptly made me a new burger and comped my meal.  Not sure we'll be going back though.  The only reason we were there in the first place was because I won $100 gift card at work."
Jamie L.,"Oakland, CA",340,688,472,4.0,12/15/2010,"Came here after the Yelp Elite Event at Élevé ( ) with Jessica M. (now B.) and her +1, Rebecca B. We had the drinking munchies, coined by Jessica. I haven't been to the WC's Cheesecake Factory. To be honest, it is no different from the one in Union Square. Its just on the ground and has fountains with its outside seating.  The service was okay, however, their desserts, hit the spot that cold evening. Jess and Becca split a hot fudge sundae. While I ordered myself a gluttonous slice of their Reese Pieces Cheesecake. I can't review their dish, but mine was a heaping mountain of everything bad but oh so good for me. The texture was rich. The taste screamed out every guilty feeling of consumption, but for that moment I really did not give.  I like Cheesecake Factory, but if I had to place it on places I would go, I would have to put it on the same list as like Buckhorns or CPK. Rarity attendance but occasional appearance."
Loran B.,"Pittsburg, CA",26,1,5,2.0,10/9/2010,"I want to share 2 experiences at this particular Cheesecake Factory.  I actually like the chain in general, but this particular one had to be talked about.   #1.  First visit was in December 2009 for my mother's birthday.  Everything was fine as far as the wait and the seating.  But the silverware was filthy!!  I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, but my mother did.  So we spoke with the manager and he gave us free appetizers and of course, new silverware. Because the restaraunt is so nice, and I love the ambiance I decided to sweep that one under the rug. #2.  Second visit was September 27, 2010, my birthday.  Again everything was fine until we opened up the silverware...DIRTY again but this time food crumbs were in the napkin as well as the bottom of the water glasses.  When we told the waiter he just gave us new silverware and a new water glasses.  He never apologized, or tried to restore our confidence in eating there.  He obviously didn't care, right?? So that's it for the Cheesecake Factory in Walnut Creek, perfect example of judging the book by it's cover.     And another thing, the waiters wear all white from head to toe.  You would think they would set a standard on the cleanliness of the shoes.  Because some of the waiters dingy, busted tennis shoes threw off the clean look."
Steve C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,96,7,3.0,10/4/2012,"It drives me nuts when they won't seat you yet you look around and there are empty tables everywhere.  We wanted to sit outside where there were a lot of empty tables or in the bar area where there were a lot of empty tables but were told no.  They had not scheduled servers for those tables that evening.  Service was poor from our server, but the manager kept stepping in, so at least we were ok.  Is it the server's fault for not doing his job well or the management's job for not staffing enough people for the crowds they always seem to get?  I don't really know but they don't take reservations if you are wondering."
Marcus M.,"Ventura, CA",767,138,332,3.0,10/22/2010,"Okay soo neither location's Fashion Valley nor Otay Ranch are as big as the square footage or height of the ceilings as this place! So out of all Cheesecakes this particular location has significance. From what our waitress explained, the guy who started the chain went to UC Berkley and is from actually from Walnut Creek where this location sits. He decided to make this one different since it's in Walnut Creek. ""One of the nicest ones in his own backyard."" I guess you could say. In my opinion, the one in Huntington Beach is exceptionally nice too. As soon as we sat down we glanced at the menu. Surely, the menu is the same at all location's. For appetizers, we ordered the Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll which was pretty good. For main Entrees we ordered the Beef Ribs with onion strings and french fries, and the Philli Cheesesteak with fries. Both were good, but not something to do cartwheels in the restaurant for. Nice place for groups."
