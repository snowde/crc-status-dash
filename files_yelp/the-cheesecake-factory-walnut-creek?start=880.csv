Eleanor D.,"Hercules, CA",143,148,171,3.0,11/15/2010,"Even though this cheesecake is 1. Less crowded ( There's no wait like in SF) 2. Has a nicer decor. 3. And has a great patio seating 4. Has fresh warm bread. (in SF it was cold) But for some reason the food i received here was less tasty.   I thought that my Parmesan crusted chicken was drenched in sauce. It made it soggy not crunchy, When i remembered the description saying ""lightly sauced"" .. Hmm... on the bright side they give HUGE portions"
Barb B.,"Martinez, CA",1,24,,1.0,12/16/2012,Service at walnut creek Cheesecake Factory is the worst!  We sat outside in the patio waiting for our seats and never once did the waitress ask if we wanted drinks.  Then I went inside and the manager said to help yourself and order at the bar.  There were 12 of us definitely not enough room to stand at the bar!  What are the waitresses/servers for??? Get rid of the current manager!!
Jack S.,"Discovery Bay, CA",0,12,1,4.0,6/21/2012,"I e-mailed the restaurant about our experience and received a phone call from the manager, she was truly sorry for what had happened,  Yes we will go back and a extra 2 stars for how they handled the situation."
Alex W.,"Danville, CA",39,13,3,4.0,5/29/2011,"Very good food. Appetizers are amazing and the burgers are very tasty. The salads are kinda gross but overall great food and will eat here again. The service can be a little slow at times so be warned, its easy to fill up on bread and appetizers."
Kevin W.,"Concord, CA",431,214,62,4.0,7/13/2011,"When you first walk in, the decor is overwhelming and makes you feel as if you were in a casino. Anyways, going to the food part... When I'm craving a lunch salad, I usually come here for their Salad Lunch Specials. I always get the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad Lunch Portion and it's usually huge. Also it's pretty much the same size as the dinner portion (maybe just a smidge smaller) and is only 10 bucks.  Also, I recently found out that Cheesecake Factory had happy hour specials on their appetizers. 5 dollars for an appetizer? I'm there."
Kristen Z.,"Salinas, CA",7,1,,5.0,1/9/2014,They have the greatest nachos ever here. The customer service is impeccable and the cheesecakes are to die for. I've never had a bad experience while eating here. The servers have always been exceptional and gone above and beyond with our needs. Definitely recommend.
Jenny F.,"San Francisco, CA",14,91,,3.0,11/21/2010,"I have been here several times and each time is a different experience.  The first time I went and sat outside.  Our server ignored us and attended the tables around us more frequently than ours.  Another time, they brought out all the dishes for a large party (about 15) and they mixed two of the dishes up.  So we had to let the rest of the party eat while my friend and I sat there awkwardly eyeing the other food.  They offered us some soup, but that took them as much time as our dinner did.  Lunchtime service has been wonderful and prompt, but only in small parties.  Dinner has always been a bust service-wise.   The food is always delicious, so it is difficult to boycott based on service alone.  I love the herb crusted salmon -- great flavor on the salmon and a citrus cream sauce that goes well with the potatoes.  Key Lime Cheesecake is fresh and simple.  It compliments the elaborate and flavorful main courses well. I wish my experience was more consistently pleasant with service, but their food is so dang good I cant help wanting to go back."
Liane T.,"San Francisco, CA",73,69,,5.0,8/22/2011,"To disclaim, this review is strictly for Customer Service. I've been to many Cheesecake Factories so it's easy to say most of them are the same. This is true, for the most part, seeing that the chain is (for the most part) consistent with their quality of food. What I want to say that makes this different from some is the excellent customer service they have. And by this I mean not only the waitstaff but the managers. On the occasions I've been here, I've seen at least one manager working with customers and I feel that's a great reflection of the restaurant ownership. Even when a dish was taking too long, one of the managers from the kitchen came out and personally apologized and offered a soup or salad while we were waiting.  Kudos, management. You guys are doing an awesome job. Oh and Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake for anyone that needs to try something new next time!"
Grace L.,"San Diego, CA",1143,621,560,3.0,8/18/2010,"After being out of town for the entire weekend and missing out on all the drunken fun, I was happy to have come home to celebrate one thing: Lovie's birthday! We ended up walking around Walnut Creek Monday afternoon with Lovie, his twin bro and their mom and dad. This is where we had our early dinner. We were seated outside to enjoy the nice warm weather. The boys ordered their heffs and we ordered our iced teas. I also mentioned to our waiter that we were celebrating birthdays. Later on, we see someone get sung to, and Lovie's bro says, ""Dammit, Grace...now they're going to have to sing to us too."" I smirked :-) The food was about as good as expected from Cheesecake. Very very good avocado rolls for the appetizer. My fish tacos were really good and plentiful that I had to ask for a box. Lovie enjoyed his flat iron steak despite looking a little minuscule than he wanted. Then came the singing.... They gave out complimentary little champagne flutes filled with ice cream sundaes and a candle on top. And when the singing started, brother's face was priceless. I said out loud, ""I need a picture of this!"" He says, ""Don't you dare put these on facebook!"" I smirked once again."
Ken B.,"Brentwood, CA",14,36,,4.0,4/28/2011,"I have to say that our late night visit here exceeded my expectations. Yes they have very large portions. They are not cheap.  I loved the decor but some might think it over the top.  Our server, I wish I could remember her name, was EXCELLENT. she had ownership having worked there for 4 years. She knew the menu and gave real suggestions. She was also on top of things and personable without being overbearing.  I had a Santa Fe Salad which I enjoyed. Acutally my wife and I both enjoyed it. The dressing was tangy and delicious. She got a Pasta and that ended up coming home as a leftover. We really enjoyed the cheesecake slice we shared as well, white chocolate raspberry, delish.  It stays open until 11pm on weeknights (this is late for anywhere out of the city).  The menu was a bit overwhelming but I know that if I can get a repeat of the service I had this time I would be happy."
Susan L.,"Concord, CA",15,20,,4.0,12/6/2014,"fabulous food, no matter what i order. my personal favorite is deep fried mac n cheese balls, followed by BBQ salmon and succotash, finishing with chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that the valet parking service they use (signature parking) dropped my Versace sunglasses case out the door and then drove over it. can't make this stuff up... the manager actually admitted that the valet did this. bottom line: best cheesecake ever, wonderful appetizers and entrees as well, friendly servers and fun atmosphere... but don't ever, ever use the valet parking service."
Rachel R.,"Pittsburg, CA",172,138,111,4.0,6/27/2013,I've been here numerous times with my work staff.  The birthday celebrants always choose this restaurant.  Who could blame them with the variety of menu options and dessert choices you can't go wrong!  We always have an amazing hostess and waiter/waitress!  They have great customer service and delicioud food and desserts!  There Chicken Madeira is to die for and my favorite cheesecake is Vanilla Bean!  YUMMY!
Paul H.,"San Francisco, CA",14,3,,1.0,12/25/2013,"I like cheesecake but giving one star just because of the person who picked up the phone to take an order. He was giving me attitude the whole time. Asked him what are the prices for small, medium and large. He answers ""we dont have such sizes"" and no othe comments. Maybe you can tell me what sizes you guys have then? I was pissed off the whole time but still had to place an order because my family really wanted cheesecake for the christmas party.  After getting over it, understanding that it is christmas eve, we went to pick up the cake. Well, we got there and apparently they don't have the cake that we ordered. Guy told me he took it out from the freezer when I was on the phone because it takes about and hour and a half for it to defrost. I'm not sure how they lost the cake.  I can go on and on about how he gave an attitude but I will stop. I dont write reviews much but I had to because me and my family were extremely mad and disappointed at a restraunt that we enjoyed dining just because of that one person."
Oh Y.,Bay Area,0,28,7,2.0,3/6/2011,"Quality of food...... It's ""OK.""  Quantity......""Good."" Service.......F- We were very disappointed with service! We tried weekdays, weekend & evenings! (3 x's)  Different sections. Different servers. I guess being ""grumpy"" is a prerequisite to work there."
Ada F.,"Pasadena, CA",659,313,1421,4.0,11/19/2010,"I have been to the cheesecake factory but on my last visit I tried their Sunday brunch. OMG was it good. I had the energy breakfast without chicken. The waiter was charming and tentative. This location is a little less crowded than the ones I have been to. The decor seems a little nicer, place is cleaner and the patio seating is amazing. The portions seems to be slightly bigger here. I would definitely come back to this location."
Daryll G.,"Mountain House, CA",2,148,8,3.0,1/12/2011,"I've been here a few times and I'm torn about how many stars this place actually deserves.  Let's start with the good. This is the Cheesecake Factory of your dreams. The ones in San Jose are just BLAH. nothing special about them. This location has outdoor seating areas where you can wait 45+mins for a table during dinner hours. The interior is amazing. From the lights down to the stone floors, wood paneling, mosaics, water fountains with fire coming out of it, ceiling fans and space heaters.  The service? It's so-so. Nothing extraordinary. I don't expect too much, simply because this is a huge restaurant, but I do expect a refill for both drinks and bread. The last time we went, we asked for more bread. The server came back and told us that she would bring it out as soon as the next batch was out of the oven. 40 mins later, our meal is over, and she brings us the check and places it next to an empty glass of water. So much for bread. So much for service. But again, not expecting much, it's a big location, but that's no excuse to not refill a beverage.  The servings? HUGE. Worth the price and the wait. Maybe they purposely starve you with a 30+ min wait so you can effectively finish your entire plate."
Matt L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",281,41,13,4.0,1/19/2013,Prices aren't great and the calories are thru the roof but this is a great place. We frequent it for Date Night. The grilled artichoke is our favorite appetizer.
Ty T.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,8,7,5.0,12/6/2013,"I Love the Decor, I Love the Food, and I Love the Atmosphere! The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat. I love their avocado egg rolls. I went there on a Saturday afternoon after doing a little shopping in the area. There was a bit of a wait so I decided to order takeout. My order was ready in 15 minutes. I was happy camper! I love this place!"
Robin L.,"Yorba Linda, CA",610,613,154,4.0,3/23/2009,"Went to The Cheesecake Factory this past Friday night right in the middle of primetime.  Wait was quoted at 75-90 minutes, which I thought was pretty good for a brand new restaurant on a weekend evening.  My bad for telling the hostess we'd take  the first available table.  We ended up at a lovely but FREEZING table on the patio's outer edge.  After trying to warm up with alcohol, we gave up and asked to be moved to a patio table closer to the building, where the heat lamps high above, would help us weather the cold. --Freeze frame or like Evie on Out of this world, stop time--  When we asked to get moved to a different section I was expecting at the very least a disapproving look.  However the hostess and the server were so nice about it; it was really no big deal and even the hostess helped carry our stuff over to the other table. Okay, resume (unfreeze time).... Meal was excellent (Cheesecake Factory food is so consistent isn't it?), service was great and they even sang happy birthday to my friend who to protect the innocent, I will name ""Matilda"" (Betty D.). The restaurant itself is so pretty and all new, so the ambience is lovely rounding out the dining experience. All in all, really nice WC Cheesecake Factory experience.  I know, I know, it's a chain, but like Starbucks, not all Cheescake Factory's are created equal.  This one, like the Pleasanton one, is doing things right. NOTE to WC Cheesecake Factory Management if you're reading: Those tables on the outer edge wouldn't require patrons to wear snow gear with a small adjustment or two?  Standing patio heaters for just those tables or some sort of a wind barrier would probably take care of it--the heaters are just too high to combat the wind chill along those tables"
Juliet H.,"Pinole, CA",170,52,3,3.0,1/15/2013,"I like this place, but I don't have the rabid adoration for it that many of my friends & acquaintances do.  I have had mixed experiences with the food & service here, but the last time I was there, the service was excellent & the food was pretty darn good.  Still, there are lots of other restaurants at the same price point -- or cheaper! -- I'd rather go to almost always.  But now I know what to order when I am attending the inevitable birthday party/wedding dinner/girls' night out thanks to their new Skinnylicious menu (sorry, I almost hurled while typing that!).  I also really liked their reduced fat cheesecake.  It didn't taste like a reduced fat dessert at all, & I loved the walnut crust with the sweet cheesecake.  So no dread on my part for the next event I'll attend here, except in the money department."
