Salonje R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",194,278,41,4.0,9/13/2011,"I am in love with this place but the management is not very friendly nor the hostess's at the counters.  On 2011-09-12, I visited this place with my dear friend Ivan R. and their demeanor, poise, and friendliness was not pleasant and differed depending on the guests that arrived at the restaurant.  The manger (who wore a peahc colored shirt that evening saw me then turned his attention to a group on white women.  STOP BEING A RACIST AMERICA! On a lighter note, the food as always was AMAZING and the passion fruit mojito was just what the doctor ordered (well not really but hey I needed a sip...or 10 last night).  Unfortunately I did not get any cheesecake this time but I do plan to return in the future.  Hopefully management and the hostess will have improved or have been replaced. :-)"
Shahrooz H.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",33,113,16,3.0,8/29/2013,"What happened to the portions? While their prices have stayed relatively the same their portions have shrunk dramatically. Overall it is what it is, nothing special but a good choice if going in a large group since they have something for practically everybody."
Que H.,"Irvine, CA",3,43,2,4.0,10/9/2012,Service and food is great! And of course the vast selection of cheesecakes are worthwhile!
Jory S.,"San Francisco, CA",205,119,2,1.0,12/16/2010,"After a number of tries I have just given up on this place.  I've been a die-hard Cheesecake fan for years but over the past two it seems like the service at most locations has just crumbled and the food quality is becoming increasingly inconsistent.   Besides unnecessarily long waits: went this past weekend for lunch at noon- half the restaurant was empty yet we had to wait 20 minutes for a table??  Testimony of bad management! Food quality is spotty- sometimes good sometimes blah or portion size ebb and flow.  (Tetaki Salad for example- sometimes 4 slices of tuna, sometimes 8 or 9).  Testimony of bad management/ quality control! Service has just been consistantly awful for the past few years at many locations but certainly the Walnut Creek location.  They really seem to hire people who don't know anything about waiting tables, juggling all the details and demands, and people who have no sense of time management.  They really need to evaluate their hiring practices and certainly look into spending more on training!  They consistently deliver slow, aloof, inattentive service over and over.  Testimony of bad management and training development! Take your money and go to a ""mom and pop""- there's so many to choose from in Walnut Creek!"
Adriel H.,"Danville, CA",281,108,9,3.0,7/12/2010,"Compared to other cheesecake factories i have been to, the lighting here is very dark for some reason.  Hard to see in the dim setting, and it has multiple entrances which can be a little confusing.  I came in through the parking garage entrance, and there was no welcoming area where a hostess would be, i had to walk all the way to the main entrance to get a hostess to grab me a table. The waiter service was decent, food was at par with any other cheesecake factory.  I ordered this raw fish thing that came in a tiny little circle which didnt taste as good as other raw fish i have had before."
Emma S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",26,192,133,5.0,10/6/2012,"Um Cheesecake Factory? YES PLEASE! This has got to be my favorite restaurant! Staff are friendly and there's a bunch of stuff on the menu. Although service is slow & slammed, I find it totally worth it. Location is perfect and there's a nice parking lot too. You must eat Cheesecake when you come here! How can you come to a place called the Cheesecake Factory and not eat Cheesecake?????"
Kristen S.,"Oakland, CA",292,158,123,3.0,11/24/2012,"For me, the Cheesecake Factory has a nostalgia factor to it that leads me to eat here  - it is the place that my family went to on special occasions or when we wanted massive amounts of food that would last us for multiple meals. In other words, Cheesecake Factory was a special treat. Unfortunately, Cheesecake Factory no longer has that appeal for me so the only thing that brings me back is to recreate some of that nostalgia. This Cheesecake Factory, as with most others, was super packed, although the wait time for 2 was less than 40min so that was pretty good. The food is usually always well-executed and tastes good, especially for the amount of people that come in. Unfortunately, my dining partner's pork chop was overcooked (this is the reason why I always hesitate to order pork chop at a restaurant like Cheesecake Factory in which they specialize more in foods that can be easily executed and sent out quickly) and the sauce was a bit too sweet. I ordered my go-to favorite  - the gumbo. While the taste was okay, it was a bit too oily and greasy after a while. When it arrived it looked like someone had thrown it all over the plate - presentation was super sloppy. I also found a stray ziti within the rice, which led me to speculate about what else could have accidentally fallen into my food...The appetizer was good though - the buffalo blasts are my absolute favorite! Biting into crunchy pieces of chicken with buffalo juice already mixed in with the meat - delicious! Unfortunately this wasn't the best Cheesecake Factory experience I've had, but for how many people it serves, the food is surprisingly consistent. We ended up opting out of the cheesecake, which for me is actually pretty common - I usually never get cheesecake because I fill up too much on the delicious wheat bread, appetizers even before I reach my entree. Overall, this was just an okay experience!"
Kim G.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,19,,2.0,2/15/2014,My husband and I stopped in here on New Year's Day. The food was not impressive. We ordered some wine and appetizers. The masa corn cakes that the waitress recommended were horrible. The edamame was yellow and cut into 3 inch pieces. Maybe it was just a bad day because people all around us were complaining. We will probably try it again at some point but not for a long time.
Nikia B.,"Concord, CA",61,21,15,5.0,12/22/2012,My food is always hot and enjoyable! Never a dull moment here. I love the ambience. Always great customer service!
Ashley M.,"Austin, TX",154,57,25,2.0,6/6/2010,"The short version: You're better off getting takeout if you're craving this place. DO NOT go here if you have a large party.  Long version: I used to always love going to the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square in SF. Yes, it's a chain and there's always a wait but the food is pretty good and I always have a good time. I've been to the the Walnut Creek location twice now and I've left disappointed on both occasions. The food is just ok and the wait staff is always nice but their problem is with their hosts/hostesses. The first time I went the hostess sat us right away (less than 15 min wait) and apparently didn't tell the wait staff. After almost 20 minutes a waitress walked by and asked us if we'd been helped yet. We said ""no"" and she apologized and said none of the hosts/hostesses had informed her we were in her section.  I decided to go to this same location again for a birthday dinner with friends. I called ahead to try to put my name in since I had 12 people in my party, but they do not take reservations. They informed me I should come early to put my name in and tell my party to arrive later. I showed up over an hour before I told my friends to arrive so I could get my name in and we wouldn't all have to wait. When I said I had a large party the host got his manager and they put my name in the system. I said they would be arriving in over a hour and I came early to get us spot (like they had informed me to do on the phone.) At that time the ENTIRE bar area was empty and nearly every table was open. She said that wasn't a problem and to come speak to her when my party arrived and they would seat us. Score! After waiting in the lobby for over an hour all my friends show up to help me celebrate my bday. I tell the hostess manager my party had arrived, she looked at me like she forgot who I even was. Then she said she'd take a look around and get back to me on how long the wait would be. She came back 5 min later and said it would be over another hour before getting seating. EXCUSE ME, WHAT? Did the conversation we had an hour prior even happen??? My entire group was upset and the hostess manager didn't do ANYTHING to try to alleviate the situation. She basically blew us off. I immediately started calling near by restaurants to see if anyone could fit us in... everywhere else now had over an hour wait too so we just stayed at Cheesecake Factory.  Another hour and a half later we finally got a table! Every other restaurant I've ever been to in my entire life (whether it's fast food or a 5-star restaurant) has given me something when they've screwed up and Cheesecake Factory didn't do anything to help us. A freaking piece of cheesecake would have been nice or even an ""I'm sorry"". :( Not going back to this location again. I recommend getting takeout if you absolutely have to have CF! Giving them two stars cause at least their waiters are nice."
One P.,"San Francisco, CA",20,123,2,1.0,5/7/2011,"I went here to appease family. Impoverished souls who think this place as ""fine dining.""  ICK...the sushi roll appetizer, what part of the salmon did they use, 2x I set the bite down beneath the ""tea"" leaf. The salmon on the salad, barely eat-able (over done and chewy). Call me a city sophisticate or a snob, gladly accept the honors.  To boot, bad service, snotty host, had I not returned to the station to remind them of my request to be reseated 15 min after the 15 min given, no where was I on the list.... Wasted a good linen ensemble on Walnut Creek."
Lisa L.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",1,19,,3.0,1/31/2015,My last few visits have been disappointing. Food came out lukewarm and portions seemed a bit smaller for some odd reason. I guess they are not all that consistent after all.
Alexis O.,"Antioch, CA",113,72,16,4.0,4/2/2011,"I've probably been to this cheesecake factory about 8 times by now.  My first experience with this brand was actually in San Francisco for a late lunch and I fell in love.   I typically come here with my husband or friends.  It's a very loud place, so if you have a sound sensitive baby, this place isn't for you.  Luckily my little 5 monther can take it. I loved loved loved the deep fried olives when they had them for a short time.   The goat cheese salad is very tasty.  The fresh bread is always nice to much on as well. I've tried several items off of the menu so it's always nice coming here because I never know what I am going to get. One thing that is a constant: Pomegranate mojitos.  LOVE THEM here.  Just LOVE THEM. Oh and the red velvet cheese cake, get that to take home."
Arish A.,"Union City, CA",52,47,,4.0,5/1/2011,"I used to come here fairly often. From my experience, service here is fast even when it's bustling with customers, and the ambiance is nice enough. They have huge portions of food for a decent price, but what I like most about this place is feeling the warmth of the fire pits before I go in. I'm not really a fan of desserts and I don't order the normal stuff, but I hear their entrees are good. However, I can tell you that their weight management meal options taste pretty good...which probably means you shouldn't eat the entire thing if you're watching your weight.  Parking can be scarce some days so I recommend carpooling. I always get the weight management meals so I can't really comment on the normal food selection other than that they offer a wide selection of different Americanized ethnic foods."
Aileen G.,"Vacaville, CA",44,39,89,4.0,4/28/2013,love their calamari and strawberry lemonade is so refreshing.  of course...don't forget the awesome cheesecakes!!! forget about counting calories when you come here! Its a treat!
Kat S.,"El Cerrito, CA",24,125,1,3.0,10/11/2010,"Ambiance - Excellent. A great vibe for a corporate shmooze, a romantic table for two, a girl's night out, or just hanging out with some friends. The outdoor seating areas are particularly good for large groups or cocktails.  Service - My waitress (Jennifer) was truely fantastic. I've also never been to a Cheesteak Factory that had particularly bad service. So props there.  Cocktails - Quite good. I had a BlackJack Martini and whoever decided blackberries should make friends with Jack Daniels was a very very smart individual. I also ahd the Pink Lemonade and it was quite tasting.  Food - Eh. First, I echo others' feeling that a menu the size of a novel does not encourage me. I do not need nor want that many options. Just show me what you do well so I'm sure to get something delicious.  We had the Tex-Mex eggrolls to start and they had a nice flavor and were well executed but did not blow me away. I had a special which was a pasta dish with lightly batter fried chicken, prusciutto, baby arugula, and a white sauce. The baby arugula was perfectly sized for biteability (I having to cut apart arugula when it is used in a non-salad dish because the pieces are too big). But all in all, the flavors were fine, but simply ordinary.  This is only my third visit to a Cheesecake Factory (the other two were at the one on Union Square in Frisco), but I have never been blown away by the flavor profiles. It's a step up from Chile's or Applebee's, but for the price, I'd rather go to a local joint that might not have the same level of ambiance, but is more likely to show me something new and fantastic in the cuisine."
John H.,"San Francisco, CA",30,822,93,3.0,10/10/2012,"Lotta choices here and the portions are big and greasy :) Not going to walk away skinny from this place, that's for sure. I had the brioche egg sandwich. I guess my hopes were a bit higher than what I got, which was rather lacking in flavor."
Christina G.,"Martinez, CA",45,55,27,5.0,4/21/2013,"I absolutely love this place it's great all around , food, service, prices are fair for what it is  !"
Erin M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,6,,5.0,1/26/2014,Cheesecake factory is awesome.  The food and service are always consistent.  It's worth the 20 min wait because I always leave happy and satisfied. Plus who can argue with their yummy desserts.
Steve S.,"Concord, CA",61,322,116,4.0,4/16/2011,We have been here several times. I love that you can sit outside by the fire pit and eat. As long as it is nice outside it is very enjoyable. The Food has always been great. But i must say that I'm the biggest cheesecake fan in the world and i have never liked any of the cheesecakes they offer. Costco still has the best!
