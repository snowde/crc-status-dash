Clay S.,"Alamo, CA",0,26,1,4.0,8/30/2013,I like Cheescake Factory ... I did think the service outside could have been better ... love the variety of choices as it makes everyone happy ... sometimes tough to decide.
Joshua F.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",7,35,1,2.0,5/13/2013,We're occasional diners at the Cheesecake Factory but it definitely seems like the direction they're going is bad.  The service is no longer what I'd described as Good.  Food is still ok to good.  It's got a nice patio which seems to be the #1 selling point in our family.
Gigi A.,"Livermore, CA",0,2,,2.0,1/18/2015,"ATTENTION: For those who are gluten free due to Celiac Disease!!! Beware of The Cheesecake Factories! had a celebratory dinner with friends last night at the Walnut Creek Cheesecake Factory.  While the service was excellent and everyone said their food was delicious, I had a bad experience. I have Celiac and HAVE to avoid all sources of gluten or I become ill.  Half way through my ""Angel Hair Shrimp"" pasta entree, which arrived with spiral noodles, I found spaghetti noodles in the mix.  Rather than make a scene and send it back (I had already waited 10 minutes longer than anyone else at the table of 7) I just stopped eating.  We also had to leave for our awards event. There was no time to wait 1/2 hour for another entree. At checkout, I asked the waitress to please alert the cook to this problem.  She said she would, was sorry, and offered to bring me another meal.  That was that!  No contact by a manager or supervisor.  $17.95 for 6 shrimp was a price meal. I have been to other restaurants and had real concern and understanding of the issue with Celiac form the servers and cooks.  Either Cheesecake Factory management doesn't understand the really health concerns and consequences of those who truly can't consume gluten, thinking it is a personal choice and not a medical issue, or they really don't care!  I won't be eating at any Cheesecake Factory again.  My physical pain this am, confirms that I had gluten last night! I think the Cheesecake Factory needs to seriously step up their game with regards to cross contamination. Either that, or take the Gluten Free symbols off their menus and be honest about their food prep practices."
Brittany B.,"Lafayette, CA",3,143,,2.0,9/28/2010,"Dumb.  Stupid american run mass business.  Its curious they hand you a book when you order. Un-comforting since I want a cook who can cook at least 10 things decent, the quality dips into the negative when they can cook over 122435 things.  I ordered a simple salad, w/ dressing on the side. I got a huge-ass bowl of romaine lettuce, skimpy on the cheese and croutons. All for 12 dollars! What a steal. From me. I had to ask them for dressing, which didnt arrive after everyone in my party had managed their way through half their entrees."
Lisa T.,"Concord, CA",1,11,2,3.0,1/16/2014,My husband and I went here for dinner last night. We sat outside which was nice considering it is January. We were greeted right away and she took our drink/appetizer order. We ordered spinach cheese dip which sounded really good. When she came back with our drinks we placed our dinner order. We waited for our spinach dip but our dinner came instead. She never ordered us the dip:(. Dinner was really good my husband had the rib eye with mashed potatoes and I had fried shrimp and we shared a side of asparagus. I needed more cocktail sauce and after asking 3 times I finally got it. We ordered banana cream cheesecake and the dutch apple cheescake togo. When she brought the check she ordered us a turtle pecan cheescake instead of the apple one.  Overall the food was great service couldve been better.
Meg N.,"San Francisco, CA",294,239,42,1.0,6/26/2012,"Come the eff on people.  They close at 11 on Sunday nights. Strolled in here a little before nine with the man adn sat in the bar. Some honest questions for the horrible servers at this place.  1.You see two people seated at a table. No menus, no drinks... whst do you think maybe you should do? 2.You see two people and only one set of silverware.. waht do you think you should do? 3. You take their drink order. 30 minutes later you see they still don't have their drinks... mybe stop haning out over by the pos and grab the drinks sitting at the bar? 4. You take their food order and they request a couple appetizers... maybe bring out two small plates and a second set of silverware for the two people? 5. It's now 10:30 and you see that these are teh only two people left in the bar, their napkin (the one they were given) is covering their plate, their glasses are empty, and they are talking to another server... maybe ask them what they need instead of getting mad at the other server for paoching your table? (yes we heard you whining like a lil bisnatch) We literslly stopped in to get a drink and some crab cakes while we waited for my parents to finish their movie. What we thought would be a quick lil 30 min or so turned into an almsot hour and half ordeal. This is by far the WORST cheesecake location I have ever been. Seriously I love this place at other locations for their variety but gawd damn walnut creek get it effing together!!!"
Alie Z.,"Brentwood, CA",166,74,68,5.0,3/30/2013,"Went here for dinner last night and had the best service by Mike! the food was awesome as always, I personally love the buffalo blasts! Mike knew the menu so well and had great advice about what to order! I decided on the Jamaican pepper shrimp and it was amazing! Everytime I go back Ill definitely be asking for Mike!"
Dee L.,"Oakland, CA",129,201,311,5.0,5/3/2013,"Exellent service and food. Beautiful decor. Short wait time. Cheesecake to die for.  Celebrated my birthday here, sat on the patio in the early evening light breeze and we had a very happy party of 6. Cant wait to come back and try the different dishes. Everything we tried from the appetizers to the orange chicken were wonderful!"
Chira E.,"Concord, CA",185,313,30,4.0,4/5/2010,"So my fellow Yelpers, you know that I have said on a number of occasions that there are good meal spots and there are drinks and appetizer spots. Cheesecake is a great drink and appetizer spot, I would only suggest dinner out of convenience or perhaps with a large party because the menu is so extensive, there is something for everyone. They get four stars because the happy hour menu is mah-vuh-lus!  Happy hour is from 4p-6p, Monday-Friday, and the happy hour menu is almost as vast as the regular menu. I didn't notice any item on the happy hour menu over 5 bucks. We had the avocado egg rolls, one of my favorites, velvety avocado with a sweet and tangy tamarind dipping sauce. Next on deck was the chicken samosas, a spicy curried trip to India, yum! The stuffed mushrooms are served in a flavorful wine sauce. Hmmm let's see, what was next? At $5 per item we took full advantage. Oh yes, the fried artichokes, there was a slight glitch with those, be careful there are two on the menu. Grilled and fried, ordered the fried, but grilled came to the table. It was quite good though. Drinks are 5 bucks too. Sweet deal!"
Brooke Q.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",100,28,2,3.0,8/10/2011,"I've always heard good and bad things about this place. The ahi tartare is good and so is the mediterranean tacos. But are salads weren't good. The carlton and luau. The luau chicken was not seasoned at all and made me feel like I was on a diet. Wasnt much flavor, except on the wutons. Sweet potato fries were good, but can't really go wrong there. Id go back and try something else.  Oh and the server was nice but could been better"
F R.,"Inner Richmond, San Francisco, CA",0,19,,4.0,10/16/2013,"I've been to this branch several times and service is always good. Food and desserts are delicious. My only complaint is the long wait on date nights like Fridays or Saturdays that's why only a four star. But then again, it is a popular restaurant with good food. So, we still wait when we can."
Karen J.,"Brentwood, CA",4,18,,4.0,4/22/2011,"I think it's pretty expensive to eat there, you totally pay for the ambiance as well. But some of the dishes are sooo delicious!!  And in the last couple years they introduced ""small plate apps"" so you can still have a yummy treat while waiting for your meal without getting so full. I've never had a bad meal there.  My entree favorite: Chicken Costolletta.  deeelish!"
Deborah B.,"Brentwood, CA",0,21,,3.0,10/6/2013,"We took our 23 year old son and his friends to lunch for his birthday a few months ago and while it's a lively place and nice atmosphere for a celebration, the food was very ordinary. The boys said their burgers were decent but weren't impressed with the appetizers.  My husband enjoyed the grilled salmon but I thought the chicken tostada salad was average.  The service was very good however."
Patrick L.,"Dublin, CA",152,143,80,3.0,7/6/2010,"Well, who hasn't been to the cheesecake factory?  I'm not sure how much of a review I can give, but I will give my opinion on this location.  The wait at the WC location has generally been very short.  I'm not sure if it's because it's newer or because they just get through people quickly.  I have heard that the WC location is the largest cheesecake factory by far.  Supposedly, it's because the person who owns the factory is from WC and wanted to make this the largest location.  So maybe we're lucky enough this happened because I generally don't wait more than 20 min on a Saturday night.  That's great since I've waited up to 3 hrs at the Union Square location.   As for the food, I think I'm starting to get sick of the food here.  I have branched out and tried some new dishes such as the spicy crispy beef, steak diane in addition to my favorite - the cajun jambalaya.   Recently, I've ordered to go on a number of occasions.  I've been disappointed with the quality of the food when I get to-go.  For some reason, it just doesn't taste as fresh.  So my advice is that if you eat at the Factory, eat there and not to go as you will regret it!"
Leily P.,"Oakland, CA",53,615,39,4.0,4/16/2010,I still can't get over the fact that a given slice of their cheesecake is 1200 calories. Also it's hard to find any entree below 1200 calories either so don't be on a diet if you're coming here... This location is huge and our wait on a Thurs night was around 10 minutes.
Melissa Y.,"Dublin, CA",139,94,6,4.0,3/3/2013,Love the atmosphere and food of course. The location is perfect for a day of shopping. The service was good but Pleasanton takes the cake on that.
Teejeronimo D.,"Danville, CA",45,158,14,5.0,2/2/2013,"Love this place...was so excited when they entered California as I went to the Cheesecake Factory in Boston many, many moons ago.  I have been to many locations... Chicago, San Jose, LA area.... And all pretty consistent.  My fav - avocado rolls and the Santa Fe salad.  Yum!,"
Jillian O.,"Napa, CA",14,191,375,4.0,1/8/2011,"I've been here a few times now and I have to say that each time is different. When you go on a day where it's not busy and crazy then the service and food is really good. However, if you decide to go on a busy weekend or Friday/Saturday night then be prepared to wait for a long time for a table, and to have crappy service and rushed out food. I recently went on a Friday night and it took us an hour to be seated, and then our waitress was so busy she wasn't always around, and the food just seemed blah. The others times I've been it was really good; just choose a good time/day to go if you want a good experience."
Patty D.,"Alamo, CA",0,5,1,1.0,12/29/2014,"Service was VERY, VERY SLOW tonight.  No acknowledgement, no apologies from the waitress when I complained we still had not received our dinner.  Waited and waited for cheesecake.  Complaiined to the manager and still waited.  Slow, poor service and no one cares about it.  Do not go to this cheesecake factory unless you have a lot of time to sit around and wait for your food."
John D.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",70,564,46,3.0,1/25/2011,"I think this place is a bit hit or miss. The service can sometimes be really slow when they are busy as was the case the last time I was there. I generally like the environment and decor and it's a good place to go for lunch while out shopping Broadway Plaza. Since it's such a large place, you usually don't have to wait longer than about 10 minutes for a table and they give you a buzzer so you can go outside if you want to while you are waiting.  The food is not bad for a chain and they give you large portions for the price. It's certainly not my favorite food but this is the kind of place where virtually anyone can find something to eat."
