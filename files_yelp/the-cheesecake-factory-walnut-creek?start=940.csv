Nick M.,"Turlock, CA",16,209,40,2.0,8/11/2010,"Pros: - Place is huge and almost has the glitz of a Las Vegas Casino.  I expected to walk around a corner and see slot machines. - Waitresses are friendly. - They bring bread to the table. - They have a large variety of cheescakes to choose from. Cons: - Hosts act like they don't need your business, so unless you walk in when nobody is there they ignore you. - The two waiters I had acted like tweakers.  They forgot things and were spastic. - The food is really not that good. - Expensive. - The cheesecake is not that great.  For having a great selection, it actually sucks. I only go to this place with groups and to me it's basically like going to a nicer looking Denny's."
Adam L.,"Pittsburg, CA",11,71,7,3.0,7/8/2011,"Went here last week it was ok.  The server was really slow. We sat down and got our drink and an appetizer ordered.    We didn't see our server until after we had eaten our appetizer. Then we got our food, and all was good. Finished our meal, and ordered a slice of cheesecake to go.  Then we didn't see our server for 25 minutes.  He came back with a slice of chesecake on a plate, which we said we ordered to go. Then he gave us the bill, and went to get the dessert to go. He came back to get the bill 10 minutes later and took another 15 to come back with the change.   Service sucked but food is good."
denise s.,"Concord, CA",0,57,,2.0,9/5/2015,I have always liked cheesecake factory but this particular location has really gone down as far as food quality and consistency. The last half a dozen times I've been there something is always made wrong or sometimes it's even the wrong order. I went there yesterday and had to think long and hard before I decided to go ahead and give it another chance but as usual The order...an omelet.. Was abysmal and tasteless. The manager tried to say that the cook made the omelette first and then just put the ingredients inside but I don't care what the reason was it was terrible.. Then they gave me the bill after I sat there for an hour while they remade it correctly and they had not even given me a break on the bill.. But once I asked for it the manager did decrease the bill which I appreciated. I'm just not sure it's worth it to go there anymore because some of the items I really liked on their menu are now gone and I can't seem to get everything right consistently.
Victoria B.,"San Francisco, CA",24,50,,4.0,3/17/2011,"As far as the brand goes, this is one of the better locations I've been to  When the weather permits, it's really nice to sit patio side and enjoy the fresh air.   I like that I can alwasy find a lot to choose from and if I just want appetizers and drinks or a full meal, it's a great choice. The drawback is that you can't make a reservation...which just bothers me about this chain in general.  But the curbside pick up is a special feature that makes up for waiting for a table sometimes.  The decor is standard for their chain and it's tastefully done.  I like that even though it's packed...the booths feel private and you can enjoy your meal and still have a great conversation. The food is okay.  It's not supposed to be the most adventerous or cutting edge menu ever, but you can find something that you'll be happy with.  They took away my favorite salad and I'm still pouting about that... Bottom line: expect to wait for a table, good choice to pair up with catching a movie accross the street or meeting up for lunch after shopping downtown.   Happy Dining!"
Victoria M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",31,177,12,2.0,3/19/2012,"I've been here 3 times over the past 6 months and each time I've gone the service has gotten worse and the food portions smaller. This last time, on 3/10/12, was the last straw.  My husband put his foot down and said ""I don't care how family friendly this place is, we're not going through this again.""   What he meant was #1) the v .e. r. y.  s.l.oooooooooooooooooooooooow service, #2) The overworked, overwhelmed server who took 20 minutes to tell us that the appetizer we had ordered was not available and then disappeared leaving us to not be able to order another one, #3) the mocking behavior and the eye rolling of the manager who on her own approached us to ask us about our dinner when we had to send a dish back.  We did not ask for the manager nor wanted to complain, but when we mentioned the 1.5 hour wait for food and the wrong dish, really your going to walk away and roll your eyes??!!, #3) the dried out chewy pork chops my husband had for dinner, and #4) the very noticeable smaller slices of cheesecake for dessert (yes, 2 hours later we got to order dessert), and #5) the very, very slow service, #6, even after that miserable interaction with the manager there was no offer or automatic comp for the wrong order, I had to experience her miserableness again to ask for it.....very poor customer service. Take out cheesecake? OH YES!  Sitting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting? OH HECK NO!"
Ashley M.,"Washington, DC",0,13,1,3.0,8/31/2013,"So I went to the Cheesecake Factory last night around 7ish. Let me start by saying that I really don't think their food is that great. I think their appetizers and drinks are worth it though so that's all I ever go for. So my waiting time ended up being over an hour last night. Which is ridiculous by understandable, so that's not what upset me, what upset me was the fact that the host were dishonest about how long the wait would be and said about 30 min. Just be honest I hate that. Don't lie. I could of went somewhere else. But my waiter Demareon was amazing, very professional and seemed genuinely concerned about our experience there. He is the only reason I have 3 stars here. Thank god for him."
Vince M.,"Antioch, CA",55,97,11,1.0,12/16/2010,"UPDATE: 4/17/16 We called during lunch time last Saturday to see if we could make a reservation for 8pm that night to celebrate my Mom's bday. Lady on the phone said she has to ask her manager, we then got approved and was all set for 8pm for 10 people. We show up that night only to be turned away because apparently they do not book reservations after 5:30pm. Had we been told this over the phone, we would have planned for another location, but we were confirmed for 8pm. The wait was so long and we were so upset, we left. Extremely disappointed, I was craving a chicken di panna =\. 12/16/10 Can't believe I have yet to review this place after going here for so many times. If you think this Cheesecake Factory has really fancy architecture and designs uhhh...they're pretty much all like this. The food is ok, kinda expensive and can get really busy but it's a fun place to hang out with friends and family.  I always get their Chicken di Pana! That is delicious. The flat iron steak is pretty ehhh. As for the cheesecakes...MMMM! I want some Red Velvet Cheesecake now. This place gets 3 stars for look and feel, service and the fact that some of these dishes are awesome. A lot are kind of a hit or miss though."
Kent J.,"Danville, CA",51,79,271,4.0,3/26/2010,"Which way is the casino?  Vegas, that's how I feel about the interior.  I actually love Vegas, so take that comment as you will. Here's the deal.  I ALWAYS sit at the bar.  The service is above average if not great, thus an easy 4 stars for service. I notice many reviewer complaints about the lengthy menu.  I never complain about options.  Also, I read complaints about large portion size.  Again, have some self control.  They are giving you value.  Take the leftovers home or leave them behind.  From my experience, the food has ALWAYS been consistent.  Better than your average restaurant but not amazing.  Try the Miso Salmon.  3.5 to 4 stars for food, and I'm not a hater, so 4! The Cheesecake Factory will get crowded and you may have a long wait.  Popular restaurants become busy.  Plan accordingly."
Kristin W.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,16,,2.0,11/2/2014,"Poor service.  The food was good. Typical cheesecake factory food, but the service was poor. The waiter would disappear for long periods of time. Not sure I would return to this location again."
D S.,"Alamo, CA",5,55,9,2.0,2/24/2013,"The food was okay, but the 45 min wait was absolutely unacceptable. The bartenders could care less about the wait and taking care of the customers."
Brenda S.,"Vallejo, CA",7,24,2,2.0,10/13/2012,"Visited Cheesecake Factory Walnut Creek, Ca. celebrating my Daughters Birthday  weekend of 9/18/2012. had the worst experience with the  staff at the counter, worst customer service, think the girl's name was ""Casandra Murillo"", someone needs to give her a class in ""How you talk to and Communicate With Guests"" so Rude. But alas, here comes Manager ""ASHLEY LOUIE"" to the RESCUE !!!!! She exhibited the utmost in Professionalism. She came in asked the questions and offered her assistance to help us leave feeling better than when we came in. THANK YOU ASHLEY !!!!!"
Kevin M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,9,,1.0,11/2/2013,"I am confused, is this a CAFETERIA or a restaurant?  One thing is for sure, it is a Factory of some sort and food is best not served on an assembly line. And for such a large CAFETERIA, it would have been nice not to bump elbows when sitting with my date! Oh, did I mention, my silverware was questionably clean! Food was lacking flavor, couldn't get our check fast enough!"
Joe N.,"Antioch, CA",220,404,212,3.0,12/8/2010,"This is the 4th time I have gone to the Cheesecake factory and every time I have been, it has been a nice experience. I love the decor and how big the place is, the food is usually fantastic, a good value for what you pay and the service is usually really nice and friendly.  Last night was nice but a little bit of a different experience than I have been use to. We were seated very quickly with minimal waiting. When we were seated, we were kind of placed in a corner, compared with being in the middle, which is nice I suppose. I had a few issues. First of all the table we were seated in was right up against a wall and extremely cramped for someone my size at 6' 6""......they probably should have seated us at a larger place. I felt very confined and cramped. Another major problem was that after 10-15 minutes of sitting there, I had to ask for someone to help us. It took forever to get our drinks and bread and it just made the experience a little bit of a bummer. Once we got someone to come help us, it was a little better, although we did get our appetizer and entree at the same time, which is taboo for such a nice place. Decent server after the fact of forgetting us at the beginning.  Out of the 4 times, this was the least favored time as far as the wait time and having to ask for help. I will still go there in the future....... but am not so excited as I was before. Good thing I had great company or this experience would have been a total bust!"
Roger H.,"Concord, CA",3,60,1,4.0,4/1/2010,"The stars were pretty well aligned tonight. We arrived just before 8 pm we got street parking almost right in front of the place. Closer than if we parked in the public garage. Then we walked in and asked for a table and were told it would be 25 minutes. Only 10 minutes later we were being directed to our table. Unfortunately, they thought ""table"" was code for booth. We said we'd wait for a table to open up but before we even got to the front they found us a table. We both ordered the flat iron steak. Each came a little more rare than we ordered but were otherwise quite good, juicy, firm without being tough. A little on the pricey side but it was balanced by the great waitress we had. Attentive without hovering she made sure we were well taken care of. The only real downside to the evening was how insanely loud this place was. Half the time I was mouth reading as we were trying to have a conversation but I'm a terrible mouth reader so I was constantly asking her to repeat herself. Overall, great ambiance, good food, too loud."
Joss G.,"Las Vegas, NV",34,35,4,4.0,12/4/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is almost always a decent place to go, whether for a date night with your guy, a stop for lunch during a day of shopping, dinner and drinks with the ladies, or a gathering of people for a special occasion.  Our late afternoon lunch today for my mom's birthday was no different... A wait can usually be expected, and upon walking up to the restaurant it looked pretty busy considering that it was already after lunch hours.  But I was surprised that our wait was only 20 minutes! For chain restaurants like this, the food is usually consistent, so to me service is the main factor... The hostesses were friendly.  The guy who seated us was friendly.  And our server (Kenneth W.) was great!  He was friendly while taking our orders and answering our questions about the specials.  He also brought us everything that we asked for during our meal, including one of their menus that my uncle had asked if he could take home.  Our server was nice enough to ask the management (and without the kind of attitude that you'd experience at other establishments).  He was also pretty easy-going and joked around with us throughout his service.  So, thanks guy... My mom had a nice birthday lunch! As for the food... Huge portions (okay for family-style), enough to compliment the prices of the dishes.  My personal favorites:  AVOCADO EGGROLLS and SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKES for appetizers, and CHICKEN MARSALA & MUSHROOMS as a main dish.  Other dishes we ordered today were the SHRIMP FRANCHESE, CHICKEN BELLAGIO, and PECAN CRUSTED CATFISH... None of us were disappointed. We also shared the Ultimate Red Velvet cheesecake... They enjoyed it.  I had two bites and was done.  But then again, I just don't like cheesecake that much."
Sam M.,"Northern, CA",9,130,18,4.0,2/14/2010,"The hubby and I had never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory. It's a chain, and couldn't and wouldn't afford it. You know what I mean. If you're going to blow $100 on dinner I want it to be worth every penny.  A chain restaurant doesn't come in mind when I think of this. So we got a gift card and that's why we went.  We requested outdoor seating. When you enter the décor and structure is great but it's LOUD!! I felt like I was shouting to my husband while waiting for our table (3 minutes on a early Sat evening). The patio seating is the place to sit, alittle street noise but not to bad. Plus they have alot of heaters so the temperature is great. Food: Holy Crap it actually tasted really good.  Appetizer: We ordered Ahi TarTare it was very good just wish it had alittle bit more kick but other than that it was perfect, fresh and light. Entree: I ordered the Weight management grilled chicken and was very surprised. The portion was HUGE. Three chicken breasts served with steamed rice, asparagus topped with arugula and some seasoning. It was mouth watering and very flavorful. Drinks: Okay this area gets a 1 star for the simple fact is a mojito costs $10!!! Yes $10!!! The last time I spent that much for a drink was in Hawaii but that included a beautiful view and ocean breeze. Also you couldn't taste any rum. BOO! Cheesecake: What can I say, it was AMAZING!!! I ordered the Kahlua Coffee while the hubby ordered the Tiramisu. Yum! Yum! Yum! My only regret was I didn't order another slice to bring home. Service: I believe her name was Jessica, well she was great! Never once did she rush us, gave us great suggestions and was on time with everything."
Elizabeth B.,"Martinez, CA",4,67,4,3.0,5/16/2011,"This was my first visit to The Cheesecake Factory.  We had called ahead and were told they didn't take reservations but they were running about 30 minutes out to get seated.  We ended up waiting for 1 hour and 10 minutes.  I somewhat understand the theory behind not taking reservations, but then at least offer call ahead seating.   We hit the bar while waiting for our table.  For 2 ""well"" drinks and 2 specialty drinks the total was $37.  I was a bit taken back at the price. We were finally sat for dinner - outside.  It was cold and we were told the heaters were turned up as far as they could go.  Oh well, I was starving and wasn't about to ask for another table.  We ordered 3 apps which were all yummy.  Stuffed mushrooms, popcorn shrimp and avocado eggrolls.  No complaints about any of them. The dishes we ordered for dinner were, Chicken Piccatta, Hibachi Steak, Monterey Cheeseburger & Crispy Spicy Beef.  All were excellent save for the Hibachi Steak which was overcooked and tough.  We debated on sending it back but didn't want to run any later than we already were.  We each also ordered one more drink.  The drinks took a long time to reach us and our server appeared confused as to why we didn't have them.  It still took a while for him to retrieve them for us.  Since it took much longer to get seated, we ordered 3 pieces of cheesecake to go. The total for the 4 of us with tip came to $240.  The food was good, the service was okay and the wait was atrocious.  For $60 a person there are plenty of other places we would choose to go."
Jason S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,8,,4.0,10/21/2013,"Good atmosphere and excellent service. This is one of the few places open late in the Walnut Creek area. I ended up going with fish, steak, and a nice greek salad. Definitely a place I would go to after hours to avoid the crowds and have a more relaxed time."
Vicky T.,"San Francisco, CA",232,261,362,3.0,7/2/2010,"Same as all Cheesecake factories... Always crowded, long waits, same catalog menu.   I like there food... I havent had one bad thing.  The Walnut Creek location is great since we can grab some drinks and food before a movie (across the street).  I love the outside seating area here.  It has heat lamps so we can stay warm and toasty on any overly breezey night.   They have an extensive small plates/appetizer section, so that's always good when we're going out for a small bite to eat and drinks.   Small Plates:  I recommend the Ahi Tartare with avocado, Chicken Samosas, Stuffed Mushrooms, buffalo blasts, fried Mac and cheese.  Skip the crap puffs.   Can't go wrong with anything from the rest of the menu... selection of pastas, seafood, poultry, steak... ranging from american-, asian, italian-, mexican-inspired."
Diesel K.,"Walnut Creek, CA",2,13,,5.0,7/12/2011,"I've been here like twice in a month, the Service is ALWAYS GREAT here.  Foods are great, too. Pasta Carbonara, Bang Bang chiken&shirimp,  papcorn shirimp, and so on.  And the amount is HUGE! You might want to get a bag for your rest meals. Breads are good. Environment is just like a castle."
