Phuoc K.,"Oakland, CA",284,214,10,4.0,10/19/2010,"i hadn't been to a cheesecake factory in a while and I was pleasantly surprised by this one. There was no wait for dinner (though it was a Monday night), the service was very prompt. Our particular server was very nice and helpful and knew her specials. Our salads were of course ginormous and well prepared.  the outdoor dining area was very pleasant on a beautiful night and made for a nice light pre-movie dinner."
Robert R.,"Concord, CA",333,736,1032,4.0,4/1/2010,I went here to grab a quick caffeine run. I still had a gift card  I needed to finish out the remaining balance. They have to go counter for desserts. I got a Med. Mocha and was helped almost immediately. I think that it is easier to bypass the Desserts now since they put all the calories next to the display case. I will be back to use the remaining $3.43 toward a Cheesecake or Hot Chocolate. 4 stars for the convenience of the counter with friendly service.
A H.,"Alamo, CA",0,6,,2.0,3/19/2012,"What can you say... it's a typical giant chain restaurant. The food is just like any other cheesecake location... obnoxiously huge portions and fairly bland. The service here is fine but the wait for a table is always waaayyy too long. If you are in downtown Walnut Creek and the hostesses here tell you there is a 30+ minute wait for a table (which there always is), find somewhere else to go. There are a dozen restaurants within a few blocks of Cheesecake that have better prices, service, and food."
Jo Jo M.,"Lafayette, CA",0,11,,4.0,7/7/2010,"Okay, so I decided to give The Cheesecake Factory another chance.  It's been more than a year since my last visit.  My experience was completely different from my first visit to the WC location.  If you haven't tried the Sweet Corn Tamale dish yet, you must do so asap.  It was so delicious, I savored every single bite!  Enough said, you must go there and experience it for yourself...enjoy!"
Courtney S.,"San Ramon, CA",153,330,85,4.0,3/19/2010,"I actually remember when they brought Cheesecake Factory to Maryland. It was one of the favorite date places of the young set. If you were going out on a date, Cheesecake Factory and Red Lobster were the places to go...or Olive Garden. Well, I never went out on dates, so I am sorry to say I've never been to the Cheesecake Factory before today. And, this Walnut Creek location definitely makes me want to go back.  The parking garage takes you to the back door of the restaurant--that's door to door service! The menu reads like Bronte -- a voluminous novel telling the story of food. Ahhh, the poetry and majesty, that is, the Cheesecake Factory menu. I haven't seen a menu this large since the one at Elephant Bar. There are food offerings from just about every ethnicity.   I started my lunch off with a cocktail, a passion fruit Mo-ji-to (imagine Brian from Family Guy on ""The Bachelor..."" it was excellent. Then my friend and I ordered the fried calamari for an appetizer. Usually calamari is overcooked and really tough, then you pray for extra dipping sauce. However, this calamari was very tender. I felt bad about eating so much. Then came the main entrees: I had the mahi mahi fish tacos. They came served with a side of black beans and seasoned rice, with salsa and Guacamole for the tacos. As if that weren't enough, I had the nerve to order a slice of cheesecake. Hey! I wanted the whole experience, get it? I ordered the lemon raspberry cheesecake. So delicious.  Our waitress was great. She was very attentive to our table, and we were never at a loss for water!  Now I'm as bloated as a tick, but my first Cheesecake Factory experience was so great the sickness I am experiencing now is definitely worth it!  I have graduated from Cheesecake Factory as a possible ""date night"" eating choice. But, there is certainly nothing wrong with a possible ""hangin' with the girls drinking mo-ji-tos"" lunch or dinner. I will definitely return."
Betsy W.,"San Francisco, CA",30,39,,2.0,12/14/2009,"This is  the place to go if you want to gain weight. This restaurant chain believes ""bigger is better"" and serves humongous portions. Really. I wanted to have an enjoyable meal with some friends and not eat myself into a coma. So I ordered the caesar chicken salad. Light meal, right? Jeez !  There must have been a half pound of chicken (breast) on the 3/4 pound of romaine lettuce. I am very glad I asked for the dressing on the side. It is no wonder almost half of the people leave with a take home satchel."
Nancy S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",29,53,,4.0,6/19/2013,"The portions here are amazingly huge and the menu is filled with both unique and common entrees. The food is delicious and the cheesecakes are fabulous. Similar to the rest of the menu, there are both unique and common cheesecake flavors. I've tried many of their cheesecakes and my favorite so far is the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake. Additionally, the service is friendly and fast, although there is often a wait to get seated. This place is spacious, has nice and interesting decor, and because of the crowd it draws, it has a lively and festive ambiance. Great for casual dinner dates and group dining."
Michelle Y.,"Oakland, CA",195,62,41,2.0,1/4/2010,"So, how does it take an hour to get a soup..... Cup of soup at that. I mean...yes i like the Cheesecake factory for most of the food..but if they are so corporate..don't you think they would be able to get the food out in a timely manner?!  My complaint is that they are slow and the waiter kept trying to avoid us....didn't even refill water... c'mon now."
Cara Y.,"Oakland, CA",188,330,108,3.0,11/18/2009,"What do you want?  It's the freaking Cheesecake Factory. Their menu is 100 pages long, with everything from meatloaf and mashed potatoes to wasabi-crusted ahi tuna to Joe's Special to jambalaya to Thai chicken pasta to pizza to filet mignon to ""Luau salad"" to burgers to...you get the picture. Places that offer so many options make me nervous, because none of it is usually executed very well.  Cheesecake Factory follows that trend pretty well.  Giant portions, mediocre food, served by teens and 20-something that would rather be texting their BFFs on bloody thumb-stumps or shoulder-tapping for beer. However, it's a safe place to dine when you're dining out with 3 people who can't agree what they want to eat, and no one wants to make an executive decision.  It's also a good place to eat if you have an urge to transfer a giant, delicious piece of pumpkin cheesecake from your mouth to your thighs.  It's also an option if you want to enjoy drinks with friends on the heated patio in the glow of the Vegas-esque fire fountains, potted palms, and giant chandeliers.   CoCo County excess at its finest."
Jessica B.,"Isla Vista, CA",6,9,3,4.0,3/29/2011,"Deep-fried macaroni and cheese appetizer was so tasty! My favorite cheesecake would have to be the red velvet! Didn't have the greatest service, and it tends to be a little pricey, but a fun experience overall."
Nate S.,"Paradise Valley, AZ",121,206,77,1.0,12/30/2009,"Don't get me wrong, sitting outsite and enjoying a drink here is something I'd recommend. The bad-There's always a wait for food.  The worst -it's inexcusable that a person in our group bit into a piece of plate, yes a sharp PLATE fragment that was in the Chinese salad. It was very dangerous. I understand mistakes happen, but if it was me there would've been consequences. It won't stop me from going to cheesecake factories because I enjoy large portions and variety...but this experience was unacceptable."
Virgo M.,"Bay Area, CA",221,767,81,3.0,11/25/2009,"I've always felt the ""food"" at cheesecake factory is super sub par. So, why, why, why do I occasionally fall back into the trap of ordering anything other than what they clearly announce to be the specialty--cheesecake?!  This time, my inner voice said ""just order starters"" and so that's what we did. Chicken Pot Stickers, Spicy Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll and Factory Nachos.....all equally tasteless and overpriced.  For pricey beverages, the smoothies were tasty and so was the honey vanilla latte albeit a tad too sweet for me.  As for the service? He was so-so. Took too long to greet us but was attentive enough after that.  To-go,  we carried out cheesecakes--special red velvet, blueberry white chocolate and chocolate chip cookie dough.....you can't go wrong with any of these, or any type of c-cake here at all for that matter...YUM.  Final word? The appearance of this factory is simply amazing. Vast and jaw dropping awe. Loved, loved, loved the open fire outside. Twas lovely on the eyes!"
Heather S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",398,101,18,3.0,4/27/2012,"Man, I used to LOVE the happy hour here, but last time I was in for happy hour I realized that they got rid of the $5 drinks on happy hour..... BUMMER! Also they switched the menu up a bit..g no more Buffalo chix sliders, ended up with a McDonalds style chicken sandwich instead :( Dissapointed"
Elena M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,20,36,5.0,9/23/2014,"I do not have enough words to tell how much I loved this place. I like The Cheese Factory and go there quite a lot usually in downtown of San Francisco( long wait and noisy) or even more often in Corte Madera but it was my first time in Walnut Creek location. We were there at lunch time and had to wait for about 30 minutes but only because there were 10 of us and in was not easy to accommodate this group. The staff super friendly, food super tasty, etc., etc., etc."
Laurie W.,"Vacaville, CA",0,25,,2.0,11/3/2014,"I was very disappointed with my meal. My experiences here used to be very good but this time, and my previous visit, were not. They made mistakes with both my order and my friend's - clearly the cooks/chefs do not read the orders. I ordered an omelette and I've had much better at Black Bear Diner. My toast was overcooked as were my oily potatoes. The ""avocado"" was a joke - they were cut up so small that I barely knew they were in the omelette. I will not return here. Next time I will go to my favorite restaurant in Walnut Creek which is much cheaper and always delicious - Tomatino's!"
Anonymous P.,"San Pablo, CA",1,272,477,5.0,3/3/2012,"Enjoyed this spot from beginning to end. Located in the heart of walnut creek shopping district, so we didn't mind the wait of 30min. Once we got to our table, our waiter was already there with their complimentary bread and butter. Started off with a few drinks and more bread as we waited for our entrees.  The mango smoothie is so sweet and so delicious, my kids loved it!! We had a spicy chicken pasta with asparagus, peas, bell peppers, garlic (hold the onions pls) in a spicy chipotle sauce. We also tried their pasta carbonara. (Linguine pasta with smoked bacon and peas in a garlicy sauce.) Our friends dined on their famous meatloaf and grilled pork chops. Sadly their mashed patotes wasn't really mashed, still harden so we had to mash it ourselves. LOL!! And for dessert, their strawberry cheesecake :)"
Debra F.,"Vallejo, CA",1,2,,5.0,8/22/2013,Took my business partner here for her birthday.  It was a surprise and she loved it.  From the moment we arrive the atmosphere was great. Our waiter was so great and the food was so delicious.  She had the meatloaf and I had tacos.  She let me taste the meatloaf and it was oh so delicious.  The cheesecake was marvelous.  We have decided to go at least once a month and treat ourselves. If you have not tried it....TRY IT!
Henry S.,"Dublin, CA",387,1497,49,4.0,12/8/2009,"I like the Cheesecake Factory but I don't LOVE it. It was so much better when there was only a hand full of restaurants in the bay area.  Its more of a treat when I had to drive to San Francisco or San Jose to eat at Cheesecake Factory but now, I have two with in 15 miles of me (Pleasanton and Walnut Creek).   My wife and I came to this location for lunch this weekend and I had the Chicken Club Sandwich and my wife had the lunch portion miso salmon.  Both our dishes were delicious and my french fries were cooked perfectly!  Golden brown, piping hot, crispy outside and soft on the inside.  My sandwich was HUGE however there was more tomato than chicken in my sandwich.  My wife's salmon was very good and the presentation looked great. I do have to say that the hostess was really accommodating when I asked for patio seating because we had our dog Deucey with us.  She said that as long as we are at a table along the edge of the patio its fine."
Sue F.,"Danville, CA",19,71,23,1.0,1/13/2013,"Horrible! Absolutely disappointing! We went tonight to celebrate my birthday and expected so much more. My meal was only warm and after searching for our disappearing waitress, asked if it could be reheated. She came back with my meal after the others in my party were finishing their meals. She had been in a long discussion at another table in our sight (more happy customers?) and mine was still only warm. When she later came back, she said she was sure it was alright. The manager appeared and said he too knew it had been warmed. Really? Am I making it up? I should of asked them to try it! The manager than offered me a piece of cheesecake on the house even though I knew my family had told them it was my birthday. Gee thanks. The service and food were just plain BAD!"
Rolo R.,"San Francisco, CA",32,39,,1.0,4/20/2014,"This review is base on their management. A friend of mine applied for a position for this particular Cheesecake Factory. He went there in the afternoon, and spoke to the manager at the time, after the interview was done he was told that he will get a call back after they do a reference check on him. 2 days later finally they're done with the checking of his references. He was told to come in at a certain time one day the week after. He went in the day he was told to comeback. So when he got there he was told that the manager that told him to comeback that day is off, and no other manager has any notes or some type of recollection of the 2nd interview for that day. So he wasted his time coming there for no reason because since nobody can interview him for the 2nd time that day he was told to comeback again a few days later. This is without an apology from any of the management members and it seems like there's a lot of them there. You would think they are communicating with one another but apparently not. It shocking that this establishment is successful if the management member is not talking to each other. The only excuse given to my friend is that they are on a transition of getting new managers. For me that is not a legitimate excuse, if a company is going through changes it's the companies job to communicate with one another on what's going on with the restaurant. So my friend that was not interviewed the 2nd time was ask to comeback again. So he came back again to meet with another manager that he was told he was suppose to meet with, but guess what? That manager is off for the day already when he was asked to comeback that certain time. This is unbelievable! You can understand the frustration of my unemployed friend who's been told over and over again to comeback so that someone can interview him. He waited about 30 minutes for a new manager there to interview him where she only asked 3 questions. After that 3 questions, the manager that was interviewing him told him that if he doesn't hear from them within 24 hours they moved on to another applicant. Without any type of apologies all he was told was to move on if he doesn't hear from them. My friend is planning on calling the department of labor because he felt like he was discriminated by this company, and he is also going to call Cheesecake and ask for their Regional manager and corporate office because of this whole situation that occurs. He know this review may not matter since this is a huge establishment and it doesn't matter how many bad reviews is written about this place they will still be successful, but he just wants his voice to be heard, and sends out this warning for whoever want to work there. Because of how he felt he was treated he will never be coming back to this place to eat, and his friends and family will sure hear about this."
