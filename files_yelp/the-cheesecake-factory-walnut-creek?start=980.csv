Astrid L.,"Concord, CA",0,26,,3.0,5/23/2011,"This was my first visit in this CF. It is huge, the wait time was only 25 min, and went quickly. We had to wait by fire pit outside. Very windy place. Our waiter was Steve, a very nice guy, who was quick, didn't forget anything and the food was good. The shrimp pasta was a little pricey, for $3 more they add shrimp, we counted 4 on the plate...:( My salad was big and I guess I have lunch with it today. Overal a nice dinner and we will come back."
Annette W.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,48,1,3.0,3/8/2013,This place is usually busy so trying to get a seat on the weekend can be a challenge. The menu is a big overwhelming. Too many choices. Some of the food is great but there are also a few dishes I wouldn't try again. The food is a bit pricey but if you can manage to get in for happy hour it's really nice. Service can be really horrible at times even when they're not busy.
Reginald D.,"Vallejo, CA",27,30,29,3.0,1/2/2013,"First I have to say the seating arrangements are terrible.  The party next to us............too close, should've (just) made us a party of 4.  The Firecracker Salmon Rolls....excellent . So are the Bufallo Blasts."
Britnie S.,"Oakley, CA",24,3,,1.0,5/13/2013,Ok guys I know it's New Year's Eve but the service tonight is terrible:( better off going somewhere else.
Beatriz L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,15,,4.0,7/26/2013,"The first time I went there didn't like it that much cause the inside is very noisy, dark and looks like a casino. The second time we sat outside and I loved it. They have a wide Menu, the waitress are always nice, the food comes fast and the prices are fair."
Ezequiel R.,"Concord, CA",66,52,30,2.0,12/15/2009,"Can you say ""over priced chain restaurant""? Soulless corporate menu, inhospitable twenty-something staff, and prices that demand a far better experience.  In a nutshell: Got there, greeter was less than thrilled to see anyone interrupting her text. Server was not unfriendly, but not friendly either. The food was indeed good (but I have also had a good dish at Applebee's). The menu was TOO extensive and very confusing (no suggestions from our server, however). Short changed in the silverware department (had to borrow a fork and a knife). Water went dry, no offer to refill. No check-back, and server assumed we liked everything.  Alas, the cheesecake was fantastic. But it better have been, considering they hinged their reputation on it and not the service."
Trice P.,"Vacaville, CA",9,53,81,4.0,8/28/2010,"This location is definitely larger than the one in Pleasanton and the one at the top of Macy's in SF.  I really like this location because it's so close to everything in downtown WC (theater is right across the street and two blocks down is Broadway Plaza). Parking garage is right next door, which is convenient (3 hours free or valet parking for $7.00).  If the lot is full, there are other parking garages all around.   The front is very inviting with what looked like a casual waiting area to the left of the entrance and outdoor dining to the right.  Nice fire/heat features on both sides.  Like all Cheesecake Factories, the decor inside is the same. We went on a Friday afternoon for lunch.  We waited less than two minutes to be seated (not bad for the lunch hour).  Our waitress was extremely friendly and fortunately, we did not have the same experience as some others with the hostess (as far as not being addressed when we walked in). The Miso Salmon lunch plate has always been a favorite and will continue to be so after this visit.  I ordered the Evelyn's Favorite pasta dish (I forget the exact name).  The pasta was hard and it was too oily.  The vegetables were good (sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke, mushrooms). But, I don't recommend this dish.  I normally am not disappointed with what I order here, so this is my first disappointment.  The bread is very good (don't eat too much of it, because the food portions are pretty hearty). We ordered the Pina Colada cheesecake (newly added to their menu) and the Adam's Peanut Butter something something cheesecake (can't remember the exact name). Both were pretty good and would order this again. This place is definitely not a place to eat if you are watching calories."
M.J. I.,"Vallejo, CA",169,17,6,5.0,9/20/2012,Service is always good and I have yet to be disappointed with the food. LOVE the Firecracker Salmon Rolls and the Herb Crusted Salmon.. :)
Mia O.,"Walnut Creek, CA",88,27,1,1.0,3/26/2012,"So sad - had a bad experience - order was wrong, server took the dish away, took the part that was wrong off the plate, served potatoes and bagel on another plate after 5 minutes.  Then brought the right entree on a separate plate after 10 minutes.  The check came with the wrong item on it.  We asked to speak to the manager who corrected the bill but no apology and instead, asked, ""any other problems""?  We used to like going to the bar and taking home a slice of cheesecake but I think no more.  I'm sad."
Adam C.,"Berkeley, CA",154,21,1,4.0,12/4/2011,"Always have a great time coming here. The most striking part of the restaurant is the amazing design and decor that reminds one of being in lavish Las Vegas casino. Plus the food is great, I ordered the wasabi-crusted Ahi tuna which was EXTREMELY delicious!! The only downside is, because of its popularity, waiting to be seated on a Friday or Saturday night can be expected. Great service as well."
Mike S.,"San Rafael, CA",32,351,178,4.0,7/8/2010,Dinner. I like this place although the food ain't bad the service is excellent.
Courtney Y.,"San Jose, CA",442,308,59,1.0,11/3/2009,"SLOW.... Like Sloth Slow.. Slow and steady didn't win us over....  It was a Sunday and we got there around 5:45, the hostess said there would probably about a 20 min wait.. No problem. This wait wasn't too long, the 7 of us ended up getting seating in a 6 person booth. I guess they are okay w/ squeezing people in.  Not only was it squashy it was damn dark. Good thing I pretty much picked out what I wanted before we were seated.  5 out of 7 of us decided to get a crap load of snacks and small plates to share while my brother and Dad got a giant salad and Chicken and Biscuits. We were pretty tough customers b/c my mother is allergic to almost everything. She can't eat any type of dairy or eggs so we had to ask for all sauces and cheese on the side. Yes, I know that request right there is setting ourselves up for a disaster.  The BF ordered a bowl of White Cheddar soup (or at least that's what the waiter said) and out came White Cheddar and Broccoli soup 20 min after we ordered it. Not sure if they were growing the broccoli in the back or what, but I was sure soup in general is made ahead of time.  Maybe the Chef's arm fell off or something. The appetizers also took an eternity to come out.  It took another 15 min after the soup for our first little small plate to come out. To top off the horribly long wait was the last dish, the sweet corn tamale cakes. This came out w/ HUGE dollops of sour cream on the top. He did however bring the green sauce on the side, but I'm not sure if he understood us when we said ""My mother is allergic to ALL DAIRY"" He then asked us if it was okay to scrap off the sour cream.. WTF??? NO.. She can't eat any of it..  We ended up leaving a good 2 hours later.  Never again will I come back here.. Only if I'm forced to.. We should've went w/ my initial craving of Chow's but decided to try something new.. BAD IDEA!"
M T.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,199,,4.0,8/22/2014,"Ate here on August 22, 2014.  Very good service.  I had the meatloaf platter this time.  Meatloaf passable (I have had better, like my mom's and my wife's).  Potatoes and mixed veggies very good.  Lots of food for the money.  Ate at an outside table, which was very pleasant on a Friday just after the noon hour.  Left 19 percent tip, and thus the total bill with tax and tip came to $102 for five people.  For the money, we had 2 iced teas, 1 soda (sodas and iced teas were each $2.95), 1 cafe latte ($4.50), 1 Santa Fe salad, 1 mushroom burger with sweet potato fries, 1 stuffed chicken tortillas plate, 1 meatloaf platter, and 1 create-your-own omelette.  Everyone had a large quantity of food on their entrée."
Ashley H.,"Concord, CA",0,4,,2.0,4/22/2012,"Tried to make a reservation for a party of 6 but they don't take reservations for parties smaller than 10 people, annoying.So we waited an hour to be seated and had them place the cake we brought in their refrigerator.After eating dinner which was delicious the server brought out our cake, which took her 10 minutes to find and you could tell she was freaking out by the way she was walking all over the restaurant.Once we got our bill, separate checks, we noticed they had already added 18% gratuity...ok we can't make a reservation because our party is too small but big enough that you automatically add 18% gratuity?!When the change/cards were brought back the server didn't bring the loose change just rounded the dollar amounts so instead of getting $4.89 back she just brought back $4....I will not be going back anytime soon."
Josh B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",39,655,,3.0,10/5/2012,Can get SUPER busy - but don't they all.  Consistent cheesecake factory fare. You all know what it is.
Jenna V.,"Walnut Creek, CA",8,37,,1.0,8/30/2012,"Ummm no thanks. Overpriced, standard tasting food... poor service. The only thing that I will come back for is the Cheesecake and I'll just get it to go. Don't waste your whole evening waiting for a table here and getting bad service in return."
John J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",9,71,2,2.0,9/13/2009,"I am entirely unimpressed. Booh!  The interior is reminiscent of a Casino and, when crowded, almost as noisy. The wait is tremendous unless you go at off times. And the bill is staggering.  On the last excursion to this house of excrementation we had a party of six. Once all together and seated, we placed an order for drinks. These were delivered two at a time over a period of half an hour in the midst of which we placed our food orders.  We're a pretty diverse bunch. Mom and Dad split a veggie pasta which would have been good had it been served hot. As it was, it was cool when it reached the table. I had ""Jamaican Shrimp"". While the shrimp were hot, the black beans were cold. I had no idea that they overcook their shrimp to the rubber biscuit stage in Jamaica until I tasted this dish. The rice was lukewarm warm, and the one component that should have been cold, mango salsa, was lukewarm. The Baja Fish Tacos also suffered from cold beans and rice. Cold portions were sent back to the kitchen. The ""Bang-Bang"" chicken and Shrimp was sampled and discovered to be more ""Whimper-Whimper"" than ""Bang-Bang"". The young guy had a gigantic bowl of spaghetti with meat sauce. I would swear that meat sauce was straight out of the can, right off the Sysco truck..  And all the food had enough salt to turn Lake Tahoe into the Salton Sea.  This place is Applebee's on steroids. The food here has no soul, no magic. It is Corporate American Food, Inc. with an eye toward profit margin. Nothing innovative or inventive and no intentions of ever challenging ones palate. It looks like a Casino because this is exactly the kind of food served at lower end Casino food courts.  Look, if you want a great meal, it can be had in Walnut Creek. If you call this a great meal, well then you must consider Mickey D's to be Haut Cuisine.  Want a nice meal in the Creek? Go to Artisan on Bonanza and order some small plates and taste some great wines."
M O.,"Orinda, CA",0,7,1,5.0,6/19/2013,"I had a larger group on a Tuesday 6/19 1p.  Selected TCF due to the space available for larger groups, take reservations for larger parties though it will be tougher at dinner/weekends. Ambiance is nice/ festive.  Large portions, you can get smaller ones at lunch. The service was impeccable - when I called and had questions,  the manager yesterday (Andrew I think?), dealing a w. cake, and service during the meal perfect (Crystal), I have not seen such good service anywhere else in years.  The food is maybe on the pricey side, but the service makes up for it."
Arsen P.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,2,,3.0,6/18/2013,Food is really good.  the pasta dishes and sandwich dishes have been the best for me so far.  service was okay felt very rushed before I could even finish ordering she would take off and I would have to wait for her to come back to continue with my order. That was annoying! The cheesecake is terrific the tiramisu and Oreo is the way to go. The bar drinks I ordered barely had alcohol. Overall a good experience and good food. I will be coming back. Would give a 3.5 if I could
Mitch G.,"Benicia, CA",0,5,1,1.0,9/27/2014,"If you want to experience horrible service, indifference and a horrific wait, this is the place to be. Instead, go to one of the many other restaurants in Walnut Creek that offer great food and care about serving their customers. We love the SF creamery, Hubcaps, Sasa, the silk road, etc."
