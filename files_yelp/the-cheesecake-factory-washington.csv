Helena F.,"Derwood, MD",68,218,91,4.0,12/19/2017,"This was my first cheesecake factory experience and I must say I was a little overwhelmed by the LENGTH of the menu. Salads, burgers, pasta, pizza... EVERYTHING you might think of. This makes it a great place for the crowd. They do have the amount of calories next to every single item. Well, I do not know if this is the information I need to know when getting my cheesecake fix ;) Since we came here for lunch we mostly got stuff from the lunch specials. Those were still some pretty huge portions. I got almond chicken sandwich (which was tasty) and it came with ceasar and a bowl of tomato soup (I think this varies according to the offer of the soup of the day).  Overall this was rather a positive experience."
Len P.,"Washington, DC",60,85,11,3.0,1/10/2018,"Food is always good here but service is SUPER spotty - far more so than the several other Cheesecake Factory locations in the area or elsewhere. For example, 2 weeks ago I came in on a quiet night and sat at the bar. Immediately and friendly service. Tonight I went in, got seated and sat for 25 minutes while waiter after waitress walked by and left me alone. I was 5 feet from the front desk so it's not like they couldn't see I hadn't been helped. Very frustrating and though I've eaten at this location several times before (with equally inconsistent service, though never ignored for quite so long) I doubt I'll be back."
Jynnah R.,"Washington, DC",108,87,159,2.0,12/22/2017,"I have been here a couple of times and had a different server each time but they all seem so sad. There is a movie theatre across the street where a friend and I always come from afterwards to the factory.  Every time we come here our server just seems so sad. Like they all seem like they don't want to be there. I wonder if it is management? Someone should check?  While the food is pretty good, It takes forever even though every time we are there, it is never full or half full. The food is always pretty good, it's Cheesecake Factory, there menu doesn't change so it's pretty consistent. No complaints on our actual dishes, but you have to ask for bread and they bring you a chunk of butter.  It's just not the best atmosphere."
Gellie E.,"Washington, DC",122,256,623,2.0,11/22/2017,"Recommend for a happy hour. They offer several of their appetizers for about $6-$8 (no more $5 apps), which is still a good deal. We ordered the sweet corn tamale cakes and chicken samosas. The tamale cakes were refreshing and filling. The chicken samosas were essentially ground chicken in triangles - no potatoes or veggies that a traditional samosa has. They were greasy and I would not get again. We also ordered an entree off of the regular menu and just a note - the complimentary bread was not good. The bread wasn't quite room temperature, but practically. Our refill batch (we like our carbs), was cold and stale - but maybe that's what we get for asking for a refill. No qualms about service; it was adequate. They have a to-go counter on their upper level, where we got some cheesecakes for the road (because you can't go to Cheesecake Factory without getting cheesecake!). But all in all, not my favorite Cheesecake Factory location."
Eric H.,"Washington, DC",171,32,14,3.0,9/15/2017,"For whatever reason I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory before. So when a coworker was looking for a place in the barren Friendship Heights to have his last lunch before leaving the company, we decided on Cheesecake Factory. Nothing much to say about this place other than it's extremely cookie cutter and exactly what I expected. It's essentially a Chili's with a nicer interior and more expensive food. We got some appetizers which were tasty but really heavy. Then we all had a different salad and they were drenched in dressing. Pretty much par for the course. Either way, it was a good time. Service was a bit slow, but no complaints."
Rithi C.,"Baltimore, MD",453,116,138,4.0,6/14/2017,"Came here with my girlfriend for a quick lunch. The restaurant was busy, but we were able to get a table for two. The waitress was polite and very accommodating: I told her that we were in a hurry and she was happy to give us our bill when our food arrived. We both ordered a burger - mine medium (as it should be) and hers well-done (....). It took a while for our burgers to arrive because a well-done burger takes longer, but they were both tasty and more than filling. The Cheesecake Factory is known for their (You guessed it!) cheesecake, but we didn't have time to get dessert this time. If the quality of cheesecakes is consistent across these venues, then I'm sure theirs is fantastic. A nice sit-down venue for lunch or dinner; I wouldn't be opposed to coming here again."
Marco M.,"McLean, VA",137,103,35,2.0,12/18/2017,I've been ordering a large catering orders ($600+) from Cheesecake Factory for the past two years and every year there is always a delay.  My pick up time is always 11:30am (that's the earliest available) and I never leave until 12 noon.  My special requests are never completed. This is the main reason why there's always a delay.  This year they couldn't locate my catering order which was very surprising to me because I called last Friday and Monday morning to confirm.  Their customer service isn't the greatest; I never got an apology after waiting over 30 minutes and for messing up my special requests I made for the order. I will definitely not return here.
Rebecca W.,"Baton Rouge, LA",1990,930,7784,4.0,12/22/2017,"This was super convenient, especially after a long day of DC activities. My family and I were happy to get back to our hotel and eat some real food. Before this, it was overpriced zoo food, so we needed some fare a couple steps above. I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in years, but it's fairly consistent everywhere I have been. Dim lighting, ample seating and the cheesecake case right in the front, so you can drool while you wait for your food or wait to be seated. The staff here was nice, but after we got our order, one of the staff seemed a bit snippety after I asked for some to-go utensils. Whatever. Food was ready within 20 minutes and we were on our way up to our rooms to get our grub on. Ordered a burger, crab bites/balls and an Oreo cheesecake. The food was tasty and quite filling. These days, I just like to take bites of food and I feel like I've eaten a complete meal. So, from what I tasted, I was satisfied with. The fries were not all that crispy, but oh well, can't win 'em all right? This is located in the Chevy Chase Shopping Plaza. There is a possibility we'll be back before we check out of our hotel, since it is so close and their cheesecake is always something I have enjoyed."
Linnie S.,"Washington, DC",1,2,,2.0,12/31/2017,"Too small,too far away from 90% of the residence that eat in mall restaurants.This is a over hyped location in a dying section of dc. Everything about this location is 50/50.They should put a location more in the downtown area around h st."
Faith P.,"Washington, DC",291,52,8,1.0,8/14/2017,"- Came here with a friend, hostess was nice. We decided to sit upstairs. We was turned off by THE DIRTY SILVERWARE AND FOOD STAINS ON THE MENU. That we decided to go somewhere else to eat. Won't be back."
Julia G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",22,121,532,3.0,4/25/2017,"Went last night for a group dinner with work. Cheesecake Factory is never my choice of dinner in a big city that has lots of great, local, farm to table options, but tonight was not bad. Ordered the herb crusted salmon which usually comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus, but just swapped out the mashed potatoes for the snow peas side and I'm so glad I did! The snow peas were mixed with some zucchini and onions and tasted great. So did the salmon. Everything was done nicely on the plate.  Ordered a lemon raspberry cheesecake which I haven't had in years but was as light as I remember it compared to some of the very heavy cheesecakes that they serve."
Lisa G.,"Washington, DC",26,104,153,4.0,12/24/2017,"I didn't feel like cooking two days before Christmas so we treated ourselves to dinner while shopping in Friendship Heights. There were a good amount of people in the restaurant and we opted to dine on the second floor. The hostess was friendly and we were promptly seated. We already knew what we wanted so were ready to order as soon as we sat down so were a bit disappointed when it took our server 5 minutes to greet us and ask us what we wanted. After we ordered, our server Damani) brought out water (he forgot the lemon wedges) and bread (it was not warm like it usually is). Our loaded baked potato tots arrived pretty quickly and they were delicious. Our entrees, chicken chipotle pasta and bistro shrimp pasta, came out soon thereafter and were also yummy. We ate maybe half of our entrees (such big portions) and ordered snickers cheesecake (it was a pretty small slice) to go. Overall, the food was a 4.5 but the service was a 3. Still, Cheesecake Factory is always a fave so we will be back."
Shelly J.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",334,179,799,3.0,11/12/2016,"Average experience So after watching a nice movie, my friend and I wanted something light. Hostess wasnt really friendly, first she strutted across her booth to take us to the table by the cold glass door. I was going to sit but my friend, flat out told her no, thats not happening. Can we get a better table please?! Hostess seemed offended that she had asked. Moving on, waiter took his time in getting to us. It wasnt that busy. (9pm) I wanted crab  wontons and apple crisp and my friend got a salad. Food came out fast. My crab wontons barely tasted like crab. It was more like eating deep fried cream cheese balls. The dipping sauce was horrific. Menu stated: sweet chili sauce that was a lie. I got some rice vinegar dressing with red pepper flakes swimming in it. I couldnt eat it. So, my waiter pulled a disappearing act. Never checked on us. My friends salad, she liked it. The manager was the food runner and brought my apple crisp and my friend got cheesecake.  The apple crisp was good. It made my night better. Finally waiter shows up because its time to pay. Next time we will sit at the bar and I dont recommend the crab wontons."
Sam T.,"North Bethesda, MD",130,448,1793,3.0,4/20/2017,"We stopped here on the way home as the wife was in the mood for this place after we got some great news. We were headed home for veggies and frozen shrimp so this was a ""treat"". Our experience was average as was the service and the food."
Chris D.,"Washington, DC",397,44,18,1.0,4/18/2017,"Tuesday night... my cousin & I went to this location. It's closest to both of us. We got there around 10:30....the bar was packed... We waited because we didn't wanna sit at a table.  Finally we sat down at the bar. Brooke C was the bartender. I asked for a taste of Rose... the restaurant was completely out of it. This big huge component of a big corporation was out of Rose! Cousin ordered Riesling & I Pinot Grigio . We each had 2 glasses of each. Appetizers: she: crab & artichoke dip, Greek salad (with NO ONIONS- she sent it back.....yet again it came back with opinions {but she was so hungry}) . I ordered my usual fried Mac & cheese balls (they were smaller....didn't have as much flavor or sauce) MAINS: Cousin: got the Miso salmon. The miso glaze was thick like BBQ sauce & wasn't as hot as it should've been . Me: my usual shrimp scampi ....with extra noodles & extra sauce! However my noodles were COLD!!! The shrimp were lukewarm. I was like how in the hell are you gonna try to gimme cold noodles tho? * So my cousin & I told Brooke C. She actually asked me did I want her to reheat just the pasta or the whole thing? My cousin & I were thrown off like did she just ask us did she want her to reheat this food ? Or did I want them to make a new dish. I work in food & beverage so I know the behind the scenes tricks kitchen's use in a situation like this. How dare she ask me if  I want her to reheat it? !""!""! I was DISGUSTED ! To me , a customer I had visions of them throwing it in the microwave . So I sent it back the WHOLE THING to have a new plate made. A manager comes down. We tell her what's happened. She says ""oh no we don't use a microwave! We can basically toss it in a pan & re plate it or make a totally fresh plate...takes like 5 minutes?"" Why would a fresh entree ever take 5 MINUTES? My cousin had already been suffering through her lukewarm food... Finally mine comes out... By this point I'm so over the experience but yet still hungry. I was so disappointed... This was just an AWFUL experience. Cold food, asking if I wanted it reheated?. Could've been prevented! I just cannot believe this even happened. RUINED MY WHOLE NIGHT !"
Linda L.,"Rockville, MD",79,183,308,3.0,7/4/2017,"The restaurant is located in downtown Chevy Chase. There is street parking nearby or garage parking for a fee. Outdoor and indoor seating are available, and this location occupies two floors. On this day, we arrived right when they opened at 11:30am and were able to snag seats indoors close to the window which provided a great view of the streets. The tables are arranged close to one another, so that is one thing to consider if you prefer more privacy. I ordered an egg white omelette with veggies and goat cheese. For the custom omelette, you can add up to four toppings and it comes with toast and tomatoes/house potatoes. The portions here are very generous, so make room for dessert! The menu is endless with breakfast served all day and a separate Sunday brunch and of course, cheesecake menu. My omelette came out perfectly constructed; however, the goat cheese was not spread throughout. The house potatoes were somewhat bland since there was not enough seasoning.  Our waitress, Jordan checked on us several times and the service was good. She was also attentive with refills which was a plus on this hot day."
Ashleigh O.,"Washington, DC",284,147,90,4.0,5/15/2017,I've been to this location a few times so this review is just an overall summary of my experiences. I've never had a bad experience coming here and each time has been with a large party. I haven't had a terrible experience with service here but a couple of times it was a bit lacking for it to be a big group.
Deanna D.,"Bethesda, MD",39,82,135,5.0,9/25/2016,"For some reason, this Cheesecake Factory doesn't have the highest reviews... Hmmm, because every time I go, I get great service and great food.  This visit was a special occasion, it was for my best friend's birthday!!! Lol! Our server was Antonio and he was wonderful! Very patient and just did a great job.  I ordered the Luau salad with chicken and let's just say... It was sooooooooooo good! I didn't want it to end! I also ordered a piece of snickers cheesecake to go (Sat) and enjoyed it today (Sun). I can't quite remember what my best friend had, but she did say she really enjoyed it. Hoping they will keep up the good work and will definitely be returning for that salad!"
Henry R.,"Fort Bragg, CA",0,16,7,1.0,12/2/2017,"One of the worst cheesecake factory's I have eaten at.......from the server taking a break before taking our order to dirty silverware, dirty table food still stuck on plates.......diaipointed in this location."
Nichole E.,"Washington, DC",1,19,4,5.0,6/20/2017,"Was served by Tatianna. She was a great waitress & very kind! She even gave us advice on which dishes to choose from.  The food was really good & it's extremely beautiful inside. It was my first time going to Cheesecake Factory & im so glad i shared my first experience at that location. Looks so upscale and elegant, my type of thing"
Ali V.,"Bethesda, MD",118,166,116,4.0,8/6/2017,"It's nice that they put how many calories are in a slice of cheesecake, but it really reminded me that maybe I would be full after eating just half of one. It always seems to be buzzing, but not too loud. Seems like a nice place to go for a medium-special occasion or just to take a break from a tiring day of shopping in Friendship Heights."
Saria H.,"Syracuse, NY",9,3,,1.0,11/26/2017,I love Cheesecake Factory. I wish I could say that my experience at this location was as good as others. But after being stuffed in a corner table and ignored for 8 minutes; my husband and I discovered our new love: Maggiano's!
Lauren S.,"Gaithersburg, MD",39,110,164,3.0,8/25/2017,"I'd like to give 3 1/2 stars.  My rating is based on several factors - my dinner, my friend's dinner and the service.  We started with the Chicken Potstickers off the Skinnylicious menu.  The Potstickers were so wonderful  - soft with a tasty filling in a fabulous garlic ginger sauce.   Then I got the Skinnylicious Veggie Burger, with a side Caesar Salad.   The veggie burger was enormous and delicious on a soft bun.  I could only eat half because it was so large and filling.  I had the option of getting a house salad or a Ceasar Salad and I'm so glad I got the latter.  The Salad was fantastic with good dressing, crunchy croutons and a sprinkling of shredded Romano.  It was really a very good salad.  My friend was not so happy with his meal.   He got the Meatloaf with mashed potatoes and succotash.   I didn't taste his meal but he thought the seasoning in the meatloaf was unusual, it wasn't the standard meatloaf flavor he was craving and so he was disappointed.  He thought the mashed potatoes were good, but then thought the succotash was odd because the ingredients were unexpected - peppers, corn and zuccchini.  If I had to sum up, his expectations were different than the reality. Sometimes that turns out well, and sometimes not.   We both enjoyed the warm Apple Crisp with vanilla ice cream.   The staff was very friendly - we were greeted warmly at the door, and our server was friendly and knowledgeable and efficient.   The restaurant is loud - on each of the two levels.  At this location they have outdoors seating off the lower level, which is a nice option.   They don't take reservations."
Chris L.,"Washington, DC",4,34,20,5.0,12/1/2017,"Such a classic dependable go to spot. Like how so much options on the menu, breakfast served all day, calories listed on menu, low fat options, and very family friendly. Heard the weekend brunch suppose to be good. Highly recommend the Thai lettuce wraps!"
Lisa M.,"Washington, DC",0,2,,2.0,12/29/2017,"First let me start by saying I love The Cheesecake Factory, like made my family take me here for my law school graduation dinner love. This location is the worse I've ever been to and I've visited Cheesecakes coast to coast! Since this one is in my neighborhood I find myself visiting it often BUT never again for the second time in a row and the umpteenth time total they've gotten my to go order wrong. Then when I say it's wrong they get upset at me! Idc how much I like this place their incompetence knows no bounds. Two stars because the food still smacks...the customer service just sucks."
Angiebear M.,"Silver Spring, MD",81,10,,5.0,7/13/2017,"My husband and I went to a doctor appointment in Friendship Heights on Tuesday and we both were crazy hungry afterward. We knew we'd have to wait out the traffic to get back home so we thought, let's take advantage of Cheesecake Factory's happy hour. Solid plan.  It's been like 2 years since we went to a Cheesecake Factory but it was worth it for the strong drinks and great food deals for happy hour! Wesley served us and he was just awesome. He was really attentive, made sure we got our drinks before happy hour ended, and was overall really pleasant. After having a pretty crummy day, he was a joy to have! The food was good, too. The happy hour burger was actually the size of a real burger and it was no hassle to get fries on the side. I didn't care for the rice with my steak tacos, but the tacos themselves were pretty tasty. (That sauce!) If we're back in the area again, heading back to Cheesecake might be the move."
Bri R.,"Washington, DC",2,33,3,1.0,7/27/2017,"We decided to go here for my birthday. I had never been but I love cheesecake so I thought, ""Why not?"" I'll tell you why not. Our server couldnt care less that it was my birthday, spent waaaaaay more time at another table flirting with 2 tipsy chicks than at my table of 9 and the food was terrible. Some folks had over salted vegetables and french fries while others, like me, had under seasoned pasta. The Chicken Da Vinci is disgusting and our server claimed that he knew it was horrible and asked me why I ordered it. Now, this is after 30 minutes of NOT checking on us and the table next to us. The table next to us sent their food back as well.  I do NOT reccomend celebrating anything here. The cheesecake is yummy but that's most likely not made in house. Oh and, no I didnt get a free one. Mr.Server said they no longer do that. And to top it all off, I woke up this morning with bubble guts. Yay!"
Grace A.,"Phoenix, AZ",292,13,1,4.0,11/17/2017,"I've visited this Cheesecake Factory several times - it's always pretty good. Nothing too fancy, but big portions and reasonable prices. The menu is a bit overwhelming, but there's so many options that you'll always find something you like! This location typically has slower service... especially when they get busy, some tables just get bypassed or forgotten. However, the servers make up for it with their sunny personalities and willingness to go out of their way to guarantee a positive experience!"
Amy. F.,"Takoma Park, MD",5,12,5,3.0,5/4/2017,"I received a nice note in the mail hand signed apologizing for the disaster of that visit.  They covered 2/3 of the price of the two meals, which was decent considering they were pretty much inedible, so I received my money back.  I still want to cry when I think of the experience though so will never return to that location, and maybe not the restaurant as a whole.  Still, at least they care."
Paola G.,"Silver Spring, MD",335,299,34,5.0,6/26/2017,Ask for Alissa. She's awesome! Deserves best waitress award.  Besides that all of cheesecake food is great!
Dasha T.,"Manhattan, NY",2,6,,2.0,10/16/2017,"Not amazing but not horrible either. The service was good, quick and friendly, and overall the food was good! I liked the menu had a wide variety of food. I was only disappointed by a couple things. First, the side salad is just mixed greens with a small slice of tomato, would've been nice to see something more than just that. Second the menu says ""original cheesecake with fresh strawberries"" but the strawberries were not fresh, they were just strawberry preserves."
Uncle L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,1,3.0,10/8/2017,This one is a hit and miss but the staff were great! I can't blame them for the Quality portion but I think it all depends on who is cooking what! I will go back if I am in the area but three stars for the meals we had that day!
Kathryn L.,"North Bethesda, MD",598,725,5211,4.0,1/10/2016,"It's mandatory I update my review....do overs are always good, especially when they are in your favor.  Wanted a quick snack between shopping & football, hence the craving for the Avocados Egg Rolls called us.  Walked in, zero'd in on a table by the window on the 1st floor.  Hostess said hi & welcomed, I said hi back & asked if we could have that table, she said sure & allow her to clean off it 1st, works for me.  We got situated, she came back with menus & told us that Mike would be serving us. That he did, what outstanding serving & social skills he exuded.  He was very pleasant, engaging & knew the menu.  Mike also was proactive & stay on accord in checking on us through out. After we demolished the yummy Avocado Egg Rolls, we did decided to try one of their new salads, the Vegan Cobb Salad, say it an't so CF. Not only was the portion enormous as we were so happy we decided to share, yet those ingredients were bomblicious!  It came with & placed in a nice foodie precision layout of Grilled Asparagus, Green Beans, Roasted Beets, Avocado, Cucumber, Tomato, Garbanzo Beans, Quinoa, Almonds & Sunflower Seeds with their very tasting special House Vinaigrette.  I would just love when CF makes a Vegan Cheesecake, yet until then, here are some Vegan/Veggie options to share:  Veggie Burger (without cheese/mayo) on their sourdough or wheat bread. Pasta with the rigatoni, which is vegan, tossed in olive oil instead of butter & 86 the parmesan cheese, you are golden to enjoy some good options.  Salads galore...of course.  Although it was not a full meal setting, Mike did his thing on his service & the timing of the food, couldn't ask for a better mid day meal experience."
Diane F.,"Crystal River, FL",116,11,18,5.0,6/30/2017,Excellent food as we expected they would have.  We were seated quickly and the servers were great. Staying at Embassy suites Hotel in the same plaza we have eaten here several times and never been disappointed. Cheesecake factory is a chain you can count on. Try the avocado eggrolls
Rachel H.,"Rockville, MD",71,200,62,2.0,6/28/2017,"Where do I began with this review? We arrived at The Cheesecake Factory around 8 on a Tuesday night and found no wait time. We visit their other locations and are basically always happy but we won't be back to this one. Our sever just couldn't get it together and it became increasingly clear that he just didn't care. We were seated for about fifteen minutes before having to flag down two severs for the bread. One of the nice things about going to The Cheesecake Factory is eating bread while browsing the menu. While ordering I asked for certain items to be left off, I was informed that the sever isn't able to accommodate the request due to the system. We typically come once or twice a month and I always get the same time... with the accommodations. I'm pretty sure the sever just didn't want to put in the extra work. We finally got the bread and our food (without the accommodations) came right after. The table across from us sent their bill back three times and the sever still couldn't seem to figure it out. I'm not exactly sure where our sever went during the course of the meal. I asked for ranch and by the time the sever came back I didn't need it anymore. The sever even mentioned that it had taken him ten minutes. Eventually we got our bill and everything was surprising correct. However; the bill was rung up wrong and when we tried to use a gift card we got the balance slip but no giftcard. It took another ten minutes for him to come back with it. I honestly felt like we spent more time correcting issues and looking for our sever than we spent enjoying our meal. We won't be back to this exact location. It's unfortunate that The Cheesecake Factory cannot seem to offer quality service at all of their restaurants."
Michelle A.,"Los Angeles, CA",949,68,156,4.0,3/2/2017,"First I'd like to say the manager was awesome!! The food we had wasn't the best...kinda bland. However, everyones taste is different, so I won't mention the dish.  The Salmon Egg rolls and Avocado Egg rolls were the best...oh and the Wheat Bread they bring before dinner. Anyway, the manager gave us each a slice Cheesecake since we didn't care for meal... he wanted to comp the meal, but we wouldn't let him...so thanks for Cheesecakes. I had the White Chocolate Macadamia Nuts and Pecan....TO DIE FOR!! Great customer service!!"
LaRae J.,"Cheyenne, WY",0,44,9,5.0,9/16/2017,"Amazing and delicious! Probably the best Cheesecake Factory I've visited. Simone, our waitress, was so pleasantly phenomenal. If I'm ever back in town, I'm definitely ask for her to be our server. In regards to the menu, the Miso Salmon is a must order as well as the cucumber lemonade. Yummmmm!"
Andrew J.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,10,,1.0,12/22/2016,Cheesecake factory kicked out on duty law-enforcement officers out of the restaurant because they were wearing their service weapons along with their uniforms and badges that clearly identified them as police officers.  How dare them disrespect the officers their families and the members of community around them.  I hope there's never a knife wielding lunatic or a robbery going on at the cheesecake factory because the police won't be allowed inside due to their no gun policy.  I hope Cheesefactory knows people could be going and most likely are going in there left and right with concealed weapons and nobody even knows! Cheesecake factory employee chose to single out on duty law-enforcement and that is wrong! cheesecake factory issued a sheepish generic apology for the incident which is completely unacceptable.  I will never bring my family to cheesecake factory ever again!
Pam L.,"Washington, DC",84,80,109,4.0,1/28/2017,Came for a late night drink. They have 4 150 calorie drinks. I had a margarita it was so yummy for 150 you can't beat it
Leak S.,"Washington, DC",0,12,2,3.0,8/16/2017,"I love this place but today I ordered food  to go and I have learned my lesson. Only eat in cause if you don't like it you can send it back. My potstickers were nasty, the chicken tasted overcooked and the crab dip was ok at best . Nothing special about it."
