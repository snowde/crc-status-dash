Michael T.,"Honolulu, HI",32,25,,4.0,8/23/2011,"This restaurant rocks . . . literally. I had lunch at this beautifully appointed restaurant during the 5.8 earthquake that originated in Virginia but shook the Washington D.C. area, along with some 20 other states and eastern Canada. The light fixtures swayed, the floors rumbled, and a few laminated menus flopped to the floor. While workers in the adjacent office building evacuated, the employees at the Cheesecake Factory remained calm, flipped the television to a news channel, and reported the news to all those who cared and were within earshot. At first, I thought the underground Metro had rumbled to a rough stop several feet below, but I soon realized I was experiencing a rare, and hopefully once in a lifetime, event -- a jolting earthquake in our nation's capital. Wow! By the way, the food was excellent despite the geological sideshow. The server brought two kinds of bread -- three or four slices of a soft baguette, and an equal number of a dark, perhaps molasses bread.  I then had the lunch set -- a chicken and apple salad sandwich, the house tossed salad (expertly dressed with, not drowned in, vinaigrette), and the soup of the day, a rich mushroom cream soup. This was a perfect lunch for an eventful afternoon.  While the chicken salad was not the best I've had, the bread was toasted just right, and the sandwich was cut into neat geometric shapes that enhanced my dining experience. Visual appeal is so important to me. I had a cold bottle of Redbridge beer, a gluten-free, sorghum brew by Anheuser-Busch. Very different; smooth and clean-tasting. Uncharacteristically, I skipped dessert -- duh, no cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory? -- probably in my subconscious haste to leave the restaurant before an aftershock. This restaurant, like others in the chain, is dependably excellent.  This particular location, however, is the only one I've been to that literally rocks.  For that reason, it probably will remain my favorite Cheesecake Factory in the country!"
Mike P.,"Phyllis, KY",0,5,1,2.0,6/20/2015,"They took waaaaaay to long to seat us.the food was decent, but I wouldn't come here unless u can patiently wait for 1 hour"
Andrew W.,"San Diego, CA",2,35,,4.0,1/25/2012,"This Cheesecake Factory is just like all the rest:  huge portions, long waits, and amazing desserts.  I used to come here once a week, but now that I am getting healthy and my SO has decided she is going vegan (360 days a year, and vegetarian on the other 5.25 days) we come less often. Four stars because I award that fifth star only to dining establishments which offer a truely amazing  and unique experience."
Emi R.,"Washington, DC",7,44,,2.0,3/19/2011,"Oh, the mediocrity. I'd avoided this place like the plague, because if I'm going to be living in DC, there's about a million non-chain restaurants I could eat at. But I got roped into this for a friend's birthday. And I'm probably not coming back anytime soon. Here's what doesn't make sense: cheesecake is an insanely fatty food, and while it's delicious, I wouldn't want to eat it following a giant dish of pasta. Which is what a lot of the menu is. So I went with a chicken caesar salad; impossible to screw up, right? WRONG. The lettuce sometimes tasted like artichokes, the dressing was inexplicably spicy, the parmesan cheese tasted like it came out of a bag and the chicken was dry and cold. I've had better salads at McDonald's. But hey, the cheesecake couldn't be bad, right? I looked at an overwhelming list and settled on white chocolate raspberry. It was SO sweet. SO ... insanely ... sweet. I couldn't even finish it, despite the fact that I had only eaten a third of my salad. Also, the server was pretty standoffish. She handed us the cheesecake menu and then didn't come back for 15 minutes. And she wasn't super-helpful or anything. The worst part? A salad, slice of cheesecake and a diet coke was $30."
Colin R.,"Denver, CO",0,19,,1.0,10/12/2012,"How do I hate the Cheesecake Factory? Let me count the ways. First of all, much of the food isn't even prepared onsite (it's reheated from a central facility in the manner of fast food). For the price of the food, you could go to a genuinely good restaurant and get something handmade. Not only that, but you get a menu full of ads, since they're obviously not ripping you off quite enough! Unbelievably tacky. Seriously, go support a local restaurant, which will give you better food, better service, and better prices. You'll be glad that you skipped out on this palace of mediocrity."
X X.,"Washington, DC",0,351,,1.0,12/18/2015,the service was bad. with friends and they could not understand why we had to wait so long. the restaurant not busy. The table next to us got better service. the food was average. There must of been spices in the hamburger. The restaurant not busy. We could not eat dessert. We were on a time limit. And went somewhere else where we could get faster service. The wait person talked too fast. Hard to understand. Not slow down. I was still hungry when I left. Something about the food was not filling. the atmosphere not much of. We sat in a booth. and had a poor lighting. It was fun to be with the friends.
Emily B.,"Washington, DC",0,12,,1.0,9/29/2014,"I love this chain, but the Friendship Heights restaurant is pretty bad.  One particular time I went with my parents. They flew all the way from Europe to see me and I took them to Cheesecake Factory because I thought it'd be nice, but the evening was just more trouble than it was worth.  My dad ordered a beer and the glass was broken, so he accidentally cut his mouth on it.  We're not high maintenance patrons; we just asked that the waitress take it away and probably throw away the glass so nobody else has that experience.  The waitress was appropriately apologetic about it, but the manager came over.  I thought she was going to apologize or offer us a free beer or a coupon or something to compensate for the bad experience.  But instead she overbearingly asked us, ""Is there a problem??"" And we simply explained the situation- not that we should have had to.  We really just wanted to be left alone so we could eat our food.  They brought my dad another beer, but accidentally charged us for three beers.  Not only did it take us fifteen minutes to convince the waitress that my dad was only brought two, (although he did technically only drink one because the first one cut his lip) but it would have been more impressive if they had said ""You know what? The beer's on us.""  I was just all around very disappointed.   once I went there just to get avocado egg rolls to go, and there were more sun dried tomatoes than avocados, so the egg rolls were tart and overwhelming.  They're overpriced, but they're so good I normally don't mind.  Now I'm hesitant to splurge on them again. The food is great, but I mean, it's a chain so I can't really credit this place with that. Overall it's just a sloppy establishment. The music is too loud and the service is unprofessional. Part of Cheesecake Factory's charm is that the waiters are supposed to be elite.  These waiters all look dishevled, I mean they might as well be working at McDonald's.  I live in the neighborhood and I'd go here way more often if I were more impressed by it.   But it's just supremely disappointing.  The experience feels cheap.  It's a shame."
Kelly G.,"Washington, DC",643,1117,2185,4.0,3/26/2011,"On 3/19/11, I took myself to The Cheesecake Factory after pilates. I wanted soup. I thought they might have my favorite. They did! Chicken artichoke soup is actually on the menu every Saturday! Wow! Throw in the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake and I am one fat and happy camper. I was one of those people eating alone at the bar, Tara L., but am not certifiably crazy. Am I? I dunno. Am I? You talking to me? What are you looking at? Oh excuse me. You're excused. No, no, excuse me..... ....We'll be back to The Cheesecake Factory to settle this once and for all. We're sure we are fans."
Mark L.,"Boynton Beach, FL",1,45,15,4.0,7/22/2013,"My favorite chain restaurant.  As expected very busy on a Saturday night.  We stopped by the take out desk on the 2nd floor to grab some dessert.  Service was quick.  This location suffers from lack of open parking, there is a pay to stay underground garage that is nice."
Cathy H.,"Washington, DC",799,317,1032,3.0,12/13/2011,"I almost never frequent American chain restaurants because it would definitely affect my foodie credibility, if you know what I mean.  :-)  The only reason I go to the Olive Garden is I used to work there as a teenager and it holds a special place in my heart.  But, I will tell you that The Cheesecake Factory serves awesome appetizers.   The Avocado Egg Rolls and Thai Lettuce Wraps are very yummy.  The lettuce wraps are an interactive meal in that you assemble your own.  Included are glazed chicken, bean sprouts, cilantro, julienned carrots, noodles, thinly sliced cucumbers, and three possible dipping sauces: peanut, sweet and sour, and tamarind-cashew (same dip that accompanies egg rolls).   I am not usually a fan of TCF entrees because they are massive and often times mediocre-tasting.  In the past, I've tried their salads, Kobe burger, Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, and Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp; all decent, but nothing memorable.   Go here for the appetizers."
H. W.,"Washington, DC",0,34,7,4.0,9/18/2013,"You only get 4 stars Cheesecake, bc you got rid of not only my favorite drink (cucumber martini) but unforgivably my favorite sandwich, the grilled portobello mushroom!!!  Luckily, they still make it for me there sometimes, been frequenting this location since '97.   But there is such a variety, which is what I like best about the CF chain.  Great food, good service, efficient knowledgable staff.   The beet, goat cheese, arugula salad melts in your mouth!  I love the raspberry lemon cheesecake - yum!  So much I could write about the drinks, choices, and taste!   Please tell corporate to bring back the portobello sandwich!  The Japanese eggplant sandwich doesn't measure up!!! This location is one of the more fun of the Cheesecake Factories from DC to Rockville, Columbia, Annapolis, etc, but it's acoustics make it loud.  Love the spiral staircase. Easy parking in the garage below the pavilion, be sure to get your parking sticker validated at the hostess stand."
Adam M.,"Washington, DC",45,275,4,4.0,10/16/2009,"I don't really understand how they do it:  Cheesecake Factory's prices are par for the course, but the portions are astronomically large.  I ordered a lunch special--""half"" a turkey sandwich with a salad and a bowl of chowdah.  It was $9.95 for all that food,  and the turkey sandwich was more like a whole normal turkey sandwich than a half.  The bowl of chowder was too large for me to finish.  The salad was tossed in a tasy vinegarette; the turkey was pretty good, better than your average deli meat.  And the chowder was creamy and tasty. The decor is really very nice for a chain restaurant.  The other person in my party ordered a slice of pumpkin cheesecake for dessert, and it was delicious. There's really nothing bad to say about this place.  Friendly service, nice decor, good food, and good prices.  I guess I don't really understand how they make any $$, though."
Steven B.,"Long Beach, CA",58,67,1,4.0,7/30/2011,"Visited the bar tonight.  Had the stuffed mushrooms to start, and the spicy cashew chicken for an entree, although I subbed out rice for broccoli instead.   The food, as expected from The Cheesecake Factory, was outstanding.  It was delivered a bit slowly, but at no fault of my bartender who provided great service and searched out the status of my food before, honestly, I even noticed that I should be noticing that it hadn't come yet.   Because I am a bit of a fitness freak, I tend to be a very particular about what I eat.  Because of this, the expansive menu at The Cheesecake Factory is well suited to me preferences.  And, finally, even with the high quality of the food, I don't perceive pretentiousness from the environment which is what kills me about so many places in D.C. that try all too stubbornly to seem important.   Another dude at the bar was identified as a ""Regular.""  Based on the experience I had tonight, it's likely I may become a ""Regular"" myself in the future."
Amy S.,"Chevy Chase, MD",8,141,,5.0,8/28/2013,"Seriously, I would give this place 10 stars if I could!  When I first moved to DC, I went on a date here and thoguht it was a fancy restaurant.  I remember calling my friends back home gushing about the upscale, divine place my date took me and they laughed and told me it was a chain.  Still, the ambiance here is great with those cute little candles and the servers are SO kind and sincere!  The menu itself is insanely large but I cannot believe how delicious and wonderful their ""skinny menu"" is! Kudos to Cheesecake factory for offering a low-cal menu that us dieters can eat!  It definitely does not taste ""diet"" and the options are plentiful!  I wish more restaurants would do this!  Everytime family comes to town, I always take them here because it really is my favorite place in the area!"
Rachel M.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,,1.0,9/26/2015,"I have been a lover of the Cheesecake Factory, but If you have a baby and a stroller than this location isn't for you. I was there with two moms with strollers and the place was empty and we were treated very poorly. After being sat by the hostess in an area that was empty so that we could have our strollers without bothering people, the manager came over to us and told us our strollers were blocking the walkway (which they weren't) and that it was fire hazard.  He wanted me to move the stroller, but my baby was sleeping in it and the hostess knew we had strollers when she seated us. I moved the stroller out of the way (even more) and for the rest of our time there we received dirty and unwelcoming looks from the manager and the waiter (who wasn't even our waiter). Another patron was there with her stroller and the manager did not bother her. In retrospect, I believe we were harassed because we only ordered coffee and drinks and did not order a meal at 4pm (the place was empty and isn't any service better than no service?). I guess we can test that now because I don't plan on returning and neither do my friends. We also will be sure to put the word out that this location is not mom and kid friendly! I also believe Cheesecake should rethink their management if managers like this are representing them."
Jamila T.,"Baltimore, MD",34,91,53,2.0,12/8/2010,"This review is for dinner. I go to the Cheesecake Factory ALOT. But  I've been to this location three times, all for dinner on Sundays. Can I get some warm bread? And can it not be all white bread... lemme have some of that brown oat bread. Why am I asking? And maybe can I get a refill? Why am I asking?! lol. And how about serving my BBQ salmon meal piping hot?! (Its never happened and I get the SAME thing every time.) Until they master those few techniques I will not be back to this location. My other Cheesecake Factory locations seem to get it right. I've been to this location twice and each time I was not impressed."
Walt C.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",10,196,57,3.0,10/13/2011,"3rd time at this Cheesecake Factory this week while in town for work. Very convient to have the restaurant attached to the shopping center and easy access to metro. Food and service is always good, out of all the meals, the best was the BBQ Salmon, Hot fudge Sundae and Fried Calamari. Now to go and burn off all these calories!"
Venkatesh B.,"Rochester, MN",42,134,11,4.0,2/28/2011,"The fam and I trekked out here in the rain this evening for dinner.  We parked in the garage right next to the restaurant and underneath the mall.  Take your ticket with you as the restaurant will validate it for a discount.   We were seated quickly and served by an attentive and energetic server.  He was quick to get us everything we ordered and even though it is Monday night had a lot of energy.   I highly recommend the chicken somosas as an appetizer.  The menu is very extensive and I'm sure delicious.  My wife had the chicken mediera which she thought was very good.  The chicken was cooked nicely as it was tender and juicy.  My sister had the pasta da vinci which she describes as delicious; she orders this every time! Finally, obviously the cheesecakes are their notable dessert but if you are interested in the other options I recommend the chocolate truffle cake, which is more than enough to share by two hungry people or three rather full people. Have a great time!"
Michael K.,"Gaithersburg, MD",19,63,37,2.0,8/12/2012,"Very nice ambiance, but terrible appetizers and entrees.  I would say that the quality of their food has gone down to TGI Fridays standards...  Their cheese cake is their speciality, but I'd avoid everything else..  (I'm referring to both DC & MD locations)"
V. T.,"Washington, DC",0,16,3,2.0,12/31/2014,If you want your food hot . Please don't sit in the bar area . Last few times food was cold order a burger was dry ass hell... Serve was deplorable... Working in the area. Please don't sit in the bar area !!!!!!
