Yasmine R.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,14,8,4.0,5/8/2015,The service and cheesecakes are great! The food is presented very well but I did not like the artichoke Crab dip. It's all artichoke and no crab lol the crab wontons (& the sauce that comes with it) are great! I had a passion mojito which was also great!! Stay away from the skinny menu if you like your food to have any flavor!
Doc F.,"Chicago, IL",1,57,13,1.0,5/15/2016,"If you can explain to me how it takes 17 minutes to serve two slices of cheesecake to go, with no one in line in front of me, then I will give the place more than one star. At least I didn't have to pay extra for the attitude from the cashier."
Rodger S.,"Washington, DC",36,182,324,5.0,5/27/2015,"Years ago, we used to go here a lot because we lived nearby. We've been out of the neighborhood now for a decade or so, & my trips back have been infrequent. But when I went for lunch yesterday, it all seemed familiar. My Santa Fe salad was just like I remembered it--& that's good!"
Summer K.,"Washington, DC",107,21,,1.0,7/26/2015,"Will not be dinning here again. They screwed up my order TWICE in a row. They made the same exact mistake...with different servers on different days. This goes to show that the wait staff is incompetent and there is poor communication with the line cooks.  Also, my boyfriend gets takeout and they ALWAYS put him on hold for so long when he calls to place his order that he has to call back. Again, poor customer service.  Too bad their food good is really good, cause their customer service effs it all up."
Cora C.,"Chicago, IL",0,116,620,4.0,4/25/2015,"Treat yourself and your loved ones to these scrumptious cheesecakes. For a restaurant, their coffee is really amazing, rivaling the best coffeehouses in town."
Christopher L.,"Takoma Park, MD",0,5,,1.0,11/11/2016,Food is typical of the Cheesecake Factory but the service is terrible. Went here for lunch on a weekday and our waitress took forever; forgot several things; brought appetizers after the meal; took forever to bring the check and then never came back to pick it up -- to the point where a lady at a nearby table came up to us to ask if we had seen her. Never had that happen before. Finally had to pay at the hostess stand and in the confusion we didn't notice that they didn't return our credit card. We have called twice to try to find out if they have it and can't get an answer. Not worth it.
Brandi B.,"Frederick, MD",35,115,80,4.0,4/15/2016,"Very nice location.  The food is amazing. To be honest, I didn't believe everyone when they would tell me how good it is.  But now I am a believer!  The portions are huge.  Definitely give the nachos and fried mac n cheese a try next time you are there.  Ridiculously delicious!"
Lori S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,43,29,3.0,3/20/2016,"Cheesecake Factory restaurant food is predictable. Here, it's the service, that is unpredictably slow and sluggish. For a restaurant this large and inside a large DC metro hotel, the service should be better. We are not impressed."
Carla T.,"Fort Washington, MD",1,2,,1.0,10/25/2015,"10-24-15 The Cheezcake Factory,  Chevy Chase location . A party of 15 to celebrate a birthday. Management failed to put us on the wait list when we arrived  at 7PM.  He made us wait an addition 1 1/2 hr and didn't have a table ready. Members of our party found 3 tables in close  proximity and ask for those. Managerment should have done that. Management  assigned a waitress that was clearly a sweet heart but way too inexperienced  to handle 15 people alone. 40 minutes later while taking our entree  orders 1/2 thru - she decide to take some other people's orders (not in our group) it was ridiculous  and they did not fairy compensate our entire party.    She took forever putting the food in and bringing  it out. Actually she didn't bring it other people did. We never even got our happy birthday  song. If she thought not to putting forth an effort due our race -she  definitely did not  get much tip due to her attentiveness ,speed and acuaracy.   I  felt cheated while paying the bill. I paid for an experience not just food. #disappointing #unprofessional"
Jalissa N.,"Kasson, MN",1,73,107,5.0,4/7/2015,"We came here last week for my friends birthday dinner. We all had wonderful food, fun, and service. I ordered the appetizer sized Cesar salad and there was plenty left over! Huge portions! Many people got the cheesecake as well. They sang happy birthday to my friend as well. Very fun!"
Natalie B.,"Washington, DC",8,31,58,4.0,7/5/2014,"I live in Bethesda & this is one of my favorite places in the area. You always want to come back whether you are with your friends, family or spouse.  The design of the interior is beautiful & it is kinda dim inside.  The menu has endless of possibilities. I love ordering the pink lemonades. I do have to say that the food is oily & can feel heavy in your stomach afterwords.  The cakes are delicious but most of them feel like a ""new york cheesecake""  - once again heavy (high fat cream I guess)."
Christopher C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",6,72,195,1.0,8/26/2014,"I have always enjoyed the food at the Cheesecake Factory - most recently the Greek salad has become a favorite with the Teriyaki Chicken and the Pepperoni Pizza. Of course I love the desserts!  The reason a 3.5 star establishment gets 1 star is the absurd corporate policy of sending out kids menu food on plates to hot to the touch. Why they cannot simply plate on regular plates is beyond me. Every time we are there with our kids, we have to send their orders back to be re-plated. As long as this continues to be corporate policy at the Cheesecake Factory, I will give everyone I eat at 1 star reviews despite the level of the service."
Gail B.,"Washington, DC",380,1223,1839,3.0,2/9/2015,"I usually eat salads and not so much cheesecake.  if you are already shopping at Mazza Gallery or nearby, it is worth a visit.  I would avoid the weekend."
Food L.,"Washington, DC",75,14,10,4.0,5/10/2015,Food was great. Ordered buffalo chicken wings which was may not be the best I've ever had but better than some other places. Big Bang chicken was ok and black pepper shrimp was too good. Their cheese cakes are good too.
Bill P.,"Denver, CO",24,79,5,2.0,1/1/2016,"OK, have not been to this location in like...10 years....place was really, really a treat to visit. Was always a little pricey but you exited feeling satisfied your dollars where spent wisely on relative decadence. Well, food was.....average at best. Service, well these days.....don't expect more and except defeat. 2 beers and a mating pair of shots....we were already $44.00 in the hole.....meh."
Maria R.,"West Covina, CA",82,24,33,4.0,2/14/2015,"This location is always busy but the service is great. Seating doesn't take long and table service is fantastic. My server Ryun D., was wonderful, excellent service! Pasta and salad were today's picks and absolutely delicious. The Chicken Chipotle Pasta had the perfect spicy kick and the Chicken Tostada Salad was very yummy."
Gail S.,"Washington, DC",23,17,6,4.0,8/24/2014,"I love the outdoor seating but often there is a bit of a wait.  The kale salad is great. I get the BBQ burger with a veggie patty. It is more healthy but still great. To be clear, it comes with bacon so it is NOT vegetation."
Connor D.,"Bethesda, MD",3,150,,4.0,2/4/2016,"Always great time here. The food is always good and the service is usually great. A few times but not usually my server will be mediocre, take a while, and not be very attentive. But it's a great place for a family to eat and is very good as a whole."
Benjamin D.,"Seabrook, TX",205,120,28,4.0,1/1/2016,"Very inviting spot to hit up either solo or with friends. The owner, Freddie, is often waiting at the door to greet folks. The food is good and the karaoke is always entertaining."
Natasha S.,"Washington, DC",312,1495,618,4.0,10/23/2012,"I won't lie, Cheesecake Factory is my favorite chain restaurant. They have so much on their menu, it's rare you meet someone no matter how picky they are can't find something to eat here. Three of us came here on a whim. It was late, and a friend of ours was staying in the Embassy Suites next door. We just needed to find a place to eat and chat. So Cheesecake was the winner. This was our first time at this specific location. We were seated immediately on this Monday evening, and the place was packed. Not what I expected for a Monday night. Our server was really attentive and very nice. I have probably tried almost everything here (sadly). I have been coming here for years and it's rare I have ordered something I don't like. This specific night, I ordered a few small plates to share. Mexican style chicken lettuce tacos, tuna tartare, fried calamari and grilled artichoke. My eating partners ordered burgers which looked fairly decent. I really love their small plates, salads and appetizers. They really do rock in these departments.  The chicken tacos were super fresh here, really flavorful. The artichoke was perfectly cooked and the calamari was tender. Not dry and over-fried. Even the bread that came out was on point - extra warm and literally right out the oven. Love this place - can't go wrong."
