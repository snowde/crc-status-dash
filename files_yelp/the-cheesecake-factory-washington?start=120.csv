Amir I.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",4,1,,3.0,1/17/2016,"Some of the restaurant's employees have a serious attitude problems. They need some more customer service training or get them fired. If you want to get a slice of cheesecake, expect a 20 min wait."
Vera K.,"Washington, DC",20,10,17,1.0,5/19/2014,"I've never been to the Cheesecake Factory before, but was very impressed by their vast menu options and wanted to test it out. My friends and I popped in on a Saturday afternoon with high hopes of enjoying our first meal at the CF. Needless to say, this was one of the worst experiences I've ever encountered.. and even for a chain restaurant.  After being seated at a table that was surrounded by several unclean tables, we requested to be moved. The 7 employees who seemed to be aimlessly congregated at the hostess table made it difficult for the hostess to do her job. Anyhow, they tried to seat us back in the same section with 1 or 2 of the tables being cleaned, and as we denied they seated us in a booth near the waiter station (smell of dish water, lots of traffic, etc)  Are bread plates and silverware were filthy with caked on dried food. After asking to speak with the manager to inform her of the not so great service and multiple health code violations.. she simply dismissed us stating that if we wanted to leave, we should. Overall, terrible customer service at this particular Friendship Heights location, and uneducated management not understanding the value of customer service and relations... made for an unfortunate experience.. and we didn't even order our food! I'll pass on this one."
Karim H.,"Washington, DC",23,37,40,3.0,3/15/2013,"This place is overrated... but it's still solid if you know what you're doing. To say the menu is big would be a bit a of an understatement. This chain is also known for its large portions. I've had lots of dishes ranging from average to excellent. Perhaps my favorite is the hibachi steak. Their steaks are pretty good overall. Their cashew chicken is OK. Burgers are solid. Flatbread sandwich is decent, even if it pales in comparison to what you might have in Navajo country.  Lots of choices for appetizers too... most of them good. My favorite are the sliders - some of the best I've had. The lettuce wraps are good. The calamari is OK. So much to choose from and I've tried a lot of them, but just thinking about it gives me a headache. I'm not a fan of cheesecake (although they have a mean brownie sunday), but I'm always down to go here if there's no better option around."
J. F.,"Greenbrae, CA",1,8,,4.0,8/18/2014,"I don't usually eat at the Cheesecake Factory. Although, they do have fabulous cheesecake. We were exhausted from touring museums and decided to camp out in our room at the Embassy Suites. Cheesecake Factory was downstairs. We ordered. Got our food. Went upstairs and realized there was no ketchup in the bag and the pasta we ordered had chicken when our vegetarian daughter ordered without.  I went back down and spoke briefly with the manager who was very nice and offered to fix the meal. I left soon after with ketchup and the corrected pasta at no extra charge. Having been a manager for a long time in a couple different restaurants, he did exactly what I would have done in a similar situation. Very kind and generous. Grateful for superb service."
Reza S.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,2,1,1.0,8/26/2015,"The service in this location is horrible.  Even in the weekdays when there are too many empty tables, you should wait for 15 min til host gives you a table. Under the table, there was napkin, small plate, and spoon which fallen by previous guests and were not removed plus too much dirts and foods under and over the table. We ordered water, but they brought orange juice instead. We ordered mashed potatoes as side, but they brought coleslaw. We ordered salad and there was piece of hair in the salad. Totally there is a shit place to go and spend money. Also, the server was so rude and impolite. I prefer to go to McDonalds instead of Cheesecake factory. I had the same experience last week at the Democracy blvd. brach too. Never go there."
Vania C.,"Washington, DC",94,106,84,4.0,7/29/2014,"I am really tempted to give this place 3 stars for their slow service and long wait but I Cheesecake Factory restaurants is generally always packed, and even more so during dinner rush hours. If only they took reservations...Regardless. the food was decent and the staff was friendly, so in the end, I gave it 4 stars. FOOD = 4.5 stars I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, which tasted well enough, but I should've gone with my first choice, Four Cheese pasta. If I was gonna order carbs anyway, might as well go out. But no, I tried to be healthy and avoid the cheese and totally regretted it. My friend sitting across from me ended up ordeirng the Four Cheese pasta and it was mocking me the entire night. Portion size is defintely huge. I couldn't finish my pasta in one sitting and had to bring it home. I'm personally not a huge fan of cheesecake, but all of my friends raved about the chocolate & peanut butter cheesecake so I'll just go out on a limb and assume it was good. SERVICE = 3.5 stars One word: SLOW. If it weren't for the fact that we were an hour and a half away from campus, I wouldn't wait 2 hours for my food. The wait was long, and after a day of shopping, we were all starving. For dinner, I recommend coming early around 5pm or later around 8pm. Definitely avoid the dinner rush between 6-7pm. Food was served around 20 minutes after we ordered, but our waiter was clearly preoccupied with other tables. We had to try really hard to get his attention when we wanted more water, order cheesecake for dessert, and pay the check. PRICE = 4 stars A little pricey bc we were in DC but still worth it, given the amount of food they give. Evelyn's Favorite Pasta was around $14-15. ENVIRONMENT = 4 stars Classy, dim lighting - good place for dinner with a group of friends or for a date."
Kelly S.,"Greenbelt, MD",6,4,15,1.0,4/13/2015,"I don't even know where to start. We ordered a 10 inches ""The Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake"" over the phone to be picked up by April 13th which is today. When we came it was already almost 7pm, so we have decided to have dinner since we haven't eaten yet. We told the server we ordered a whole cheesecake over the phone and asked her if she's going to give it to us before we leave, she said yes! she is going to give it to us before we leave. An hour later, when we were about to leave she told us that it's better to pick the cheesecake up ourselves from the bakery so we can see the cheesecake and etc. then we said, ok no big deal. So we went to the bakery and asked for the cheesecake we ordered over the phone. As soon as we got home, I took the box out of the bag and saw the exterior side of the box has lots of chocolate stain probably the person who put the cake in the box has DIRTY HANDS and didn't even wipe the box at least!!!!! So I opened the box immediately to see if everything was good. Holy moly! you can't believe what I just saw! A 53 dollar 10 inches DESTROYED ULTIMATE RED VELVET CHEESECAKE!!!!!! The person who put the cake in the box was responsible for this. He/she didn't put the cake carefully and properly knowing that cakes are FRAGILE!!! 4 slices of cheesecake which are worth almost 32 dollars was damaged and the toppings/icing was all over the box. It was so terrible!!!! Obviously you can see it yourself in the attached photos. That cake I ordered is for the surprise 80th birthday partyof my dying Father-in-law!!!! For 70 bucks of meals and 53 dollars cheesecake aren't worth it!!!!! Cheesecake factory just destroyed everything!!!! So if you wanna order a cheesecake to go, this place is not the right place for you. Don't waste your time and money here!!! STAY AWAY!!!!!!"
Deanna F.,"Austell, GA",0,6,,1.0,7/29/2016,"Horrible service and food!!! No need to explain, the facts are just that. This experience has assured me that I will never dine at another Cheesecake Factory again."
Dahabina O.,"Washington, DC",0,10,,5.0,1/5/2016,The service is great! I've come here many times for lunch and dinner and the servers are friendly taking our orders quickly and the wait for the food is not long at all.
Alessandro P.,"Potomac, MD",65,53,8,4.0,1/18/2016,"It's a good place. I like the bar, little dark and intimate, The service it's what you expect for cheesecake  factory. Not outstanding but not bad. I loved the wings,  i Will come back in i'm around but i still prefer other place for get some american food"
Greg T.,"Washington, DC",21,8,,2.0,7/3/2014,"Sitting at our table for 15 mins before a server came over to take our order. She did acknowledge us and day she would be right with us, twice. Table was cleared from before, but not wiped down. Still waiting for someone as I logged in and wrote this to wipe out down.  Significantly different from CCF experiences in the past. So buyer beware."
Jim R.,"Virginia Beach, VA",62,41,1,2.0,5/24/2014,"I have been to several different Cheesecake Factories and this one was subpar to all of the others....First off I watched one of the busboys clean a table and pick up some silverware off the floor under the table and reuse it on the same table.  Second, my wife asked for olive oil and the waitress brought some sort of oil that wasn't even close to being olive oil...maybe it was some type of blend that was suppose to be passed off as olive oil?  Third, we both had a pasta dish and the noodles were horribly over cooked. To top it off, when we ordered our cheesecake, the waitress insisted that she bring it to us in ""to go"" boxes instead of on plates so we could leave quickly....WTF is that?   I blame this on poor management."
Kim V.,"Strongsville, OH",2,3,,5.0,11/15/2015,Meal & service were great!!  Food came out fast and was delicious! I can always count on having a great experience at Cheesecake Factory!
Kim S.,"Salem, MA",1,11,,2.0,6/13/2016,"Food fine. Service terrible. Waited at hostess stand while hostess was chatting at bar.  Another server came by and sat us, apologizing for the lack of awareness. Mind you, not busy at all. The locations I visit back home are always packed. Should have set off alarm bells. Went down hill service wise from there. Won't bore you with details but will not go back."
Melissa B.,"McLean, VA",389,62,77,3.0,3/5/2015,"Cheesecake is a great place to go with a group of people since the menu is so expansive. Unfortunately, the service at this location leaves a lot to be desired. I have been here two times, and both times the service was extremely slow, and the waitresses lacked the customer service skills that someone in their position should have. I eat out a lot, so I consider myself to have a good gauge of what is a reasonable wait time- here it is way too long. I will say the quality of food each time I've eaten here has been good, but because of the service I will not eat at this location again"
Jen F.,"Washington, DC",428,666,129,3.0,6/8/2012,"I am a big fan of the Cheesecake factory, especially when I am hung over and need something extremely heavy to make myself feel even worse about myself/knock me into a food coma.  The location in friendship heights is perfect.  There is rarely a lunch/brunch wait, even on the weekends. I favorite dishes include the bread at the beginning of your meal (I could eat loaves and loaves of the stuff) and the following: Thai Lettuce wraps: Three different sauces: chili, peanut, and something else.  Giant lettuce leaves, grilled chicken with peanuts, noodles, cucumbers, carrots, etc to make perfect lettuce tacos.  I'm a big fan of the grilled chicken slices over the ground up meat you typically see at other restaurants. Avocado egg rolls:  YUM.  I love avocado especially when its wrapped in a deep fried shell.  The dipping sauce gives it a pretty interesting flare. Chinese Chicken Salad: DELICIOUS.  Beware, it may be a salad, but its like 2984309235 calories. So those are my three recommendations.  OH, and the 30th anniversary cheesecake.  It is cheesecake and chocolate cake in one, the best of both worlds!"
Sarah S.,"Silver Spring, MD",11,11,,2.0,2/16/2015,I had the worst experience here on my birthday. The food and service was terrible. Our waiter never came to our table to see if we needed anything. The food was cold and took forever to come out. Our waiter forgot half of our drink orders. The one in white flint closed down so I dragged my friends to the friendship heights location and it was god awful. I do not recommend this place to anyone. Just horrible.
Josh O.,"Bethesda, MD",6,4,,1.0,5/13/2015,Horrible service.  Food came out not as ordered.  Needed to ask multiple times to refill drinks. Server seemed checkout out. Bill total was wrong. No efforts by management to fix the problems. Please avoid this location at all cost.
Mrs. H.,"Washington, DC",4,29,9,2.0,7/31/2014,"I like the Cheesecake Factory, but the service I received @ this location was not so good. The hostess buzzed us and said our table was ready, only to take us outside to a DIRTY TABLE and tell's us to wait for a bus boy. Eating outside was nice but I felt as if the waiters were forgetting we were there. Other than these issues food was good as always."
Michel C.,"Seminole, FL",27,13,867,5.0,4/18/2014,"Always awesome, never disappointing. Excellent food and service, and of course, the cheese cake desserts are out of this world!"
