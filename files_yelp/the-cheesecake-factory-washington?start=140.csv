Chuck G.,"Ridgeland, MS",0,2,,1.0,3/8/2016,"I'm a big Cheesecake Factory fan and this is the worse one I've been to.  Poor, slow service. My fries were worse than a McDonalds and seemed like they had a tan from the heat lamp.  If you go to this one, don't judge all their restaurants by your experience at this one.  Very sad."
Kim L.,"Bowie, MD",18,12,1,1.0,8/17/2015,Terrible service. I believe his name was Bryce. Waited 20 mins before we were acknowledged. Never came to check on us. We asked for options on the menu and he stood there like a statue and never offered recommendations. Staff needs better training in customer service. Won't come back based on our waiter.
Vee G.,"Washington, DC",0,58,1,2.0,8/14/2014,"It's a chain restaurant w/fatty food and huge portions.  For many, that is an automatic 5 stars.  I went to this place a lot during law school.  This is a good place to eat your feelings.  The service is usually good. I am only giving it 2 stars because once I ordered a meal to go w/a slice of cheesecake, forgot the cheesecake there, called them to have them remove the charge from my card, they said they would. Unsurprisingly, they never did.  That is just a lack of followthrough."
Sumit S.,"Edison, NJ",3,10,,1.0,4/23/2016,This is my 4th time at this place and the service gets worse everything.We walked in at 11:30 PM and besides place being we were made to wait 30 minutes for the cheesecake orders(that is readily available for pickup from bakery).i may not come again...
Robin G.,"Bethesda, MD",88,434,218,5.0,1/21/2015,I always enjoy my food at the Cheesecake factory. My regular dish is an egg dish with tortillas. It's very good. I am giving this 4 stars but I should really give it 3 because this day at this location my food was not hot and the service was mediocre.
Hu K.,"Zürich, Switzerland",338,1251,2819,4.0,5/3/2010,"In addition to great HH menu, now $5 ($4.95) small bites on the menu (all day).  After getting my favorite HH item, CF corn tamale, I got flatbread (sausage and ricotta) and corn fritters. Both were very good. Corn fritter is like hush puppy. Fluffy texture and sweet flavor from corn. This goes well with white wine or beer. Since I had small bites:), I didn't feel too guilty about getting the famous redvelvet cheesecake. This is one of the best thing you can have at CF, if you like redvelvet cake or cupcake. It comes with CF's standard portion, so called 'HUGE' and velvety cheesecake (consider as you are having triple creamy frosting) with moist cake-layer.  My monday starts with happy meal from CF and maybe ends happy with same happy meal:)"
Lyn W.,"Bethesda, MD",13,27,,3.0,7/3/2015,Omg I am at the CHEESECAKE factory right???? Anyway it took 20 minutes for premise cheesecake to make it to the table...... Change the name of you can't deliver! The cheesecake was fabulous and the others at the table thought their entrees were worth the wait.
Wanda H.,"Washington, DC",0,4,,2.0,8/22/2014,"What an  disappointment.    Pros  good food Cons   slow service,  server not friendly her tone was dry she never smiled I request that they sing to our group birthday girl that never happen"
AccioSoyMilk ..,"Richland, MS",20,64,,3.0,5/29/2015,"I had a job interview in the area and decided to visit. I've only been to the Cheesecake Factory once in my life, and as this one (which was not the same I one I had visited previously) close to the Metro (right across the street), I zeroed in on this place to eat. The restaurant seems a little small and cramped when you enter, but then again I didn't go upstairs, so maybe it was spacious. The hostess offered to seat me in a small seat that is right in view of anyone who walks in. At first I was going to be like, ""Fine,"" but I saw that they had more (better!) seating inside.  I was actually right next to the kitchen entrance, but I was okay with that because that meant there was no one to the right of me and it meant my food would come out all that much faster. :P My server was fantastic. I'm not 100% of her name, but she was super friendly, always with a smile while not being uber creepy that some servers are. If she was having a bad day or just wanted the Friday to end, I definitely couldn't tell. I could also see she provided the same service and courtesy to my neighboring diners, including noting any special requests if made. After perusing the menu for a few minutes, I was brought water and I made my order. I got a chicken almond salad sandwich and a green salad and a green iced tea. I was hungrrrrryyyyy. But the iced tea came out in good time and the main course was reasonable by most standards (maybe not by my tummy, but whatever). I'm actually confused. I got a bowl of soup even though I thought that was an entirely separate item. It was tasty, a cheese and vegetable chicken soup. The salad had too much dressing (should have requested it on the side) so that the leaves on the bottom were soggy. It was good, but it was too much. The sandwich itself was a little disappointing: it was like they had cut out the middle of bread and called it a serving. I swear the pieces were perhaps the width of two of my fingers, and I have small hands! It tasted good, but it was kind of a pathetic serving. But for the most part everything tasted good. I ate, but as I said, stuff like the salad had too much dressing. I finished and spent a few minutes reading when my server came back to take away my plate. I requested their Godiva brownie sundae, no whipped cream. She repeated my order and said it's coming right up. I did enjoy the brownie sundae, but it was a little too much. Too much brownie that was very rich, and not enough ice cream to balance out. I made it about 2/3 of the way through but couldn't finish. It'd be a great dessert to share, but I wasn't expecting the brownie to be so rich. Ugh, I could feel my clothes expanding from the fat, right then and there. :) As I ate, I got my check. It was expensive. Everything was about $25, not including tip. I'm still not sure what happened with my salad/sandwich thing and wonder if there was a miscommunication somewhere. But it was nice to visit. I probably wouldn't come here on my own again for awhile since it's just a little too much, but it was fun to see what this location was like and the service was really good (except for the seating in the beginning, perhaps)."
Shakeem B.,"Washington, DC",62,139,73,2.0,11/3/2013,"Went here for our cousin's 10th anniversary and were assigned, Rod/Rob or whatever. Obviously being a waiter is a part of his work release program. His customer service and people skills are WAYYYY off! Seemed like we were irritating him just by our presence. I love the Cheesecake Factory. The food is always great, but this was by far the worst customer service experience ever!!! Don't become a waiter if you don't know how to treat the PAYING customer.  SN- no offense to those really on work release. I applaud your efforts to re-enter society and the workforce."
Sean C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,14,2,4.0,12/7/2014,Love the double decker location. I worked at the original Cheesecake Factory in Marina Del Ray California back in the early 90's and I have witnessed the expansion of the brand worldwide since that time. The Cheesecake Factory is consistently the best restaurant in the business. I can be assured the consistency of their food at any of their worldwide locations each and every visit. The only reason I don't give this location a 5 star rating is because I thought the underground parking was validated. When I had it stamped at the restaurant I still had to pay $3.50 when I exited.
Yilun K.,"San Francisco, CA",173,29,1,1.0,5/15/2013,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to and I love Cheesecake Factory! I would give it a zero stars if I could. It took us over an hour to get our meals after ordering eventhough it's late on a Tuesday night, the waitress never brought the bread. I ordered a chicken bellagio which is usually my favorite at Cheesecake Factory. However the chicken was soggy instead of crispy, too salty to eat and the noodles terrible. My boyfriend ordered a jambalaya shrimp with rice. The rice was clumpy and terrible, worse than from my $5 rice cooker.  The bathroom is the grossest thing I have ever seen with no toilet paper and dirty napkins all over the floor.  Don't come here it will ruin Cheesecake Factory for you!"
Tara L.,"Washington, DC",3327,828,2200,3.0,3/10/2011,"Who knew this place was a nuthouse during the day?! And by nuthouse I don't mean crazy busy. I mean, there are a bunch of crazy people eating by themselves at the bar. Luckily, if you focus on the TV overhead, continuously play with your cell phone and only make eye contact with the bartender, you should do just fine.  I ordered the small, arugula salad with golden raisins, almonds and fresh chunks of parmesan cheese drizzled with lemon and olive oil. It was delicious and I plan on recreating it at home. I also ordered a side of sliders which were tasty and filling, but definitely nothing out of the norm. As I was filling up I looked around and noticed just about everyone had ordered a slice of cheesecake to round out their meal. As I ate, all I could think of was ""Damn, does everyone need to get cheesecake when they come here?"" I had absolutely no plans, thoughts or desires to have any. At all. That is until the bartender told me they had a brand new type of cheesecake that consisted of some of my favorite things: red velvet cake layered between cheesecake and topped with white chocolate icing and shaved, solid white chocolate.  The slice was massive and I vowed only to have a few bites and take the rest home. It was smooth, creamy and the red velvet tasted like it was from scratch, but again it didn't rock my world. It was just some good, ol' cheesecake. Although Cheesecake can never lead you fully astray, it probably won't wow you either. If you're dining with someone who is a picky and safe eater though, they are bound to find something that works."
Vincent V.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",0,13,8,1.0,10/18/2014,They give out tables based on a racial preference. Left that place feeling disgusted after 1.5h of waiting for the table.
Juliana C.,"Brookline, MA",438,370,228,2.0,5/7/2009,"More like the the Fatty Factory. A while back there was a Talk thread requesting suggestions for boring restaurants; the kind of place you could bring your unadventurous parents or out of towners who want to feel at home. My friends, TCF is just that kind of place. The War & Peace-size menu (matched by the gargantuan food portions and the sheer size of the main dining room) is chock full of run-of-the-mill, ho hum American dishes.  My coworkers and I go to TCF when our boss is out of town and we can get away with slightly longer lunches. There's never been a wait around 12:30, and service has always been attentive. The lunch size portions are NO DIFFERENT than the dinner ones, so you can knock off $3 from their inflated prices right there. The savings will make dessert more like $4. The ""small plates"" could feed a small country. If you absolutely must come here for whatever reason, go for the white chocolate blueberry swirl cheesecake, automatically box half of what you order for your next meal, and you'll be golden. Word to the wise: You can get cheaper coffee at a freaking Starbucks."
Nick Z.,"Clearwater, FL",54,92,15,4.0,9/9/2013,"Cheesecake is always very consistent. We ate at this DC location for dinner. We wanted to watch football, so we ate at the bar. I know this is not an ideal choice to watch a football game, but the TV was an old somewhat blurry flat screen. The should get a nice HD feed.  The bartender did a good job and I always appreciate the size and options you can get at CF. They even have a Gluten Free Menu."
Boris S.,"Silver Spring, MD",376,323,770,5.0,3/20/2012,"hey sexy Mac & Cheese Burger (6/5 NOMs).  You heard it right, its burger with Mac & Cheese topping!!! It's a total foodie overload, but so worth it! You don't often find a such an unusual burger. As soon as I saw it on the menu I could hear it call me out ""eat me boris"""
Mare P.,"Carlstadt, NJ",44,181,102,3.0,1/7/2014,Had dinner here last night.  My first time at a CF.  There were pluses and minuses.  I was disappointed with my pot stickers because the sauce was off.  It tasted was sharp and not blended.  I like TGIF's better because of the taste and value.  I waited a while for my meal.  It was just warm so it probably had been sitting. The flavor was okay but I would have enjoyed it more if it was hotter.  I didn't want to send it back because I had to wait to be seated and I was getting tired. Took dessert to go & loved that.   The staff was nice but dropped the ball about delivering the entree.  There were a number of interesting items on their big menu so I will be back to see if this was just an off night.
Unique T.,"Washington, DC",13,1,,1.0,11/10/2015,"(Bare with me. I know this is long)I went to this restaurant about 6 months ago. All I ordered was the Greek salad with no olives and some cheesecake. My waiter was very disrespectful. I've received olives in the salad and she was rushing me and my friend to leave. Our waiter was talking to another waiter about I how she can't wait for us to leave because she's ready to go. I was distraught. I've never been treated like this here before. She received no tip. I didn't tell a manager because that's her job and I don't know what's going on in her life. So I let it go. My boyfriend and I came again this past Saturday because I thought it would be better than last time and the service was great! She was wonderful :)  Everything came on time. Also she was so cheerful. But sadly,we got the calamari and now we have food poisoning. If it's not one thing it's another. This is seriously unacceptable. I'M NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN!!!"
Sheena K.,"Silver Spring, MD",76,41,74,4.0,3/11/2013,"I worked my first server job at this location between 2008-2009 before I moved away for College. As a job the place was pretty cool I would make between $100-150 after their CRAZY ASS TIP OUT SYSTEM (Bartender+Buser+Food runner). I have been back several times since, so that should tell you The food is great. I tried almost everything on the 200+ menu in my year of working there. Some of my favs. were Avocado Egg rolls and Firecracker rolls, Miso Salmon, Chinese Chicken Salad, Tempura rolls...basically I can go on and on. The portion sizes are great for the prices and as a Big girl I always pride myself on being able to stretch a plate for two meals. As far as all the complaints of the portions being too large alot of time there is a lunch and dinner size and also let's remember YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT IT ALL. Portion what you will eat first then TO-GO the rest. simple as that. Last but not least, my favorite Cheesecake hands down was...(drumroll)...and still is....Fresh Banana Cream.  After writing this review I wanna re-apply so I can get that 30% discount again. :- )"
