Libby F.,"Silver Spring, MD",1107,1433,1069,4.0,10/12/2010,"Happy hour!  $5 for Long Island ice teas that will make you drunk text your ex - yes!  $5 for my favorite avocado eggrolls - yes! Don't write this place off because it's a chain.  The appetizers are really good.  The bar area is a great place to relax after work.  Our bartender, Phil was very friendly and attentive.  You couldn't ask for better service! It's a drag though that the restaurant only gives you discounted parking validation.  Clyde's down the street will give you at least two free hours.  Any way, I'll be back.  No texting while drinking though..."
Stanley G.,"Rockville, MD",0,2,,1.0,10/15/2014,"Horrible experience !!. The food was taken away before we had a chance to finish it  ( by overzealous busboy) which prompted a confrontation between them and the waiter. A cup with ranch dressing flew over the waiter's section on my wife's hair. The manager was not apologetic , and basically  ""oh well... sh@t happens."" and all that for $70 dinner ? They won't be getting my business again."
KIM P.,"Washington, DC",5,39,,1.0,10/6/2012,"The one start is for our waiter and his POOR service.  I figured I could spare one star for the fact that he did bring our food out.  The food however is always on point when I come here and the stars in no way reflects this.  I thought that part of being a waiter/waitress is having personality and spunk!  I did not receive this at all from my waiter last night .  I'm sorry but if you don't like your job quit, if your cat died take a day off, if you're just plain ole having a bad day SUCK IT UP!  My friend asked for a refill, when he brought it to the table he didn't stop and ask if there was anything else blah blah blah.  Just dropped it off and sashayed away.  He was very rude and had a DIVA ISH TUDE!! If he is my waiter when I go back I will politely request another."
Denise W.,"Temple Hills, MD",3,11,13,3.0,1/31/2015,"I give this location 2.5 stars. This CCF is just meh. Sometimes you get good service and food, while other times the service and food are lackluster. Go at your own discretion, you may enjoy yourself."
Richard K.,"Gaithersburg, MD",1,21,6,4.0,3/1/2014,Love this place. The staff is friendly. The food is great and prices are reasonable.  I would recommend though that they use more of their space. Its spread out the wrong way.  Also I loved Brian our server.  Cheers.
Jerry X.,"Honolulu, HI",45,88,54,4.0,12/27/2013,"As standard as any other Cheesecake Factory, this time I was astonished with the delicious dumpling (potsticker).  The clam chowder soup, noodle shrimp garlic all are excellent choice to have.  For Asians like me, a portion can feed two persons."
Ryan T.,"Washington, DC",29,80,,4.0,12/26/2012,"This is my go-to place in Friendship Heights.  It is terribly cliche, I know, but I like the food and the dessert.   Highlights: Nachos, Taquitos, Avocado Egg Roll, Bang-Bang Thai Shrimp, Chicken Caesar Salad, Meat Pizza.  Some really great food.  Have a to-go box ready because the portion sizes are ridiculously huge.  Check out the calories that they count on the menu.  You can leave having eaten about 4000 if you aren't careful. As far as cheesecakes go - some are just too decadent and rich.  I have tried about half of them if you can believe it.  My least favorite ever is the much advertised red velvet.  It's just too rich.  One bite and you better have a dentist on call.  The best cheesecakes are: Godiva Chocolate (also rich, but so much better), and the white chocolate raspberry lemon (very light and refreshing).  Kona Coffee takes a close third!   Drinks?  It has a full bar, but if you aren't feeling boozie the lemonades are tasty and endless."
Dee B.,"Washington, DC",102,556,221,1.0,5/26/2014,Considering a roach sauntered across the bar just as I finished eating I don't plan to return to this location.
Electric B.,"Kensington, MD",12,78,111,5.0,1/18/2015,"It was a great Cheesecake Factory that I've been to! The food is good, customer service was excellent, and the location is perfect! I think this is one of the best Cheesecake Factory's that I've been to."
Terry S.,"Springfield, TN",35,22,,2.0,9/1/2014,"The wait was terrible, the food was ok, the price was high. You would think that with the money that this place rakes in they could pay someone to clean the bathrooms. They were disgusting!!! I would rather hold it than go in there!!!"
Jameelah S.,"Manhattan, NY",251,250,1846,4.0,9/16/2013,"Though a busy restaurant the ambiance was calm. Darryl P our waiter was very helpful & expeditious in his service. I just have dessert most times I come to this location but, I know the service will be delightful when I eat a meal."
Mariya R.,"Silver Spring, MD",1,10,1,5.0,8/22/2014,"I love cheesecake factory. I wish I could just own jist one of their restaurants. The food is always delicious. If you go there, expect to spend around 20$+ on your meal. Also, dont order burgers and some food that you can get at mcdonalds, this place is ""fancier"" and it is better to try some of their house meals instead of hamburgers. Anyways, it is an amazing place and servers are really good"
Michael R.,"San Jose, CA",75,32,50,4.0,10/29/2011,"Had dinner here tonight, since the snowy/rainy weather is so bad I didn't want to leave the building where I'm staying (Embassy Suites).  I decided to have three small plates rather than one of their usually huge entrees.  Each was quite good, though I'd say they were not perfect. I've posted photos of each dish. 1) Sweet corn fritters. Six good-sized, succulent fritters containing whole kernals and batter fried perfectly. These are very good, although not as sublime as the crispy nearly-all-kernals variety served at the E&O Trading Company in my home town (San Jose, Calif), which I hold as the standard by which I judge corn fritters. 2) Butter lettuce chicken wraps (Mexican).  Three leaves of lettuce stuffed with shredded slaw-like greens, a small piece of grilled chicken, avocado, onions & salsa. They come in a clever zig-zag rack lined with squares of waxed paper. With the chicken and avocado on top of the shredded slaw, these wraps are tough to hold.  I'd recommend putting the chicken and avocado in first, and top with the slaw. But they were tasty and satisfying. 3) Crab balls.  Six small balls are served on a hot tray. I would have liked to have seen a higher proportion of crab to breading, but these had a good crab aroma and taste. The texture is very soft ... they fall apart if you try to cut them into two bite-sized pieces. Each of these came with a small cup of tasty sauce.  None of them needed it, however ... they were plenty tasty by themselves.  I just dabbed each to the sauce at times.  The crab balls usually fell apart, unfortunately. The wrap's was a thin sweet-spicy sauce ... very nice. All in all, excellent."
Mari G.,"St. Augustine, FL",67,185,45,4.0,1/3/2013,"My first visit to a Cheesecake Factory. I had the wasabi encrusted ahi dish: scrumptious!!! The flavor was right on target. Everybody at my table loved their food (seven of us) and a couple of us are pretty picky. My picky eater child even ate all of her food. We were too full for dessert, but decided to take it home. On my first visit I should get cheesecake, right? lol Nope, I ordered the tiramisu. So decadently delicious. I had tastes of the pumpkin cheesecake, original and red velvet. Very rich and creamy. I liked them, too."
Kara O.,"Washington, DC",0,10,,4.0,2/6/2014,"40 min waiting on Friday night in front of the cheesecake vitrine ,which was compensation for the waiting:) Not a fish lover - decided to go Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna - not very wasabily;),tasty amount of Ahi Tuna,plain rice, but the Julienne vegetables - rocks even in the micro amount. My friend chose Bistro Shrimp Pasta, the battered shrimps was fine,but the spaghetti with the basil-garlic-lemon cream sauce - soo delicious, melted in my mouth very quickly(it wasn't mine - I know) The worst choice of the menu was the Hershey's chocolate Bar - ,I guess I just ""overseat"" in front of the vitrine - it tasted as a cheap fake chocolate imitation, the second choice was very good - fresh and exotic - Mango Key Lime cheesecake. I missed the cocktails - next time I am starting with it after the long wait and before the good meal."
john h.,"Washington, DC",0,7,,1.0,7/20/2014,"Disappointing Upon leaving a restaurant in Bethesda, I complemented its manager on its consistently good food and service. That had been our experience at the Cheesecake Factory in Friendship Heights, but our last time there was disappointing at best. The pasta in a dish that we always order was soggy; the salad was anything but appealing; and the waitress said that she was tired. No wonder that we do not plan to return to that restaurant."
Rockelle M.,"Washington, DC",14,83,26,2.0,6/13/2014,"I gave this place two stars because the food was hot and good. On the other hand, this is my first time visiting ""this""CCF. The bartenders were attentive but had no bar etiquette. We were here for happy hour and the bartender did not ask if we wanted rail drinks or drinks on the HH. Even though we paid $5 all night when we switched our drinks we ended up paying 4x as much for 2 drinks and mind you they were Skye vodka drinks !!!!  Really?? The manager Chad took off one drink as if we frequent places to get free Skye vodka!! Give me a break!!! We loved the CCF in Clarendon but will overlook this place all together. Horrible customer service from the bartender to the manager!! Awful!!! Never again!!!"
Ja'Bette L.,"Germantown, MD",150,109,39,4.0,9/13/2010,"I'm definitely a fan of the Cheesecake Factory.  I've only been to this location and the one in White Flint.  When it comes to food, they do it all, and consistently well.  This location took really good care of us.  The service was fantastic, and I can always find something interesting on the menu to try.   My only complaint... their dining chairs suck.  Perhaps all locations use these chairs.  I guess I've always been lucky by sitting in a booth when I've gone in the past.  Thank goodness the staff was as attentive and helpful as they were.  I'm not usually picky, but there's no way I would've enjoyed my meal in those chairs.  Thank you Cheesecake Factory staff for promptly finding us booth seating."
Mr W.,"Charlotte, NC",23,42,36,5.0,8/7/2013,Doesn't matter what you get it's all good food. Always enough for leftovers unless you're... Well lets just say its worth the trip. Pineapple upside down cheesecake... I would knock over some kids in the middle of the street to get some of this cheesecake. *drool* *stiff arms kids in the FACE!!*
Kris K.,"Jacksonville, NC",11,150,222,5.0,5/26/2011,"Delicious. Huge - almost too huge of a menu. Waitstaff is great & even switched my kid's meal to something else for no charge because he wasn't eating it. We stayed in the area for a week & ate here several meals.  The kids menu is very reasonable - a HUGE pizza for under $6. (The crabcakes are a bit of a ripoff, though.)"
