Anna S.,"Washington, DC",201,267,24,3.0,1/9/2012,"I have a friend who uses ""Cheesecake Factory"" as a put-down for boring suburban people: ""She said her favorite place to shop is Ann Taylor LOFT. Cheesecake Factory."" ""Cheesecake Factory took me to Macaroni Grill for a date and spent the entire time 'talking politics' with nonstop Jon Stewart quotes.""  1. Hilarious. 2. This perfectly encapsulates for me why Cheesecake Factory has almost become cool again in recent years. The original big box restaurant for surburban bores, the seminal font of ginormous portions and impossibly long menus, the promised land for fourth-graders all over the country: It's now almost self-parodying, and therefore it's a lot more fun to visit than any of the competitors it's spawned. My high school friends and I - who visited this location once or twice a month between 2000 and 2003 - recently reunited here for dinner. My eggplant sandwich was the size of my head. Pasta wasn't served on plates so much as wallowed into tureens. Our waiter - who seemed, like every Cheesecake waiter I can remember, to be an aspiring actor - could not take an order or pick up a plate without saying ""TEN-FOUR!"" or ""EIGHTY-SIXED!"" in a voice so full of zazzy enthusiasm that I had no trouble imagining he went home to an apartment full of mutilated hobo corpses. The entrees, while caloric, were tasty. Prices were reasonable, considering that the leftovers were going to feed us for days. Drinks were so generously poured that I was stumbling after two wines.  The real letdown was the cookie dough cheesecake, which came on a crust that tasted like crumbled cardboard and featured far less cookie dough than I remembered. I was sad to see that the peanut butter chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake had disappeared from the menu - that thing took excess to new levels. I miss high school. Cheesecake Factory hasn't changed since high school. Therefore, I like Cheesecake Factory now more than I ever did."
M E.,"Boca Raton, FL",168,1,,5.0,9/21/2015,"My friend and I recently went to this location late Sunday evening and sat at the bar. We were soon greeted by Reece who just gave us an amazing experience overall, not only did she know great food and drink items to recommend she also had an amazing attitude. She treats clients as though they're not just someone she may never see again, she was engaged in conversation with us which really allowed us to have an amazing time. We will definitely be back to see her!"
Monique M.,"Washington, DC",153,71,11,4.0,3/5/2012,"I'm no foodie, but I know good food!  It took me the longest to even step into a Cheesecake Factory, simply becasue I always thought they were too expensive.  Again, I'm no food critiq, but I DO know a good happy hour when I see one.  M-F from 4p-6p you can get select pasta dishes as a lunch sizeed portion.  With this, they also have an abundance of selections for appetizers under $10, along with lunch entrees under $15.  Last but certainly not least, they have select Signature Drinks(only 4), wine(red or white), and beer(select drafts) for $5, or less.  Hay now!  That's enough for me to walk through the door. As always, my service is attentive and very polite.  I occassionally have to stop the server to ask for a refill, but I also drink faster than the normal female, and it tends to be a bit crowded during happy hour.   About the food.  I will admit that I've fallen in love w/the Spicy Chipotle Chix Pasta(minus the chix, extra spicy), and refuse to get anything else.  Even when I tell myself to try something else, I just can't pull away.  Please look into it the next time you go.  Also, the J.W.'s Pink Lemonade IS the business!  I drink that shit like it's juice, and that's why the servers can't keep up...not their fault. So why only 4-stars if this place is so spectacular?  Who only has a happy hour for two damn hours?  *Come On*  By the time you get there, and grab a seat ONLY at the bar, happy hour is over!"
Toya D.,"Washington, DC",119,419,153,3.0,2/29/2012,"Never saw what the big deal was about this place and I really only go when it's someone else's idea. I've gone to several locations (for birthday dinners), tried several dishes (pizza, fettuccini alfredo, barbeque ranch chicken salad) and they're all just OK to me. The food wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good enough for me to wait 45 minutes. I play it safe and stick with the buffalo blasts (fried egg rolls stuffed with lotsa shredded chicken tossed in buffalo sauce). They're hot, crisp and always good. I will say this...this location has a GREAT Happy Hour! The food and drink specials rock, so that's enough to make me forget about how mediocre the rest of the menu is. Dessert-wise, I've never been a huge fan of baked cheesecake. It's way too rich for my taste. After 2-3 bites, I'm ready to tap out. I'd honestly rather have Sara Lee (yes, frozen)."
Semra E.,"Washington, DC",675,544,146,4.0,11/6/2009,"Ever walk into a glass door before?.........I did, and it happened here during a very busy dinnertime, luckily I was only 14 yrs old at the time, so I lived through it. Glass or no glass, this place still has great food and you always get what you paid for, which is why us Americans are fat. One plate of anything feeds 4 humans.....don't try to finish it all fatty.  I'm just sayin'"
Eileen G.,"Marietta, GA",6,21,2,1.0,7/26/2015,"Do we need to see another example of Poor Customer Service by a servers poor communication skills and hapless managers? Ok, yes the food has good. Loved my salad. As for Customer  Service??? It sucks. In town on business so went yesterday with my DC and Atlanta BFFs.  We go to pay and calculate an amount that includes a nice tip.  We pay by gift card + cash + credit cards. We are then confused because the receipt says $9.00 amount due. In all of the confused explanation from the server Jeremy, we leave without putting our cc back in our wallet. We call back hour later. MANAGER tells us found cards, just ask for on duty manager to pick up. So back next morning to learn the day manager cant find where cards were left. 4 hours later they call, cards found. We  again are inconvenienced  to go back. We again ask for the PM manager and expect to hear some apology and offer to comp us something. We get nothing until I ask.  She simply hands me back my cc with no apology. None of the 4 managers offered us anything for the hours of inconvenience. Oh well, other restaurants all up and down Wisconsin Ave."
Amazing S.,"College Park, MD",0,29,,1.0,8/16/2015,"Been here twice, every time the food is horrible. Better option is to go to the one in Montgomery Mall which is about 15 minutes away. Way better service and Food."
Lissa B.,"Washington, DC",24,473,2884,5.0,6/8/2010,"I have been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years.  I love the huge portions (which have actually decreased in size--not a bad thing since the portions used to be ridiculous!) and an appetizer is enough to fill me up!  I have tried many, many items on their menu and I believe fully that the best thing on the menu is the ""Avocado Eggrolls.""  Seriously, if you haven't tried them, order them next time you go!  It sounds bizarre, but they are amazing.  The sauce that comes with them is incredible and if I am with a group of friends, we order one sauce for each of us or we fight!  It also comes with these fried white rice noodle things which also taste good dipped in the sauce and are fun to munch on.  :)"
Rick B.,"Orland Park, IL",44,691,383,3.0,8/11/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory in Friendship Heights area of Washington DC - 3 stars: nice little restaurant with a huge 20-or-so page menu. Something for everyone. Nice selections, and attentive staff. Is within walking distance of Embassy Suites hotel."
Alexis W.,"Chevy Chase, MD",0,8,6,3.0,8/2/2015,"Never disappointed with this place. This is my go-to for holidays, birthdays, etc. However I tried their orange chicken for the first time and I was utterly disappointed. The rest of the food was good and up to par but whatever you do, do not order the orange chicken. It is way to dry, lacks flavor and all around a disappointment. I do recommend the Chris' outrageous cheesecake though!"
Tori F.,"Washington, DC",2,16,18,2.0,3/1/2014,"I ordered pick up from Cheesecake Factory tonight and was given the wrong food. When I went back to exchange the food, the waitress was annoyed that I asked politely for the right food. Not once did she apologize. It definitely left a bad taste. The food is okay, but nothing to rave about."
Joey D.,"Bristow, VA",13,187,,3.0,10/1/2012,"We came here for dessert. TONS of different cheesecakes. Beware they are large portions and SO rich. I felt awful after wards :) Service was slow and not the friendly-est.  I would like to come back sometime for a meal, but this trip did not wow me."
Safiya W.,"Washington, DC",115,3,,1.0,7/20/2015,"I would NOT recommend this location for any reason. My sister and I came here on a Saturday evening while waiting for my child at a nearby party. We had about 2 hrs to kill so we decided to have dinner. After 1.5 hrs, we had a drink, bread and appetizer but after more than an hour our entrees were not ready. Being the first people seated in this section of course you would think we would have received our food first but nope. All the other tables received and ate their entrees or were eating them but we had not received ours. I asked to speak with the manager and his response was ""There is a large party upstairs and food comes out of different parts of the kitchen at different times."" Basically he said, yes I'm the manager but I do not know what is going on, I have no answers and I'm not willing to find out what's going on either. No sense of customer service, respect and clearly lacking the skills to properly train staff on following up with customers when issues arise. I work and shop in Friendship Heights but I will no longer spend my money in this establishment that does not value me as a paying and loyal customer of 20+ years."
Kelsey H.,"San Francisco, CA",90,168,3,4.0,8/17/2012,"Although the Cheesecake Factory is a chain, no matter where i go they never fail to amaze me with their FLAVORFUL food! I had the stuffed chicken tortillas (special item) and they were so delicious.  I picked them because they had the CORN CAKES, and the corn cakes were crispy, sweet, and absolutely delectable.  Note: they're the same ones in that tamale appetizer things (I think) or extremely similar, so if you don't want to spend on an appetizer or you don't have TOO much of an appetite, get these tortillas! The restaurant wasn't busy at all (we went on a Wednesday night) and the waiter was helpful and charming, and even graciously took 2 pictures of my group. A big plus about this place too was that they had a skinny menu with food, AND skinny drinks they can prepare that are ALL UNDER 150 CALORIES!  It included their cosmo, mojito, margarita, long island ice tea... and maybe a few others. Oh yeah and the cheesecake.  I can NEVER eat a whole piece because it's so rich but I would if I could and I wouldn't get a stomach ache!  (and if I wasn't partially lactose intolerant...)  Most importantly, I love how there's always a HUGE mound of whipped cream on the side."
Keyanna B.,"Washington, DC",37,42,5,4.0,5/18/2014,Wonderful as usual. My only complaint would be that our table was sticky. It was a SLOW night so not having clean tables is unacceptable. We were seated immediately but then there was confusion about who would serve us. Yes it's a chain but the food is great and I love the skinnylicious menu!
Adam B.,"Rockville, MD",0,14,,3.0,8/13/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is a solid place to go that's not too expensive and has a ton of food. However, it has a very particular feel, and if you're not into that then you're SOL. Pros: - Large menu selection, lots of different types of food - I mostly stick to their burgers, which are very tasty (but see the Cons down below) - The servers are polite and I've never had a bad customer service-type experience with them - CHEESECAKE!! This is probably why you're here. It's delicious. Cons: - The environment. It doesn't have any sound-dampening features, so you can hear the conversations going on right next to you and the whole place is very loud. Not ideal for a date. Also, the tables are a little too close together for my taste. - Food portions are entirely too large. Pastas could feed an entire household per order, and the burgers are borderline inedible they're so big. Even their Skinnylicious menu portions are huge! I'd rather they slightly reduce their portion sizes and also reduce their prices accordingly - Servers, while very nice, aren't the most attentive. I always have to ask to get my water refilled, and it's taken 20+ minutes to get bread and butter to the table. Overall, it's solid but definitely has some downsides."
Darlene S.,"Washington, DC",0,4,,4.0,9/5/2014,"Always been a fan, but a little less since I'm 100% Vegan.  But anyway I went there with a neighbor (who's moving to Atlanta soon) suggesting.  It was during happy hour, so the menu was easy for me.  The happy hour prices are what I remembered from a few years ago when I was last there.  Any how, I ordered a glass of the red wine special & a veggie burger.  There's nothing special on the bread, but the veggie burger was delicious.  The ingredients, texture & consistency of the veggie burger was  good.  I probably should have stayed with the side salad but substituted French fries instead. Not  greasy or much guilt.  Overall a nice early dinner or snack,  great wine and peaceful atmosphere."
Rumit P.,"Silver Spring, MD",391,441,1293,3.0,3/23/2014,"The bar area is awkwardly narrow and has limited seating. The happy hour mojitos are overly sugary limeades and should be avoided. At $5 for syrup with unmuddled mint, you're not getting a deal here! The service is standard, nothing to tell friends about."
Carl N.,"Tizimín, Mexico",8,300,,2.0,5/9/2014,"I only come here for work events or b-day bashes, never on my own, as others have mentioned. Huge place, huge novel like menu, huge portions.  Order yourself a beer and take a gander at the menu.  You might need a second beer before you are done.  It is that big, but that is an understatement.  I always question how a place can be good with so many options.  A jack of all Trades is never appealing to me as they can do everything decent but nothing amazing.  Cut 75% and focus on doing a few dishes really well as Chef Ramsey often does on his show.  There are so many different dishes, I can not imagine this food being fresh.  I just imagine a bunch of bins with pre cooked food and sauces in the back.  No way this is made to order and does not have the taste either. I usually like to leave general reviews without getting into the specifics of the dish I had as everyone is different and I feel it is pointless to describe exact things I had.  But wow, the fire roasted artichokes were NASTY.  Negative stars.  Everyone at the table were like ""eww, good luck with that..""  I took a bite and chewed...and chewed...and chewed...and chewed...looked for a napkin (nah better not in front of my co workers)..and chewed..and could not swallow and eventually it felt like I had a huge wad of paper in my mouth, you know, like those spitballs you used to shoot (or be hit with) in grade school.  My teeth could not break the artichokes apart so it could travel on down the throat.  In other words, it tasted horrible and was impossible to eat.  Luckily, the waiter, who was kind and patient (one good thing here) switched it out for a spinach dip after I complained.  Moroccan chicken - look, been there, there was nothing Moroccan about it.  It was good, but not like anything I had there.  I think this place needs to scale back big time and have more of a focus as far as entrees and appetizers are concerned.  I think this is a very standard American eating experience with some attempts to go ethnic.  Stick to some kind of theme though is my advice and shorten the menu.  Too many items make it impossible to do any one dish really well and increase wait time."
