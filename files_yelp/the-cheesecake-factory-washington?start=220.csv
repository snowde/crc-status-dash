Kiki R.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,203,9,4.0,7/4/2010,"Cheesecake Factory = enjoyable experience.   I ate here on a Wednesday evening and it was still packed.  It's Wednesday for goodness sake!!  But now you know how much people enjoy eating at the Cheesecake Factory.  I had to wait 30 minutes for table and i was starving.   My boy and I had a lovely little waitress named Rachel.  I swear, she must have came by our table 4x to check if we needed anything.  The service was excellent bc she did such a fantastic job.  I had a nice window seat overlooking the entrance of the Washington Sports Club, which is ironic when I am stuffing my face with fried mac and cheese balls.  The WSC is there to remind you to hit the gym right after you gain the 10 lbs.   Lastly, the food was pretty good.  My boyfriend and I just ordered dishes of small bites and apps.  The fried mac and cheese balls were good, but a bit salty.  The stuff mushrooms were a bit small.  The crab and artichoke dip with bread was delicious.  The chicken samosa was very fulilling dish for a great price.  It had a very fresh dipping sauce to it.  Finally, the chicken sliders were nice and crispy.  And I had room for dessert.  You don't go to the Cheesecake Factory and not order a slice of cheesecake.  I got a slice of Raspberry Lemon cheesecake and it was DIVINE.  it was like a little slice of heaven in my mouth. I wholeheartedly recommnend this place for the good food and heavenly cheesecake.  Now I have to make a stop at the  Washington Sports Club......"
Richard W.,"Bethesda, MD",3,9,9,1.0,11/7/2012,"Went there for lunch on the weekend.First time there.I am a vegetarian so I thought I would try the one thing on the menu that was vegetarian.i was very disappointed.The burger was huge,but patty was mushy,tasteless and fell to pieces.The accompanying salad was saturated in a balsamic dressing and was limp and not fresh at all.My first and last time dining there.Just awful!"
Andrew K.,"Washington, DC",119,69,14,3.0,4/7/2011,"Sure, it's a chain restaurant, but given that I was planning a night out with a large group of friends, where else provides so much variety of food? Both times I've went was during dinner and it was needless to say, PACKED. very loud, dozens of waiters and waitresses gliding past packed tables and standing customers.  And both times I've had to wait 45 minutes, despite it being 9PM. The service is solid, nothing too special nor nothing too lacking about it.  Drinks were refilled upon request, orders brought in a timely manner, but the checks took a while to process.  Other than that, I was satisfied. Food itself...well what can I say? I love this chain restaurant, and the food was great; I love the large portions, so its sure to fill up anyone.  The dessert was also great, particularly the red velvet cheesecake. 3 stars. Solid service, good food, but a bit crowded.  Nothing special about this one that separates it from other cheesecake restaurant establishments."
Dorri T.,"Verona, NJ",0,1,,2.0,11/2/2013,"Gluten free diners beware! I ordered a gluten free hamburger off the gluten free menu. When it arrived the bun looked too good, gluten free people you know what I mean! They ran out of gluten free buns and gave us a regular bun instead. Thank God we didn't eat it! Shame on you Cheesecake Factory!!"
Miya N.,"Ponchatoula, LA",0,8,,5.0,10/24/2014,Service here was great! Had a smokehouse BBQ burger and stuffed mushrooms - delicious! Key lime cheesecake topped it off. Great ambiance and waiter.
Chris C.,"Petworth, Washington, DC",11,93,6,4.0,3/17/2013,You can't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. They have so many options it's almost overwhelming. It can get crowed which means a long wait. That's not a problem because you can order to go if you don't want to wait for a table.
Jessica B.,"Washington, DC",168,38,2,1.0,1/24/2010,"I am writing this review from my table at Cheesecake Factory and am OUTRAGED at how my mother was just treated by the manager on duty this evening.  My mom asked for her ahi tuna steak to be returned to the kitchen and cooked a little more. When the steak was returned looking like shoe leather, we asked to speak with our waitress. The manager came over instead and said in a condescending manner that my mother didn't understand the process of cooking this fish. She wouldn't let my mom get in a word edgewise - otherwise, Mom would have been able to explain that she always orders the ahi tuna and has seen it done correctly, that she knows the difference between raw tuna and overcooked. This manager acted like my mother was an idiot and not a valued customer. She was disrespectful and rude.  I am writing a negative review because everyone else at the restaurant has always been wonderfully attentive and concerned about our dining experience - this was so disgustingly outside the norm!  We have been eating here on a weekly basis for the past four years and never, ever have we been treated as badly as she was this evening.  I have staunchly defended this restaurant as a quality dining establishment for a long time.... I really hope no one else has to deal with this inappropriate manager."
Annie T.,"New Orleans, LA",0,2,,2.0,4/15/2010,"My party of 3 decided to eat there around 12:30 on a Saturday afternoon. I was prepared for a wait but when we arrived, the restaurant was not as busy as I would have expected and were seated right away by the host.  Unfortunately, that was the end of our interaction with any of the staff. No one came to serve us drinks or take our orders down. The tables all around us had someone attend to them except for ours (we must have been within the Bermuda Triangle of tables) It took a full 30 MINUTES before we decided to abandon our table and just walk over to the bakery counter for some cheesecakes to go. I've been to several Cheesecake Factories around the country and have always been happy with the service but I was quite disappointed with the service (or rather, LACK of service) with the Friendship Heights location. If this location can't get their act together on a slow lunch period, I hate to think of what they do during busy peak dining hours."
Mark S.,"Washington, DC",0,17,,1.0,10/28/2014,"My first visit to a Cheesecake Factory.  At first blush, the food seemed good... an oversized veggie burger, sweet potato fries, huevos rancheros (eggs at any time of the day, what could be wrong with that?).   And at first bite, the food was tasty.  But by the second and the third, one could feel that the food was ""corporate"" or somehow.... lacked soul.   I'd call it upscale ""airline food"".  Only the (pumpkin) cheesecake stood out and held its ground.  I know... what was I thinking?  I got exactly what I bargained for, right?  Right."
Kristine U.,"Washington, DC",5,29,,3.0,1/23/2011,"Yeah, it's a chain. Yeah, you already kind of know what to order before you get through the door (because you've been here far too many times) -- so I don't really expect any more or less from CF.  This is usually a go-to for the AU crowd for birthdays/weekend kick-offs/girls night out/anniversary dinners and basically for whatever reason you can think of, so I tend to steer away from it just because it's always packed/you can get a lot more from within the city for the same price, if not less. So expect a decent-sized college crowd. However! I've never really had issues with service, so it's all good with me. If you're looking for variety or more of a local place, I'd walk up two blocks to Clyde's or Lia's."
John C.,"Arlington, VA",3,48,,1.0,1/1/2012,I had to stop coming here. Twice my credit card has been compromised. Thanks to the bank for calling me with a fraud alert. Maybe they will be able to hire staff that will not steal credit cards in the future.
Alicia G.,"Washington, DC",350,882,868,3.0,8/9/2007,"The menu here is ridiculously long. I have to give a lot of credit to their staff who have to know each dish inside and out. I work at a restaurant also - and I'd go nuts trying to remember everything in addition to their incredibly long list of cheesecakes and other desserts.  I've been here a bunch of times - always with a big group which is quite a hassle when it comes to paying the bill. I also always end up here when someone's family comes to town - I really feel that we should go somewhere else but someone always wants to go for the cheesecake.  Their portions are huge - especially their salads. I remember a time when a friend got an entree salad and they ate and ate and ate and when they were done....their salad still looked like it had never been touched. Amazing.  Anyway - I usually get an appetizer as my entree because even they are quite filling. And I always end up getting the Thai Lettuce Wraps that come with chicken, noodles, 3 sauces, carrots, cucumber and maybe something else? They're 11 bucks - and they're very filling. But it's the good kind of full - not the - ""oh crap, I shouldn't have eaten that"" food remorse.  The drinks are pretty good - I like the Bikini Martini.  I give three stars because the service is okay - the food is okay - but the wait for a table will just kill you! Service varies - some servers are really nice and friendly while others just look annoyed before they even reach your table (especially if they see you're a group of college kids, which was the situation at the time). Everything is okay - but not great or amazing."
Doug G.,"Washington, DC",6,114,23,3.0,9/11/2013,"Went here two days ago for a quick lunch in the middle of the day. Sat outside with no wait. Server was attentive and quick with the drink refill. Food was ....tasty, but this restaurant has got to be part of the reason why americans are so very overweight. Even the burger I ordered off of their uh is it called skinnylicious? menu was slathered in mayo and the bun tasted of butter. It was yummy like fat is yummy. The arnold palmer I asked for was just gigantic. The cup of he soup de jour was the size of a regular places' bowl. I don't need or want this kind of food very often, so I probably won't be back, but I could see that some would want this kind of thing."
Dee P.,"Washington, DC",8,18,,3.0,3/6/2013,"I am just not a fan of all the food they put on your plate. Michelle Obama needs to do her ""Let's Move It!"" campaign at this place. Geez, the portions are huge!! I tend to get only the appetizers as a meal. And, why are the waiters always cautioning you to, ""be careful, the plate is very hot!"" Are they microwaving the food? Yuck!!"
Evan H.,"New York, NY",282,756,38,4.0,9/8/2009,"I hate chains, they always suck...  Oh, sorry, I didn't see you there.   Screw it.  I love the cheesecake factory, I don't care that it's a chain and I don't care who knows it.   Yesterday I was craving Thai food, yet my gf was craving a salad from TCF, so i relented and remember my love for just about every salad that TCF has to offer.  The TCF is really provides some of the largest portions of any place I have every been. From the HUGE sodas to the ""lunch size"" salad that is big enough for two and the ""small plates"" that are just large appetizers served on a small plate.   If you are trying to diet, this isn't the place for you.  I've eaten three separate meals in Paris that don't equal one dish from this place. All that being said, is this place a mecca for foodies around the world?  God no.  But its sort of a guilty pleasure and has big salads, one of the few places to get a good big salad (cue the Seinfeld reference)."
Sara E.,"Portland, OR",8,48,,3.0,1/16/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory consistently has great food with big portion sizes. I knew that going in. The appetizer salad I had was big enough to have leftovers, and it was extremely delicious. The cheesecake was, of course, heavenly. Their featured chocolate cake peanut butter sort of cheesecake was perfect.  The downside: the service. It was REALLY hard to get our server's attention. Even after coming to our table, she said that she would be right back, so we couldn't order yet. We eventually had to flag down other servers to get things for us. I would say it was an understaffing issue, but the other servers had enough free time to text for awhile. Not sure what the problem was here, it might've just been an off-night. I won't pretend like I'm not going to come back, because c'mon, it's The Cheesecake Factory. I just hope the service issue will be worked out."
Aja A.,"San Francisco, CA",133,131,1,2.0,1/23/2010,"The first time I visited a cheesecake factory, I was in Atlanta.  I was with a big group of people--we went to some crazy Christian gathering for a week down there in like 2001.  I think my mom thought it would straighten me out or something...not so much.  Anyway, I was freaking ravenous, and someone said, we're going to the cheesecake factory, and I was like what the shit?! I'm so hungry I could eat a brick, I don't want to go tour some dumb factory and learn how cheesecakes are made!  Sigh. I'm not kidding, either. I really did think that. I sympathize with Semra E--I get trapped in that goddamn glass turning door every time I go there.  I hate that bastard door!  I try to come in through the mall if I go in at all. This place is overpriced, rushed, crowded, and not my first choice for food ever.  I'm never craving anything except dessert that I think it is worth sitting through the wait to get in here. What's the deal, really? What's so special that I should wait 45 minutes to sit down?  Why does it take 6 years to get served? Oh, probably because Leon Uris wrote the menu, and the cooks have to thumb through a 24 book index just to find the recipe.  The service is highly variable. I've had excellent, attentive waiters, and waiters who made me want to just go into the kitchen and do it myself. Sorry I'm ruining your life asking for water. I know that you're really put upon and all, in your little white uniform. If I am here, I order the thai lettuce wraps.  They're an appetizer, but a meal in themselves.  They are good...just not worth the hoo haa you have to go through to get them.  The roasted artichoke is definitely palatable.  And the cheesecake, of course, is fabulous.  But if I want cheesecake, I go to the bakery and order it.  I don't get a little buzzy thing, drink three over priced martinis, tap my fingers on the bar, tell the lechy old man next to me no twice, and finally get seated just for a piece of effing cake.  Ok so I did that once but I learned my lesson."
Nicole L.,"Washington, DC",1056,1561,92,3.0,5/21/2010,"We were looking for a coffee place but after walking around the area, we realized there wasn't one for another block. So we ended up choosing this cheesecake factory cos it's closer to the meter. It was a bit chilly out and the restaurant was not letting people sit outside even though it was sunny day. We ended up sitting inside - ordered some latte and a chocolate mousse cheesecake. The cheesecake was so heavy we could hardly finish it. The restaurant was crowded for a week day afternoon. Our server was very nice but he was busy with tables we didnt see him much. Overall, I hardly go to cheesecake factories, the coffee was great but cheesecake never taste fresh to me."
Angela C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",47,82,,3.0,5/26/2010,"Came here because we were looking for a place that was casual enough for me to whip out my laptop for a casual meeting.  We dined outside because the weather was nice but the table was wobbly.  We told our server, hoping to get something to stick under the stand but he did nothing. Food was okay..I had the navajo sandwich (chicken breast in pita bread).  The pita bread was really good!  but the sandwich tastes pretty heavy..not really what I was looking for.  It comes with a side of fries but I swapped it for some spinach (to be healthier).  Big mistake - spinach was seriously sauteed in a pound of butter.  For that, I might as well eat fries! Nothing special and wouldn't go out of my way to come back."
Nicole F.,"San Diego, CA",336,851,1978,3.0,11/5/2007,"This is a decent place to go on an off hour.  We went at 3:00pm on a weekday and it was still pretty crowded but no wait.  That said, our waiter was harried and the service was actually slow.  The food choices are varied - salads are huge - and good.  The fish tacos left something to be desired (but we lived in San Diego for 6 years).  The eggplant sandwich was ok, but had too much mozzarella cheese on it.  The macadamia nut cheesecake was really good and I am not usually a fan of cheesecake but my husband said, ""how can you come here and not order it?"" So we split it and even leaving with a doggie bag I did have that  ""what were we thinking"" feeling at the end.  Oh and that was even not having eaten the bread which we told our waiter we would like but never got!    3 stars for menu variety - good salads & cheesecake.... and being open on an off hour."
