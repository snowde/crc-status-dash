Sarah K.,"Decatur, GA",0,35,,2.0,2/12/2012,"It's the Cheesecake Factory: you come for enormous portions of generic food and then lust over the two-page-long list of cheesecakes. I've had plenty of wonderful desserts here but the main courses have all been ""meh""; my favorite is probably the Chicken Di Pana. However, what really gets me about this place is how inattentive the servers are. I've been there three times and never had a good experience. Want your water refilled? Not happening, because nobody's coming around - they're all standing at the counter talking. Want your check? Oh, sure, just wait twenty minutes. My college roommate LOVES the Cheesecake Factory, so we went by again today for what will probably be my third and last visit to this particular locale (always had good experiences at the one in Fair Oaks Mall over the border). We actually stood there for several minutes while the waitresses gossiped amongst themselves. One of them said ""hey, can you get the customers"" and the others just shrugged and ignored her, right in front of us. What the heck? Sorry, for that kind of service you're only getting two stars."
Mikey H.,"Bethesda, MD",0,14,,4.0,12/2/2012,"Excellent service.  All staff we encountered were friendly, courteous and you could see were hard working and on the move. Our waiter did an excellent job and was attentive to our table of four and the tables around us.  Food was served in a reasonable amount of time and was prepared as ordered. I enjoyed the new lighter menu selections. 4 stars for an overall positive experience."
Kristen B.,"Washington, DC",18,28,10,2.0,12/1/2013,"Today I visited the cheesecake factory at Chevy Chase Pavilion and my experience was below satisfactory. I placed my order with a very nice waiter. About twenty minutes later the wrong plate is brought out. The waiter was very apologetic and sent the food back to the kitchen and the manager came out to apologize. About another 20 minutes passes and my meal is once again brought out; however, this time the chicken was undercooked. Again, the waiter apologized and took the plate. The manager came back out and explained to me that the chicken is marinated over night and was cooked at 185 degrees and how it was in fact all the way done. I, however, still have to disagree. Maybe the piece that I tried didn't cook all the way. By this time i had been in the restaurant for over an hour so I just decided to get cheesecake to go. I ordered the white chocolate caramel macadamia cheesecake, paid my bill, and left the restaurant; only to get home and discover that I was given raspberry cheesecake instead. I have visited this location before and it is usually very good and I have actually had some outstanding service and food in the past; but, this time i left utterly disappointed."
Dea A.,"St. Augustine, FL",436,643,600,3.0,4/20/2008,"I have never had an entree from this company that I loved or that I needed or craved. EVER.  On the other hand...  Key Lime cheesecake, now THAT is something I crave. Go to Best Cellars down the block, pick up a bottle of wine, come here, pick up some dessert and walk home happy!"
Rye M.,"Alexandria, VA",0,109,,1.0,5/27/2015,"This may be the worst CF in the dc area. We realized after a few minutes that we came to this location about 2 years ago and recalled the experience being lackluster. Well, the service was so bad this time we didn't bother to eat and just left. Came in around 8 pm on a weekday and surprisingly the place was pretty busy. An available table on the ground level next to the door going outside was given to us but we declined since you are basically rubbing elbows with the customers sitting right next to you. Opted to be seated outside where the table was not cleaned and no silverware present. Our inattentive waiter did not ask us for drinks but just brought out water. Asked politely for silverware, bread, plates, and a lemonade. Nearly 10 minutes later my lemonade finally comes out with the bread and he takes our order which consisted of appetizers and 2 entrees. Another 20 minutes pass and nothing comes out. We asked our inattentive waiter what the issue was and he says I'm not sure. Will check immediately. Huh? Is it not your job to check in a prompt manner whether the food has been placed on the counter to bring to the customers in the first place? Left and told the manager we would pay for the lemonade. She tried to persuade us into staying but we declined and weren't responsible for the 5 sips of the lemonade I had. Will never return. Embarrassing to say the least."
Kim O.,"San Antonio, TX",15,64,1,1.0,8/20/2011,What a disappointment. We went here with our child on the way to visit our Wounded Warrior at National Hospital. Bottom line waiting 45 minutes for lunch food to arrive is way too long for a one year old. The restaurant was not crowded and our server was incompetent at best.  Our kids food was out in 5 minutes and making her wait 40 minutes for what we ordered was ridiculous. How long does it take for food to be cooked? Immediately after getting our food we asked for it to go and my husband bagged it himself.  I was so pissed off at the lack of service that I slung my food in a trashcan on the way out the door. BTW the tuna carpacio looked like friskies cat chow on avocado. $50 seems like a steep price to pay for a cold sandwich and a lot of wasted time.
Shakeyla T.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,3,,1.0,9/3/2012,"The service here is horrible. Our waiter was slow, unprofessional, and impatient. Being short with costumers after they've had to wait a decade for a meal is unacceptable. We should be the irritated ones, not you!"
Allen H.,"Washington, DC",36,29,8,4.0,2/15/2009,"Went here on Valentines day and this place was pretty decent. The only thing I didn't like is when we went in for food you had to go upstairs to check in. The prob with that is because if a table is available downstairs, you came all the way up there and had to go right back down. I heard people complaining about that. Other then that though, This place is great. It is very nice and clean, and the menu, WOW. The menue has a variety of food such as American food, italian, and Asian. They even have a breakfast menu to pick from. This place is magnificent!  We got there at 4:30 and we left about 6:00 with a full stomach. The food was so good I couldn't eat it all!  mmm I am def going again and again anda again. I gotta and wanna try everything. For desert we had Dulce a leche and that was so good, like I was floating in clouds.  I give this place a 4 outta 5."
Bethany H.,"Brandywine, MD",3,20,,3.0,1/7/2009,"Just your slightly better than average cookie cutter restaurant. Tries far too hard to be edgy and classy, when it serves burgers!  For some reason, people do in fact believe it to be mod, which means there is always an interminable line- for slightly better than TGI Fridays food. OK, maybe that's harsh.  Parking for the Friendship Heights branch is insane. Insanely expensive. As is the restaurant, insanely expensive that is, for again, food that's good, but not that good.  I imagine the first Cheesecake Factory was magnificent, but then they went corporate and now we have a high priced fern bar minus the ferns. I give them props for the decor being this side of classy, but wonder just how many people you can stuff in that space."
Kathy M.,"Washington, DC",38,104,,5.0,4/6/2012,"I'm surprised this place doesn't have more reviews... doesn't everyone go here? (SMILE)...   I'm a long-time fan of the C.F.  The menu is about a mile long, so allow yourself some extra time to work your way through it.  Also, everything on the menu is DELICIOUS (which often adds a layer of difficultly in trying to determine what to order).  And, to make matters worse (lol), you'll probably have to take some of it home because they don't skimp on the portion sizes.  The C.F. is the real deal and they deliver a good experience."
Willio J.,"Arlington, VA",23,33,,1.0,10/3/2014,"I have always enjoyed the food at the Cheesecake Factory and I  love this chain, but the Friendship Heights restaurant is pretty bad.  Unfortunately, I live 1 mile away for that location.  My goal today  was to enjoy a nice dinner at my favorite chain restaurant for 18 yrs but the Miso Salmon came out burnt and my desert was frozen.  Steve, the manager on duty tonight, with aspiration of being a General Manager some day came by to apologize but did not do much else to give me a reason to remain a customer.  Steve, its important to handle issues and make sure that your customers are happy if you want to get promoted some day. I am now an unhappy customer as I  wasted ~$59 tonight.  Also, it is disingenuous to tell a customer that a portion of the meal was on Cheesecake Factory, only to have the waiter explain that that the burnt salmon and frozen cheesecake each with one bite out of them were not  charged."
Kim C.,"Columbus, GA",146,524,20,4.0,12/28/2009,"Yes, it's a chain, but I still like it. The Renee's special calls out to me every now and then. As does their salads. I like this location (my friend used to live down the street), and the servers we've had have all been really friendly and prompt. Also, the wait for a table was never more than 5 - 10 minutes for me. Their menu is so big that there's always something for everyone!"

Brandi G.,"Washington, DC",104,71,19,3.0,12/7/2008,"Cheesecake Factory is one of the places I find myself in at the suggestion of someone else.  It's usually one of the last places I want to go to mainly because of the wait.   [Hot Chocolate] The Factory Hot Chocolate is decent, but for a girl who is on the hunt for some good hot chocolate this was just mediocre.   It's served in a large 16 oz. glass with whipped cream, a straw, and a sleeve on the glass.  The chocolate was bitter and the whipped cream tasted watered down.  I had expected it to be made from Godiva, but the waiter said they use a chocolate made by Sysco (I think he said Citavo). For a place that makes whipped cream on the spot for their cheesecakes, I was surprised that this whipped cream on their hot chocolate was not up to par. [The Food] We had the calamari (decent), edamame(good), spicy ahi tempura rolls (really pretty good that I order time and time again), pork chops (rubbery and the potatoes were too salty), and the stuffed chicken tortillas (Ro's favorite).  The service was great and kindly brought out mashed potatoes that were much better than the salty ones we first received. We finished it off with a carrot cake cheesecake.  I'm not a fan of carrot cake so I did not enjoy this cake as much as Ro did. [Ambiance] Located in a place that receives a lot of traffic, it has the potential of being completely busy.  But on a Sunday night like tonight around 5:30 pm there wasn't a long wait after all.  The inside is typical of Cheesecake Factory decor, dimly lit, etc. There are two floors, but I have mostly been seated at the top level.  There isn't anything special about the view from the windows, as the windows face Saks and surrounding shopping departments across the street.  This view is nothing like SF Cheesecake's nicer view at the top of Union Square."
Cadence R.,"Washington, DC",100,222,,3.0,9/26/2008,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory a total of four times in my life in four different cities. Tampa, Salt Lake, Washington DC and kind of one in Austin where I worked for an hour before deciding to quit. The Cheesecake Factory in Friendship Heights is exactly the same as all others. Just kind of there. My food was actually pretty good, but the overall experience was not. Server was friendly, but they packed us in this tiny area. Best way to describe the seating was that it was a circular booth on one side and then the tables came out from there and the other person sat in a chair. Well, my roommate sat on the booth part and no one was around us. By the end of the meal there were people on either side of her and she couldn't even sit back because some woman's purse was on part of her seat.  The other negative was the bathroom. It was pretty gross. The restaurant wasn't that busy, but the bathroom had trash all over it and they were out of toilet paper. This isn't Wendy's... I do expect something a bit nicer if I'm paying more than $10. The food was good and I would agree that it's good for getting a group of people to go. Generally you settle on something like Friday's or Applebee's and CF is definitely a step up from those places..."
Jim T.,"Washington, DC",42,28,1,5.0,5/11/2011,"Oh man this place is a classic!  I have been coming here for 5 years and have been to a bunch of different locations.  I cant post on them all so I will post on this one, the one I am most familiar with.  This is a great place to take your family for any non-holiday event.  Its now well known so a holiday event might make you wait in line.  Although due to their pickiness with location there is always stuff to do nearby while you wait, with the pager they give you.   I wish this place gave reservations but it is worth the ordeal.  I am a personal fan of their baby back ribs and their Caesar salad.  My wife loves their egg plant parm."
Mariah S.,"Washington, DC",69,316,620,4.0,8/12/2009,"Sat at the bar and was promptly greeted by a smiling bartender so that was a good sign.  She said they don't have happy hour drink prices but there was a bar food menu only available during 5-7pm which was fine.  She brought out that menu, plus two others, and my goodness what a range of choices. It seemed most of the items were fried or categorically weight-watchers unfriendly, so I ended up selecting the small order of thai lettuce wraps from the bar food menu, and being that I typically nibble rather than eat and wasn't interested in having a take out.  The presentation of the entree was pleasant, and I was more than happy with the portion size.  It appealed most to me because I saw more ""greens"" than anything else.  The butter lettuce was the perfect wrap for the marinated, grilled chicken strips, julienned carrots, thin noodles, roasted chopped peanuts, served with three different types of sauces to choose from:  peanut satay, sweet chili sauce, and I think the other was a tamarind-cashew.  She also brought me a demi-baguette of whole wheat which was served warm.  Crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  My co-worker ordered the quesadillas, which had a zesty freshly-made red salsa.  Between us, our bill came out to $29 which included the wraps, quesadillas, and four bottled domestic beers."
Austine M.,"Washington, DC",63,14,3,5.0,11/15/2011,"I have never been to a Cheesecake Factory before because of the chain-ness of it all, but i stopped in today for a happy hour/late lunch shopping break.  Their drinks are strong and only $5 for happy hour.  Their salmon was expertly cooked, as we're the veggies.  I will come back!! (and sit at the bar)"
Marian P.,"Washington, DC",7,51,1,2.0,12/22/2012,"Okay, so The Cheesecake Factory used to be one of the best dining experiences you could have.  This chain generally delivered good food with a good value and good service.  Last night, my family (a party of 3) and I visited the location at Friendship Heights.  This visit was characterized by poor service and okay food.  After we were seated, we waited about 15 - 20 minutes for a server to approach our table.  I was about to ask to be seated in another area when our server finally arrived.  His attitude bordered on rude when I asked if there were any specials.  He answered, ""no.""  I would expect, ""I'm sorry, there are no specials this evening.""  We ordered our drinks, my son, Mr. Pibb, my husband, Blue Moon, and tonic with ice for myself.  My son's drink came about 5 minutes after our order and it was put down in front of him with a splat, our drinks came 10 minutes later.  In the meantime, a table was seated to the left of us, the same server brought the table water and bread immediately.  We had to ask for bread for our table after the other table had already received theirs.   The server came back to take our appetizer order.   As we waited for our appetizers to arrive, we gave our entree order, my husband and son both ordered medium well steaks and I order shrimp scampi.  Meanwhile, 2 of our appetizers (my son's and mine)  arrive, they are okay but where is my husband's appetizer? Neither our drinks or our appetizers arrived together, what gives?  The server brings my son a refill of his soda and he sets it down very hard on the table.  My husband's appetizer finally arrives. We are finishing our appetizers, when the server comes back to ""confirm"" our entree order.  He basically takes our order again and informs us that the steaks will take about 25 minutes to cook.  Why was that neccesary to tell us how long it would take to cook our food?  I have never had a server tell me that before.  Our entrees arrive about 30 minutes later.  A table seated about 10 minutes after we arrived have already received their entrees.  Our entress are okay.  Nothing all that special.  This is not characteristic of my experience of The Cheesecake Factory. Specifically, my shrimp scampi was dry, there was very little sauce on the plate and the garlic cloves which are usualy plentiful are few and far between.  As our dinner draws to a close, our server begins to become very gregarious and helpful.  When we ask for boxes, he responds, ""my pleasure.""  He offers to validate my parking ticket and hands it back to me with a ""my pleasure.""  Obviously, this is his push for a great tip.  Our bill is $117.  I leave a $5 tip.  I ask to speak to the manager to explain the low tip.  He listens and apologizes for our experience.  it will be a very long time before I see the inside of this chain restaurant again."
Michael S.,"Silver Spring, MD",19,195,4,4.0,1/21/2009,"What a huge menu! That's all I'm going to say. You can find virtually everything between the covers of this 100-page behemoth (OK, I'm slightly kidding). If you're out around town and you and your pals get hungry and you're totally stumped about what to eat, just slide on in here. Their ""lunch"" portions are INSANE (read: DINNER portions, more like!). If you're here during the daytime, get the lunch specials (unless you're REALLY hungry and/or will share with someone else). This must be why America is such a fat nation...oh well! At least the cheesecake is good!"
