JC M.,"Washington, DC",80,58,,4.0,9/10/2008,"OK, I'm usually not a big fan of chain restaurants, but this place is an exception. The atmosphere is the same from Cheesecake Factory to Cheesecake Factory, the one in Atlanta looks the same as the one in Clarendon looks the same as the one in DC. So nothing too exciting there. As for the food. Huge portions. Way too much for one person, but there is something about their Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms that really does it for me. Personally I rate their Chicken Marsala up there in my top 5 favorites. I sadly even compare other Chicken Marsala's to theirs. The bow tie pasta is covered in Marsala sauce, 4 thin chicken breasts and a load of mushrooms. It's really my favorite dish there. I have had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta, which is also good...but I generally stick the the Marsala. I don't go there often so when I do I stick to what I really like from the place. As for appetizers...you've got to try the Avocado Egg Rolls, they are really the best thing offered on the app menu. A tight second place would be the Vietnamese Spring Rolls and the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  The more I write about this...the more me thinks me needs to go back and eat there again. It's been a good couple years since my last Cheesecake dining experience. Yup, that's it...next paycheck will be a dinner there."
Ken L.,"Mountain View, CA",104,34,3,1.0,8/8/2010,"Pathetic attempt at eggs over easy.   If the cook can't prep such a simple dish, I would like to know how they got a kitchen job in the first place."
Tomas H.,"Bethesda, MD",5,31,18,5.0,2/9/2011,"My Shepherd's Pie was great, nothing to add. Just great. Attentive waiters, nice atmosphere. Really good place."
A.J K.,"Rockville, MD",5,11,,3.0,2/11/2011,"Oh Cheesecake. How I adore you. You're the one place where EVERYONE leaves feeling satisfied. In more ways than one.  I've been frequenting the Cheesecake Factory for as long as I can remember, and its been a staple for our family's birthday parties and other celebrations. The menu is VAST and accommodating, the servers are quirky and energetic (service is awesome- just be sure not to eat too much of the free bread they put out), and the portions are HUGE and reasonably priced. The only regret you'll have after you finish your meal is the fact that you might just have committed calorie seppuku.  As far as specific recommendations for food; Thai lettuce wraps are always a great appetizer, as are the Nachos and Popcorn Shrimp. For main entrees, Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp, and Chicken Fettuccine are long time favorites. They also have great, well cooked pizzas and decent sandwiches. The Frozen Iced Mango and the Pina Coladas are amazing if you're looking for a refreshing drink, and the Red Velvet Cheesecake hits the spot when you're in the mood for dessert. I've been hearing a lot about their Strawberry shortcake, so I'll be sure to try that on my next visit."
Bobbi B.,Washington Metro,5,85,4,1.0,1/6/2008,"I am still grossed out, which is why it's taken me a while to write about this.  I'd been an occasional grudging patron of the Factory ever since my days of group house living in Friendship Heights. I was mainly a fan of their chopped salad and the brunch menu.  Then I had a disturbing experience there last spring.   Their Santa Fe Salad arrived in the usual obscene portion size the restaurant's known for, and tasted pretty much as it had the last time I ate it.  This time, though, I actually got down to the bottom of the bowl because I was sharing it with a friend.   Horrifyingly, under all the lettuce and garnish I found what looked to be the remnants of a pasta dish, specifically, spaghetti.  Mind you, there is no pasta in the Santa Fe Salad.   My conclusion?   Either the kitchen isn't washing the dishes, or the kitchen is scraping the remnants of other patrons' dishes into new orders.   All possibilities are disgusting.   And no, I didn't report it to the server or management.  Scarred for life."
Clarence J.,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",60,1219,82,4.0,6/12/2008,"It's a chain.  And one that covers a massively wide variety of food.  This in general would worry me {why do most of the CF reviews start this way??}, but I went to try the cheesecake long ago and have been going back regularly ever since to try more and more of the food.  I haven't gone wrong yet . . . and have occasionally even finished a whole plate.  (Only when I'm sure I'll still have room for cheesecake, of course.)  I still find the better part of valor is to split the plate in half and plan to take the second half home for leftovers.  (Or I guess you could share with whoever you're eating with and not have any left to enjoy later . . . HA!   Not likely.)  That said, there are plenty of restaurants that do some of the individual menu items/styles better -- but I thoroughly enjoy the CF for a place where I can go for just about anything and get consistent quality and a decent amount of food for what I pay, and where the service has always been good. Now, I will caveat this with a wish that they would stop getting rid of the cheesecakes I like best.  So far the cappucino white chocolate and the white chocolate caramel latte cheesecakes have both gone by the wayside, and it's a complete travesty.  It's too bad they've got another 20 or so types or I'd really be annoyed... Don't go to any CFs for a nice quiet meal unless you can get outside seating or go in the narrow window between lunch and dinner.  Otherwise any one I've been to is a study in controlled chaos, noisewise.  The most romantic meal will leave you hoarse from yelling to each other by the end of the night.  If you know what you're getting into though, it's all part of the enjoyable charm!  (Really!)"
Alexa B.,"Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn, NY",41,82,,2.0,10/5/2006,"See, I believe there is a trick to the Cheesecake Factory.  The menu is so gargantuan it's kind of like a game in which the objective is to find something good.  OK, well at least I do that.  Anyway, I live down the block from the place so it's kind of hard to avoid. From My Experience: Eggplant Sandwich?  Yuck. Appetizer Potstickers?  Eh.  Go and get some real Chinese. Fish & Chips?  Made me sick. Burger?  Well, chains seem to have a way of hitting this one on the head.  But it's fricken huge. Pasta?  Far too decadent and laden with butter, sauce and cheese (like just about everything else here) but people seem to love it. Chicken Salad Sandwich?  OK, but too much goddamn mayo. Fish Tacos? No no no. Just bad. HERB-CRUSTED SALMON SALAD? Fantastic. I'd say you're safe with just about any of the salads, but get the cheese and dressing and all that heavy stuff on the side, because it's the CF way to pile it on.  Overwhelmingly so.  Regardless, my stars are for the page of superior combos they've created for the lover of the dinner salad, even if they need a little tweaking. Just a few final things-- The bread isn't great ( I had to say it- I like bread).  Of course, everything is overpriced.  Go there on a weeknight so you don't have to wait for hours for a table... and then for your food.  DESSERT, I dare say, is literally too good... at least for people like myself with a wicked sweet tooth.   So yeah.  CF in one word?  Dangerous."
Jasti S.,"Bethesda, MD",89,113,5,4.0,3/15/2011,Best mojitos and customer service ever of any CF I've been to!
Gladys M.,"Columbia, SC",0,1,,1.0,11/22/2014,"Seven of my friends were there last week. We wanted to dine at a Cheesecake Factory since we don't have one in Columbia , Sc. I ordered a Sirloin steak, the portion was very small, I keep wondering when they would bring out the rest of my steak.  I had to order a salad in order to even out the meal. Even the salad was small (A form of a Cobb salad) To say the least I left hungry. Then, since we do not have a CCF in SC. I wanted to take some home to share with family.I wanted about 13 slices that's equivalent to a whole Cheesecake. I was told if I bough a whole cake I would be charged 48.95 but If I got the same amount of slices but different kinds I would have to pay 119.00 and some change. I would not be able to digest that kind of cheesecake. It is  not that good that I would pay that much, that fattening and calorie loaded, but not so good I would pay 119.00 for the same cake, just different flavors, all the slices cost the same, weight the same, and same number of slices per box. I will never go to another Cheesecake factory. I'll go home and cook my own for a whole lot less."
Natasha O.,"Portland, OR",59,97,263,3.0,7/10/2008,"As everyone knows, Cheesefactory has great (albeit fattening, roughly a half stick of butter per slice) cheesecake & until about a year or so ago I didn't even know they served food. I've been to this location twice and sadly they were both this week; back to back evenings.  What can I say, their Dulce Duleche Cheesecake is to die for!  The place seems a bit crowded and noisy on both floors.  There also isn't ample space for parties to wait while their table is getting ready & they tend to block the takeout counter.  As such,  I really can only recommend this location as a take-out location. Personally, I don't know why you'd want to take out their entrees which while being ok, there are plenty of other restaurants in the area with better tasting quality (and WAY healthier) for the same price.  I don't the point of giving you a lot of something when less would mean better quality. Cheesecakes here are yummy of course but they don't give you extra whipped cream like I've gotten at other location when I've asked.  The girl just looked at me funny when I asked and said there's whipped cream already on it.  I haven't tried the 7 inch cake that I bought yet as it takes about 2 hours to defrost (which for some reason I hadn't realized was going to come frozen in the first place).  The cake also comes wrapped in plastic which is then placed into the box.  Will update review after I've tried it tonight. ***UPDATED*** The cheese cake is fabulous but the crust sticks to the bottom and the sides of the holder.  Other than that, the slices are smaller than the giant slices you guy but are still yummy."
Enigmajic O.,"Rockville, MD",154,1232,62,4.0,12/11/2007,"Can't go wrong with this place.  If you're looking for a nicer place with large portions of meals to satisfy anyone or everyone, this is the place to go.  You'd have to go off-peak times since the wait can be very long, but you can't go wrong with the food.  Be prepared to bring at least half your food home for your next 1-2 meals.   My husband had the pasta jambalaya which was very tasty with a spicy cajun twist.  My crispy pork tenderloin was very tender and crispy and not dry at all - I could cut it with my fork it's that tender.  My experience at this particular chain was made by the side of mac n' cheese that came with my entree.  It was the best freshly-made mac n' cheese I've had anywhere.  The creamy cheesy ziti pasta goodness is still making my mouth water......"
Roc G.,"Fredericksburg, VA",37,206,189,4.0,7/14/2010,"I think cheesecake factory has mastered consistency. From one restaurant to the next, everything tastes the same and is always delicious. I always want to try something different, but unfortunately I'm in my box and stick to what i like. So with that, the fish tacos were huge. I got em with mahi mahi and they were served up with guac.  Delicious. I dont even eat the rice and black beans that come with it and am stuffed from the three tacos. ~"
Anna C.,"New York, NY",7,54,,3.0,3/12/2009,"My dad always says that any appliance/gadget/restaurant/etc that tries to do everything will not do any of them particularly well.  The CF fits this description pretty well.  The menu is a spiral-bound volume, which gives you an idea of the range of dishes.  However, this was only my second CF visit so I've only begun to scratch the surface.  My advice would be to not try anything crazy and you'll probably be safe.   I was just coming off of 3 days of sugar over-indulgence when some friends invited me out to CF for dinner.  CF is legendary for hubcap-sized platters of food containing many thousands of calories, so I was a bit anxious about finding something on the menu that didn't make me want to rip out my intestines.  I had luck with the herb-crusted salmon salad.  I asked for dressing on the side, and was presented with an enormous bowl of salad greens ringed with some tomato slices, endives, and steamed asparagus.  In the center was a generous, but not grotesque, piece of nicely cooked cold salmon.  Plenty of veggie fiber + a little protein and healthy fats = ahhhh. I didn't think ""digestive happiness"" and ""Cheesecake Factory"" could be in the same sentence, but apparently it's possible.  That being said, it was pretty damn overpriced and not really anything special.  The only reason I liked it so much is that it was exactly what I was craving. And the parking issues? Take the metro.  This restaurant really isn't worth taking the hassle to drive to."
Jalpa P.,"Fairfax Station, VA",338,116,4,4.0,1/11/2013,"This doesn't apply to this specific location...actually I don't even think I've been to this one.  It's just that their drinks are only $5 and huge selection of amazing appetizers are half off.  I think that's a great deal.  Now I know why so many people stop by after work.  You work hard, you want to play hard...while saving money!  Only negative is that the drinks are too sweet...not strong enough at all...I barely taste the alcohol. Also...I do NOT recommend getting the red wines during their happy hour - they taste very cheap.  I'm one of those people who will buy a cheap bottle of wine at the 7-11 and I still thought the red wine during the Cheesecake Factory hh was terrible.  This only applies to what they gave me during hh only...I imagine they have a better selection.  I also have not tried their white during hh so this only applies to the red.  I would give it 3 stars but I must say that the food selection they offer during the hh deal  compensates fairly well for the lack of robustness of their red wines and over sweetened cocktails."
Julie G.,"Washington, DC",0,15,,5.0,8/4/2013,Yummy ... its very close to where I live and they have the best food ever. my favorite is the grilled salmon dish and the crab cake bites.
Kate M.,"Alexandria, VA",430,36,,2.0,6/23/2010,The food was what you would expect but the service was disappointing and they weren't overly busy.  We never got our appetizer or the extra plates we requested.  The dessert took way too long.  The friend I was dining with said she had dined there last week and had the same sad service.  Too bad as usually you can depend on TCF to be pretty good.
Nan G.,"Bowie, MD",13,71,151,4.0,4/3/2008,"While out with my mil today we decided to get some lunch.  She chose the cf and I thought it was a great choice. The menu is huge.  I haven't been in many years so I had forgotten that there were so many choices.  I even had to tell the waiter to come back a few times because I just wasn't ready. Since it was lunchtime we were seated quickly.  Our waiter was very attentive and fast. I ordered a margarita and it hit the spot.  For lunch mil ordered the turkey pastrami reuben and I ordered the Navajo (grilled chicken sandwich with tom, lettuce and avocado served on a thick fried bread).  The sandwiches were huge.  We shared; and I'm so glad we did.  Her reuben was so much better than my navajo.  The navajo was okay but not as good as the reuben.  It was just somewhat bland.  Funny note: she substituted slaw and I substituted broccoli for the fries; they still served the sandwiches with fries and brought out the substituted items separately.   The broccoli side was also huge.  It was cooked perfectly-still a little crunch to it with just a touch of seasoning.  No butter or oil to overload the veggies. Now to dessert:  mil ordered the tiramisu.  She loved it.  It seemed a bit loaded down with whipped cream but looked tasty. I ordered the key lime cheesecake!  5 stars alone for that!  It was so creamy and good with a nice mix of tart and sweet.  It was served with a bit too much whipped cream too.  I think our lunch choice was just fine. Mil gave cf 5 stars- but since I'm yelping they get 4. I'd give my lunch companion 10 stars!!!"
Chequella C.,"Washington, DC",0,2,,1.0,2/18/2012,Main dishes ordered were YUCK! (Chicken marsala & Angus cube steak). I'd advise sticking with only the appetizers. The place had an nice look though. Another example of a place that spends more time making the table look pretty than making good food.
Sarah F.,"Brooklyn, NY",83,522,159,3.0,7/13/2007,"Good place to go if you are super hungry and really can't decide what type of food you want to eat. Their menu is the size of a small novel so there is plenty to choose from and each dish could feed a small village in Africa for a week.  It is not however, a good place to go if you are on a diet, don't want to wait  for 40 minutes with half of Arlington County,  want fast service or a bartender who doesn't seem like he fell out of a bad sitcom."
Mel B.,"Washington, DC",61,283,,5.0,7/9/2007,"I've never been disappointed here. However, I only go here on specific occassions-  1. like Larry G, only if I'm super hungry 2. If I have friends/fam in town that are super picky and not interested in anything but burgers and cheesecake 3. If I've been RREEEAAAALLLLYYYY good about watching fat and calories and treat myself to some cheesecake 4. Really craving a good burger- I love their burger on sour dough. It's so delish! Overall, safe bet for the picky eaters, great price for the big portions, never been disappointed with sogginess/undercookedness, etc., deadly desserts, and a nice brunch on Sundays with a layered french toast that you can feed off of for a week! I have no shame in giving a chain a great review if they deserve it."
