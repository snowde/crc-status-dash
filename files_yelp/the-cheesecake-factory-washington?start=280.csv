Monica R.,"Andrews AFB, MD",12,23,,4.0,6/23/2010,"I've been here once, but that first experience was a good one. I decided to order the roasted vegetable and goat cheese pizza and since it was before 5pm, I decided to go with their lunch time special which included a side salad.   What I got was a pizza the size of a large dinner plate and a salad that was equally as huge. The pizza was freaking awesome It was very flavorful and the goat cheese added that kind of extra zing to it. Just thinking of it right now is making me drool a la Homer from the Simpsons .   For dessert I had to try a cheesecake. I mean if you're going to go to a place called ""Cheesecake Factory"", you have to get a cheesecake right?  So I got the  White chocolate and macadamia nut and l I can say that it was not bad but I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be. Overall, the service was great, the food huge and the price was just right. I think I spent  a little over 25 for a drink(mmm, mojito), dinner and dessert."
Jed S.,"Baltimore, MD",42,217,,5.0,9/4/2006,"It's a chain, yes, and the wait time can be very long. That said, the food, in my experience, is always spectacular and worth the wait. The menu is scattered, serving all sorts of cuisine, but I find that to be one of the pluses. If you have friends who can't agree on what to eat, this is a great choice because given the depth of its menu, the Cheesecake Factory is bound to have something for everyone. The portions are enormous and reasonably priced. And the cheesecakes are obviously great. I happen to love the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake or the Chocolate Mousse, both phenominal, although the others are great too."
Candace H.,"Washington, DC",198,398,20,2.0,11/12/2005,"I've been here too many times for my own good.  Dragged along with friends, groups, families, whatever.  It's the quintessential chain restaurant pretending not to be a chain restaurant.  And any restaurant that serves everything from British to American to Chinese to Mexican food kind of scares me. The cheesecake is pretty good, which gives it one star, and the fact that it's open later than other restaurants in the area.  But the food always makes me feel a little sick afterward.  It's one of those dessert-only restaurants."
Ann L.,"Kathleen, GA",150,554,11,3.0,7/18/2010,"It's the Cheesecake Factory - you know the drill.  If you're there during lunchtime, get one of their ""lunch sized"" portions - it's a few dollars less, but you still will have enough to bring home with you.  The salads are usually banging (Santa Fe is my favorite so far) and the pizzas are awesome too (one has veggies and goat cheese, so good).   As for this one, ask to be seated upstairs.  The downstairs seating is really limited - there's a patio, the bar, and then the rest of the seats are kinda underneath their spiral staircase.  So, do yourself a favor and specifically ask for upstairs. I went on a Saturday evening and the service sucked.  We ordered an appetizer (fried mac and cheese balls - judge me), two salads, and a glass of wine.  The wine took about 15 minutes to get to our table, but no biggie since we weren't in a rush.  Not too much later, our food came out.  Our server plopped our salads in front of us and took off while another server put down a plate of fried cheese slices - not what we ordered.  We told him (not our server) this and he took them back.  Over ten minutes later, we still hadn't received them (yes, our appetizer) and our waiter had not stopped by once to check in with us.  At this point, I walked up to the manager.  Not so much to tattle-tale on the server, but really, the server may not have even known about our problem since we told another server our problem after he had ran off.  The manager seemed really accommodating and said she would get back to me.  She came to our table about 5 minutes later and said ""Sorry, there was a mix-up with your drink downstairs, but that should be coming up soon.  And as for your crab cake appetizers, that should be here soon too.""  I corrected her and told her we weren't waiting for a drink and we ordered mac and cheese balls, not crab cakes. Again she left and again she returned apologizing.  She explained that the balls had been delivered to the wrong table (next to us, those lucky bastards) so they are now making new ones for us which should be up soon and she also said she would comp us for the balls.   So we eventually get our balls (mini heart attacks with a side of cream sauce), get a few bites of cheesecake, and ask for the check.  The check comes with both the mac and cheese balls on the receipt and the fried cheese appetizer (that we never ordered but had been brought to our table which we did not accept) with the fried cheese appetizer comped.  Another five minutes go by before our server comes by, and we explain this to him.  He says ""yea, you didnt order those, so i comped you for it"".  Thanks, buddy, now go comp what we were supposed to be comped for.  Eventually, he got it right, but it was just another hurdle that resulted in delays in the evening. All in all, it's still great food at a great price, but I'm probably gonna stick to coming for lunch."
Samuel L.,"Washington, DC",0,56,,5.0,7/19/2010,"Been to a lot of ""Factories"", they are always consistent with their food and service.  This place is no different.  It's always so hard to choose from their ridiculously long menus, I pick something new each time and am never disappointed.    The one aspect that made this the most unique and enjoyable experience in the CF was the waitress.  I believe her name is Jessica, she entertained us from the get-go with impressions, voice-acting and clever wit.  I will never forget how much she up-lifted me and my friends dining experience.  Well done!"
Stephanie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,47,,1.0,6/29/2009,"Being that The Cheesecake Factory is known for their cheesecake, they should really stick to desserts.  Unfortunately, I was too disgusted by the dinner to even attempt dessert.  The fried mozzarella/asiago triangles were a decent appetizer, so I had high hopes for the dinner.  I ordered fried chicken cutlets with mashed potatoes, asparagus, and a lemon sauce.  The first few bites were great until my meal started to taste like a McDonald's crispy chicken sandwich.  Halfway through dinner my bf said he couldn't eat anymore because his chicken sandwich with fries tasted like a fast food meal.  While this restaurant certainly gives enormous portions as well as free drink refills, the food is not tasty in the least bit.  When the waiter came to discard our plates of heaping leftovers, he looked disappointed that we didn't eat more.  I could have sworn he created the menu after we passed up the opportunity to take a doggy bag back to our hotel.  If you're visting D.C. don't waste your money or time here.  There are so many other great restaurants to choose from."
yvonne g.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,34,1,4.0,12/28/2009,"Yum, Yum Yum is all I can say, the wait is long on busy times but so worth it. Meals can be a bit pricey. I have always had good service and I have eaten here several times. Decor is great and the same though out the country. Definitely have the desserts!!"
John D.,"Washington, DC",0,32,,4.0,10/12/2012,"Very good, fun clean atmosphere.  Great to take teen kids as a parent, or a casual date. It can get very crowded so be ready to wait. It's a bit pricey for the fare, but its good food and mostly good service. Been there a few times now and always consistent."
Larry G.,"Capitol Heights, MD",362,626,10,4.0,5/9/2007,"Treat yourself to Cheesecake Factory if you haven't eaten in like a week.  Believe me, they serve HUGE servings of food.  2 or 3 people can eat off a dish.  So, the prices are worth it.   Usually, when I go there, I'll have their Orange Chicken.  It's pretty good.  I've had their burgers.  They're alright.  Their pasta dishes are pretty good.  Just be sure to take half of your dish in a doggie bag.  Otherwise, you'll leave there with a busted stomach. However, the best part of the dining experience there is the cheesecake.  I've never seen so many different kinds of cheesecakes in one place.  My favorite of them all is the Key Lime cheesecake.  It's sweet and tangy...just the way I like it.  Other cheesecakes are delicious as well but nothing is as good as the Key Lime. If you go there, reserve ahead of time.  Otherwise, you will wait.  Count yourself lucky if you only waited 30 minutes because you will wait longer.   Wait service isn't always that great.  Sometimes, you'll only see your waiter when you get your order taken, when your food arrives and when you get the bill.  They seem to forget to stop by every now and then for drink refills.  I just flag the other waiters walking by and have my drink refilled.   Cheesecake Factory isn't someplace you'd want to go out regularly.  It's somewhere you'd go for a celebration...while the night is still young."
Ray C.,"Gwynn Oak, MD",0,16,,4.0,7/6/2010,"I have been eating at this restaurant for many years.  Generally there is a wait. Cheesecake is fantastic.  I really like the crab cakes. pros:  Good, lively atmostphere and good food cons:  Too much of a wait at times and some of the waitresses continuously monitor tables and take notes. Get the impression of being rushed."
Will Y.,"Washington, DC",13,177,,4.0,1/21/2009,"This place has a menu about the size of a mid-sized city's phone book. Virtually all of the food is good to excellent. This is a great place to take a group because everyone can find something they want. Portions are big enough to share. I don't enjoy dining in what looks like some kind of Willy Wonka set, but its a small complaint."
Harvey D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",216,406,,4.0,2/19/2009,"The great thing about this place is the menu is huge.  If you say you can't find something you like here, you're lying.  I have had lunch and dinner at this location many times and have never had a bad experience.  The food has always been delicious and that includes items like Sheila's Blackened Chicken Pasta, the Tons of Fun Burger, the Ceasar salad, the Grande Burrito and several different types of cheesecake along wtih the strawberry shortcake.  The portions are gigantic and I never leave hungry.  The prices can be a little deceiving because the portion size is so big.  The wait staff has always been friendly and attentive.  I do warn you that they don't take reservations so if you go at peak times, you will end up waiting.  But it's worth it!"
Sheree C.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",3,30,,4.0,2/18/2008,"I have always enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory and am impressed that so many of their dishes tastes delicious. I have a habit of ordering the same thing every time I go, however, I do tend to munch off the plates of friends and family and with the exception of one time, everything was good.  I recommend the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, it is a bit spicy and they cut down on the chicken portion, but it is good to the very last drop and tastes good the next day when you heat it up in the microwave. The Chicken Madeira and Kobe burgers are good choices as well. As far as drinks, I recommend their Mai Tai's and any flavor Bellini. The desserts are all good, but my favs are the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake, Vanilla Bean and Banana Cream Cheesecake.  As for parking, I'm not a fan of that absurd garage below the restaurant. I usually get lucky with parking near the townhouses behind the building or parking by the Lord and Taylor or Mazza Gallerie lot, it just seems easier, not the mention the validation for the garage under Cheesecake hardly offers a discount.  Unfortunately Cheesecake Factory isn't open for reservations which is crazy because it's such a popular place to eat, so if your party is more than 4, you will have a rather long wait during prime time. If you're going in for a quick meal/ appetizer and some drinks, I would suggest the first come first serve seating in the downstairs section. Staff is very nice and energetic and I've never had a problem."
Laurie B.,"Washington, DC",0,18,,5.0,6/5/2012,"the cheesecake factory is one of my all time favorite retaurants, and the one on wisconsin in friendship heights make the experience even more pleasurable. the staff is very polite and always makes sure to come check that the meal is going well. every time its so hard for me to pick which cheesecake to get, as i love the dulce de leche so much--i usually end up getting two and taking home the leftovers, which by the way are still just as good the next day!"
Alycia E.,"Washington, DC",13,93,,3.0,9/23/2008,"It seems somewhat pointless to review a restaurant with the word ""factory"" in its name. We all know that C.F. is about huge portions of ""meh"" food, but what it IS good for is finally getting consensus from a large group of people just looking to agree on a place to meet and eat. Large menu, decent drink menu, and the Friendship Heights Metro right underneath -- it really is a good place to suggest when you have one or two people in your group who aren't food explorers."
Renato S.,"Frederick, MD",8,341,69,4.0,8/28/2009,"Stopped in for diner and was impressed.  The layout is pretty nice, two floors and good service."
Alexandra S.,"Washington, DC",55,293,139,4.0,4/18/2011,"Just like all the other Cheesecake Factory restaurants, this one can get crazy busy.  We happened to eat here on a week night and somewhat on the late side so it wasn't too bad at all. In fact, we just went straight in and sat at the bar.  The waitress was very nice and we ended up not waiting long at all till we got our food. I not only love the diversity of the menu but consistently find the quality to get great as well. And yet I still managed to be pleasantly surprised when I ordered the mediterranean fish. It was sooo good. Cooked perfectly and the spices/tomatoes etc on top were excellent.  I had planned to only eat 1/2, given their portion sizes, but ended up cleaning my plate!  My friend ordered the cuban sandwich and holly cow was that good too! yumm yum. We even splurged and shared a slice of the plain low-cal cheesecake and it was delicious too. Not only a lovely evening but a great dinner. Excellent combo."
Glen L.,"Albuquerque, NM",41,91,1,5.0,8/16/2006,I can't believe the other reviews were so negative.  Ya gotta love The Cheesecake Factory.  The portions really make you feel like white trash.  It's damn good though.  I highly recommend the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake.  It is the BEST.
Alat B.,"Washington, DC",0,5,,4.0,8/1/2011,I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory.  My first exposure to the Cheesecake Factory was in Boston where I used to go repeatedly.  I came to this one for the first time over the weekend and relived the same amazing experience.  The variety at Cheesecake Factory is unparelled and the food is always amazing.  I definately recommend this place
Petra S.,"San Francisco, CA",551,1119,512,2.0,1/25/2006,"I've only been to the SF location but I've found that the wait just isn't worth it. If your going for say a special event and not being able to reserve is just a big downer and a waist of what would have been a great event. The cheesecakes there are tasty but again go for either dessert OR a meal cuz the cheescake is so big and filling in itself you wont have room to enjoy it or it's ""price"" if you don't have an empty stomach. And if your watching your weight it's a little too unforgiving to eat there too often, and with thier entries their just not that tasty unless your getting thier ""luau Salad"" which is a hawaiian/asian salad that is both sweet and savery and very filling even if you only get a half portion which i recommend. I once had thier pesto pizza and remember having a terrible stomach ache afterwards which left me in bed pretty much for the rest of the day. Dunno what was up with that. Other than that this is a highly over rated place to go for a birthday or with your friends since the wait can kill your patience when your STARVING."
