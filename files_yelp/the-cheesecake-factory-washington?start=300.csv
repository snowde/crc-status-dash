Veronique B.,"Bethesda, MD",0,39,1,5.0,5/31/2013,"I have to say I am the first one surprised at how great this place is especially considering the location where it's apparently competing with a ton of restaurants... HA! I tried almost all of them since I just moved to the neighborhood and am getting such a kick of being able to walk to diner... Chain restaurants are really not high on my list, so I went there really because it was there and so was I.... well I just about fell off my chair. Service is one of the best I've had in this country (and they don't sweep right next to you as you are eating!!!) from the hostesses to the servers they should all get accolades (I wish I could remember names but you can't go wrong with anyone! Special mention and kudos to TCF for hiring OLDER servers wow there's a change!) and the food is typical US chain but GOOD... they try original and they pull it off too! I was delighted with the quality and the quantity can be highlighted as pre-recession!!! Result is I keep going back again and again (secretly wishing they disappoint! lol) because of the whole experience at a great price.... all I can say is KEEP IT UP!!!!"
sandy c.,"Washington, DC",47,4,,4.0,4/12/2011,Everytime I get the chance my friends and I have dinner here. The service is always spot on and the food is fantastic . The cream of chicken and artichoke heart soup is a must try. The experience here is always good
Leigh S.,"Gaithersburg, MD",55,21,2,2.0,6/15/2009,"While I have been to Cheesecake at both White Flint and Friendship Heights  many many times, I just had to write about my most recent trip to the FH location... Our service was so preposterous, I don't think I can go back to the location - not for lack of service, but for the most intrusive service I have ever received! As a server of 8 years myself, I can be pretty forgiving, but he was so invasive we could not enjoy our meal.  While it is aggravating to sit and wait for service, or have your waiter disappear on you, it is equally annoying to have a server that clearly cannot read his customers and interrupts the table *every* time he passes by (which was frequent since our table was right next to the Micros where he put in orders). After checking back after every single time something was dropped at the table (is the bread ok?, drinks, apps, a napkin, more butter, a refill, another refill, an extra fork - are these all ok?), I was getting annoyed. At one point, I was cutting off a shrimp tail and he stopped to ask me if something was wrong with my shrimp.  Can a girl cut her food without an inquisition?  My breaking point was when he came to get us refills (my pet peeve is when people take my glass and reuse it, but I digress) and he took my glass with a sugar coated rim and PUT IT IN HIS ARMPIT to carry back to the station to refill it with lemonade.  Sorry, but that's unsanitary and completely disgusting. I may be done with Cheesecake (at least the location) for good."

Jen P.,"San Francisco, CA",59,373,457,4.0,6/27/2008,"i came here on a visit to dc with my cousins. and i usually go to the one back home in san francisco. the only problem i had with this location was that the top floor closes at 10, and there are only small tables downstairs."
