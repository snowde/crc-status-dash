Christina C.,"Ormond Beach, FL",4,48,56,3.0,1/14/2017,The food is great and most servings are enough to get leftovers for the next day. I'm giving it a low review though because they stuck us in a booth behind the dishes station and all night we heard the loud clatter of dirty dishes being stacked. Really shouldn't seat people there.
Junior V.,"Columbia, MD",30,33,8,1.0,2/8/2017,"Needed a good place to eat a burger so I stopped in... was greeted and seated quickly. Staff is nice, too. However, the burger, which I ordered well done, came out  half well half rare. I sent the burger back and waited another 30 minutes for my food. I took the food to go since I had to be back to work soon. I walk a few steps away from the establishment so I was able to get to my desk in a minute or so... I sat down and pulled my food out to see a bug fly out of the bag! I can't get my money back nor can I get my time back. Not happy..."
Ga Hing C.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,83,420,5.0,6/24/2016,"LOVE The Cheesecake Factory and I wish there was one in NYC. This location had good customer service, great ambiance and the food was good. For the appetizers, I couldn't decide so went with the eggroll sampler. Every single piece of that dish was delicious. Especially when dipped in the dark-green-sweet sauce. As for the entrees, the Chicken and Shrimp Bang Bang was very tasty. The Steak Diane and Madeira Chicken was perfectly cook and very flavorful as well. Beware! The portions are HUMONGOUS!!"
Stephanie M.,"Bridgewater, NJ",186,28,14,2.0,12/10/2016,"The food was alright but i'm super pissed about the parking. We drove here and SPECIFICALLY CALLED the restaurant ahead of time to ask if they validated parking, which they said they did. So we parked at a lot and had it validated. The service was pretty slow, but we didn't really mind because we had nowhere to be.  UNTIL we get to parking lot and find out the validation only takes off $2 so we had to pay for 3+ hours of parking anyway. I'm pretty ticked they didn't think to mention that when we called just to ask, because now i'm out $10 when i could've parked for free."
Claire W.,"Washington, DC",66,93,128,4.0,5/16/2016,Had a 4/5 star dinner experience at Cheesecake Factory on a Friday night. Our server was friendly and efficient at the same time. She did a great job of double checking on ingredients in a certain dish or cocktail and accommodating for substitutions. I ordered the Thai glazed salmon which naturally came with white rice but she suggested if I wanted brown before I could request it. She must have read my mind! The service was good; there wasn't any lags in getting the food or drinks. Overall had a wonderful time.
John C.,"Ormond Beach, FL",258,1256,3001,3.0,3/8/2016,My wife wanted to eat here when we were walking around the area shopping.  I had the Ahi Tartare that looked more like a side for my morning bagel.  Not very impressed but I was not very hungry so it worked.  My daughter had fish taco's ( I hade one) they were a bit dry but ok.  My wife had a burger (I had some) also just OK.  Nothing special this go around.  I can attest to there deserts from past experience.  I once had a red velvet cheese cake delivered to my home for my wife's birthday - it was great.
Barbara P.,"Reston, VA",263,192,88,3.0,1/27/2016,"According to Montgomery County Code Chapter 15, Section 15-15a, restaurants are required to post calorie counts for standard menu items for at least 60 days each year. I carry a heavy burden for knowing the calorie count for a slice of red velvet cheesecake, which is DELICIOUS, FYI. Skip if you don't want to know. Have you removed your eyeballs down a few lines? It's a whopping melonfarming one thousand five hundred forty (1,540) calories. Skip skippity skip. Service was great-- we had a table of 12 but our waitress was super nice when it came to splitting checks. I shared the Spinach Dip and Louisiana Chicken Pasta  which is wise considering the very 'murican portions. Despite my attempts to be less spherical, I still ordered a slice of red velvet cheesecake-- half for here, and half to go! I then peer pressured others into sharing 770 calories with me. Now for #firstworldproblem. The ladies' restroom was oddly lacking-- the stalls are cramped, especially for anyone that's just eaten at this establishment (see portion comment above). Of 3 stalls, one didn't have a functioning lock, forcing me to run over with my pants around my ankles to the larger handicap stall (partially joking). One of two soap dispensers just has a hole in the counter. Step ya game up Chevy Chase Cheesecake Chfactory! Oh yeah... and parking still came out to a buttload despite the validation. Go park over at Giant and walk over to earn your slice of cheesecake."
Kia E.,"Washington, DC",85,40,22,4.0,10/15/2016,Ordered the AHI CARPACCIO..it was tasty..my fi ance ordered the crab balls..(litte plate)..you get about 6..they had a decent flavor.  Ordered a long island ice tea .kinda pricey but STRONG!!
Mell H.,"Olney, MD",159,65,71,2.0,1/28/2016,"I'm a huge fan of the Cheesecake factory-- in fact, it's one of my family's usual go-to places after we do some shopping at Westfield Montgomery mall in Rockville. My mom, sister and I decided to eat at the Friendship Heights location after doing some shopping around the area but we were sorely disappointed. The food and service was noticeably shabbier than the Rockville branch. We ordered the Thai veggie wraps, crispy fish tacos, a fried mac and cheese burger, and the lemon meringue cheesecake. Our server was quick to take our orders but she brought out our food very late which was my biggest complaint for today's dinner. A couple sitting across the room from us arrived later than my trio, ordered after us, and still got their food a good 15 minutes before us even though they had ordered very similar items (burger and tacos) The burger and Thai lettuce wraps were excellent! The lettuce wraps in particular are so fresh, delicious, and flavorful! My family always gets them when we come to Cheesecake, especially because everything else we order tends to be fried and heavy haha. You won't be dissapointed with the quality of the vegetables or size of the dish.  The biggest let down of the evening and the reason for my 2 star review was the fish tacos. The fish itself was crispy and tasteful, but the rice, which is great at the Rockville location, was dry, tasteless, and stale. The two lime wedges that came with the tacos were dry to the point that they were hard to the touch (i couldn't even squeeze the juice out of them). The marinated onions had soaked the bottom of the tortilla and caused it to mush up. It all became clear to me then: the tacos had been left underneath the heating lamp for way too long. I don't know what happened in the kitchen or with our waitress, but the tacos had been ruined due to neglect. I could have forgiven the bad rice if it was simply bad rice, but could I overlook an amalgamate of crusty rice, crusty limes, soggy tacos, caused by our overly long wait for food? No way. Anyways, I don't think my review is reflective of the branch as a while. The food overall is better at the Rockville branch, but tonight's major issue regarding the lackluster fish tacos could have been avoided entirely if the food had reached us in a timely manner."
Glenda S G.,"Bowie, MD",0,2,,5.0,6/25/2017,"My sister and I stopped in for lunch between bball games in which our kids were playing. Franco, the MOD, was very visible, serving tables, greeting customers and ensuring everyone's dining experience was enjoyable. The icing on the cake is that he boxed up our leftovers...who does that anymore! Definitely, recommend this location!"
Mrs T.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",0,9,,1.0,9/30/2017,"I order the Thai lettuce wraps.  Which came in in different containers. I notice that on the lettuce leaves there was a bug on one of the leave,  which tells me that the lettuce not washed off. The chicken was bland that really did not help the meal out at all. Seeing that bug the meal really disgusted me. How could you really serve people food that has not been cleaned.  I would rate them a 0 and would not select any star . But to continue you have to select one star. Horrible place"
Tasha D.,"Arlington, VA",0,20,54,3.0,5/9/2017,Great menu and beautiful location. Near lots of shops! Delicious desserts! Divine cheesecakes!
Big J.,"Washington, DC",0,28,,5.0,6/10/2017,"Went to have dinner.  Served by Karen H.  She was just delightful!! Friendly, attentive but not intrusive.  Ask for her - she is great!"
Rashada C.,"Washington, DC",103,7,,1.0,2/18/2017,I would never go to this specific cheesecake factory every again. It was my friends birthday and we were waiting for a table. She made a reservation for a large party and most of the party had to be there before we could be seated. However even when majority of the party showed they did not have a table ready  to accomadate us. There was a couple siting in the section who were both finished eating. They sat us at a table were only half of us could sit. After talking to the manager she told us it was nothing she could do. Finally after a lot begging she finally did allow us to sit at a bigger table after we waited a hour and 30 minthues. We get to the big table it is almost time to close that is how long we were waiting. They take forever to give us our food. It got to the point were i canceled my order and got a cheesecake. The services here sucks
Mary Agnes R.,"Washington, DC",176,9,,1.0,5/15/2017,"Came here for my college graduation celebration last night. There was a party of 9 people, and we spent almost 3 hours there- excluding the hour spent waiting for a seat (after already having a reservation). It took 20 minutes to get our sodas. The mixed drinks didn't arrive until after 30 minutes. Finally brought bread after about 30 minutes as well. My waitress's extremely long hair weave literally TOUCHED the bread, because the hair was so long. After finally getting our food, mine was cold. Another's sandwich bread was so hard, it wouldn't break when slammed against the table. We finally ordered desserts after 30 more minutes. It took 40 minutes to get the cheesecake- no joke. In addition, this entire dinner (3 hours) my soda was never refilled. Terrible service. The dinner was terrible."
Gwoping Y.,"Bethesda, MD",145,93,231,3.0,9/16/2016,This cheesecake factory is conveniently located in friendship heights. I've always been happy with the service here and the food is consistent with what is expected. There can be pretty long waits here but during the day you can roam the mall while you are waiting.
Amy C.,"Endicott, NY",8,30,4,3.0,2/25/2017,"Very, very noisy to the point our kids covered their ears from time to time. Service was slow, the server seemed harried. We ordered guacamole to start, fairly tasty, the salsa served with it was some flavorless anemic tomatoes. My hubs ordered the spicy cashew chicken and it was quite tasty, I ordered the chicken Marsala that was so beyond bland, I just didn't eat much. The kids meals seemed adequate. Both cheesecakes we tried were quite good, had to wait an hour for our entrees  and an additional 15 minutes for our to go cheesecakes...overall very meh experience."
Angie S.,"McLean, VA",0,8,2,1.0,3/27/2017,I was there and waited more than 25 min and no server came Over so I had to go and ask the hostess  that was laying down like she needed a nap at the front desk  so I asked her to get me a manager or a server who can  take my order ! After few min no one came so we end up  leaving it wasn't even busy To use that as excuse anyhow I'm   happy I didn't spend my money there and I won't ever again
Curtis K.,"San Diego, CA",50,260,271,2.0,10/17/2015,Favorite restaurant chain. Least favorite location. You gotta ask for bread. The pastas seem to come with less sauce than usual. They forgot to give me a plastic utensil for my take out. I feel I'm have to remind them a lot. Cheesecake Factory usually has way better service.
Andre' L.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",39,57,20,3.0,8/4/2016,Food is very good service excellent atmosphere outstanding chicken Cesar salad egg roll sampler and everything pizza all of our food was fresh hot and flavorful the professional service of Ryan made this a wonderful lunch.
