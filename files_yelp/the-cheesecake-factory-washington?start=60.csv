Mary S.,"Culpeper, VA",44,100,21,2.0,3/13/2017,We went for a late dinner at around 9pm Saturday night. There was a 30 minute wait so we decided to eat at the bar. We sat at a table behind the hostess and waited 10 minutes for the table to be cleaned. Then we had to wait another 3 minutes or so to get our drink order taken and appetizer order by the waiter. The food was delicious. I ordered steak and my boyfriend ordered a chicken and shrimp dish with rice (gumbo or jambalaya). I'm giving it two stars because of the quality of service we received. Didn't really expect that from this establishment.
Kristina B.,"Santa Barbara, CA",1,8,16,1.0,11/3/2016,"One star for sure,the worse service ever and the food ever. The service was so unhappy working ,couldn't anything with smile or polite,his  was kind rude ,didn't answer our questions very well. I order the shrimp,basil and garlic,it was really bad,cold,the shrimp like frozen and no tasting. Only good think was the white wine because they didn't make it. Don't go there,zero stars"
Annie T.,"Silver Spring, MD",449,90,2446,4.0,6/17/2014,"I came to the Friendship Heights Cheesecake Factory for HH.  It was perfect to grab some food before seeing the Free Screening of Jersey Boys at AMC Mazza Gallerie courtesy of Yelp! Thanks!    I was bummed that my fav, the calamari was no longer a part of the HH menu.  I'm not sure if that is for all locations or just the Friendship Heights location.  When we got there, there was plenty of seats in the bar area.  We chose to sit at one of the high top tables.  HH there is from 4-6pm.  We got there right after 4pm. We ordered the crab dip and the buffalo blasts.  The crab dip was ok, nothing special, but not bad.  It had a real heavy fatty flavor.  The buffalo blasts were also fatty, but I loved them.  They were super crispy w/ an intense flavor and I loved the buffalo dipping sauce.  The buffalo blasts came with so much!  All the HH apps were $5 bucks, you can't beat that.  They def are not cheap with the portions. I always love Cheesecake Factory's HH, it's just hard to get to since it only last for 2 hours. The movie happened to be awesome, so it was a great day for me. Yay!!!"
Angelo A.,"Washington, DC",0,22,,4.0,8/2/2017,"Excellent Service.  I was part of a party 5 people - one of them showed up late and was graciously accomodated.  The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp was fantastic - as were the avocado rolls.  We had Banana Cheesecake, Salted Caramel Cheesecake and Oreo Cheesecake - all of which were very good -- especially the Oreo!  NICE JOB!   Only negative was the couple sitting at the booth next to us' movements affected the bench of our booth.   :)"
Harshit J.,"Adelphi, MD",133,4,1,5.0,8/17/2016,"One of the best places in town. It has the perfect ambience for a date. The place is very well decorated and lit. The wait staff are one of the best I have ever seen in town. Patient and suggestive. The food is amazing. The pasta, nachos and of course the cheesecake. The beer battered fries were OKish. Loved the place.  Amazing experience and will definitely visit again and again."
Bianca F.,"Rockville, MD",426,338,1082,4.0,5/1/2014,"Who doesn't like the Cheesecake Factory? Not many! It's good! I come here from time to time. I really like the bread they offer. The wheat bread is delicious! It's topped with whole rolled oatmeal. They do offer the white bread; but get the wheat. And the bread is free! I was able to avoid a slice of cheesecake which I have thought about every day since I visited. The red velvet, pumpkin and the white chocolate and vanilla are all divine! Red velvet, red velvet! Mmm mmm!  So since I avoided cheesecake but was still hungry and clearly not cooking myself dinner; I opted for the Skinnylicious chicken samosas and the seared ahi tuna salad.  The Skinnylicious chicken samosas are good; but they were greasy. Kind of not so Skinnylicious in my opinion. Maybe they should bake them instead? The seared ahi tuna salad is good! The tuna has some type of Cajun seasoning on the outside; yummy. It's my fav salad there. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal & will probably go back at some point to get my red velvet cheesecake fix."
Shabobe G.,"Washington, DC",88,9,,2.0,9/17/2016,"This restaurant use to be always a sure thing with regards to food, ambiance and service. We came today for my mother's 70th Birthday and the service was shabby, the waitress forgetful, everyone complained about their meal but me, and the manager didn't take off a weak drink from the bill. Believe me, best to a up this place."
Nima A.,"Washington, DC",0,8,,1.0,7/16/2017,"Worst breakfast in town; Dennis, the cook dumps anything he likes in the omelette against the order; staff response: we will tell him. Waste of time and money; a greasy omelette at its worst with aged ingredients."
Serena S.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",0,1,,1.0,10/21/2017,"My husband and I are regular customers of Cheesecake Factory. Today we went to have lunch at the Friendship Heights restaurant in Washington DC. Before ordering, I found one fork still have food left on it! It was so disgusting! So I told the waiter to change it, who then showed the fork to the manager on duty.  Interestingly, the manager did not even bother to come out to explain. Then I started to check others - they are all dirty, filthy, oily - with food remains. Even the empty table next to us has a dirty knife with food residue. So my husband asked for the manager. It took the manager more than 2 requests and 10 minutes to come.  All what he said is that he will tell his boss. We could not imagine such issue can happen at Cheesecake Factory. We lost the appetite and left quite a lot food. The last thing we wanted is food poisoning.  Health department should be alerted and have their inspectors to check this restaurant.  We were not only disappointed with the lack of hygiene but also with lack of interest from the manager."
Andrew O.,"Arlington, VA",1,24,2,2.0,8/29/2016,"This location has gone so far downhill. Mostly due to the poor customer service. They will not survive if they continue to treat their customers this way. Today was the last straw, and my office will not go there anymore.  We eat there in a group of 6 to 12 people quite often for lunch. Today they had a difficult time accommodating six of us at noon!  Because they wouldn't put tables together. Said it was a fire hazard. Had to eat outside. Continued to get attitude from servers. No smiles. Not friendly. They used to be so good. Management needs to get a handle on this. It is a reflection of them. We are an easy going, happy, fun group who dine out for lunch in our work neighborhood on a regular basis. We will not go to Cheesecake anymore."
Cem G.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,6,5.0,7/19/2016,We Are fan of Cheesecake Factory. Especially with Oreo cheesecake. We ordered avocado egg rolls it was so delicious and we ordered another one too.... Always satisfied with food.
Erika M.,"Washington, DC",150,145,14,2.0,8/29/2016,"I came to Cheesecake Factory on Saturday evening to celebrate my birthday with one of my close friends. I've come to this location several times in the past and have always had a great time. Unfortunately, this past weekend, I cannot say the same. My friend and I decided amongst ourselves that our server had to have been brand new - that's the only way we could remain patient and polite with such disappointing service. I had to ask twice for sweetener for my iced tea. We had to ask for bread to be brought out. The bread finally came, but the server seemed to not think that silverware or plates were necessary. Had to ask for those. I ordered the brown-butter roasted carrots with pecans as one of my side dishes. It came out of the kitchen as just a plate of warm carrots. I asked the server where the butter and pecans were and she said ""I didn't know it was supposed to come with pecans."" I'm guessing she missed menu training?! I know from my own history as a server that it's a really nice touch to include a container of whatever sauce came on the plate with people's leftovers when they're packed to go. I can't say that I was surprised that she didn't pack me a container of the delicious remoulade that accompanied my fried catfish, but as I am eating these plain leftovers, I really wish she'd thought to do that.  In addition to my own poor service, there was another server working the patio alongside my server this particular night. I was sitting two tables away as I heard him complaining to a table about a table that had just left and how did they didn't tip. He gave a monologue about the frustrations of ""paying to be here"" because he had to tip out the bar and the bussers and whoever else and it really just upsets him when people ""don't tip for no reason."" If I wasn't already distracted by the fact that he was wearing shorts, which is generally unacceptable at any place above a bar, I was definitely distracted by him speaking that way.  All in all, the food was delicious, but the service really detracted from my overall experience."
Brenda H.,"Washington, DC",0,4,,5.0,6/13/2017,"We had lunch, I had pasta my spouse had meat loaf, of course we shared, I'm not a beef consumer, but his meat loaf was really good. We were happy with the service and pricing. I'm sure we shall visit again and I'll enjoy his meat loaf."
Aida S.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,11,3,4.0,11/11/2016,Had the Louisiana pasta it was so good. Cheesecakes are amazing here a great deal to choose from. The prices are great for the quality of food.
Marivic L.,"Washington, DC",156,506,752,3.0,5/27/2014,"This is really a 3.5 for the meal and cheesecake I had last night.  This Cheesecake Factory is very much like the others, with two levels. We got seated quickly and our server was nice enough. My meal was surprisingly good for being on the skinny menu. Shrimp over pasta for under 590 calories? Yes, please. The shrimp, pasta and asparagus were cooked well. The sauce was so tasty that it was hard to believe it was healthy.  I tried the apple streusel cheesecake for the first time. Wow. That's some great streusel topping with nice apple chucks in the cheesecake itself. I didn't even miss having chocolate that day. Really."
Valentino C.,"Washington, DC",218,67,72,4.0,4/18/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. The food and drink specials are great for happy hour. Big portions so come hungry. Sometimes I just indulge in the lettuce wraps, one of my fav items!"
Jerry T.,"Charleston, WV",3,16,3,3.0,4/19/2016,"Stopped by May of 2015, Cheesecake was great! Had to wait 30 minutes for our check though. Restaurant wasn't busy either. Our waiter must have left during our visit and didn't tell us or his replacement. He just vanished."
Narie L.,"San Jose, CA",4,62,47,5.0,8/18/2016,Luv luv luv Cheesecake Factory. Ordered crab cake wanton; fire cracker salmon & the Mai Tai drink. All very good.
Shannon S.,"Irving, TX",52,165,187,1.0,12/9/2015,"Nasty bar area.. Nets and bugs everywhere. I orders a bottled drink and looked around the bar and was so glad I did. I will never order any  drinks from this place. Their sanitation practices are horrible. I felt like I was on an episode of ""Bar Rescue"" The management should be ashamed of this"
Eric T.,"Silver Spring, MD",19,73,10,5.0,1/8/2016,"Are there better restaurants yes, but this is where I met my wife when I worked there years ago so it will of course get five stars!! By far the biggest menu I have ever scene with many yummy options from artery cloggers to healthy options and beyond. The desserts and especially the cheesecakes are of course amazing. Whatever you are in the mood for the Cheesecake factory will have it!! The secret to success at the Cheesecake factory is that they are constantly food testing. What is food testing you ask? Here is some inside skinny, the managers constantly send out ""fake"" food orders to test the quality throughout the day. If anything is off they address it immediately. That is why the quality and taste of the food is so consistent. As far as corporate restaurants go, this is well oiled machine. The food is good, the service is good and you will always leave very full. Thanks for hiring the hostess with the mostess that led to my happy marriage and my handsome twin four year old boys, who by the way also love the Cheesecake Factory!!"
