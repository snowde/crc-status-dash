Kirk S.,"Washington, DC",204,648,24,1.0,9/13/2014,"ABANDON ALL HOPE YE WHO ENTER HERE. This is the home of American opulence, a shining gem of American eating at it's absolute worst and it's absolute fattest. Gaze thine eyes upon the thousand-calorie slices of cheesecake juxtaposed with the 500+ calorie appetizers and unbelievably huge entrees. Quiver in fear at the oversized Italian meals that no one person should ever eat. Divert your eyes from the morbidly obese, the huge families who evidently could not afford condoms, and the wailing bar patrons. Contemplate becoming anorexic or, as a more drastic alternative, pretending to be Canadian to distance yourself from the 'murricans surrounding you.  Or just, you know, go elsewhere."
Pamela B.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,17,,2.0,4/21/2017,"Visited the cheesecake factory for a night cap.  Was directed to the bar where the waitress was otherwise occupied and capativated with her two male customers.  Finally, another waitress came over and took our order.  How much do you think the cost for a drink of Sambucca?   Would you believe $13.  Beware of the price of drinks, they are ridiculous at the Cheese Cake Factory.  The food was ok,"
Linda O.,"Washington, DC",144,206,52,3.0,3/6/2015,"They have an infinite number of offerings--a regular menu, a skinny menu, a cheesecake menu and a booze menu. Talk about choices; it's almost mind-bending. I have had some good experiences here. And not so. Kids like it; the name lures them (and parents) in. I've caved to the pressure of teenagers plotting to go here. The salads are reasonable; quinoa & kale salad and ceasar salad are go-tos for me. A few appetizers aren't bad; crispy crab bites and hot artichoke dip are safe. It's the main entrees that I find myself objecting to. Last time I ordered the southern fried catfish platter; the catfish was decent, but canned corn as a side? Are you kidding me? For the price I was paying? The green beans were as tough as clothes pins, too. The cheesecake is agreeable, nothing phenomenal. The bread that accompanies the meal is so so, although freely offered. The restaurant itself feels cold to me no matter what season. All that tile and stone--on the floor, tabletops, bar, staircases--invites the chill factor. Service is usually satisfactory. When this Cheesecake Factory first opened in DC a few years back, it was all the rage.   The food is generally acceptable. Pricing is somewhat on the high side for a chain, but then again, it's located across the street from Mazza Gallerie."
Rizma W.,"Washington, DC",105,590,510,4.0,2/12/2015,"This has recently become one of my favorite places for happy hour. Lucky for me, it is also very close to my office. A lot of bars and restaurants have 3-5 dishes on their happy hour menu and a similar number of drinks.  Cheesecake Factory offers at least two pages of delicious options for every palate. From crab rangoons and cheeseburger sliders, to Vietnamese shrimp egg rolls and tamale cakes smothered in salsa verde, this is the place to come if you want to do more than just drink the day away. And the prices are GREAT, especially for this part of town. Most of the happy hour dishes are $5-$7, and the drink specials offered are usually about the same (depending in what you order, of course). According to one of the bartenders, the restaurant has an arrangement with the Beringer vineyards, which makes a Merlot exclusively for the Cheesecake Factory. It's one of my favorite wines at any restaurant; juicy and just slighty sweet. I could easily drink that stuff by the bottle.  And it goes without saying that the cheesecake is amazing. That's a given. There are very few things in life that a slice of chocolate chip cookie dough or red velvet cheesecake cannot fix. Period. The only reason that this isn't a 5 star experience is because the staff is iffy. I've have attentive and fun bartenders and I've also had inattentive ones that would rather discuss personal issues with their coworkers with a bar full of customers. Parking is available of nearby side streets, but it can be a little tricky to find at the that time of day. Fortunately, the Metro is located just across the street, and there is a parking lot very close to the restaurant, as well. (There is no street parking from 4-6:30 pm on weekdays. They will ticket AND tow your car. You have been warned.)"
Sharett L.,"New Orleans, LA",24,119,129,4.0,1/30/2014,"Love that this location is not in the hustle and bustle of downtown but still in a location with shops and other happenings.   The food here was very good. Hot, large portions, and well seasoned without being salty. This was my server's first day in training and she was very sincere and sweet. You could tell that she was still learning. My only downfall and reduction in the star is that the silverware is just on the table, not in napkins or placed on top. That's just filthy. Also, the upholstery and leather in most booths needs to be replaced."
Drew L.,"Potomac, MD",19,95,549,4.0,2/21/2016,"Always a fun place to dine with all the selections of drinks, food and of course cheesecakes. Generally food is good with good sized portions."
Anna N.,"Alexandria, VA",120,271,364,2.0,12/6/2015,"Every time I've been here there's been a problem- either food or service. Doesn't seem to happen nearly as much at other cheesecake factory's. On this visit tonight the front desk was helping someone with an issue. We waited 4 minutes then I asked if they had a flight. She said ""I'm helping someone else."" I said yea I know I just wondered if there was a wait so we would no. She could have just said yes/no. Instead she again in an even ruder voice said ""I'm helping someone else"". So we left. I called and talked to the manager, and after waiting 20 minutes on hold, talked to Shania, and her only offer was that if we wanted to drive back we could and she would seat us."
Stephanie H.,"Frederick, MD",7,68,,3.0,2/10/2017,"I really love Cheesecake Factory however, last night was not the best experience. We arrived around 9pm- the waitress was friendly and upbeat. With that said, the food was good but, the drinks were slow coming. We relocated our table because the ceiling was leaking- after we pointed it out to the staff, they didn't even try to block the area off or catch the leak."
Susan W.,"Chevy Chase, MD",0,39,112,4.0,1/11/2016,Food was good: shrimp and sausage rigatoni in marinara sauce that was just spicy enough for a nice kick. Hubby ordered chicken scampi which he said was delish. Service so so. Waiter took order and delivered food promptly but did not come back to ask how the food was. Nor did he offer extra Parmesan cheese sprinkling. Little disappointed with service.
ILove D.,"Arlington, VA",2,49,17,2.0,1/16/2016,"Shrimp angle hair pasta, very good! Big portion. I had it for two meals.  Avocado egg rolls, good but too salty for me. My husband likes it a lot and finished the whole plate.  Factory burger, not very good.  Cheesecake, yum!  I like this place, unfortunately the service in this particular location is not good. Try other Cheesecake Factory, those may be better."
Monisha R.,"Centreville, VA",0,13,,1.0,2/17/2017,"The worst service. Ordered a burger with a veggie burger patty, said no bacon at least twice and the server wrote it down. Food came out extremely late (we asked them how long it would take because we were going to a movie), but it still came out 40 mins after we ordered. The burger came out with bacon, not sure what chef thinks that someone who ordered a veggie burger would want bacon, the server offered to take the bacon off of this burger--which doesn't solve anything because bacon is greasy and would still be on the food, and ended up leaving with no food. This is not the first time I have had someone ruin my order here, not worth your time-especially if you are hungry."
Komet M.,"Washington, DC",7,19,1,5.0,6/2/2015,"I've been patronizing this particular Cheesecake Factory restaurant since April 1991, when I treated a visiting friend from my college days to lunch there.   The place is always HUMMIN'!   And the reason for that becomes readily discernible to anyone who comes there either set on having a delicious, satisfying meal or to pick up a take-away meal or a previously ordered cheesecake.    (In the latter case, I've treated myself to a whole cheesecake there for my birthday annually for close to 23 years now.    The quality is always the best.)    The ambience of the restaurant is relaxing and soothing, with clear, unobstructed views of the surrounding neighborhoods.  Anywhere you sit in the restaurant, you feel at once secure in the hands of staff who know their stuff when it comes to the rich and varied cuisine The Cheesecake Factory has to offer.    The menu is like a book (LOL), with lots of mouth-watering, appetizing dishes.    The drinks on offer are also really good and refreshing.  (I confess to a partiality for the Merlot and strawberry daiquiris.  Smile.)    So, if you want to make the most of what The Cheesecake Factory is all about, COME HUNGRY!  Better yet, come famished.  The food is soooo tasty and filling that you'll probably need to ask staff to provide you with a doggie bag.    You needn't feel ashamed about that.    I cannot praise the restaurant staff enough.   They really care about you, the customer, and ensuring that you have the best experience possible.  (Should you plan on having a meal there as part of a group, just be sure to call ahead of time to be sure staff can accommodate you and your party.)"
Adrienne M.,"Laurel, MD",961,274,1158,4.0,5/9/2014,"I've been to this location several times since I've been in the area. I give it four stars for the following: 1. The service is always great. Polite and personable.    2. The food is always good...for the most part (I try to avoid anything with mashed potatoes. The potatoes never taste cooked enough). 3. The drinks are awesome. Always strong enough to give it a kick, but not too strong to make you pass out on a booth. 4. The ambiance is good. You can come here with a rack of friends to celebrate a birthday, dinner on a date night, or happy hour with a coworker. It's always a good time to dine here. 5. They have a pretty good happy hour. Although it's not your standard 3 hours like most chain restaurants, and you have to almost bulldoze your way in, they continuously have good specials (which I don't know how much value you'll place on this statement because they also have small plates for a few dollars)  And finally...  6. The serve some of the best cheesecakes you can find anywhere. I'm not a cheesecake nazi, but I will tell you that the red velvet cheesecake is something special.  I deducted 1 star for hard potatoes and a lack of a parking lot (strange combo I know, but how can you mess up on potatoes??? And parking...well...)"
Diana M.,"Washington, DC",0,7,,2.0,1/28/2017,My family and I visit this location yesterday.  While I understand the restaurant was busy it is unacceptable that it took them an hour to serve our food.  Our server was very apologetic and I understand it was not his fault but I don't recommend this location.
Lester P.,"Washington, DC",293,15,10,1.0,4/3/2016,"This has to be one of the worst customer service situations of all time. I requested tables for 20 people, after a brief conversation with Manager Shanna Williams (NOTE) This young lady would not listen to a word we were saying and in her frustration Ms. Williams suggested we go to the restaurant next door. Her attitude was awful."
Mary B.,"Langhorne, PA",0,2,1,3.0,7/11/2016,"The food was good, but the services was extremely slow.  The restaurant was not very crowded and it took almost an hour to get our food.  We had asked for separate checks and the waitress said it was not a problem.  When it was time to receive our checks, she had to go around the table and ask each of us what we ordered.  It took her over a 1/2 hour to bring us our checks. I will not return to this restaurant because of the slow service."
Iyore E.,"Owings Mills, MD",28,21,2,1.0,3/13/2016,"We just had the worst service imaginable. We decided to take our sister out today because it was her birthday and our waiter was DANIEL. His services were beyond HORRIBLE from getting the wrong drinks to forgetting to add the vegetable we requested to be added to the order. We decided to tip him $25 even though he didn't deserve $1 after we tipped him. We informed him that it was my sisters birthday and we expected the typical Cheesecake Factory celebratory birthday shoutout and guess what??! He said he was tired and if we wanted, he could assign another table to us! I was completely SHOCKED. This is definitely my last visit to this location! Someone's attention needs to be called to this ASAP!  I expect more and I will be contacting the corporate office!"
Lorine P.,"Washington, DC",0,3,,2.0,1/4/2017,"We go here often with our grandson, who is 3 and does better in a booth than a regular table. Today we were told there were no booths available and escorted to a table about two feet away from 5 empty booths and one booth that already had people in it. When we asked to be seated in one of the booths, we were told that section was closed even though one already had people. My husband went back to the hostess/manager to point out the absurdity of the situation but was refused again. Within 15 minutes people were being seated in the booths around us. This is very poor customer relations."
Evin E.,"Washington, DC",0,6,2,1.0,2/7/2016,Yesterday the waitress Melena was real rude and ignorant to us. I m a foreigner but live in DC and go to this place every week. I bet She thought we were tourists. Love the food there but such attitude put a shadow on the reputation of such a wonderful restaurant.
Delora W.,"Washington, DC",40,1,,1.0,2/6/2016,Very small dining area and a two and a half hour wait. The service and food was horrible not coming back !
