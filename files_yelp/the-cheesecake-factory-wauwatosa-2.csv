Bill M.,"De Pere, WI",19,16,5,4.0,8/16/2017,"My server was awesome and very personable. Checked in on me and held a conversation well.  The restaurant itself, was actually a little dirty, even though they had just opened for the day. The table was clean, but the floor and sills were dirty. Remind myself to order dessert first. Didn't actually order a cheesecake. It sounds like such a sin not to, but I was just full."
Kimi P.,"Milwaukee, WI",2,9,2,1.0,7/10/2017,"Ummm yeah,never again! Why do ppl go here? You leave hungry. Bf's potatoes were nasty and hard, see the fork marks?  3 shrimp for his scampi and those stupid steak medallions! Med rare my a$$, let's give them 4 small pieces of steak and still screw it up. My Salmon was boring, steak was over done and 3 asparagus spears. Really?.. and don't be so cheap on the butter... I had to ask 3 times and each time they give us 2 little packs, for 5 slices of bread. I like butter on those crappy ass potatoes too. Bf waited for a drink over 10mins-acually it was more like 17mins, before she noticed after running by  3 times, then quite a few more mins to get the drink. Then she takes my bread plate with my knive and fork on it; wait I need those! I grab my utensils and now have no where to put them. Great ! 2 forks are on the table, I assume one for the app and meal and the other for dessert. God knows one isn't for a salad.  What's with no soup or salad for dinner? We spend $22.00 per plate and get this bread, that's all crust.  Then I had to ask if I get vegetables with my meal, most don't get veggies with the meal.    So I get it, they want you to order an appetizer...we order crab cakes, menu says ""plenty to share"" cough cough** bullshit!  3 crab cakes the size of maybe an inch & half.    After the appetizer we wait and wait and wait. We look at each other and we're like: shouldn't we be eatting something? Umm yeah,soup or salad would be nice. We went home hungry.  And what's with the  tacky Waitress  wearing white button down top with fluorescent pink bra showing through. Management should have sent her home to change. Everyone else is dresses with their white blouse and black pants. Ridiculous. Won't be back.    Our waitress and hostess were pleasant, can't blame them for cheesecake factory food."
Michelle P.,"Milwaukee, WI",16,12,2,4.0,12/29/2017,"A friend and I decided to go to Cheesecake factory because she had a gift card. Service was probably the best service ive experienced. Food was good. Drinks were tasty but very weak. I had banana cream cheesecake, yum!!!! Very good experience besides the weak drinks and it was pretty pricey. I will definately be back"
Leigh A.,"Milwaukee, WI",120,478,130,1.0,9/1/2017,"Will never go here again. Ordered food for delivery last night. Skinnylicious shrimp tacos, factory burger and a slice of Godiva cheesecake. Delivery was a mess. Food was cold and soggy. Worst part, I found a black curly hair in my tacos (we all have straight blond hair). GROSS. I'm waiting for reply from delivery and restaurant. See photos."
Brian M.,"West Bend, WI",23,137,212,3.0,12/7/2016,"I have been here many times and find as far as the entrees go the Cheesecake Factory is beginning to lose some of its luster.  For those familiar, this location is basically part of the Mayfair mall experience.   As such, one should expect quite a crowd which is generally pushed closely together to squeeze in as many as possible.  Thus it's rather noisy and not a destination for a quiet date or intimate dinner.  My recent Monday lunch (1ish) visit found my group of 4 having to wait 10 minutes for an open table.  We of course were seated in the bank of tables where others are within 18"" on both sides. Cheesecake Factory would be so much better served rearranging the seating format to really focus on the experience of the visit.  It really is an interesting theme and looking around at the interior architecture is part of the experience.  I have always been a fan of the classic burger and never been dissapointed until this visit. I ordered my meal medium & I'm fairly certain the meat was still mooing.  That's on me for not complaining but I hate doing so because there's always that fear of what's happening to the food when sent back. Two of our group received their meals a full five minutes before the other two.  The waitress even came to ask how we were enjoying the first few bites to correcting her question to how half of our group was enjoying their first bites.  We were not offered drink refills at any point during our meal The cheesecake as always was excellent.  Seems Cheesecake Factory is getting a little complacent in preparation & service.  We will return because the Mall is right there & the cheesecake remains awesome but it's time to reboot their game a bit."
Carly M.,"Milwaukee, WI",5,58,282,5.0,6/11/2017,"I have been to a number of Cheesecake Factory locations and have never been disappointed. The food is always flavorful, the portions are large, and service is spot on. The avocado egg rolls are the best appetizer and I have tried over ten types of Cheesecake and I always wish I would have ordered the Oreo cheesecake! I like to support non-chain establishments but around the mall, it's all chains!"
Alisha M.,"Kenosha, WI",47,156,437,4.0,3/21/2017,"Of course they have the best Cheesecake around and it is a great restaurant for birthdays and families; however, food is hit or miss. They have a great small plate and appetizer selection; however, when it comes to the main course it can be hit or miss. Opt for sweet potato fries over the regular fries. Kobe over any of the other beef and pass on the fish/chips. I love the Multigrain bread they offer to start."
Jeffrey C.,"Racine, WI",0,5,,3.0,12/24/2017,"Food was great as usual. Every time we come back it seems that the service gets worse. We waited over 10 minutes before we were even greeted. Then we had to wait an additional 10 minutes for our drinks. My girlfriend addressed the issue with a manager who provided us a free appetizer. Another issue was we weren't provided with knifes to butter our bread. It seems the service is slipping, but thank you to the manager the provided us with an appetizer."
Janelle C.,"Greendale, WI",0,6,14,4.0,9/28/2017,"Consistently great-tasting food! Everything is a little bit overpriced but servings are fairly large. I recommend the bacon bacon burger - what a treat when I really want to splurge on calories! Their fries are also cooked to a crispy gold perfection. My mom is a picky eater and she actually quite enjoys the grilled fish tacos! They provide complimentary bread and butter, and would recommend just asking for the wheat bread because it's soft and delicious, while the white bread can be crusty. Service has also been consistently good at this location! Side note: their menu is quite large and can be overwhelming."
Tom R.,"Milford, CT",0,29,,3.0,11/19/2017,"OK - if you've ever been to Cheesecake Factory, you're well aware that they're pretty consistent no matter what city you're in. Decent food, nothing fancy. This review is about a horrible drink experience at the Mayfair Mall location Wauwatosa, WI. I ordered  classic Margarita but what I was served was indescribably bad. I still can't figure out what the horrible taste in that drink was! I sent it back and opted to play it safe with a bottled beer which to 30 minutes to to brought over (after I had to ask the waiter what was up). Clearly, a bartender who was in need of retraining."
Manan S.,"Woodridge, IL",0,2,,1.0,10/12/2017,"The worst experience of my life. They had LIVE WORMS in brockley, i took out my staff for a lunch and we had ordered daily specials. After a while the lunch came and after taking a few bites, my friend noticed there were live worms in brockley, and we started checking we all saw the same. The food ordered by all of us had mostly brockley in it and we had to stop. Called the manager and he apologized but due to the sheer shock, we decided to walk out of the restaurant, to never come back again. I still can't fathom the fact that a restaurant that charges this premium of a price, can't take care of basic food etiquette. Of course never going back again and I don't think this guys are going to learn but others had to be warned."
Dolores J.,"Milwaukee, WI",2,17,,5.0,9/17/2017,Usually restaurant chains aren't my thing but I decided to try this place after a friend wanted to go.  This place is delish and the service was spectacular!  I had the steak hibachi.  Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Avocado egg rolls. Mmmmmmmmmmmmm.  I will definitely be back.
vielesha d.,"Milwaukee, WI",24,89,89,4.0,11/14/2016,Cheesecake is probably one of my favorite chain restaurant because they have a wide range of everything from drinks to food. I've never had bad service at this location and my food has always came out fairly quickly. This time I ordered the buffalo blasts which were okay. The dish was mostly just crust and you couldn't really taste the filling so I probably won't order that again or recommend. Other then that my service and drink was fine.
Jessie P.,"Franklin, WI",0,29,2,1.0,10/3/2017,Very poor service.  Horrible bartenders and service at the bar. I know would see that the food is good the most people go out for the atmosphere and I would have to say this is what are the pores atmospheres that I have seen in a very long time. If I wanted to hear people whine and cry I would have just stayed home. We go out to escape have an experience this was a horrifying experience. Pretty sure the cheesecake factory has lost my business this was the 2nd time I have gone back hoping things would get better but it has not.
Jacob J.,"Sussex, WI",33,33,8,2.0,3/19/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory the the choice for dinner for my mothers birthday day and it was average. The prices were high for a average meal. Tonight I had the crispy chicken sliders and the fried Mac and cheese. The crispy chicken was okay. Wasn't anything special, but salty. The fries where just like any other. The deep fried Mac and cheese was kinda burnt on the top and bottom but overall good. The Cheesecake is great but expensive.  The service was slow and waitress took forever too get out food and check. It was pathetic how long the Cheesecake took to get even tho I could see the counter from my table.  Maybe I'll come back some day."
Ingrid C.,"Cleveland, OH",34,53,37,1.0,9/9/2017,My food was so dry that I sent it back. I was told that I should ask for fresh chicken when I order a chicken sandwich. Wtf? Why wouldn't it be fresh? Overpriced! Staff was rude and the food took forever to come out. Nothing was competed on my bill. Won't be back!
Sheng C.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,8,5,2.0,8/6/2017,"Ok, so this is a late post.  Went to eat here last week for a late dinner. It was quite disappointing and sad.  Only good thing, well two good things, our waitress, and getting seated right away.  The food wasn't any better from the last time we decided to eat here. I ordered a combo of steak Diane, medium done, and salmon that came with a mashed potatoes side. The steak Diane was well done. =/ The fish was border line dry. The potatoes took up half my plate and was kind of, hmm, what's the word, gummy-ish and dry,  like there wasn't enough butter and someone over whipped or mixed them. =/ My husband ordered the gumbo. It was ok. A bit aqueous I think. I thought it would be thicker in consistency, but then again, I never had gumbo before. It had taste though. The portions were ok, besides my side of potatoes. We probably won't be going there for another year or so."
Neal E.,"Haymarket, VA",1169,4360,28768,2.0,12/10/2015,"Had lunch here today. Ordered their Mexican Chicken vegetable soup. They should advertise this as a stew or something else, it had so little broth in it - not sure how they can market it as a soup. It was predominantly carrots and tortilla strips - very little chicken and even less broth. Will have to try some other menu items in the future - everyone else in my group enjoyed their lunch."
Danny R.,"Milwaukee, WI",68,4,1,4.0,3/16/2017,"I've been here two times, and both times I've come out satisfied. Very friendly staff. White Chocolate Raspberry & Ultimate Red Velvet are a success in my book."
Jesse M.,"New Berlin, WI",0,6,,5.0,8/20/2017,"Had a fantastic meal, portions are huge. The pricing is fair and whatever you do don't leave without cheesecake."
Jose M.,"Dubuque, IA",6,5,2,3.0,7/24/2017,Good food...but extremely slow service. The last two times I've been there...both early dinner(5ish)...it took almost an hour took after we ordered to get our food.
T W.,"Sheboygan, WI",0,3,,2.0,10/27/2017,"We had lunch here today. My chicken salad sandwich was a disgusting mess. Too much mayo on and in the sandwich, to much butter or whatever they use on the bread to grill it. I ate one of the 3 pieces of the sandwich. I told our server the sandwich was bad. Her response was I'll tell the kitchen. No offer to remove it from our bill or get me another sandwich. The food here is pricy and I doubt I will return to this restaurant or location."
Sara K.,"Englewood, CO",7,43,240,4.0,5/26/2016,"I went here for my birthday with my Mom because I wanted cheesecake. We sat outside on the patio which was nice except the chairs they have outside left a waffle pattern on my legs. I sat on my napkin and asked the waitress for another one and she forgot, however I think she was in the weeds-she appeared to have several tables. I ordered the eggplant parm which is served with a side of pesto angel hair and I ordered a side of mashed potatoes. My Mom ordered the Chicken Alfredo which looked delicious. Both items were very tasty. I forgot how BIG the servings are and it looked like we didn't eat anything by looking at our plates. Our server made up for the napkin mishap by serving my cheese cake on a festive plate and sang ""Happy Birthday"" with the some help of some other servers. She was very nice and the experience was most enjoyable."
Kari B.,"Milwaukee, WI",54,250,430,3.0,6/19/2016,Sometimes too many choices is a bad thing and that is how I often feel about the menu at Cheesecake Factory. The food is all over the board..I guess it's good when people in the group want different kinds of food. The food is just average; nothing really stands out. The portions are huge and can easily be shared. But really the only reason I come here is for their low carb cheesecake. It doesn't taste low carb and satisfies the cheesecake craving and if you share even lower carbs!
Avery A.,"Kenosha, WI",21,3,3,5.0,1/3/2017,Love the food!! Great service!!  I always get a simple Caesar salad so I have room for dessert. I usually can't even eat half of the salad given the fact that the portion sizes are HUGE.  Have tried other entrees as well and they are good too! Great burgers! Definitely a great place to go if you're in the area and I would say it's affordable for the food and experience.
Jill O.,"Lansing, IL",69,375,949,4.0,7/8/2015,"This is one of the better Cheesecake Factory locations that I have been too. Cheesecake is one of my favorite desserts, so it comes as no surprise that this chain is one of my favorites. I really like the design of this one. It has high ceilings and a welcoming decor. The staff was really nice. Our waiter was really friendly and made great small talk- he noticed my girlfriend's Batman shirt and they excitedly talked about upcoming movies and TV shows. It's a little pricey, but the portions are massive. If you eat like I do, you pretty much get two meals- one portion that you finish at the restaurant and another that you get to enjoy later at home. The menu is so long, but it offers something for everyone. From Chinese food to burgers, to pasta, and everything in between. They also have the best free bread at the start of the meal- seriously, the honey wheat brown bread is one of the reasons to go.  I went with my girlfriend and her mother. My girlfriend ordered the Factory combination, with Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon with mashed potatoes. She was really happy with everything on her plate. Her mother and I both had Chicken Madeira, and it was amazing. The sauce is the perfect amount of sweetness, and the portion is massive. Her mom loved it too, it was her first time having it and she was really pleased. Naturally, we had to get dessert. Mother got the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. It's layers of cheesecake, fudge cake, and truffle cream. It looked outrageously decadent, and she said it was a good life choice. The girlfriend ordered the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake, and loved it enough that she only ate half so she could enjoy the rest later. I ordered the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake and oh my god, it might be my new favorite. It was so rich and creamy."
Gary G.,"Burlington, WI",4,129,12,5.0,9/17/2016,"This place has the fastest service and low wait time, when it's not swamped with shoppers (understandable).  Try to go during the week if you want immediate seating.  Excellent menu and the cheesecake second to none!  I highly recommend the Shepard's Pie!"
Jeffrey J.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,51,,2.0,6/8/2017,"Overpriced,  overrated,  slow service. Food was ok at best. 12 dollars for a burger. Went here because of a gift card given to us. It will be unlikely we would return here."
Andy K.,"Milwaukee, WI",118,342,1031,4.0,8/4/2015,Lost in the menu Vast selection of items with huge portions. Service is always attentive. Prices are reasonable for what you're getting. Oh so yummy cheesecake!
Meredith M.,"Auburn, AL",97,195,334,3.0,1/25/2016,"I was torn on how many stars to give.... Food = 4, price = 3, service = 2. A group of 4 of us went for lunch on a Saturday and it was packed to the brim. Being right next to the mall, this was no surprise. We were told that the wait would be 20ish minutes and it ended up being closer to 30, which is not anyone's fault since it is impossible to predict, but the counter staff seemed annoyed to take our name in the first place. Once we got seated, we ordered the spring rolls with soy sauce instead of the peanut sauce due to dietary restrictions and we ordered drinks at the same time. The appetizer came without the soy sauce and our drinks came 15 minutes later (also, I asked for no straws and it came with it anyway). *sigh* The food though was good (the veggie burger and salad were actually much better than expected and had great flavor, even though it was a little small). Our server was kind but for the price, nothing about the experience was too impressive except for we split one of the peanut butter cheesecake flavors($8) and ok I admit, that was pretty dang good... I think that Cheesecake Factories in general are overrated but I guess if you have a thick wallet and are in no rush whatsoever, once in awhile might be a nice treat but nothing to go out of your way for."
Karrie K.,"Milwaukee, WI",38,18,14,2.0,6/6/2017,"Rediculously slow and inattentive service. Meal was cold and mediocre at best. The Godiva sundae was the only thing good about this visit. Hopefully this was just a fluke, as I've really never had a problem here before."
Linda C.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,8,,4.0,12/3/2016,"Had the infamous baked macaroni and cheese. Really good!  Our waitress was so nice.  She did a great job.  The only thing I can't comprehend is a glass of wine was $10.  A mixed drink was 12.00. Our bill was very expensive for just two people. The cheesecake was also amazing!  Would return.  This time, with more money!"
Kyara M.,"Austin, TX",53,143,151,3.0,2/23/2015,"Busy and intimidating! Came here on a Friday night around dinner time. We were on our way to see a MKE Bucks game and wanted to eat before tip off. Even with having my boyfriends mom who lives close to the restaurant to go early to grab a table since they didn't take RSVP, we waited about a hour to be seated. Granted, it was 5 of us and there were more people coming through the door then there were people leaving. It was totally intimidating to walk through the door and seeing the hungry patrons wait for their buzzer to sound stating their table was ready. It was absolutely packed.  Finally, we are seated and given warm bread and butter. Menu is gigantic. Almost overwhelming. You don't know where to start and where to end. The nice thing is there is much variety meaning you will find something that interest you. It's impossible not too. Even on a busy night, service was pretty good and food came out at a reasonable time. Portion sizes are huge. You won't have room for cheesecake!  If you haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory, it is worth the drive, wait and price which isn't very bad. I would place them better than ""A-OK"" but the lack of seating is problematic. They really need to expand by maybe adding an upstairs dining area or bar to create more room."
Alana B.,"Milwaukee, WI",32,3,,5.0,5/1/2017,"The food was amazing and I am very happy with my overall experience. I am a very, very picky person and she got the order down the best way possible. I order the same thing every time I go and this time they decided to put asparagus in my pasta (which should not be there), I said something about it and, they took it, made it over, and included a dessert of my choice because of the inconvenience.  There were two different people that apologized for the mishap and I felt that they were genuine in their apology. I thanked everyone, and I would recommend it to everyone."
Mike M.,"Pewaukee, WI",0,9,2,1.0,12/6/2016,"Probably the worst dining experience ever.  That is what my wife and in-laws told me when they returned from dinner last week.  It was dark, they couldn't read the menus, music was blasting at one point and the kids meals either were undercooked(mini corn dogs) and kids sliders were nothing more than plain.  When my wife asked her waitress who went missing at times if they could adjust the lighting she was told no! We will give our $100.00 to Maggianos instead next time!"
A M.,"Milwaukee, WI",5,50,30,4.0,6/28/2016,"The happy hour specials are a must!  Don't be fooled, the portions are quite large and the drinks fairly strong. Great HH spot!"
Marcia T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1006,202,394,5.0,1/1/2016,Amanda our server is awesome. She knew everything on that menu. Really appreciate that. Miso Salmon with mash potatoes and their avocado rolls are sensational!! Thank you Amanda!
Jef K.,"Vernon Hills, IL",15,18,23,5.0,7/20/2016,Evan says that at the cheesecake factory there is the best kids pizza EVER! You would really like to try it! - Evan age 6
Toska S.,"Coral Gables, FL",6,51,18,5.0,1/15/2017,"Visited this location while visiting family and friends. They were beyond crowded and the wait was 2 hours. Lucked up and got a high Table in the bar. My night wasn't going well at all. I'm sure it was because of the extreme busyness the restaurant was experiencing. I had the pleasure of meeting the GM Andy and what a wonderful, professional, kind, man of integrity. He was great! He turned our frown into a smile, not only by making good on our messed up order but by gracing us with heartfelt conversation. He loves his soon to be fiancé and 9 month old daughter. What an awesome family GM man!"
Rita H.,"Germantown, WI",13,7,1,2.0,4/26/2017,Haven't been here in awhile.  Won't be back again.  Two in our party and our table was next to two other parties within a foot on each side of us   We certainly heard about their birthdays kids illness.  No thanks not spending cheesecake prices where you hear every ones conversation and you can't hold one yourself.  All they want to do is pack in the people to make more money.  So disappointed in my date night.
