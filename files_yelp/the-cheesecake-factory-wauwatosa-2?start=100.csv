Annie S.,"Wauwatosa, WI",32,32,16,3.0,11/15/2014,"It's the standard Cheesecake Factory. Long menu, a little of everything. I do love their white chicken chili. There's frequently a wait at dinner time. I recommend skipping the cheesecake and getting the strawberry shortcake. It's delicious. Also, it's huge so a good idea if you're sharing."
Matthew F.,"Oak Creek, WI",52,24,1,4.0,3/26/2015,"I love the menu...so varied.  I do not like the wait nor the close proximity to other patrons, but have worked my way around that.  I like the bar area seating and usually there isn't a wait for those seats."
Angela G.,"Milwaukee, WI",15,63,4,2.0,4/13/2013,"Too much stuff on the menu and I've never had anything that was truly great or I'd up the stars.  Portions are disgustingly huge. Who can eat this??? Yeah you can carry it out after you're finished but I came for dinner, not 2 dinners! And it's never as good the next day...it just isn't.  The one huge peeve I have is they have no kids menu.  I don't mind not having a kid menu in an upscale restaurant but you're a corporate restaurant next to a MALL. Get over yourself. I don't want to pay 9 dollars for a cheese sandwich that is too big for 3 adults to eat so that my son can have some food.  Only reason it's getting 2 stars is that the cheesecake is actually pretty good. Service is hit or miss."
Duke L.,"Brookfield, WI",92,82,36,4.0,2/20/2015,"I love their variety of menu. They have pretty much everything. Their portion is large so you can share dishes easily. I usually order pasta there. I like Louisiana pasta and their shrimp scampi is excellent. If you also have room for desert, their cheese cakes are outstanding. My favorite is banana creme cheese cake. I highly recommend anyone there."
Tiffany R.,"Groton, CT",31,25,17,5.0,6/1/2014,"Amazingly good!! A bit on the expensive side, but well worth it. Our waiter, Tiffany was very sweet and so happy and polite. My boyfriend and I both ordered the lunch portion of the fetuccini Alfredo and a Godiva Cheesecake at the end. Everything was so good! The restaurant was very clean and tidy as well at the staff. I hate it when I go into a restaurant and the waiters/waitresses are in dirty uniforms."
Lisa A.,"Milwaukee, WI",246,594,972,4.0,3/1/2013,"Had we had cheesecake factories back in the 90s in Wisconsin, my teenage mallrat self woulda so been all ""oh my god"" over the whimsical, vaguely Victorian interior and fancy schmancy salads and fusion cuisine.  Since it arrived a little later in my life I'm always sort of like ""oh, this is kinda cute"".  It IS a little pricey here, and the food is probably only a step up from olive garden, but I still like it here. The menu has everything under the sun and then some.  Our service the other night was really really really good.  We split a piece of cheesecake and when we asked for the bill to be split, our waitress split the price of the cheesecake 3 ways. Nice!  Our only suggestion? A cheesecake sampler please and thank you! So difficult to decide on one kind with like 40 flavors!  Also, weirdly the bar area is really cute here.  They have a lot of foo foo drinks here and a happy hour there. It looked like there were a lot of dates going on in the area. So dudes, two things that make a girl really happy? Liquor and cheesecake."
Ba R.,"Evanston, IL",163,66,185,2.0,10/4/2014,"It's fine, for a chain, I guess. The menu is huge, with a hilariously-large number of categories.  Also, there are ads in the menu. That's not okay."
Cathy S.,"Aurora, IL",8,20,,2.0,7/8/2014,"I have never had the chance to eat here. Went with a group they told us an hour. There was a section open that would have seated all of us, but we got the feeling they didn't want to bother with us. Too bad. Again I didn't get to eat here. We went to Maggianos. They seated us ASAP when we walked in."
Sarah E.,"Madison, WI",1,56,1,4.0,10/4/2014,"Good food. Expensive but generous servings. But honestly, eat somewhere else and then come here for cheesecake, it's delicious and what they are named for."
Jesse J.,"New York, NY",0,3,,1.0,2/14/2015,So my girlfriend went out on Valentine's Day (I wasn't with her because I'm in Boston) to get herself a slice of cheese cake because she deserves it. This cheese cake factory told her it would be a 15 minute wait so she orders the slice of cheese cake... 30 minutes pass and it hasn't come yet so they ask how much longer it would be. But they say we have no record of you placing an order and it will be a 45 minute wait for a slice of cheese cake now. So my perfectly deserving girlfriend was deprived of the wonders of a slice of cheese cake. I would not have my valentine treated in such a manner.
Stephanie M.,"Milwaukee, WI",75,4,4,4.0,11/24/2014,Love this place! Everything I've tried has been great! It is a recurring place for my husband and I! The prices are great and so much for your money!
Tony J.,"Milwaukee, WI",5,151,1,2.0,12/19/2014,"Well I didn't actually get to try a piece of cheesecake after our meal but I may go back for a piece, someday. I've been to that cafe de lux (or something like that) in Chicago that is owned by these guys & it's basically the same story.  The place is obviously very massive & very dim inside. It's mostly all about fluff, the food is mediocre.  They pack the people in here & they must serve thousands every day.   The service was great after they took us to the wrong table in the beginning.  Also, the woman patron next to us was complaining about not getting her artichoke, that was a bit annoying but understandable.   Me and my daughter both got burgers & a side of green beans.  The burgers were good & quite big but a bit overpriced. Fries were blah, not even as good as Ore-Ida. Also the green beans were nearly $5 for a tiny portion.  Some of the seating here is quite odd, they put you right next to other parties at some of the tables, that's a tad annoying.   Menu is very massive, everybody should be able to find something if you can read in dim lighting. As I said before prices are a bit high for Denny's type food.   I may only go back for the cheesecake, eventually"
L B.,"Neshkoro, WI",0,3,,2.0,1/18/2016,"I did not have a good experience at this location , I ordered the mushroom Swiss burger , with no onions and no mayo, it came with both and was very greasy . By the time the waitress came back I told her , .. She offered to make a new one but by then I had scraped off the onions and mayo . I told her to tell the cook what they did . No other mention was made of it , no offer to discount it or anything . Way overpriced and not good customer service ."
Scott C.,"Madison, WI",25,2,,5.0,11/9/2013,The cheesecake Factory in Milwaukee was awesome!! Love everything about it . Look forward to going back and eating there again this week.
Nicholas P.,"Elm Grove, WI",131,67,2,2.0,6/8/2012,"Honestly, the food is like Applebees at 4x the price.  I've had rude staff insult me directly, and the place is generally so packed full of people, it takes forever to get a table plus a day to get your food.  I don't know why people are so fascinated with this place. The cheesecake is good for carrying out though. LOL"
Nina N.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,407,1100,3.0,8/4/2014,"I've been to a lot of Cheesecake Factorys but this none just fell short of the service and the quality of food, the white bread they brought out was different from all the other ones that I have been to, and the inside was refrigerated cold while the outside of the bread was hot, second it took a VERY long time for our order to get ready, and at the end although by accident the waitress spilled he container of balsamic vinegar all over our iPad mini and although the iPad was fine the case was ruined and other than apologies they didn't even bother to offer a desert or something to make up for the cost of the case that now has to be replaced. I'm sure we would have declined anyways but it's the type of service that puts you above the rest. So overall a blah experience"
Amanda L.,"Pasadena, CA",99,56,21,3.0,1/16/2013,"I mean...it's Cheesecake Factory....if you've been to one, you've basically been to all of them.  The menu is massive and cluttered with ads, it's pretty inside, they have a lot of cheesecake...blah blah blah. You all know this. I'm writing this, though, because I've been to this location twice in the past week while visiting family ...and let's be honest, there are not too many places to have a nice dinner around these parts. So I figure...why not? Our first experience: It was Sunday night and the restaurant was dead....as dead as anything that has ever died. We were sat in a little corner and a few times I felt like we were forgotten about.  We ordered the Boston House Salad and the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich. We decided we'd just share both items...and thank goodness we did...HUGE portions. The salad was very good and the sandwich was awesome. Only thing I didn't like was the roasted peppers...they kind of over powered the entire thing.  The bread was pretty cold and hard too :/ Second visit: We came with another couple and it was a little bit busier this time. We were still seated right away and our waitress was very sweet...although very spacey. She took a long time to bring anything at all. We had to ask for the bread and for refills multiple times.  My boyfriend and I ordered the same combo...and it was MUCH better this time. We also ordered the sandwich without the peppers so that was a huge plus. The cheese on the sandwich was more melty and delicious and overall...just a better meal.  The other couple ordered the Salisbury Steak (yeah, I dunno why that was ordered either...huge joke of the night haha) and the Shrimp Pasta. Both of them were very happy with their choices.  The bread was also much better this time around. I'll assume this is because it was busier...but still...make the effort to serve fresh food to all of the guests. My big complaint from this night was the fact that our waitress took so long to come pick up my credit card, we had to flag down another employee to take care of it. It was seriously about 15 minutes!!  So...all things considered...3 stars. I do like the fact that even though this location is at a mall...it's detached from the mall. Makes it feel a bit nicer than most other locations. RECOMMENDATION!! Try the Mint Green Iced Tea (Sweetened)....SO GOOD."
Lacey B.,"Milwaukee, WI",43,70,,4.0,2/10/2012,"If you can't find something you like from a menu this big, then perhaps eating isn't for you. Observations: -The portions are huge and the prices reflect such. -This location (at Mayfair) is always busy. As are every Cheesecake Factory location. -The complimentary bread is delish. -When you are finally seated, you may end up at one of the table in the long ""row."" Dining this way is not private, intimate, romantic, etc. I wish ALL restaurants would do away with this interior design choice. NO customers like it. -I have never ordered a meal that I didn't like. Although, several times my entree has come out of the kitchen miss-prepared and needed to be sent back. I blame individual servers and/or kitchen staff, and not the restaurant chain as a whole. -Don't go to the Cheesecake Factory if you're dieting. Calorie counts are high.  -One piece of cheesecake is enough for two grown adults."
Jon H.,"Houston, TX",58,259,40,4.0,5/9/2012,"I don't care what people think, I love The CF. Thousands of food options with HUGE serving sizes (it's about two meals in one), free bread, reasonably priced (it's not McDonald's cheap, but what is?!), my wife loves the cheesecake, and a good open atmosphere. You normally have a little wait time to get seated, but oh well.  If you want an above average dining experience without any fancy frills, I would go here."
Gina B.,"Milwaukee, WI",76,358,147,3.0,1/17/2012,"I have been to the Cheescake Factory twice now and this review is a blend of both experiences.  First time - horrible experience.  Long wait time, about 40 minutes longer than quoted and the food was a sloppy mess.  After spending $30 for two burgers for lunch, I vowed I would never return. More recent experience - still long wait time and the hostess really doesn't know the meaning of 25 minutes when it is more like an hour that you wait.  The menu is huge, just absolutely huge.  It's like reading a book.  Many selections.  The prices are still ridiculous but I have to say that I loved what I had this time and thought it was a really good value for the money.  Chicken Di Pana is very good.  I was surprised when they brought my plate out and it looked like it was a dinner for two. Our waitress was super friendly and the service was great, couldn't ask for better. My friend treated me and my son because she had some gift cards and even with $50 worth, I paid another $25 toward the bill - this was for Lunch!  So yes, the prices are on the high end. Always packed, long waits, high prices, good quality (at least what I had) and HUGE portions.   The cheesecake..... ehh, wasn't a big fan.  Ironic hey!"
