Kamni G.,"Jacksonville, FL",364,358,160,1.0,12/7/2009,"So I am still a little angry so lets keep this short: 1.Had to wait for a server  2.Corn fritters gooey in the middle, not cooked 3.Manager came when we didnt ask for one and apolgized. Had them remade. 4.Corn fritters came again ,undercooked again manager came and apologized. We didnt we didnt want it and continued to wait for our food. 5. The Navajo says its bread is pan fried but it was way too greasy. The inside was more bland than a salad. The chicken was cooked well but had no salt or anything on it. 6. Crabcake burger ? Decent, best tasting thing all night . 7.Fries too salty. Can see salt on every single one. 8.They gave us free dessert and took fritters off our bill. I still didnt recover from this experience. Overall: unhappy"
Jerry S.,"Brighton, MI",0,22,,2.0,10/23/2015,"I've been to several cheesecake factories across the US and have always had a good meal with very good service.  This location, however, had some service issues.  I waited 15 mins for a waiter to come to my table after I sat but no one approached me.  I went back to the hostess and explained what happened.  She apologized but was not able to come up with a resolution.  One of the other waiters heard me tell my story and said, ""come with me and i'll sit you in my section and i'll be your waiter"".  It was a good save on his part and he treated me very well.  I may give this another try....."
Sandy P.,"Milwaukee, WI",60,47,6,3.0,10/21/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is one of those go-to chains that is typically reliable for a decent meal. After my visit last night I am not so sure I will return anytime soon. An old favorite, the Eggplant Sandwich has been watered down by removing the unique Indian Fry Bread and the well grilled veggies. What is left is a boring bun, a flavorless aioli concotion, veggies overcooked to mush and smothered in so much greasy cheese, I literally didnt eat it. My dining partner was happy with her meal. Our cheesecake was ok, but not great."
Lisa B.,"Milwaukee, WI",9,3,,2.0,2/9/2016,"I was very disappointed on my birthday today after eating here.   The music was so loud and they seat you at such tiny tables right in the laps it feels like of those on either side of you.   At the end where they're supposed to give you a free piece of birthday desert, they took my cheesecake that I had ordered to go and put a candle in it for us to share.   I paid $8 for a smaller piece of cheesecake that was supposed to be packed in a box to take with me.   Instead, the container was opened with a burning candle in it and I ended up going home with a half eaten dessert which I paid for.   When I asked for compensation they said that it wasn't how they do things.   Yet the people sitting across from us received their free desert.    It would have been nice to at least be given some kind of free certificate for another piece of cheesecake down the line but I guess my business and my birthday was not very important to them so they won't be getting any of my money in the future.   I will also be spreading the word to friends and family."
May B.,"San Jose, CA",107,271,58,4.0,4/6/2010,"I went there last night with a medium-large group, did not have to wait to get seated, our server was pretty good (minus the part where she couldn't open a wine bottle and had another server do it) - she came back many times to check up on us and made sure our drinks were refilled.  All of our food came out really quick and everyone at our table enjoyed their food - I tried more than just my own and I liked it all. I usually am too full to order cheesecake - but I have had it before - a slice is usually enough for at least 2 people. I usually order the plainer types of cheesecake - mainly because I like the simple taste of cheesecake and don't like it drowned out in chocolate and extra ingredients - and they make their cheesecake pretty well. I've been to this location a couple times now, never had a problem. Yes they have a very large menu, but it's also a chain that has to cater to a large crowd. Get over it people. And why would you go to a place like this to order a burger and fries or a sandwich? Silly if you ask me. And portion size - yea they are large, but hardly any larger than most restaurant chains. And honestly people, lets not exaggerate, it's not so large that you have enough for ""the next three days"" or enough to ""feed a family of four""...well unless no one in your family ever eats."
Jennifer E.,"New Berlin, WI",1,8,,5.0,8/13/2014,"Fantastic happy hour, extensive menu, amazing food (the corn tamale cakes are scruptious!!) and friendly staff.  Every time I order, my food is completely accurate--which trust me, I am the one who substitutes like ten things on a salad.  Definitely my go to place!"
Rachel N.,"Lafayette, IN",0,41,7,2.0,5/2/2014,"I had gumbo, while my companion had a pasta dish. I thoroughly enjoyed my dish, however the pasta was lacking. We had a short wait, but it was normal considering it's a popular place on Saturdays. I would recommend to the staff to clean their sticky tables. Ours was sticky, and the staff did not clean the other tables in between customers. I would not recommend the Cheesecake Factory if you want to talk with your dining companion. We were placed on the tables with chairs on one side and the bench on the other. The young boy on one side of us kept kicking the benches, crawling around, and actually kicked my companion before they finally left. We were relieved before the waitress replaced them with an even group. I prefer to not be part of the conversation of the tables less than a foot on either side of me."
Mit L.,"Wales, WI",10,59,80,4.0,3/8/2012,"Typically the fish taco's are fantastic, this time the corn tortilla was soggy and kept falling apart. The flavors were all there.  Mmm. Mm m. Strawberry lemonade topped it off. If you are super hungry get the shepherds pie!"
Michael S.,"Milwaukee, WI",115,182,322,3.0,7/17/2013,"Everyone knows cf is a chain and the perils and pitfalls  associated with that.  my wife had a chicken stuffed enchilada with delicious cornbread.  It was zesty and flavorful and fully satisfying.  My dish was the pasta ragu with gemelli pasta.  Beautiful shape for a pasta, I wish more places served it.  It was cooked perfectly.  The sauce was good but kind of thin and I would have liked a bit more of it.  Overall it was kind of salty but not too overwhelmingly so.  Service was great and I would definitely stop again."
Kristen H.,"Chicago, IL",42,117,1,5.0,7/15/2013,"I could write and write for years about how much I love The Cheesecake Factory. I don't even like cheesecake, but I can't get enough of theirs. Everytime I go there is always something new to get, and I probably have had about seventy-five percent of the menu sometime in my lifetime and can not remember a dish tasting bad. My favorite over all these years is still the avocado egg rolls. Their drinks are great, and they actually know how to make a daiquiri. They are pricey, but it is worth it."
Alex R.,"Milwaukee, WI",1,9,,4.0,10/7/2012,"They have one of the biggest menus I have seen.  I have been here two times. I've always been very, very happy with their cheesecake. I think they have the best cheesecake I have ever had.  I also enjoyed the appetizers/starters.  The first time I went, for my main course I got a caesar salad without the chicken. The portion size was huge! I only finished 1/4 of it, and I wasn't so happy with it.  The second time, for my main course I got a grilled cheese with cheddar cheese. I didn't like it very much. I don't recommend getting a grilled cheese with cheddar. A different cheese most likely would have been good. It was also a very large sandwich.  I think this place is very good. I just have bad luck in picking the right main course."
Michelle T.,"Saginaw, MI",0,1,,3.0,8/9/2014,"Awesome atmosphere, beautiful desserts, excellent waiter.  However, my cheesesteak was very, very fatty and after picking out most of the meat, I asked to return it.  They did bring me another dish of my choice, but the manager seemed annoyed and they didn't charge me for my original dish, but offered no compensation for my inconvenience.  Being an owner of two restaurants, this makes no sense to me.  Mistakes happen, yes, but make sure the customer is satisfied.  We were planning to come back for breakfast because the menu is so amazing, but now I'm reticent to do so."
M. E.,"Milwaukee, WI",6,20,1,2.0,4/13/2014,"Are you kidding me with this place? Can you say...OVERRATED?  Tonight we were celebrating my mom's birthday. Plus one...seated right away, although apparently it's not part of the Hostesses job to give a shit because when she pulled out the chair at the table we were being seated at...the floor was disgusting with the previous patrons meal on the floor. The table had a sticky residue on it. FYI...Customers don't mind having to wait for a clean table. Our waitress was great and not overbearing. Hubby and I had the Chicken & Biscuits...DISGUSTING...it was basically an overpriced plate of Chicken Pot pie. It consisted of mashed potatoes on top of that pieces of bland chicken breasts, then on top of that a flat layer of biscuit. This was surrounded by burned and bland vegetables. It was also lukewarm! My mom did enjoy her Crab Bites appetizer & Orange Chicken( a plate clearly for two)which I was glad of. Next on the list the uncomfortable feeling and looks everyone has when sitting extremely close to strangers. The atmosphere was good along with the decorum. As far as food goes this is not on the top of my list actually I would be just fine with not eating here again. I gave it 2 stars because my mom enjoyed her appetizer and dinner."
Chris S.,"Walker's Point, Milwaukee, WI",53,9,4,4.0,10/13/2013,Everything in their menu is great! I love going on Sunday breakfast and getting the eggs Benedict. The food is great and so is the staff. Love coming here every week!
Melissa B.,"Milwaukee, WI",1,15,,5.0,12/3/2013,I can't believe this place wasn't on Yelp for gluten free!! Many options! Oh and yeah...sweet potato fries.. AWESOME!
Dana K.,"Franklin, WI",0,2,,1.0,1/24/2015,"Struggling to give one star.  Waitress was the worst ever.  Never checked on us, didn't bring any refills. Asked 3 times for salad dressing that was missing and still never got it.  Waited 1 hour for food.  Couple sat next to us and got food within 10 minutes so it was obviously a waitress issue.  At the end finally found the manager Mike to complain about her.  He said he was replacing and the only thing that saved the night for others was we did see her walking towards the parking lot when we left.  Manager Mike was nice but we had already paid cash for our food and we're now late for a movie so we just wanted to go.  Hopefully the service improved for others after we left.  Will have to go to the other location next time."
Derrick S.,"Edgewater, Miami, FL",122,272,707,3.0,11/13/2012,"I come here a couple times a yar when ever I am summoned to Milwaukee for meetings/trainings. I really love the warm setting, cozy booths and curtains that you can pull to close your booth-- Food wise they what they are suppose to and expected!"
Geoffrey R.,"Milwaukee, WI",47,100,5,3.0,4/26/2013,"It's cheescake factory, what else do you expect. Just stay away at peak hours, or you will be trampled by babies and teens."
Diann G.,"Racine, WI",0,4,,4.0,12/6/2014,"Had a great lunch today, food was awesome, the Miso Salmon was cooked PERFECT."
C L.,"Appleton, WI",0,8,,3.0,11/2/2013,"Pagers not working and we didn't hear our party's name ( even though we were sitting about eight feet away), so after being quoted a 50 minute wait, we eventually get seated after an hour and ten minutes. We get seated and after being somewhat rushed, I ordered a drink and it didn't come till another person ordered a drink later. Our meals come rather quickly (something good for once), my girl's meal had a hair in it (it was a pasta dish). We did get that entree taken off the bill though.  Overall, a dissapointing experience from a place that usually excels."
