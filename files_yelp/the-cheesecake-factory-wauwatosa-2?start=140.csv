Regina V.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,11,,4.0,5/1/2013,"Salmon salad.  Glass of Cabernet.  Cheesecake does it well every time I'm in.  You actually get better service on a weekend, when they have more people on.  Weeknights have fewer customers, way fewer servers.  Service can be hit or miss, but the great food makes up for it.  Outdoor seating lets you look at a parking lot, I'll pass if I'm eating.  Just wine with friends, yes."
Richard S.,"De Soto, WI",1115,588,13,4.0,10/14/2009,"My first review as a Yelp Elite! I don't think I've ever seen a bigger menu. 18 pages! I actually thought I wouldn't like the place because it is your typical huge chain I usually avoid, but I actually had a pretty good experience here. I stopped in for lunch and decided to try a couple of their small plate items. I had the Asparagus Salad and the Wild Mushroom Flatbread Pizza.  Both dishes were better than I expected. The salad was fresh and bright with a nice lemon vinaigrette and lots of shaved Parmesan. The Pizza had a nice crisp crust, lots of earthy mushrooms and just a touch of garlic. The best bite of the day was when I put some of the salad on the pizza itself. The lemon from the dressing really brought out the flavor of the mushrooms. Along with the food I had a surprisingly well made Pineapple Mojito. My server was polite and friendly and the restaurant is very Wheelchair Accessible. As I was leaving, I realized that I had actually gone to the Cheesecake Factory and not ordered Cheesecake! So I guess there has to be a next time. Kind of like leaving your jacket at a date's house."
James S.,"Milwaukee, WI",2,7,,5.0,7/1/2012,"We enjoyed a delightful brunch, as we arrived at opening (10 a.m.), so it was relaxing in the rotunda area, although some took advantage of the patio seating. Our waitress, Kristin, was personable & efficient. Our favorites include their French toast Napolean, with (the best!) strawberries, pecans & chantlilly cream( haven't found better french toast anywhere), & tasty lemon-ricotta pancakes with strawberries. Yum..thanks to Chef Mike. It was nice that the manager,John, stopped by, probably to make sure we could get out of the booth after eating all that food!  Did I mention you get warm bread before your meal? He also explained their new Skinnylicious menu.. maybe THAT was a hint!"
Bryan C.,"Girard, OH",44,191,3,4.0,8/1/2010,I took my family for lunch and did not have to wait. I had the herb crusted salmon. This was the first meal I had at the Cheesecake Factory that I was not really impressed. Still... a great place to eat. The server was friendly and our food was at our table in almost no time at all. The cheesecake made up for my meal :)  I tried the new Reese's cake. It was very good. I still prefer either Adam's or Snickers.
Stephen R.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,24,,3.0,2/26/2014,"ok. manager and staff are awesome! food is good. cheesecake good but I think overrated. (maggianos is better) and although the menu is large we have been there many time and are now running out of stuff to pick and are bored. the bread they give you while you wait is good, always warm and fresh. fave food: fried mac and cheese(appetizer) BBQ Pulled Pork, Chicken Madeira dinner and ANY soup is delish!"
Kathy G.,"Oak Creek, WI",36,238,1,1.0,8/18/2009,"Is this where the fat people go to get fatter? Sandwiches coated in butter than toasted to make a nice greasy mess. Although I do think Olive Garden has them beat (since OG's pasta dishes are actually 14 servings), the serving sizes are more then enough to feed a family of four.  I've only been there twice, and the quality is high, but the service is terrible. And the prices are outrageous, of course since it's so much food, maybe someone would call that value. But I do not want to eat the same stuff from the doggie bag for the next three days, so no thanks."
Emily A.,"Nashville, TN",94,166,5,2.0,8/3/2009,"Cheesecake factory is lame.  That being said I don't like cheese cake so my review is on everything else! Plus:  There's 18 pages (at least) of food on the menu.  So everyone is bound to find something. Minus:  None of it's very good.  Mostly mediocre. Service is always sub-standard, and restaurant layout is just strange."
Cmh H.,"Omaha, NE",9,105,3,4.0,6/20/2010,"This restaurant is very large, noisy (bad acoustics) and typically quite busy. Wonderful dishes such as chicken madeira, jambalaya  and shepherd's pie. Love their chopped salad. I intend to try many more dishes as we return. The cheesecakes are creamy and flavorful...so sinful. We both love the Red Velvet Cheesecake and the servings are huge, so you may be able to split a dessert. Good thing this is not next door!"
Deb F.,"New Berlin, WI",2,29,9,3.0,7/6/2011,"I've eaten here a few times recently, due to my craving for chocolate and/or cheesecake, and my love of sitting outside on mild summer nights.  The menu is huge, for both food items and cheesecake flavors.  Some things I've tried are the Avocado Rolls...yumm, and the Cuban Sandwich, which I was pleasantly surprised with, and the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, and the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake.  The cheesecake slices are huge. Eat half, take the rest home...or you'll be hurtin'."
Katie K.,"Clarksville, TN",1,33,,5.0,7/4/2011,"This place is amazing.  The food was SO good.  The portions were pretty large and we had leftovers for a couple days!  The desserts are really yummy, I couldn't stop eating them.  They also treated my 9 month (at the time) son like a king.  They brought him his own little tray of bread and a sliced banana!  His eyes lit up and I honestly though that was the neatest thing a resturant could do. We will be going back in the future!"
steve k.,"Naperville, IL",26,11,,4.0,1/25/2015,the fried calamari was the best i can remember ever having... so tender it was ridiculous.  i have to figure out how they did that and try it at home.
Justin E.,"Mequon, WI",26,149,202,3.0,2/16/2011,"My wife and I have been a fan of the cheesecake factory in the past but were quite turned off by this experience. Valentine's day late lunch is apparently not the time to go unless you are OK with the bus staff sweeping around your feet while you are eating and OK with them loudly clanking plates and silverware around as they clear and set tables. It took away completely from the peaceful atmosphere that we have experienced in the past. Food was good, pricing was as expected, service was good. I will return but will avoid slow times for fear that post lunch clean up will interfere with my meal."
Tonya C.,"Vienna, VA",27,181,27,5.0,7/19/2006,"For a nationwide chain, I have to say I am impressed with the quality of the food and the ambiance of this outlet in particular. It's a little more up-scale/pricey than what you'd think for a chain as well. In fact, for my birthday recently, my husband and I decided on a return visit for a late-night tapas and dessert style celebration, since the ambiance allows for romantic conversations in secluded booths--with or without liquor being served. The main impetus for our return: Their fantastic hot spinach and cheese dip. The chips seem to be freshly made and somehow not greasy at all. Since we were focused on appetizers, we also got the Thai lettuce wraps, the firecracker salmon rolls, and the fire-roasted fresh artichokes. I'm a *huge* artichoke fan, and I'd never had them done quite like this, with both a balsamic dressing brushed on and a creamy garlic-butter dip to dip the leaves into. I ate myself silly on these. In fact, you might think that four orders of appetizers would be just about right for two people. In the case of this restaurant, you'd be wrong. We took home left-overs of three of those orders... and I digested those artichokes for a whole day before I felt hungry again! Of course, the meaning behind the name can't be ignored either. The desserts available represent a huge variety of cheesecakes and other confections. I'm not big on cheesecakes myself, but their chocolate mousse cheesecake is not to be taken lightly--and I enjoyed the 2nd half of that serving a few days later too. Complimenting the great food are great drinks. If you want something amazingly light and refreshing, try the frozen iced raspberry or the peach smoothie. The wait staff are also a cut above. Courteous and solicitous without being invasive or overbearing, the two waiters we've had on our two visits were cut from the same mold and delivered our food and drinks efficiently but without rushing or crowding us."
N. S.,"Waukesha, WI",4,14,,5.0,9/18/2006,"Food so good you will come back time & time again!  I had Chicken Marsala & cream of chicken soup.  Both so rich & plentiful I feasted on leftovers the next day. I had the Tarimasu Cheesecake and it was enjoyed on day 2 as well Pricey, yes, but you get what you paid for & then some... Friendly staff, excellent accommodations.  A truly relaxing & FULL-filling experience!"
John M.,"Welwyn, United Kingdom",0,16,,4.0,5/17/2011,"I enjoyed lunch here yesterday, sitting at the bar.  Great Dirty Martinis then a huge bowl of spicy guacamole that was delicious.  They brought my main about 20 minutes too soon, but happily took it away when I said I was in no rush.  That main was chicken piccata (capers and lemon) with angel hair pasta (beautifully al dente) and it was freshly cooked when it was summoned finally.  Given the name of the joint (my first visit to the chain), I felt a pudding was in order, so chose the cheesecake/apple pie (don't recall actual title); this was OK (I'm not really pudding person) and made all the better when the very professional bartender (she had looked after me excellently throughout) poured me an apple flavoured martini.  This experience gave me a little confidence in (some) US chain restaurants and I would use this one again."
Jen Y.,"Winston-Salem, NC",77,502,271,2.0,1/12/2008,"Cheesecake is really good but food is only ok.  Being a vegetarian dining here is tough.  Even though the menu is huge, everything is loaded with meat.  I do love their salads until recently...  I go here with my sister (she's a cheesecake fanatic, and makes great ones herself).  The food is so big we order 1 salad and share it with the chicken on the side for her to eat (since they don't even offer a vegetarian salad option!).  This is so we have room for cheesecake.  Anyway, we had done this many times and could tell something was amiss.  Then we figured out, they never put any dressing on the salad!  Then for us to find our waitress again to tell her about this was crazy so once we did we had to wait longer for her to bring the dressing on the side which somehow didn't make it taste as good as when it's tossed on the salad.  Our cheesecake was good but now we can't picture going back since that was odd and the wait is always so long.  We have gone to get cheesecake to go which I think is the better option....  or even better would be to visit an actual local bakery instead of a chain that serves frozen stuff made who knows where."
Scott S.,"Oconomowoc, WI",1,26,,3.0,4/21/2010,"The food was pretty good - not excellent, but above average. If you are interested in eating a piece of carrot cake that is slightly larger than a Volvo, this is the place for you."
D J.,"Chicago, IL",19,266,,4.0,8/25/2007,"Maybe it was because I didn't have to wait in line for hours to get in, unlike the Chicago location, or maybe it was because the good food seemed great in a week where dining out, rather than having dinner brought in at work seemed like a luxury - but here goes, a chain restaurant in a Milwaukee suburb gets a 4 from me this time! High ceilings, nice lighting, friendly service (even though they ran out of mojitos at 9 pm) helped make it a pleasant dinner experience. The vegetarian version of the Navajo fry bread sandwich was rather nice and they have what must be the largest portion of Caesar salad I've seen - the leaves, croutons and cheese come piled rather high on a gigantic plate! Which doesn't leave much room for the incredible selection of cheesecake - but we still managed to cram in some delicious Godiva chocolate cheese cake. Great option for regular trips and predictable fare at a reasonable price."
nick a.,"San Francisco, CA",39,104,11,3.0,1/18/2007,"Decent, but loses one star for being a chain, and a half star for being in a mall.   The food is pretty good, if you like being overwealmed.  The cheescake is indeed fantastic!"
Jessica O.,"Milwaukee, WI",45,149,100,1.0,7/18/2008,"This restaurant sums up every bad cliche that chains have to offer. Instead of enticing customers with quality they overwhelm them with quantity in hopes that middle America doesn't know the difference. All the food here is bland and horrible. Service is mediocre to poor. As for the cheesecake I am on to that scam too. I've had it  number of times and I finally figured out what was ""off"" about it. While the cheesecake pieces are gigantic, just like everything else on their menu, it never struck me as good creamy cheesecake, the reason, this cheesecake is way sweeter than traditional cheesecake. It tastes like they poured a ton of sugar into their recipes. Again much like the huge portions they seem to think the sweeter the better but that is not the case. I have never found a single thing on this menu worth eating. While the prices are very reasonable I would much rather pay more for less food that actual has flavor.  If I could give this place a negative star I would."
