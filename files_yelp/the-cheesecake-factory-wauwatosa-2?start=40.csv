Estefanny O.,"Milwaukee, WI",11,3,,3.0,1/20/2017,"Cheesecake great as usual, but the alfredo was probably the worst Ive ever had. Honestly it's overpriced for its quality, the alfredo had way too much garlic and the chicken tasted like seafood."
Denise J.,"Onalaska, WI",106,12,,5.0,1/6/2017,"Never had take out taste so amazing!!!  Everything was prepared and looked so delicious.  I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwichand would highly recommend.  The guy at ""the bakery"" was outstanding.  I wish I woulda got his name.  Asked if I'd like the bread and butter that you normally get when eating in.  So I said sure! There were 2 different kind when I arrived home,  still warm,  and lil individual butters wrapped in tin foil as well, melted and still warm.  I am normally hard to please and for most of us its always easier to write about the bad stuff. But this deserved my time and comment.  Finished with the ever classic vanilla bean cheesecake.  Yummmyyyyy"
Peter K.,"Brookfield, WI",0,21,1,1.0,9/6/2016,"Wow this place has really gone down hill!! Had a salad, dressing on side at it seams it was pre-made and they just rinses off the dressing... Gross!!"
Linda k.,"Walnut Creek, CA",17,7,,1.0,1/3/2017,"I understand that rules are rules.  They only take reservation for dining between 2 and 5.  However when I talked to manager that we are a party of 10 with a person in advanced chemo they could not bend the rules by one hour.   I am not a person who takes advantage of situations but this was a critical dinner, where a wait among a crowd would be an issue.  Not to mention the tab on a ten top table. I guess rules are rules, can't fault a manager following a rule book with a myopic vision,so we have found another venue."
Tanya J.,"Milwaukee, WI",6,3,,1.0,1/1/2017,"The only thing good that came out of the visit was the wait time. Waited less than 30 minutes. People seated 10 minutes after us got their bread first. I asked for coke to drink the waiter brought diet coke twice. I ordered a cheeseburger very well done. The first time they brought it to the table it was still bloody. Sent it back, the 2nd time they brought it, it was still pink. Than they tried to double charge me for my buger because they messed it up"
Brittiany M.,"Milwaukee, WI",147,2,,1.0,12/23/2016,Tried to make a reservation for 23 people and although they do not take reservations I thought they would work with me. The rude manager pretty much told me for that many people it would be a 2+ hour wait and he could do nothing for us. I was about to make your restaurant probabaly a $1000 at the least and he pretty much pushed my business away. I love this place but just cause of the service I might never go back. What happened to treating people with respect and helping out? All I wanted was to surprise my boyfriend for a birthday dinner.
Mike M.,"Milwaukee, WI",1,12,,2.0,10/6/2016,"Do you mouth breathe and get excited for the McRib?  If so, you are going to love it."
Frank A.,"Pewaukee, WI",505,264,344,4.0,1/25/2015,"Dined in on a Tuesday around 6pm.  The place was hoping, but because we were only a table of two we got in right away. For appetizer we started out with the Fried Mac N Cheese Balls - delcious, but at a price, and I dont mean in the pocket book.  Looked up this baby on my fitnesspal app and they are over 300 calories per ball! For dinner I had the Pulled Pork Sandwich and my guest had a large dinner salad.  Both were very good For dessert I had the Oreo Cheesecake - yum!"
Jessie H.,"Menomonee Falls, WI",59,1,,1.0,10/28/2016,"Worst experience at this restaurant I have ever had. I will never go back. My boyfriend took me here for dinner. I've been to plenty of different locations and always had a nice time and good food but this was the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurants. First they sat us at a back 2 person table that I couldn't even get into without bumping other people. The waitress couldn't even hand us our bread because there was no room. We finally order and I get the shrimp and tomato pasta with basil etc. There was only a half serving of pasta, peas in my meal, and the shrimp was so over cooked I couldn't even bite it- the tails were black. And for 23.00 I got a lousy 5 shrimp. By the time the waitress returned my boyfriend had finished his meal and I had picked at mine enough to wear I just wanted to leave. I explained my displeasure and the waitress said she would get the manager. 15 minutes later the manager appears asking me if I wanted new shrimp and when I said no she just walked away. Meanwhile all this was going on the double date of two middle aged couples in the booth behind us had their phone lights on looking at their menus flashing in the eyes every few seconds enough for me and my boyfriend to say something to them twice and the waitress.  The waitress felt bad and gave us our cheesecake for free regardless of what her manager said and our meal will still 65.00.  The little things like our waitress never filling our water glass, or asking for a refill of drinks. Or not once checking on us till our dinner was over did not even compare to the other issues.  If you want a nice dinner. I beg you, don't go here. Spend your money someplace where it will matter and the staff cares. The cheesecake isn't even worth it."
Pradeep K.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,4,,5.0,10/23/2016,Celebrated my bday here ! The food was awesome and i didnt remember the server name exactly but he is so kind helped us alot with the menu.
Gretchen M.,"Traverse City, MI",0,33,13,1.0,12/27/2016,Second try at this restaurant and it was our second bust. First visit they forgot to make half of our tables' food and the second time it took 50 minutes to get the food after we ordered. Too long of a wait and too much of a hassle for mediocre food in an unclean restaurant.
Carla C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,79,128,2.0,5/22/2016,"This is the first time I have experienced a bad visit, we had to wait a long time for our food and when it was brought out it was very cold. The breakfast potatoes were very burnt and greasy. We had to send the food back twice because it was cold. Very disappointed today with the service."
Audrey G.,"Brookfield, WI",55,281,2242,3.0,2/18/2016,The lunch portion is huge as well as the cup of soup. I would recommend getting lunch portions prior to 5 PM otherwise share dinner plates with others.
Charles F.,"Pewaukee, WI",77,134,94,2.0,8/9/2015,"I don't understand what people love about this place.  I've been here a couple of times and I always leave feeling this is just another applebees or whatever but more overpriced and with an oversized and confused menu of lots of average food. I can't say anything here is bad, nor is it good, everything left me thinking why would I pay that for that.  The service is always slow, and this location is always loud. Yep I'm done with the CCF and can't imagine anything short of the free lunch that brought me in this time bringing me back."
Dan L.,"Milwaukee, WI",66,205,175,4.0,8/1/2014,"Food for giants and an overwhelming number of cheesecakes for your pleasure.  I've been here a few times over the years, so here are my go-to dishes: -spicy chicken chipotle pasta -the club -their crispy beef dish (forgot the name) -white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake (hands down the best one) However, you can't really go wrong with any of the sandwich or salad options. If you get sore going through the enormous menu, just go with the spicy chicken chipotle pasta. It seems to be a consensus favorite.  The portions are extremely large, so if you can go for lunch, get the lunch sized portion. Otherwise, you may have some food to take home. Also, these large portions come with a comparable price tag...but the food is really good, especially for a chain.  Their shrimp and bacon club once showed up in a Yahoo! article as the unhealthiest sandwich in America. And yes, I've tried it because of that article. Not worth it."
Alex G.,"South Milwaukee, WI",9,37,52,5.0,5/23/2016,"One of my favorite restaurants!  And I must say the level of customer service here is well above my expectations.  The staff are very attentive, professional, and experienced in providing high quality hospitality.  I went here 2 weeks ago and it was great as usual.  Our waitress, Melissa, was very friendly and carried a nice conversation with our table too.  I tried the pineapple moscow mule...delicious and sizable too!  I got my favorite entree, Chicken Di Pana.  It never disappoints, but I always wish there was more of the white wine cream sauce.  The best thing about The Cheesecake Factory is there is something on the menu for everyone...it is more of a book than a menu after all!"
Shannon G.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,16,,2.0,3/22/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is literally my favorite restaurant in the world (yes I'm serious) so I think it's fair to say that I hold them to a high standard. That being said, this location lets me down consistently. It's like a bad boyfriend I keep going back to, hoping he'll change. There is pretty much always a wait (normally understandable since their food is so bomb) but the service continually disappoints. Cool guy waiters refuse to write your order cause they swear they'll remember it, but food comes out wrong every time. Drinks take 10+ minutes. Don't even bother asking for condiments after your plate comes out, it ain't happening. All things considered if one day you find yourself dying for some garlic farfalle pasta (as I often do), drive to the bayshore location."
Tiffany N.,"Valparaiso, IN",18,60,283,4.0,7/5/2016,"Although it can get a little pricey, the food is excellent. Staff was great and we all enjoyed our meals. My coworker commented that his salmon didn't have much flavor, but the rest of us had no complaints. We all took our cake to go and a couple of the pieces were incorrect and they weren't labeled at all so it was hard to determine what was who's. Other than that I would recommend this place!"
Ashley T.,"Milwaukee, WI",16,22,17,2.0,4/25/2016,"Overpriced, average tasting, incredibly unhealthy food in a cramped, loud environment."
Kari B.,"Kenosha, WI",112,11,5,1.0,4/10/2016,"The service was OUTSTANDING that's the ONLY reason I am giving it a one star...the food was less then impressive! The burger was ordered medium and came out well done and topped with all the things we didn't ask for...and then the veggie melt I ordered was missing ingredients that were listed on the menu and my second bite into was a mouth full of grit, I am guessing was from the kale. I did eat the side salad it came with but sent the sandwich with out a replacement and when the bill came...they charged me full price and no apologizes for the mishap! I have no issues paying, but it would have been nice for an acknowledgment of the mishap..."
