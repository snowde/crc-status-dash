Rosio Rosio H.,"Milwaukee, WI",324,1,,1.0,3/26/2016,Very disappointed with the service we had tonight. It seemed like our waiter was distracted. We ordered cheese cake to go it never takes longer than 15 mins however tonight it took them 30 mins while we waited I wanted to talk to a manager to ask why the long wait. The manger never showed up to our table. Very disappointed and won't be coming here to spend my hard earned money anytime soon.
Fa M.,"Berrien Springs, MI",1,22,7,4.0,12/25/2015,"Stephanie W. Great Service. I know it was a busy night, but thank you for checking on us, and getting eye contact. Sorry we didn't get to say goodbye. Your smile made the difference after an 11 hour drive."
Dewayne E.,"Milwaukee, WI",16,39,6,4.0,4/25/2016,"I was there with my family and we had a party of 7, which we got sat at a reasonable time. Our food did take a bit to come out,but with a party of 7 it should be expected.  When we received our food it was still hot and good."
Amber V.,"Fall River, WI",39,159,305,4.0,6/28/2014,"I ordered the basil, tomato, mozzarella flatbread. It was good but nothing special. For dessert I ordered the Adams peanut butter cup fudge ripple cheesecake. It was wonderful but I couldn't eat it all. Our server was very nice but something about her I found a little annoying but I can't figure out why. Prices seemed a little high but I kind of expected that."
Amber L.,"Milwaukee, WI",26,114,49,4.0,6/26/2015,It is a good chain restaurant. If my date is cheap (not often) this is a go-to. So much variety and their staff is professional.
Aubrey G.,"Milwaukee, WI",146,387,2234,5.0,6/11/2012,"First time here.  We had an outstanding meal and experience.  Arrived about 8:00 PM on Monday nite, 6/11/12.  Seated immediately with menus. A few empty tables, so we beat the rush.  Server showed up within a minute & took our cocktail order.  We were nit-picky on the order but, very soon thereafter, received our cocktails exactly as requested.  (Ten points for the server!) We ordered the combination ""Steak Diane""/salmon dinner, the sweet corn tamale cakes and the ""crispy artichoke.""  Steak was cooked medium rare as ordered; great flavor and very tender.  The sweet corn tamales were outstanding.... served with an in-house salsa of tomato, avocado,etc.... not sure, but SO good.  I was equivocal about getting the artichoke dish, but it was outstanding and a very unique dish that I will definitely order as an appetizer next time I'm here. Our server ""Veronike"" (correct spelling), was extremely professional; she complimented the excellent food to the nth degree.   Just an outstanding experience here, tonight."
Ben R.,"New Berlin, WI",19,9,17,3.0,1/19/2014,"3.5 stars actually, but I feel this deserves a breakdown for each category. The categories I will be rating are as I experienced them. The categories are parking, architecture, atmosphere, service, menu, drinks, appetizers, entrees, desserts and price. I believe it is important to note something before I start. This was my GF's birthday dinner for the two of us. I am unaware of birthday protocol but there was no singing, clapping or free dessert. I have been to restaurants cheaper and more expensive that have done it when I only mentioned the word ""Birthday"" OR when we didn't even mention it but they checked her ID for drinks and SAW it was her birthday! I could not take points off for this but it did not help it's rating case, whatsoever. Parking - 5 Architecture - 4 Atmosphere - 4  Service - 5  Menu - 3  Drinks - 1  Appetizers - 3 Entrees - 3 Desserts - 4 Price - 2"
Andrea L.,"Los Angeles, CA",284,90,279,4.0,6/5/2015,"Giant menu, giant portions...what more can the standard American ask for? Cheesecake has options fit for everybody including salads, sandwiches, pasta, fish, tacos and more. You can't go wrong by coming here. Cheesecake has been referred to as one of the nation's unhealthiest restaurant chains, and that comes to no surprise due to their rich flavors, big portions and something else...oh duh CHEESECAKE. Don't come here on a diet unless you have unwavering willpower because that display of heavenly desserts is almost impossible to pass up. Though they do have many salad options and a ""skinny"" menu. They start off with warm bread..so hard not to fill up on the chocolate wheat bread. My favorites include: - Spicy chicken chipotle pasta -Jambalaya pasta  -Chinese chicken salad -Santa Fe salad (that peanut cilantro vinaigrette though...nothing like it) -White chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake (my go-to order) -Dulce de leche cheesecake (a light, almost refreshing option) -Kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake (brownie bottom, not too rich though) It can get pretty pricey, but you're technically paying for 3 meals. If you come when the lunch portion is offered- get that because it will be enough to share. Expect over an hour wait for dinner on weekends. Also they give a free slice of cheesecake and sing on birthdays."
Erick B.,"Milwaukee, WI",36,76,48,4.0,5/22/2015,"Never can go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory. Probably one of the best restaurant chains around. So many different types of cuisine to choose from. Italian, Cajun, Vietnamese, British, American, and more.  Went for lunch and was incredibly impressed with the quality and amount of servers they had. Definitely prepared and organized. I tried the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta, oh boy. Really really filling and wonderful. Tasted the same when I warmed up some for dinner. Outdoor patio was really nice and much more quiet of a selection than inside."
Jennifer G.,"Sherman, TX",0,4,,4.0,5/7/2016,"We aren't huge fans of chain restaurants, but when we want dessert with our meal, and we both want different types of food, this is the place we go for - it's tried and true, and we have never had a bad experience.  Their menu is huge; it's a bit overwhelming, but it does offer something for everybody. We've been going to Cheesecake for years, and I've sampled something from every part of that menu. Their skinny menu is delicious, salads and sandwiches are always good, their (limited) mexican-ish options are tasty (I love the chicken tacos), and their pasta is always tasty. My boyfriend has tried just about every meat option, and his only complaint was with the filet mignon (it was fatty), and I told him to only order that cut of meat at an actual steak place (he didn't listen). My only complaint is their burgers - they aren't necessarily bad, I know a lot of people enjoy them, but I do not care for them at all. The cheesecakes are always delicious - my favorite is the apple strudel cheesecake! The s'mores cheesecake is also so so tasty. Seriously - even if you're stuffed, which you probably will be because their portions are huge - either get some cheesecake to go, or split a piece with your table. Just don't go to Cheesecake Factory without getting cheesecake!  We've never had bad service here. Sometimes service may be slow, but that has never bothered us. As long as our food gets to us fresh and hot, we are happy. I highly recommend going either before the dinner rush (like 3-4 pm), or after dinner (like 9 pm). If you go during a meal time on the weekend, there's a good chance you'll do some waiting. If you go anytime during a holiday (think Mother's or Father's day), you're going to do some serious waiting. Anyway, I recommend this place. It's a good meal, great dessert, and a good option when people have different tastes since the menu is so vast."
Chuck W.,"Racine, WI",6,59,7,4.0,3/7/2016,"We really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory. Greeted and seated immediately at 4:30 pm. Server (Jeremy) was impeccable. Ordered a beet and goat cheese appetizer. OMG! I thought my tongue was going to come out of my mouth and slap me on the back of the head for not trying this before! My wife ordered a veggie burger that while very tasty, fell apart while she was eating it. She had to use a knife and fork to eat it. Her meal came with the best tasting sweet potato fries we have ever had, yum yum! Our server comped the sandwich for us. I ordered the the thick pork chop.. It was equally as tasty. Came with a heaping mountain of mashed potatoes tasting oh so good. I swapped in asparagus instead of the standard veggies for a $1.00 more. Food was hot (temperature) and fresh."
Rick J.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,15,2,1.0,11/24/2015,Maybe just off their game. Bathroom was disgusting. Waited forever for our food even though we had no special requests. I had the White Chicken Chili that barely covered the bottom of the bowl.
Keaunis G.,"Greenfield, WI",373,103,2654,5.0,1/10/2014,The food and service are awesome! The servings are very generous and the cheesecakes are delicious! There are so many flavors of cheesecake that you are bound to find something that you will like.
Annie G.,"La Habra, CA",24,60,27,1.0,6/28/2014,"Our waitress took forever to take our order. More than thirty minutes. Our first order of drinks took over fifteen minutes to receive, she blamed the bartender. Our second drink order took another twenty plus minutes to receive, she said she just stared at the bartender. The restaurant was out of salmon, on a Thursday night... They brought our food and my to go order at the same time, no waitress to check and see if something was wrong. They forgot the two year old and three year olds food.  You always bring kids food first. The waitress blamed the cooks. Said it was wrong and nobody told her.  The food is not worth the price, and the service is lacking! It's one thing to make an adult wait for food, another to make two young children to wait, while all the adults have their food! This alone disgusts me! I cannot stand people who blame others and don't take responsibility. We barely saw the waitress all night!"
Raabz B.,"Milwaukee, WI",1,44,12,3.0,1/4/2015,"Good food. Place was busy. Server did a good job, though she was very busy. Tables are really small.. As in plates falling off the table... Overall it was a mediocre experience. Nothing extraordinary. Good place to go when you don't feel like cooking."
Zach O.,"Milwaukee, WI",65,199,15,4.0,1/2/2013,"As legendary connoisseurs of American style decadence, I'm sure you are all aware that The Cheesecake Factory is one of the worst restaurants for you.  The quality of the food is all right, but there's nothing amazing on the menu and the prices are unusually high for the average quality of the food.  While the interior is extremely nice, if you've seen one Cheesecake Factory you've seen them all. The bar area is always extremely nice with plenty of seating, the floor has a ton of room and a lot of tables feel relatively private, but a lot of the booth style seating can sometimes put you uncomfortably close to strangers.  The main reason I'm here is the RED VELVET CHEESECAKE. This cheesecake is so perfect I've been sitting here for 10 minutes trying to find the words to describe it...there are none.  There is no price too high or service too poor to make this cheesecake not worth the trip to the Cheesecake Factory."
Paul J.,"Wauwatosa, Milwaukee, WI",62,2,,2.0,7/19/2014,"We used to eat here fairly often, mainly takeout, but while the desserts were killer, the food was very inconsistent. Well, this week we did takeout there again and my memories were accurate. I ordered the corn tamales to share, the chicken and shrimp gumbo, and the Reese's  Peanut Butter & chocolate cheesecake.  The tamales were truly so-so, no kick to the sauce. It was the ""gumbo"" that was truly mediocre. Chicken - way overcooked; shrimp - overcooked, small... And not many. The ""spicy Cajun"" sauce was neither, and it was packed with tomatos (?!) It was more of a jambalaya, but not a great one. Having had the Coopers Hawk jambalaya earlier in the week, the factory suffered by comparison. It will be very hard to convince me to go back - unless it's just for dessert."
Ramsey B.,"Palos Hills, IL",399,538,21,5.0,11/10/2014,"A family favorite!  This particular Cheesecake Factory may be my family's preferred Cheesecake Factory.  The seating and service is excellent.  The food is prepared to perfection.  Great staff and very short wait time.  Highly recommend the enchiladas, tamale corn cakes, avocado egg rolls, for appetizers.  Every entrée is a great choice."
Tyler T.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,10,,3.0,2/6/2016,"Took my mom and grandma here for Mother's Day. That was a bad idea because everyone else had the same idea. They don't accept reservations, which is good and bad (that day it was bad). I tried to suggest going somewhere else, but we stuck out for the 1.5 hour wait... Filet Mignon was good and pretty quick once we had a place to sit. Waitress was very complimentary with our situation."
Sara C.,"Miami Beach, FL",1,17,1,4.0,1/30/2016,"Get a garbage can outside. Everyone stuffing everything you can think of in the flower pots. I brought in a water bottle to toss from my car, no garbage can outside. Worker inside gave me a disgusted look and took it. Get an outdoor garbage can.  Food and cheesecake always really good. Staff wasn't overly friendly but they did fine ."
