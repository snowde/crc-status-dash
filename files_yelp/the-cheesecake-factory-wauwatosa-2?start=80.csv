Milano B.,"Milwaukee, WI",215,5,,2.0,2/5/2016,"My experience tonight goes to show that not every location is created equal. After a 20-30 minute wait, we were finally seated.  We ordered an appetizer at least 15 minutes before we ordered our meal, maybe 10-15 minutes after ordering our meal, the entrees came. We asked about our appetizer and maybe 5 minutes later a manager came to apologize for the app not coming and that he'd comped it. I was thinking you better, we didn't get it. 10 minutes later our waitress who was as sweet as could be said our app was now ready and did we want to take it home with us, to which we replied no.  Dinner was underwhelming as the shrimp we ordered was extremely overdone and the gf pasta was undercooked. The only thing decent about this experience was our waitress was nice. I was thinking the manager might offer an additional incentive to return for the inconvenience of not getting part of our meal.  We've never experienced this at the Bayshore location. I know which one I will return to if I go back."
Hector J.,"Milwaukee, WI",7,6,5,4.0,8/17/2014,Iam a big fan of cheesecake so when I went I was really excited. I have tried a couple of their dishes. The first dish is the Louisiana pasta which is wonderful it's a little spicy but not to hot. Another dish I tried was the quesadillas which were ok they weren't bad and they were wonderful. I also tried their orange chicken which can be a little more saucy but overall it was great. My favorite part was the cheesecake I tried the strawberry cheese cake which was great. I also tried the chocolate cheese cake I'm not a huge chocolate fan but It was a great experience! I also love their bread.
Allie B.,"Sun Prairie, WI",2,29,2,1.0,9/7/2015,"At 230 in the afternoon 4 entrees should not take 50 minutes. Everything seemed really overpriced for what we actually got. Had multiple servers as well because ours went ""on break."" But our good took so long he came back at some point. Skip the meals and horrible service. Get cheesecake to go."
Jim L.,"Waukesha, WI",0,85,20,5.0,4/2/2015,"I'm pleasantly surprised when I eat at the Mayfair Cheesecake Factory. Last time, we got a few different appetizers and they were all good. We also split an order of Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps and they were the highlight, really good and unique. Service was pretty good and this was while they were extremely busy. The menu is impressively broad but every dish features fresh ingredients and is done just right. I can't imagine how they do the volume they do and maintain excellent food quality, so I will eat there more often and just enjoy it."
David W.,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",60,113,45,3.0,11/3/2015,"Everything is always so so.  They don't take reservations. So I ended up waiting 45 minutes for a table of 6.  The menu is vast and it's hard to decide what to get so I usually always get the same stuff and try other peoples entrees.  Calamari is good, lightly breaded, and tender. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta is always a good option. Flavorful and spicy.  Chicken Madeira was a little on the sweet side for me, but the chicken was very tender and pounded thin. Came with lots of mash potatoes to make you full and to make the plate look loaded.  Luau Salad was too sweet for my tastes, but presented well.  Baja Chicken Tacos could have used more flavor, but the tortillas were nice and soft. Not like the typical corn tortillas from the grocery store.  The cheesecake is always on point and soft and creamy.  Overall, it's hard to see what dishes they make the best because of the huge menu with all different types of cuisine, but a better dining experience than other chains restaurants like Olive Garden, Red Lobster, or Applebee's."
Jordan T.,"Eagle, WI",108,1,,5.0,12/10/2015,"My sister and I had dinner here tonight. Our server was Melissa and she was fantastic. She greeted us with a smile and suggested 2 drinks for us that were delicious. The Georgia Peach and a vodka lemonade type drink. We ordered the 4-cheese pasta and the Louisiana chicken pasta, 2 of our favorites. Both were amazing as usual. We were never in want for water or anything. Thank you Melissa for the great service!"
Shelly S.,"Milwaukee, WI",27,34,11,5.0,9/8/2015,"Really good cheesecake with a lot of different varieties. Also, the chicken Parmesan dish is to die for! It's pricey, so I only go there on rare occasions, but if you want to go, you should!"
Steve S.,"Chicago, IL",0,59,,5.0,10/4/2015,Awesome! went for lunch yesterday and all had entrees and soft drinks with one dessert and bill was $84.00 very good food and service.Our Server was Lela and she was really cool(good job) Not a big fan of the ones in Chicago.This one rocked.
Jennifer C.,"Milwaukee, WI",127,357,489,3.0,12/21/2012,"All I wanted to do was order curbside to go! I called the first time and was transferred to the bakery (I can only assume that it was the hostess that answered the phone). I sat on hold for 10 minutes - I hung up and called again. I explained that I was on hold for about 10 minutes just to order curbside to go. I was told that there were 2 people in the bakery and that the person who answered the phone would go let the 2 people in the bakery know that my phone call would be transferred. As I write this roughly 5 minutes later, I am still on hold.  Usually when I sit at the bar (or in the actual restaurant portion) to get my food, I haven't had any issue and I've gotten great service in a timely fashion.  My recommendations, don't order curb side to go. Go in the restaurant."
Pamela M.,"Milwaukee, WI",553,566,2562,4.0,12/12/2012,"Man, I sure wish that I would have gotten the Red Velvet Cheesecake... it was so perfect and not too sweet. Next time (if it's even still there). I really liked my lettuce wraps from here, they were SOOO good and so fun to eat!!  Some sort of bean chili w chicken wasn't too great. I don't like chicken on pizza and now in chili, either. It just isn't right. Was not exciting at all. But Red Velvet and Lettuce Wraps = awesome!"
Trev K.,"Germantown, WI",19,19,,3.0,5/20/2014,"The food at CF is always pretty decent but my complaints are with the waitstaff and ambiance. Tonight for example we arrived at 8:30PM to a restaurant that was about half full. The hostess could have gave us any of the half open table and booths. In my experience most people would prefer to sit by a window in a booth, she choose to seat us and one of there small tables in the far back as close as you can get to the kitchen.  In most places this would have not been an issue but CF is already one of the loudest restaurants too begin with, with its high vaulted ceilings the noises just travel. In this case I could barely talk to my wife over the noise of the kitchen staff putting away containers of silverware for the night. When our server was telling us the specials I had to ask him to repeat part of them twice because I could not hear him. Honestly, I usually do not care if a restaurant is lively and loud but this place is off the charts loud."
Mo K.,"Seattle, WA",121,47,11,4.0,6/20/2015,"Pretty spectacular desserts, and a huge selection all around. The Kahlua cheesecake was out of this world; definitely on the pricey side"
jt w.,"Milwaukee, WI",1,9,,1.0,10/6/2016,"This evening friends took me out for my birthday at the Cheesecake Factory at Mayfair. I asked waitress for another lemon. She did not hear me. Asked her again. Again, she did not hear me, so the 3rd time I said it louder thinking the music was loud. She then told me that I did not need to yell at her. I told her that I wasn't yelling, just said it louder because she could not hear me. Well, then began her attitude. She returned with the lemon on a stick and plopped it in my water and walked away. We waited for a ridiculous amount of time to order dessert. She asked my female friend first for her cheesecake order, then my male friend and walked away; she never looked at me nor asked me for my order. While she was still close to the table as she was walking away, I then asked her if I could have .... I went to talk to manager after I ordered cheesecake to discuss the misunderstanding. Manager discounted cheesecake, but it did not make up for the rudeness. NOT a Happy Birthday dinner. Loooong time before I go back there! Felt like I was back in school working with someone having a temper tantrum!"
Lisa W.,"Marion, IA",0,2,2,5.0,4/18/2016,"Loved our waitress, Alyssa, and the skinnylicious beef medallions! Who knew you could go reasonably low-cal at this restaurant?! Delish!"
Brad K.,"Seattle, WA",183,266,29,4.0,1/21/2015,Somewhat overpriced chain but fantastic cheesecake and most of their food tastes good.  Their happy hour has $5 apps that are great tasting and solid portion size.  Their beer menu is severely lacking tho.
Cheryl C.,"Fenton, MO",3,23,19,4.0,5/22/2015,"You can find all different flavors here- American, Italian, Mediterranean, Chinese, Vietnamese..etc.  It's one of the better franchise restaurant  and can easily please anyone picky eater. I brought out of town guests or Asian friends here often. This one has outdoor patio which are wonderful for the sunny days. Stand along heaters are available. The staffs in this one are super nice and very helpful. The only drawback is they don't take reservations but Bar area is  first come first serve.  Sunday Brunch (open at 10:00am) is  good and usually not crowed at all.  Kids menu has variety of choices as well. Cheesecakes are always good!!!"
Suzanne H.,"Waukesha, WI",0,3,2,3.0,10/28/2016,"Went for the first time on Thurs. night as party of 5 to celebrate a birthday. No reservation was accepted, but a not too bad 15 min. wait for table dispite the fact it was busy. Unfortunatly the service was S L O W. It took a very long time to recieve our drinks (server told us a couple bartenders had called in sick or something) Cosmo was very sour. Appitizers were good...crab artichoke dip and a mexican egg roll dish. My food order was totally mixed up however. I ordered the combo dinner, steak diane and herb crusted salmon which comes served with mashed potatoes. I asked if a vegetable was included and the server said he was pretty sure broccoli came with it. Cool. After a bit he returned to say he was told by the kitchen that ""no, veggies are not included.""  I said ok then i would like the side of glazed carrots with it..which on the menu description said glazed carrots with pecans. When food came, my dish had no potatoes, carrots in a brown sugar butter sauce (no pecans) and no herb crusted salmon, just plain salmon with ALOT of lemon on it. Unfortunately I am one of those who do not care for lemon on any fish. Later...much later when we finally saw our server again, he said he 'subbed' carrots for potatoes and he would go ahead and order a side of carrots again, this time with the pecans on it ( like the menu says) but he would have to charge extra for the side of carrots. Well I expected to be charged for the side from the beginning! I never said I didnt want my potatoes or the word 'sub' anything! And, i didn't even bring up the uncrusted, lemony salmon. Just an overall disappointment on my dish. Others seemed to enjoy the pasta dishes they ordered, however, after ordering another round of drinks, it took a half hour to get those (yes we had finished eating for the most part by the time they arrived), it ruined the experience. 3 cheesecake slices between the 5 of us and $235 bill plus (not well deserved) tip. :( ouch. I know our server was probebly busy, i've been there, but a smile and even a brief bit of intrest would have been welcomed. A bit pricy, good for the most part food, mediocre and slow service was our experience. Oh, and who doesn't like cheesecake? :)"
Joanna T.,"Wauwatosa, WI",416,2212,1021,2.0,5/17/2011,"You know the saying ""300 channels but there's nothing on""? The Cheesecake Factory menu is like that. It's something like 50 pages of junk I don't want to eat. From what I can tell they take a normal dish, add some sort of fusion-y spin to it and therefore make it completely gross.  We don't go here often because the food is both expensive and not good, but when we do venture in we are forced to wait. And wait. And wait. Maybe on principle, because there are always open tables. I will say that service has generally been good, with that whole fake cheerful ""oh, have you ever dined here?"" thing. No, but I have eaten in restaurants before so I think I can handle it...."
Mike P.,"Lake Geneva, WI",6,47,47,5.0,7/17/2015,Great cheesecake  the California cheese steak is very good  the cheesecake is a little  but it is worth every penny  Great place very busy worth the wait or take the cheesecake to go
Jen H.,"San Francisco, CA",199,400,1159,5.0,10/7/2014,"Yeah, that's right. I just gave 5 stars for a CF. I camped out at the bar after one of the crappiest of crap days, bartender was funny, kind, shared silly stories and never let my glass go empty.  Watching a game and winding down was just what the doctor ordered."
