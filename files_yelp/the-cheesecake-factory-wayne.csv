Cassy B.,"Kearny, NJ",200,59,102,5.0,12/29/2017,"I always have a good experience here! Be prepared to wait, there's always a crowd of people here. I personally think the food is worth it. That honey wheat bread, I just want a load to go please. So great.  My go to is their salads. The Santa Fe is ridiculously good if you like peanut dressing.  The staff is always polite, they're not rushing you but I always feel like eating and jetting because there's always such a long wait, I tend to feel bad."
Rich R.,"Roxbury Township, NJ",315,333,579,3.0,1/7/2018,"I'm a Cheesecake Factory fan.   Whether its Happy Hour, lunch or dinner I haven't been disappointed.    Like any other Cheesecake Factory there will be a wait if it is during peak hours.    After being seated bread is given along with your drink order.  The whole grain bread is. My favorite of the two they give you.   Some other reviewers have had issues with servers.  I never had an issue.  They have always been friendly, attentive and helpful.   I tried quite a few items on the menu and have not been disappointed.   I love all the cheesecakes here."
Linda S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,,2.0,12/25/2017,We were a party of seven. Some came from experiencing the Hackensack Cheesecake Factory and the Hackensack franchise was much better. Food came undercooked and cold in the middle. Grilled cheese was stale.  My salad came with no dressing. There was gum on the seat. Appetizers took more than 20 minutes to arrive. Incredibly slow.
Warren B.,"Morristown, NJ",1085,153,88,1.0,1/8/2018,"Fast casual spelled Performance Food Group. (Not a heavy hitter in quality food)  Certainly not a place I would venture inside. If the corral of baby carriages doesn't send you running for the door the sound of shrieking babies will.  There is nothing on the vapid menu that is made from scratch, but this won't matter to you because the Cheesecake Factory is just that.  Freezer to plate cooking.  If you care about the quality of your food, you'll pass.  If you don't care, this is your kind of place.  Feeding over dining.  Fail."
Fallon G.,"Wayne, NJ",335,176,298,4.0,11/25/2017,"I really love the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake!!! If you have room at the end of the meal, it's the perfect dessert! I also really enjoy the salmon. It's not amazing, but it's a satisfying dinner option.  My only complaint is that it's so dark inside and kind of hard to see the menu. I had to whip out the flashlight on my phone and felt like my father..."
Jameslee B.,"West Orange, NJ",0,5,4,4.0,12/29/2017,"I basically eat here with family and friends all the time and I never have a bad experience with the food or service. Majority of the time there is a 20-45minute wait which gives me an excuse to go browse in the mall. They give you a buzzer just in case you don't hear them call your party. When you're seated, the host/ hostess let's you get settled and your waiter/waitress comes to take your order.  I always ask for unlimited whole grain bread. That's my favorite. In addition to the bread I always order the egg roll sampler without the Tex Mex and Crispy Cuban and they always get the order right!"
Karina F.,"Perth Amboy, NJ",55,54,171,5.0,11/19/2017,"Saturday busy madness ! It was a 45 minute wait for a table of three. We found a spot in the bar area and decided to sit there to avoid the long wait. Didn't get our servers name but he was nice. Although the restaurant was busy, we received our food pretty fast. I took a chance ordering the Chicken Madeira but in the end, I was happy that I did. The dish was so delicious!!"
Elaine L.,"Boston, MA",179,75,277,4.0,12/20/2017,"Had the fish tacos here and they were excellent!! There's so many options on the menu so it's hard to choose from. The cheesecake is good, but pretty expensive. They don't take reservations here and there's usually a wait, so be aware of that before you go! Other than that, the Cheesecake Factory is a classic restaurant spot located in a convenient location in the Willowbrook Mall."
Brad V.,"Wyckoff, NJ",73,134,9,5.0,1/7/2018,"The average America is a jaggoff! This place is great, how can this place be 2 stars??  EVERYTHING here is great including the service. The Jamaican jerk shrimp is awesome!!"
Bea B.,"Kearny, NJ",51,13,12,2.0,1/7/2018,Came here for Sunday lunch today. Drinks and appetizers were decent. Everything was going fine until I came across a massive hair in my grilled steak tacos. This was very off-putting since it was my first time dining at this restaurant. I do not think I will be returning for a second time.
Derek Y.,"New York, NY",90,212,481,4.0,8/5/2017,"I guess service can really make it or break it for chain restaurants like The Cheesecake Factory, but I would still give four stars to this location simply because the good outweighed the bad by far. Yeah, our waitress wasn't stellar, but she wasn't absolutely horrible; she didn't come around more than twice and didn't check in during the meal except at the end. Still, the quality and portions were consistent (i.e., portions were huge)! The four of us ordered spaghetti and meatballs ($16.95), a caesar salad ($13.95), a grilled fresh salmon ($19.95), and an eggplant parm ($14.95). I can only speak to the taste of the spaghetti and meatballs since it's what I ordered, but the others seemed to enjoy their dishes. The dish was large, of course, so I'm happy. Additionally, the noodles were cooked al dente and were covered in a very aromatic sauce. The meatballs were definitely homemade and were a bit on the dryer/tougher side. Still, a nice dish at a reasonable price. Again, everything was very big. The salad may have been the largest salad I've ever seen. If you look at the photos you get a sense..."
Maria B.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",28,6,,1.0,1/7/2018,Hostesses are very rude they don't even acknowledge you and then took other names first I walked right out after the second person was taken before me. Never going back
Nicole B.,"Bloomfield, NJ",56,71,29,3.0,12/23/2017,"Seating was available almost immediately. Our server was okay. He tried to joke a little at the end but was not very attentive at the beginning and during the meal. I aske for water with no lemon and he brought it back with lemon. The water tasted a little funny to me so I got a strawberry lemonade with lite ice. When that came back it was a ton of ice. We asked for brown bread but he said there wasn't any at the time but he would bring it when it was ready. He winded up walking past out table to the one right next to us with the bread and I had to ask again. Finally, we got the bread and it was of course cold! Our appetizer and food came out and everything was fine. So the food was not the issue, it was more of the server. He could definitely step it up next time."
Viviana B.,"Bloomfield, NJ",102,53,75,5.0,1/3/2018,"I literally love coming here, especially when we can't decide on what we want to eat. No matter what you are in the mood for they have it! Sometimes the menu can become overwhelming but I promise you everything here is delicious. I aim to try something different every time. The service is always great also. Happy hour rocks here too! Great for date night, birthday celebration, happy dinners sad dinners. You can celebrate just about anything here. Try it!!"
Sue S.,"Hackensack, NJ",4,27,,2.0,1/1/2018,Why is this restaurant still in open for business? The food is bland and oily.  I would definitely not recommend.
Sara C.,"Wayne, NJ",165,214,95,4.0,1/22/2017,"I love the cheesecake factory!! I've been going to this location since I was I high school and have never had a meal I didn't like. The portions are insane, so come hungry. I always walk in with the intention of getting cheesecake for dessert but never make it between the delicious pumpernickel bread they serve and half of my entree. I always end up taking at least half of my plate home no matter if it's lunch or dinner. Drinks are also great, but a little on the pricier side (prices for drinks are not listed on the menu) and I've also had some pretty great appetizers there as well. The only downside is that they don't take reservations so I've had to wait 1.5-2 hours for a table (party of 2) for dinner. Lunch doesn't really seem to be a problem with wait times- usually sit down right away or wait a max of ten minutes. Great option if you're in the mall!"
Ali W.,"Lake Hiawatha, NJ",1740,102,435,3.0,3/16/2017,"I've been here on numerous occasions and my last visit was somewhat interesting. First off, I came here with my brother and a cousin of mine on a Wednesday for a quick lunch. We shared a fried mac & cheese, plus a basil tomato flatbread for an app, and both were delicious. Food came out fairly  quick, which is always a plus. Second course: I got the veggie burger with sweet potato fries, my brother got the veggie burger on the ""skinnylicious"" menu, which is just a smaller portion and comes with a side salad, and my cousin got chipotle pasta with shrimp. Food was good per usual. When I had my first bite of my veggie burger, I almost thought I was eating meat. They do a pretty good job with this dish I think. I had a bite of my cousin's food and I don't think CCF is a top option for a pasta dish but it wasn't bad. Overall, food was good.  Negatives: No names will be mentioned but the server I had seemed very unmotivated and careless. I guess because a few workers there know I used to work in a restaurant, they don't seem motivated to work for their tip because they know I will leave 20% or more every time. He/she had one or two other tables and spent a decent amount of time by the host stand conversing with co-workers. The table right next to us sat before us and left before us as well. Service was just really slow. My card was on the table for a good 10 minutes before the server noticed. Maybe it was just an off day so it really wasn't a big deal, but I can't ever stress enough how much service makes or breaks an experience at a restaurant.  One other thing I don't like about Cheesecake Factory in general is their huge menu. It can be a bit overwhelming for a person like me who's somewhat indecisive.  I will be back, but not anytime soon."
Nicole M.,"Hoboken, NJ",10,102,3,1.0,10/8/2017,"Okay for dinner / lunch, but will NEVER be back for brunch. Was there today around noon for brunch. The waitress and manager were dealing with an upset table if 8 next to us so it took us 15 minutes for anyone to even come take our order. Once our order was taken (an omelette and pancakes), it took an HOUR for the omelette to come out. They made some excuse about burning the pancakes and said they were making new ones. 20 minutes later, we told them to forget it and asked for the check. At this point, the manager came over and apologized and said he would remove the pancakes from the check. I told him ""considering we didn't get the pancakes, why WOULD they be on the check?"" After prompting him to do more by telling him removing something from the check that we didn't get anyway was not fixing the issue, he said he would take the omelette off as well. Oh wow, thank you so much kind sir  - I'm glad I came up with that brilliant idea. Also, our omelette was gross and clearly made with powdered eggs. The omelette came out as just that - on omelette. No breakfast potatoes, no toast.  I'll never again return here for breakfast / brunch."
Luz O.,"Secaucus, NJ",7,6,1,5.0,12/22/2017,"Yummy! I came in with a friend to grab lunch and I had amazing salads. They were super fresh and the staff were friendly! Reasonable prices as well, highly recommend."
Joe L.,"Caldwell, NJ",2,56,105,3.0,10/26/2017,We came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon and sat outside so it wasn't busy. This is a decent place to eat if your at the mall shopping. The menu has a wide selection. I ordered the lunch special meatloaf.  It was decent but a bit too salty and over spiced. The coffee was good. My friend had the chicken mango and avocado salad. It was good but it barely had any chicken. The service was friendly and decent.
Lynn O.,"Longboat Key, FL",1,27,7,4.0,8/13/2017,First time to Cheesecake Factory for brunch.. They open  @ 10 AM for brunch.. we were seated right away..  No wait at the cheesecake factory can you believe it!  We try to eat at different places on Sunday for brunch.. Cheesecake Factory only offers brunch on Sunday..  I'm not a fan of lemon anything.. but I did decide to try lemon ricotta pancakes topped with fresh strawberries. They were so delicious!  I would get them again in a heartbeat! My husband had create your own omelette. (you can put up to four ingredients in your create your own omelette).  The omelette comes with either tomato salad or breakfast potatoes..  He had goat cheese & avocado omelette & with breakfast potatoes and bread.. The omelette had a wonderful taste as well!  Would definitely recommend going for brunch! Not to mention it's so pretty inside Cheesecake Factory!  The service was very good too!
Jason K.,"Vancouver, WA",0,8,,5.0,9/22/2017,Update- excellent response from management of this store was fast and very much appreciated! Thank you for caring enough to make it right for me - this issue below was resolved to my complete satisfaction. @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ Very poor service! Left in a back corner of restaurant and forgotten about by our server- Super slow to take order- Food finally arrived- but was missing some components that we requested- but how would she know since she didn't come back after the meal was delivered by someone else- She finally checked on how our meal was after we were basically finished-  We told her about the missing items- and that's when service got even slower- Finally got check after an extended wait- We asked at front desk for a comment card.  Hostess was dumbfounded as to what we were asking about-we explained it was a little thing many restaurants have to get feedback about our experience- of course they didn't ask if we had had a problem-she ended up giving us a business card. By far the WORST EXPERIENCE we've ever had at Cheesecake Factory- Definitely wouldn't recommend this location
Samir S.,"Glen Rock, NJ",38,203,64,2.0,12/10/2017,"I have never giving a cheesecake factory such a low rating, been going to various ones across the country and food is consistently good until I came here.  The wait was typical, the staff was nice, but the food omg it just sucked.  We did the avocado rolls and they over cooked to the point the shells were burnt.  Okay we figured we would go with a safe bet of the chipolte chicken pasta.  But wow they seemed to use salsa or keptchup with honey instead of chipolte sause.  I have found the copy cat receipe and made this at home and it is not the same.  Just sad didn't expect that here"
Dom R.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",33,87,159,1.0,11/27/2017,This place really has gone down hill. The whole experience tonight was really sad. I had two different managers intervene and both times i was dissatisfied. They made our meals twice and the food was the same and it was horrible. It was watery and lack of taste. The chefs are better in hackensack.
Shane M.,"Daytona Beach, FL",71,29,,1.0,11/10/2017,"Well I believe a receptionist is the face of restaurants. A lady at this place is just incredibly bad. I do not know if she had a bad day or she is simply not good at multitasking. No smile, no greetings, clearly showing bad attitudes to customers... I feel sorry if she really had a bad day but didn't have rights to ruin our night out."
Andrea T.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",14,95,51,3.0,10/23/2017,"I like the restaurant and the service was good but the food was not the greatest. I had a chicken mango salad, which could have been good, but I hardly got mango or chicken with it, only the greens and the mango was frozen cold, plus I hardly tasted the dressing. My friend ordered meatloaf which was overspiced. Thx for the response, we will give it another try."
Camille G.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",98,238,548,4.0,7/28/2016,"Sat at the bar, James was my server. I ordered avocado toast, I was indecisive between pizza or avocado toast. James suggested avocado toast. So glad I ordered it. Made with fresh avocado, cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced radishes, and olive oil all on Italian crunchy bread. It has becomes my new fAvorite!!  Never been to Willowbrook Cheesecake Factory, it was very nice.  I would definitely sit at the bar again hopefully I'll get James again."
Megan W.,"Wayne, NJ",1,16,9,1.0,11/18/2017,"I have come here several times for dinner because my best friend loves it, but everything has always been mediocre. The last time I went, I got the superfood kale salad and it was so dry and bland. But the main reason why I'm giving it 1 star is because of the horrendous service here. It took 30 minutes for our waitress to come over to us and even let us order our drinks. Multiple waiters/waitresses walked past us and didn't once ask us if we were being helped. And then when our waitress did come, she was extremely rude. She brought us bread which we turned down and she rolled her eyes at us and continued to be annoyed and inattentive for the entirety of our duration there. Will never be going back now. Get better staff and train them on customer service."
Bryan M.,"Paramus, NJ",1,1,,1.0,10/7/2017,"Very slow service, still waiting for food. Offered bread once, beer was tapped out by the time anyone came to help."
Di S.,"Little Falls, NJ",0,5,,2.0,10/17/2017,"Terribly slow service. Waited 20 minutes for 4 glasses of wine. Waited another 40 minutes for 4  appetizers and 1 salad. Mini sliders inedible, too well done. Dessert was another 30 minutes for 1 slice of cheesecake for the table. Waiter was apologetic. But ridiculous service for a Tues.  Second and last time. Woefully understaffed at bar & dessert stations. I'm out."
Kimberly N.,"Miami, FL",31,38,25,2.0,7/21/2017,Okay so I love the Cheesecake Factory but girl idk what happened this night. The food was salty. The strawberry in my daiquiri was rotten. To top things off I ended my night with a major upset stomach  idk what happened. Disappointed and confused. The only reason I even gave two stars was because our waitress was so sweet. I don't think I'll be going back to this one anytime soon.
Lorraine M.,"Wayne, NJ",3,53,31,3.0,10/25/2017,"The food is marginal, but if you go with limited expectation, then you won't be disappointed.  The menu is big and they do offer a lot of selections.  On my most recent visit, I had the white chili with chicken. It was a little spicy, but that is just me. The portion was very small. Overall the food is okay.  I love the bread. It's always soft and tasty.  I hate how dark the restaurant is at night. You can't even read your menu. We saw many other patrons with their phone/flashlights out to read the menu."
A B.,"Manhattan, NY",8,211,53,5.0,5/25/2017,"First time eating at Cheesecake Factory... John, who waited patiently as we worked through their extensive menu made great recommendations.. The Avocado rolls were AMAZING! very cozy booth for two and clean restrooms....not sure about other locations but would highly recommend this one."
Nisha A.,"Paramus, NJ",0,2,,2.0,1/1/2018,My husband and I decided to go to cheesecake factory for brunch on Sunday. We have enjoyed the brunch at the Hackensack location many times and assumed we would have a similar experince at willowbrook. My husband ordered a burrito and I ordered a meatloaf. We also order a breakfast sandwich to share later. When our food arrived I noticed there was hair in the corn. The food was promptly returned to the kitchen. The manager stopped by to let us know that they take all sorts of measures to ensure this doesn't happen but sometimes this will still occur. She offered to recook the dish which we agreed to do. As we were waitng another server came by with a second breakfast sandwich which we told her was not ours. Once I received our meatloaf which took much longer than expected. Our waiter came by again to apologize. I had a few bites and decide it was time to go. Upon inspection of our bill we saw that the meatloaf was comped but a second sandwich had been charged. When we asked our server he said this was done to lower the bill. Apparently our discomfort was worth only 2 dollars. I say be warned as for us we will never ever go back.
Lee V.,"Kingsbridge, NY",23,38,51,2.0,8/31/2016,"Damn, Cheesecake in Wayne. I've given you ample chances. Compared to the other Factories, you failing, bruh.  I need you to make sure you don't burn the sweet potato fries and act like they are supposed to be charcoal. I realize it's weird to order breakfast at 9pm but I'm eating for two, me and my over the belt buddy. When I ask for an omelette with chicken, I didn't think I had to say I wanted the chicken IN the omelette but apparently I do. My bad. Water must be at a premium because I asked for two and only got one.  I need you to do better, Factory. Seriously, you expect me to give you flambé money but you feeding me Walmart tater tots. I gave you a two because the shorty that waited on us laughed at my jokes. Prolly cause I'm hilarious."
Krista C.,"Bloomfield, NJ",1352,69,217,5.0,2/13/2017,This is a great place to eat. All the food is well prepared and delicious. I try something new everytime and never have anything bad to say. Staff is excellent. The vibe is very nice and set in a dim lighting. Very personal. My favorite so far are the avacado egg rolls for sureeee. And the green sauce it comes with is so tasty!! Lovveeeee it !
Jenn M.,"Montclair, NJ",24,26,38,3.0,12/5/2016,Setting - The restaurant is your classic cheesecake restaurant a little bit on the smaller side. Service - The server today was ok but did not go above and beyond.  All specials were not mentioned nor were recommendations made to the menu. Food - The food was delayed but was served hot.  The fried cheese was great and the luau salad was a little dry but did the trick.
Scott V.,"Pequannock Township, NJ",439,262,582,3.0,1/18/2017,"Very VERY VERY busy Cheesecake factory.  My wife and I took in lunch here on MLK day and when we were leaving, the wait for 25+ deep for a table.  Wow...  Thank God we arrived prior to the rush which was about 11:15ish....  Popular restaurant I guess!! So, like I stated, we got there before the rush and were sat promptly and our server was soon at our table.  We ordered an app, stuffed mushrooms.  They were ""Ok"" and came with a serving of 6.  Very small and for 7 bucks, no bang for your buck with these.  We'll pass next time. The sauce the mushrooms were served in was really good tho, and good for bread dippin'.  For our meals, we ordered salads.  Mine was the Chinese Chicken Salad Dinner portion - Chicken Breast, Rice Noodles, Lettuce, Green Onions, Almonds, Crisp Wontons, Bean Sprouts, Orange and Sesame Seeds. Tossed in Our Special Chinese Plum Dressing.  Very big salad!!!!!  I couldn't even finish it and it was pretty good and flavorful.  My wife ordered the Sheila's Chicken and Avocado Salad Lunch portion - Grilled Chicken, Fresh Avocado, Mixed Greens, Crisp Tortilla Strips, Carrots, Cilantro and Cashews Tossed in a Citrus-Honey-Peanut Vinaigrette.  This was pretty damn big as well for the lunch portion!  My wife and I both thought the salads almost tasted the same and hers didn't come with that many Avocado's, and being that was in the title, you'd expect a few more.  So, why 3 stars?  Well, it took forever to get our appetizer - then our meals.  I think the server forgot to put in our order after taking it because it took almost 20 minutes to get our mushrooms... then another 20-25 mins for our Salads.  We then saw other tables get their food before us, and those tables were sat well after we arrived - and we ordered Salads.. how long does it take to make two salads?  It wasn't that busy when we arrived, so that's why I am pretty sure our order was forgotten about.  On an good note, our server was very polite and attentive.  I can't give 4 stars for the experience, but I'll chalk this up as a hiccup on her part.  I'd return for a meal as I saw other things that looked really good and man, the portions are huge!!!  The Factory is recommended."
Anika W.,"Somerset, NJ",40,9,4,1.0,9/20/2017,I eat frequently at different locations... today I had the worst experience... I ordered a side of spinach for my daughter and I... when I sampled it a big ass bug crawled out the spinach.... when the manager came instead of apologizing he said because I sat outside the bug was in my food... I eat here allllll the time never had this happen... on top of everything he was really rude in front of my daughter which resulted in me being irate and disrespectful... and put us out this establishment... so in my opinion stay away from places with bugs in the food today is 9/292017@950pm
Dom M.,"Denville, NJ",124,312,446,2.0,9/6/2016,The Big Bang Theory keeps putting this place in my head so I tried it for lunch. I had the chicken and shrimp dish over rice and - hard to believe - I didn't finish it. Flavorless. Then I tried the basic cheesecake and it was dry and kind of flat.  Expensive with uninspired one star food. Friendly servers added one star. All she wrote.  Can't recommend. But I'll still watch Big Bang!
