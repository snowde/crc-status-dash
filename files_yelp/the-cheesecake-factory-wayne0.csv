Ryan Z.,"Montclair, NJ",0,6,,1.0,1/26/2014,"Decided to the try the Cheesecake Factory.  Never been to one before and frankly will never bother again.  We sat down and the first thing I noticed was the filthy silverware and not just one piece but all of them.  How does it even make it to the table that way? Then I tried to open the menu and all the pages were stuck together.  The rest of my party also was treated to dirty menus.  Then I looked at the table and there was stuff stuck to it and it was sticky. DISGUSTING! We left without eating...It was the only time I left a restaurant because of how dirty it was.  If the front of the house is that bad, what are the parts like you can't see?"
Shiva M.,"Belleville, NJ",0,14,,1.0,10/3/2015,The front desk staff was incompetent and made us wait an additional 15 minutes after turning in the device because they forgot about us. I won't be going back no matter how good the food is. Service matters.
Cynthia D.,"Caldwell, NJ",0,4,,2.0,5/1/2014,"They get 2 stars because the food is always pretty tasty, but the customer service is beyond poor. On this warm and sunny my fiancé and I decide to dine al fresco here before heading into the mall for some shopping. We got seated right away, however we didn't get offered water for about 15minutes at which time our orders got taken...an hour has passed and still no food. Someone just came out to offer a complimentary appetizer and told us that our first dish got burned. I get it, they screwed up and are trying to recover for the mis-hap, but someone should've come over to us way before I had to flag down our waitress. Literally 15 different parties have been served and left and we're still here waiting... (Haven't walked out because my fiancé thinks it's dramatic and embarrassing). Horrible experience."
Alok D.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,2,,1.0,11/5/2015,"Worst experience ever! Very poor service. The server served me a dish with chicken even when I specifically asked for No Meat (I am pure vegetarian). When I complained, the manger did come and apologize and offered a free dessert. However, the server did not even care to apologize (all she said that it wasn't my fault), neither brought that free dessert which the manager promised for. Never going there again."
Houda E.,"Little Falls, NJ",0,1,,4.0,6/5/2016,"We've been going to this restaurant since the first week it opened, today however, 6/5, I came across the worst server I've ever met there. His name was Mike G. He was the slowest guy ever and took forever for everything. He took so long from the drinks to the complimentary bread. I asked simply for a coffee and it took forever. He walked very slow without a care in the world. When I finally got the coffee, first he slammed it on the table and then I asked him if he gave me cream or milk, he said to me, ""I don't know, you find out."" Wow!!!! So professional of him!!!! It was five of us and everyone in my table was unhappy with his attitude and rudeness. We didn't wanna make a scene there or address the issue. Also, I didn't want to give a bad image for the place because I figured its not the place's fault, just the server. Regardless of the service, they have excellent food and I've never had any problems with anyone there before."
Dominic J.,"Fairfield, NJ",0,2,,4.0,10/27/2015,The food is good and the cheesecake is amazing. The prices are a little high for what you get but over all it was good. I would recommend the Bacon Bacon Burger. It does get a little busy around dinner time so try and go a little early
Kayla B.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",0,18,1,5.0,8/4/2014,The food here was delicious ! I also had a margarita that was made just right . The Reese's cheesecake we took to go was AMAZING ! My new favorite place
Gilbert And Diane M.,"Bayonne, NJ",15,36,46,1.0,4/5/2014,"So, the last review is exactly what I sent in an e-mail to the Cheesecake Factory corporate. I did receive a call from the manager in a day or so, he apologized and asked me again what I ordered and what was the bill, so I told him it was exactly 37 dollar and some change... he then challenged me to say it was a bit high for 3 desserts and 2 coffees like I was trying to up it for my benefit lol. I did get a bit upset and thought if I wanted to do that I would have lied and said we had dinner also... well anyway we did get a gift certificate for 40 dollars, still have it, not sure if I want to go back after what the manager said. NO BUENO!"
Zhenhuabin Y.,"Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ",0,7,9,2.0,7/24/2015,"Ordered grilled salmon off their ""Skinnylicious,"" diet menu, but veggies and bottom of plate were covered with melted butter :-("
Paul A.,"Towaco, NJ",0,51,7,2.0,7/12/2015,I am still scared from eating here. Roaches across our table kills the meal. Such potential but never again.
Sinister W.,"Mahwah, NJ",14,37,3,2.0,2/18/2015,It'd be nice when someone calls to inquire about happy hour that they specify in bar only.
Nicolas M.,"Montclair, NJ",82,327,,4.0,3/24/2015,"Came for early dinner in the middle of the afternoon today after looking around at computers to buy at the Apple Store and Best Buy. My family and I had never been here before and rather than hitting Red Lobster like we always usually do, we decided to check this place out to see if it was anything like the one up in Boston that we'd go to when I was a student up there. And it was. It definitely was. Same inner decor which is hip and nice, and a HUGE menu that always makes it nearly impossible to decide on anything because there's just so much delicious sh*t. I finally settled on angel hair pasta with shrimp, my dad has fish and chips, and mom had Indian samosas with a beet salad. All very tasty, though my mom said the fries weren't crispy enough. Very good and attentive and friendly service. Only downside, it did all turn out to be more expensive than what was originally estimated and although we had a great tasty time, the food is not quite deserving of those prices. A very nice experience over all."
Tudii N.,"West Orange, NJ",19,28,10,1.0,4/3/2015,Not a good time. Most over rated place. I was really craving a steak when I came in so I ordered the coulette steak medium well. The steak came out bleeding. I couldn't report it to my server until she came over 15 mins later. She took it back to be cooked more. It came out 10 mins later- COLD everything oh wait and still bleeding in not sure what exactly they did. A manager didn't come over to apologize or anything and I asked for A1 sauce and they didn't have any! What?! That's like serving French fries and having no ketchup?! I couldn't believe it and I was pissed off. $85 bill for a shitty steak and a decent burger. The seating of the place is set up that you can't even have a personal conversation with anyone ur with. Because someone else is sitting directly beside you and you don't even know them. No place to hang your jacket so everything is bunched up near your neighboring diner with another servers butt in your face. Our server didn't pre bus unless I asked her to and when I did she took two small plates and left the rest to clutter. -_-  I had to move all of our dishes to a nearby table. Then at the end we asked for a refill of lemonade. She asked for the the old cup he has the first lemonade out of. I told her it was removed from the table. Then she said we couldn't get a refill without the original cup. WHAT?!  she said she will get it anyway and came back with a small togo cup. That was it for us. She lucky she got a tip to be honest. Never going back to another Cheesecake Factory.
Rena M.,"Hoboken, NJ",1,7,,4.0,8/9/2014,"After a horrible experience at a little byo (cuban petes-DONT DO IT)...in montclair, we came here, as a ""sure thing."" Cheesecake Factory, always is that ""sure thing"" ... the food was great, service was good, and the night was enjoyable! Your chicken dishes rock and the steak Diane ....YUM! Always recommend!"
Maria R.,"Harrison, NJ",6,46,1,1.0,1/20/2014,"I asked to be seated int the bar area for happy hour.. And I told her I didn't mind waiting for the booth to open. So an hour goes by and I ask if it's open now.. She said yes that they were cleaning the table and she would seat me right after they were done.... OKAaYYYy.... Np. After 10 minutes I asked if it was cleaned off yet and if we could sit now... She fucking sat someone else in the booth I waited an hour and a half for?! Seriously??? I wasn't even mad about waiting so long.. But waiting that long and giving my booth that I waited so patiently, quietly for... Uneceptable!"
Vanessa P.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,7,,1.0,7/29/2015,"I'm so disappointed at having to give one of my favorite chain restaurants 1 star, but was there   recently, decided to try the chicken w/biscuits and gravy and sent it back twice. First time food was barely warm and gravy was congealed on the plate.Biscuits were burnt black. The assistant manager returned in a few minutes with - guess what - a hot plate with the same burnt black biscuits. Further, gravy was tasteless. My daughter had pasta w/pesto sauce which actually looked minty-green and watery. Ugh. Finally, I noticed that the group in a neighboring booth also had an issue with their food. I don't know if it was the cook's night off, but unfortunately, I won't be back."
Lauren G.,"Verona, NJ",58,75,63,4.0,9/3/2013,I have been to this cheesecake factory location multiple times. I really enjoy the food- its always delicious but usually expensive hence I only go for special occasions. The service varies- some nights are better than others but usually it's never too bad- I also haven't had to wait more than 20 min for a table - I may be very lucky though because I've heard others wait over an hour at this location for seating
Jahnavi U.,"Denville, NJ",19,102,66,2.0,8/31/2013,The food here is mediocre and not worth the wait time. The only reason I would return is for the cheesecakes. They have a huge selection. Try the dulce de leche cheesecake. It's not overly sweet and you can really taste the caramel.
Vatsal J.,"Lake Hiawatha, NJ",5,39,,4.0,7/17/2012,"M.I.N.D.  B.L.O.W.I.N.G.  C.H.E.E.S.E.C.A.K.E.S!!!!!! So creamy and pretty huge slices.... they are more like gourmet art..and hence the slightly higher cost of owning one! But that's ok...every single one of them is worth it! Chocolate Tuxedo Cream, 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake, Ultimate Red Velvet Cake are some of the ones we gobbled up here... and many more to try out yet! As far as cheesecakes are concerned, service is pretty quick. Although for dine-in, the wait times are astronomical... every time we had to wait anything between 20-30 mins... The staff is always keen to make ur experience better but I guess they just have too many customers! We ordered the 4 Cheese Pasta and Veg Quesadillas.... they were nicely cooked and filling(alongwith the cheese cake!).... Portions are not ""very big"" and I would say every item is a bit pricey... Cheesecakes OMG!!"
Suzie R.,"East Hanover, NJ",9,14,2,4.0,12/17/2013,I highly recommend the tortilla soup. Delicious!  I also love the veggie burger - it looks like a raw hamburger at first but it was pretty good. Great service at the Willowbrook Mall location. Now back to Christmas shopping.  Ugh :(
