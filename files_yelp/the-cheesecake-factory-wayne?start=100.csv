Maureen B.,"Caldwell, NJ",2,25,2,2.0,3/9/2017,"Typical Cheesecake Factory, but not such great service. I came here with my husband tonight ordered drinks, an appetizer and our meals. My husband got a steak and I got a burger, I ordered it medium well and it came out very very rare. I sent it back to be cooked which took a while. So my husband sat and ate his food while I waited because I didn't want his to go cold. Once my food was done I then got to sit and eat alone. It's never nice to have 1 person eating alone.  Our waiter was nice and apologized after all it wasn't his fault but they could have offered offered a drink while I waited. They should have taken both meals back so we could have eaten together, after all that is why we did go out to dinner."
Daniel M.,"Wayne, NJ",68,117,360,3.0,11/23/2015,Lunch with my daughter on a Thursday. Good service and ok food. Always crowded and always seems they rush you. I do like some of their dishes though.
Cory T.,"Rockaway, NJ",8,96,96,4.0,9/13/2015,"The food here is good, but the dining area is a mad house. It's like a cheesecake warehouse on Black Friday. A bit pricey, yet the food seems worth it. I've tried a few different things from the menu & have yet to be disappointed. They also have a really good veggie burger for a healthy option when you're not in the mood for a steak. But seriously, their steaks taste awesome! One of my favorites is the Steak Diana"
Johnny P.,"Jersey City, NJ",655,52,272,4.0,4/26/2016,"Fried Calamari was pretty good as an appetizer is decent, dulce de leche cheesecake was pretty good, and as far as main courses  I'm a fan of the crusted chicken Romano.  The only issue i have is whenever i shoot by for lunch and i order from the lunch specials i always manage to end up getting the big orders but ehhh not that big of an issue.  Drinks are ok as well, but for the vibe i get i prefer to have them elsewhere since it's more of a dine in place."
Jack S.,"Long Branch, NJ",33,121,,1.0,1/1/2017,I have never been a fan as I always thought they gave large portions of mediocre food so gave it a shot for breakfast on New Year's Day and I have to honestly say I am still not a fan. Food sucks. Bacon is horrible waffle was cardboard and coffee was cold. Took forever for food. Definitely will not return.
Jessica R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,4,5.0,1/30/2016,"A perfect place to start off my day, I love everything I ordered here. Service is good, food is good, also a perfect place for shoppers yay! I will be definitely back soon :)"
Heather P.,"Wayne, NJ",127,52,2,4.0,12/23/2015,"Where to begin with this lovely place ....  Their menus are amazingly diverse with everything from a salad to a piece of cake.  The only thing i would like everyone to know is if you come here, come HUNGRY! The sizes of their proportions are enough for you to share with someone and STILL not finish it all the way! I have brought home so much food from this place that tastes amazing the next day as if i brought it home that morning! Their desserts are the best part because they must make them from scratch, especially the cheesecakes!  Highly recommend you start off with one entree or appetizer and go from there if you are a first timer!"
Placido B.,"Newark, NJ",0,4,,1.0,8/10/2016,Had Cheesecake Factory tonight just wanted to say the best thing was the bread and ice water..my dinner had no taste and chicken taste like rubber.. Our waiter never checked on us and was too busy.. I get it they wanted to go home and been serving food all night and was probably tired....we eat everywhere from chain restaurant to fine dining and know food. Next time there is always Chevy's....
Isa S.,"Wayne, NJ",33,12,,5.0,8/28/2016,Great place love the deco and the staff they are great. The food it to die for and dessert omg is so good.
Sam J.,"Wayne, NJ",1,99,25,5.0,6/30/2016,Really good you can never go wrong with anything you order. The brown bread is really good and I always order the luau salad which is so yummy and addicting. LINDAS FUDGE CAKE IS TO DIE FOR.
Jerry G.,"Bloomfield, NJ",12,20,80,3.0,9/5/2015,"Came here last night with my girlfriend for the first time ever after only hearing about this place from the comfort of my home browsing thru commercials. The place in general is a bit difficult to be seated and when you finally are, The seating is rather on the tight side.. Lacks room for private conversing.. The service was okay.. And the food was fine.. The prices were a bit on the high side.. But, you should know that coming here.. Can one say they really went to the Cheesecake Factory if they left without ordering a cheesecake? I think not. After much indecision my girlfriend and I both concluded on the carrot cake cheesecake.. Very delicious.. It barely tasted like a cheesecakes.. Melted in your mouth.. Will return and order something more on the pricier side to see if lives up to standards! Till next time."
N P.,"Clifton, NJ",0,3,,1.0,2/12/2017,For a cheesecake specialty place it is impossible to get connected to the cheesecake counter to order cheesecake... get more phone lines seeing that is the main reason you exist....
Gunny R.,"West Orange, NJ",1,99,6,4.0,10/15/2015,"A first impression is always a lasting one. Upon being seated, we were nicely greeted by our server Ashley W. She was fantastic - rite on spot with refills, not pushy or overbearing.  Dinner for three was great, everyone had something different, and the food was outstanding. I'd definitely return. Reason for 4 stars and not five, it's noisy, and the table lighting could be a bit brighter."
Iris R.,"Belleville, NJ",5,23,31,5.0,6/6/2015,Awesome atmosphere after a long day of shopping. Our waitress Michele kept us inform on the different options on food and cheesecake. The food was on time and hot. The cheesecake was delicious. The staff dang Happy Birthday to my daughter. It was great .
Debbie L.,"Caldwell, NJ",61,136,31,5.0,7/16/2015,Had a great meal here today.. Skinny menu has great choices... Always a favorite.   Sat down quickly too.
Debbie K.,"Butler, NJ",136,33,25,5.0,3/24/2016,"Just walking in I'm in love! It's bustling, busy, the cocktails everyone's drinking at the bar look awesome... Then you turn... And staring at you are MASSIVE EFFING cheesecakes! Buy one to take home ($50) or after you sit and have amazing Buffalo bites (orgasmic), giant Cesar salad, or whatever your heart desires because the menu is VAST! Large variety of everything! And follow it with a huge slice of a zillion choices of cheesecake dessert! Love love love this sugar high factory! Dieters not welcome! (Kidding! I think there's a low Cal page in menu!)"
Sara S.,"Wayne, NJ",103,34,91,4.0,3/14/2015,Food is okay better than your usual chain restaurants however its not always consistent
Jeff R.,"Haskell, NJ",0,9,,3.0,5/29/2015,Ok every time I'm here I order the bang bang chicken.  It is so good .  But every time they put shrimp in my order after I tell them not to. Why a great fast food restaurant can't get there orders strait.
Charles S.,"Haledon, NJ",0,27,3,4.0,6/14/2016,"We arrived Monday evening and decided to sit outside. The receptionist guided us to the perfect seats near a heating element. She was cheerful and happy and seem to enjoy what she was doing which always puts your mind at ease!  Brandon our waiter arrived shortly to greet us and asked us what we would like. This young man was one of the kindest, professional and goodhearted a individuals I have ever come in contact with..! His congenial presence made our visit to your facility fantastic. His table  and professional waiting abilities were... Bar none this best I've seen!   Our food, drinks and timing for all courses were impeccable! I give the food a good score of a solid ""B"", Steak Diane was a tiny bit bland but my wives Chicken Crusted dish was superb!    Good food topped with supreme service is more important than price or ambiance! BRAVO to Waiter Brandon, as well as the cheerful young ladies that sat us!! We'll be back and we won't be alone!     Finally, my hat goes off to the Cheese Cake Factory at the Willow brook mall in Wayne for their careful hiring abilities and a good eye for good employees!  THANK YOU!!!"
Thomas W.,"Butler, NJ",641,265,1003,4.0,11/10/2013,"For a chain restaurant, Cheesecake Factory is always a solid choice.  While their menu may be very large and overwhelming, the food is always good and service is always on point.  Some people complain about the wait, but for restaurants this is usually an indicator that the restaurant is good. The service is so good here, that one time I was here with my friends and the waiter came to the table to see if we were happy with our dishes. My friend said that it wasn't what he expected.  They took the dish back and let him order something else!  No questions asked!  If that's not great service than I don't know what good service is! Like I mentioned earlier, the menu is big!  So I tend to get the same things that I know are good.   For an appetizer, get the Thai Lettuce Wraps, they are very good.  For an entree unusually get the bang bang chicken and shrimp. The seared Tuna Tataki Salad is also a good choice! Make sure that you make room for dessert cause this IS the Cheesecake Factory and Cheesecake is in the name of the place!  The Godiva chocolate cheesecake is out of this world; do it!"
