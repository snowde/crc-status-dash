Nicholas Z.,"Newark, NJ",5,17,36,4.0,7/5/2015,"Southwest chicken sandwich, this sandwich was delicious the bread was a little hard on my pallet but overall the sandwich was great chicken was grilled to perfection, avocado with jalapeño peppers are a great combination in my opinion"
Wanda P.,"Manhattan, NY",310,15,52,1.0,12/14/2014,I have many complaints. First of all there is slow service. Second of all we have a low speaking waiter who seems to need a microphone. And third of all the utensils are extremely dirty AND they did not bring any water. We ordered 4 drinks and they only brought us 2 - omg I can't even deal RIGHT NOW!!!!
Cardboard J.,"Newark, NJ",0,3,,5.0,11/20/2016,What I Like To Say Is The Food Here Was Delicious. So I Went Here Yesterday (Which Is My Birthday). And I Ordered An Appetizer and An Pasta Dish. The Parmesan Cheese Bread Was So Delicious. It Look Like An Fancy Version Of The Domino's Cheesy Bread. And The Four Cheese Pasta Was A Bit Bland But Cheesy and Delicious. Oh I Also Got Their Famous Cheesecake And It's Taste Alot Like Junior's (Price and Such) So Yeah I Definitely Recommend This One.
Tricia B.,"Succasunna, NJ",9,21,1,3.0,4/25/2016,"The food is delicious, but WATCH YOUR STEP! I slipped last night and sprained my ankle. Those floors are way too slippery, in every single CF I've gone to. And I was being extra careful!"
Christina P.,"Caldwell, NJ",11,28,,1.0,12/20/2015,First and last time eating in this establishment. I came here on a Sunday night with 9 people. They told us our table was ready before they even cleared it so we stood there waiting as they cleaned. I ordered an omelette since I figured it was a safe meal. It's hard to screw up an omelette right? Wrong. Not only did they forget to cook my omelette and I got my meal after all my friends were already halfway done but they never brought me toast. I ended up just eating the bread and butter they put on the table in the beginning of the meal admit dinner. The omelette had a really bad taste to it. I'm thinking the spinach was old and slimy. Who knows. I can only speculate but all I can say for sure is I will not be back.
Chavon W.,"West Orange, NJ",18,30,3,1.0,3/4/2015,"Worst experience ever! I visited this Cheesecake factory with my family, on a week night last week. First, the server was not attentive and seemed disinterested in serving us. Some of our utensils and bread plates had dried food on them. Then, when we asked for hot water to at least feel better about the rest of them, the server seemed to not care what was wrong. Then, my cajun jambalaya was an oily mess. It was the worst ever, and I ALWAYS order the cajun jambalaya. When I told the server that I didn't want it, she took the plate away without even asking ""why"" or ""if she could get me anything else"".  Finally, as we were leaving, I stood at the hostess stand watching the hostess and 3 other employees engage in a spirited, and obviously personal, conversation. After about 5 minutes, the hostess comes over and asks me if I would like a table for 2. I said no, I'd like a manager. She gave me a generic, restaurant business card, with no name or anything else. Needless to say, I won't be back."
Crystine W.,"New York, NY",753,1201,281,4.0,10/31/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is one notch above other retail restaurants such as Applebee's and TGIF's, bringing in better food made with quality ingredients, a clean and upscale look (servers wear all-white) and top-notch service.  The best part is, they don't overcharge that much.  For a similar-quality meal in NYC, I'd definitely be paying at least double what I pay at the Cheesecake Factory.  Plus they make the best cheesecake too (beating out any Eileen's and Junior's that I've had).   I come here frequently and have tried quite a bit from the extensive menu.  Most memorable are the Thai Lettuce Wraps, Pasta Evelyn and the Chicken Madeira.  The Lettuce Wraps are a heaping mound of marinated grilled chicken, bean sprouts, carrots, pickled cucumbers and a trio of sauces.   I recently tried the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and found that really isn't to my liking, but that's probably the only thing I don't like of all the things I've tried.  For cheesecakes, you just can't go wrong with the Pumpkin (or Pumpkin Pecan) or the Dulce de Leche slices.   Each bite is heavenly, especially if you're a fan of cheesecake to begin with.   If you have allergies, the server goes out of their way to make sure that ingredient can't be found in anything you ordered.  This is a good place for celebrations, a nice date, families, casual catch-up, brunch.  They really are able to cater to everyone else's needs."
Laura F.,"East Rutherford, NJ",0,3,,1.0,11/11/2016,"Went for lunch today with my coworker.  We shared an order of fried calamari which was gross.  It was slimy and raw and was served with cocktail and tarter sauce (i prefer marinara).  My main course was the falafel salad which sounded delicious, but was also not good.  The salad itself was alright, but the falafels were so salty - even mixed in with the salad it was not edible.  Lunch for 2 with 2 drinks and 1 app came to $65.  Go somewhere else for a meal - I haven't been here in years and now I know why....."
Drew O.,"Montclair, NJ",19,362,389,1.0,12/11/2015,"Come here once a week, take away at the bar, spend $100, and it's NEVER right.  Also, takes over an hour cause they are either killing the chicken or cow in the back."
Lashawn P.,"Paterson, NJ",93,105,443,4.0,3/20/2015,"Okay there's a snow storm so that explains why it's so empty on a Friday night. Lately when we come we go straight to the bar area to eat because the service is superb. It gets really crowded on Friday nights especially around 8 pm(prime time).There are two bartenders Manny and I forget the other bartenders name, they are always right on target with your orders. They know what's good  and what's bad on the menu and nine times out of ten they are correct. I can hang out here almost every Friday(guilty as charged), we actually do come here every Friday. Food is fresh.. No complaints Old fashion burger and fries and DB had the orange chicken and brown rice! The only thing I can't stand is when restaurants have cold  water in the bathroom. I can't stand washing my hands in cold water especially since it is 35 degrees outside... Hello management! Can you please turn on hot water heater? Thank you..."
Skip H.,"Wayne, NJ",54,483,,2.0,11/15/2015,"Their cheesecake was excellent, but my dinner was bland.  We had to wait two hours for a table.  That is not an exaggeration.  I wanted to leave, but was outvoted by the people I was with.  The server was apologetic, but it really didn't matter."
Ladybug 6.,"Cedar Grove, NJ",0,3,5,1.0,4/29/2016,"Worst dinner ever.  This place is not consistent with their food.  Our waitress was very abrupt and nasty.  I had to ask for another server.  On top of that, I caught her talking about us with the hostess and another server.  The manager could also be too bothered. The food was awful.  All of it was overcooked and I will definitely not be returning."
Yahya S.,"Bergenfield, NJ",210,238,89,3.0,2/12/2016,Not as great as the Cheesecake Factory at Riverside Square Mall in Hackensack. I was sorely disappointed. The service sucked and the food took forever to come out. I expected better from this location.
Marcus L.,"Paterson, NJ",3,44,18,1.0,1/15/2016,"Service sucks! NOT WORTH THE PRICES! Ten dollars for slapped together frozen food! Not good for vegans/vegetarians. Very flavorless food while older customers can not read the menu as the lights are too dim! Sucks sucks suck! Ghetto human beings only hype this restaurant an wait two hours for a table! Very over priced! How can five customers have a birthday on the same day, in the same restaurant, within a thirty minute time spand within a close range to each table!? Over a one hour wait for food to come to the table! Stop waiting/wasting your money on this mediocre flavorless food! Never look forward going to this restaurant! Stop hypeing flavorless restaurants!"
J M.,"Caldwell, NJ",0,7,,1.0,10/10/2016,"Skip this place. Here on a Monday night and the place is mostly empty. Yet, it took 35 minutes to get some food and we only ordered salads. When we asked the waitress for a status, she responded that the wait staff does not run food, but she would check. I think it is her job to check though."
Khyati R.,"Bloomfield, NJ",129,50,81,4.0,1/22/2015,"Making random plans for consuming some delicious cheesecake n coffee at the cheesecake factory was the best idea I ever came up with lol. I love cheesecake factory n go there atleast twice or thrice in A year. It's alwsys a big occasion for its top go to cheese cake factory bit I have been craving for cheesecake now for a while. So lady night I decided I want have coffee with some cheese cake n a girly talk. As usual this place is awesome.   Let's talk about the resturant first.  It's amazing setting n ambience is perfect for a drink,  date night or just some girl talk.  Not to bright not to dark just perfect in romantic way.  Hehe. There is a bar area which is self seated. It's pretty big area. Drinks are awesome n usual at other bars. TVs in bar area where u can sit n watch games.   Service- I always experienced a good service whenever I go. They are so busy at times but they make sure to give their customers best service.  There are managers walking around making sure customers are being helped.  Waiters are all dressed in white n a so nice n peaceful.  The one who served us last night,  his name was andrew. A very nice man who was so polite to us. He got us waters n deserts. He kept checking on us from time to tone of we were ok n need something.  He also told us  that he is serving other tables which was big but if we need anything just call for him.  That thought was very considerate.  Food!- i know food here is awesome,  no matter what u order.  I always get the little egg rolls things worn this green chutney ...Mmmmm delicious.  I love threw green chutney perfect! . My fav is Sante fe salad with chicken with that green chutney. They have lot of other choice in food which are delicious. Let's move to Deseret,  best thing about cheesecake.  I usually order the double chocolate tall tower cake. Mmmmm personally I love chocolaty n so good. But late night we decided to order white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. It's little lemony n has this little hint of crunchyness in it. I b loved it.  Also ordered triamusu,  which as usual was good.  Cheesecake factory makes the best cakes n cheesecakes ever.  I fulfilled my wish of cakes n coffee now u should go n try n see for yourself.  :) good luck"
Gina N.,"Little Falls, NJ",199,185,142,3.0,10/15/2015,"I have been here the past two thursdays and both times, the same thing. The bartender is too busy talking and doesn't know how to multi-task. He needs to be more attentive to everyone and he would generate more revenue and make bigger tips. It's not busy so I do not see the reason why not. Tonight, we decided to sit at a high top instead and the waitress Nicole was just as bad. She didn't bother to come back to check on us to see if we wanted more drinks, etc. Another one; I guess they work because they like it and not for money. They only hurt themselves. The food is great; no complaints..."
Jim M.,"Haledon, NJ",0,11,,2.0,4/4/2016,"Very disappointing..... Took my daughter here (at her request) to celebrate her birthday.  The bread was not warmed, always a bad start for me. I ordered the French Dip type sandwich. It was so mushy I should've sent it back. I substituted the salad for the fries that usually come with it. The salad sucked too. The lettuce was awful soggy.  For dessert we shared a s'more cheesecake which was just OK.  My daughter had a chicken dish that she liked. I tasted it and thought it was excessively garlicky.  Since it was my daughter's birthday and she selected the restaurant, I chose not to complain and send my dish back.  On a positive note, the atmosphere is beautiful and the service was prompt and professional.  The excessively lengthy plastic covered menu was greasy."
Judy R.,"Paramus, NJ",0,11,,2.0,7/2/2016,"I have always loved The Cheesecake Factory...but not tonight! Our lettuce wrap appetizer came with way more lettuce than chicken. My dinner salad was missing at least 3 of the ingredients listed on the menu. My date could barely find any chicken in his salad. His coffee was filled with rinds. To top it off, there was no soap at the first sink in the ladies' room & part of the bathroom stall was missing so that I had a clear view of the lady peeing in the next stall. A total miss tonight! We did get comped a slice of cheesecake but it really didn't make up for the problems. The waiter was awesome. It wasn't his fault that the kitchen doesn't get it!"
Theresa V.,"Fairfield, NJ",36,281,20,3.0,1/18/2014,"Swinging by on a winter's eve,  I was lured by the friendliness and overall good rep of this place.  Thrilled that the franchise has finally added a skinnier menu, and a generous one at that.  I ordered the pear endive salad and paired it with mint tea.   My other guests ordered chicken teriyaki and the other stuffed mushrooms.   Wasn't thrilled with the butterflied uncut chicken breast on the teriyaki dish. The mushrooms were 5 to a plate,  small but tasty.  Be careful on the floors, even in my sneakers they were slippery. The refill of our iced teas was done wrong.  We got the regular iced teas instead of mint.  Also,  the servers rush around,  not exactly giving you room to maneuver.  We were seated near the kitchen,  so this did not make for a pleasant experience.   Also,  we overheard the servers conversations and they said some negative things about guests--obviously not aware that they were in earshot of guests.  Ordered dessert to go,  service was so good we tipped extra. Want to give it 3.5, but can't go with 4."
