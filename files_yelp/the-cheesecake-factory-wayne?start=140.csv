Sam T.,"Bloomfield, NJ",687,138,1822,4.0,3/19/2013,"Great great great food, workers have smiles, clean, soft lighting!!!!"
Phil T.,"Cedar Grove, NJ",25,39,,1.0,8/14/2016,So we went on the next day arrived 45 minutes before we were hoping to sit down....They were seating within 30 minutes most of the parties.  We told them 9 diners we are told 2 1/2 hours....SO NOT they don't take reservations and NO they can't accommodate large parties.
Joel S.,"Denville, NJ",0,3,,2.0,3/19/2016,"Beware of the tip they suggest on your check. While my check read  20%, it was actually 40%. The check total was 42.96 and they suggested a $17.18 tip. Do the math, that's 40%. They also calculated the tip  with sales tax, which is wrong They are totally wrong in their math and you need to be diligent. This in no way reflects on their food, service or performance, it is management's fault with their computer system. Perhaps the state or credit card company needs to have a word with them"
Michelle R.,"Belleville, NJ",51,32,4,5.0,1/21/2016,"Was surprised to see only 3 stars for them. We usually have great service when we go. Can never get enough buffalo blasts. The only complaint I have is they freeze the butter. You cant expect the butter to not rip the bread while frozen. Step 1. When receiving the butter packetts, either hold closely, and blow hot air continuously onto the packetts till soft or Step 2, hide packetts under the warm bread and let it work its magic. Bread good. Food good. Service, good. *Joeys voice from Friends..."
Bhey J.,"Belleville, NJ",46,9,119,4.0,9/7/2015,"My boyfriend and i came here for lunch and we ordered grilled salmon, which comes with mashed potato and broccoli, and chipotle pasta. The waiter offered us some bread while waiting for our entrées. A little bit too pricey for lunch specials.  But the food was okay and had overall good experience."
Melissa E.,"North Port, FL",0,3,3,2.0,9/4/2016,"I ordered curbside takeout because it was my birthday and I was going to enjoy my meal in the hotel I was staying at. I have cheesecake factory food maybe twice a year and was really looking forward to the meal that I always order, the Chicken Bellagio. I was asked if I wanted the complementary bread and I said yes. I also asked for packed utensils. I could barely understand the lady taking the order and just prayed she got everything right. Got to the hotel, no bread. I most likely would have only had one slice but still, its my option if I want to eat it, I said yes when she asked and when im paying almost twenty bucks for a meal, I want the bread. I was given two forks. No knifes. The prosciutto was very thick and fatty, and pretty much uneatable. Chicken tasted almost undercooked and the worst part of it was that it was missing the parmesan cream sauce. It looked like plain oil on the bottom. I was so pissed off. Ate half of it and threw the rest away. The most prominent pars of this dish were wrong and I would have just brushed it off but it was a birthday meal and, well, it sucked so I just have to write a review."
Lucy B.,"Pequannock, NJ",14,31,1,4.0,12/2/2014,Chain Restaurant in a mall! Food is good and service from wait staff can be good or fair. Yesterday it was good. The only thing that bothers me at this place is you never see a manager on the floor.  I have been going to this location since it opened and I have never seen a manager talking to the guests let alone on the floor. I will be back but it would be nice to know that the hostess isn't running the restaurant.
Mihir P.,"New York, NY",1,19,16,2.0,2/24/2017,"Food is average at best and totally not worth the price tag it comes with. The more I think about this place, the more I think ""maybe I'm not meant to like this place"".  See I like having good food. This place is very fancy and very well decorated. But, last time I checked, the primary reason people go to restaurant is food. Service and decor is an ""add on"". Don't get me wrong. It's  certainly  helps to have all that but food should still come first.  The food is very underwhelming to say the least. 4 cheese pasta tasted bland and not at all worth $16. Avocado egg rolls were pretty good but again not worth the $11. I think you can sense the theme here. The place has mediocre food at best for ridiculous prices. Our server(Brandon) was very helpful. So I give two stars. Otherwise, I say you look somewhere else if you're in the same boat. P.s their menu prices for some items are ridiculous. They need to come in touch with reality and price food accordingly."
Vinci Z.,"Manhattan, NY",180,91,96,4.0,4/7/2014,"I like Cheesecake Factory and I'm just reviewing this franchise in general. If you are looking for specific review points for this particular location, I gotta say that the floor is slightly dirty and greasy here.... Other than that, I have nothing negative to note. - Cheesecakes are awesome!! Afterall they are the Cheesecake FACTORY right? Yea, make sure u get them, any flavors. They are not super rich or sweet and will not make you barf (even after a heavy meal). - Hibachi steak is still my fav dish after almost 5 years. It is tender, flavorful (slightly sweet), and tastes better than a $100 steak at a proper steak house. (Other notable mentions: Steak Diane, Kobe Burger, Shrimp Scampi combo) - The dark bread that they give out in the beginning is the best thing ever. I always devour on those till I'm almost full.... Yea u guys gotta serve the main course faster."
Ellen N.,"Livingston, NJ",54,255,17,4.0,9/19/2015,"There are 2 Cheesecake Factory around us, one in the Mall at Short Hills, and one here at the Willowbrook mall.  We usually choose this one over the SH one.  The food is standard, nothing too much of a difference.  The wait though can be a huge problem.  Last time we waited for 45 mins, but we were lucky tonight...only waited for about 15 minutes.  The only problem with both locations is the bathroom.  It is too small for a large restaurant.  But overall it is a great place to eat, especially the cheesecake.  Make sure you save room for the cheesecake...the entrees size are huge."
Dewan A.,"Haledon, NJ",653,1272,1504,5.0,8/25/2014,"Good dining.  1) I like the ambiance of this place.  2) Chicken Madeira is awesome. Must have if you are here. And the chicken samosas are fantastic!  3) Then the cakes, don't forget the cakes. Huge slice, and awesome.  Give this place a shot."
Afia B.,"East Orange, NJ",34,9,15,1.0,11/1/2015,"Cheesecake Factory used to be one of my favorite places. HOWEVER, last night the food was horrible. We started off with the stuffed mushroom  appetizer and an order of nachos . I also ordered a small snack plate which was the Greek salad . We have no complaints about the beginning of the meal because that was pretty good .  Then we ordered dinner which was a disaster and very expensive . My husband ordered the shrimp and angel hair pasta which was very very dry. There was hardly any sauce on the pasta. He had  just a bowl full of angel hair pasta and 4 shrimp. My daughter ordered the herb crusted salmon. It was flavorless and dry. The mashed potatoes that came with her dish was very dry and seemed like it came out of a box. My youngest daughter ordered the fried shrimp and french fries. The shrimp tasted like it had been fried in old burnt oil. The shrimp had too much mushy crunchy batter and was not fresh tasting at all. The food last night was just horrible.  To end our night we ordered desert.  I ordered a  strawberry cheesecake and my youngest ordered a Godiva Chocolate brownie sundae. Desert was good. No complaints with desert.  I mentioned to the waitress that my husband's  food was very dry and she just said Oh and walked away. She did nothing or asked no other questions. We got our bill which was $120.74 and of course included suggested gratuity which is super annoying after you have had bad food and mediocre service.  We paid the lowest , 15% on the receipt which was $18.11 and then we just left."
Michelle L.,"Livingston, NJ",210,473,145,3.0,4/14/2015,"I've been coming here for a handful of years primarily because of its central and mall location, though I haven't been in ages, until recently. Located inside Williowbrook Mall, it offers tons of seating and loads of food options. The menu is so varied, it's sometimes overwhleming. From the brunch/breakfast menu to the salads, sandwiches, pastas, entrees and drinks, not to mention their infamous cheesecake, no one can come here and say they can't find something to eat. The porions are humongous! Come here with an appetite. There's a good chance if you get an app and a meal, you'll be bringing some food home with you! The decor is nice; the same as any Cheesecake Factory (it's a chain), and the bar is large and inviting, with ample bar and table seating. What's nice about this location is the outdoor seating, albeit, it faces the mall parking lot. The service is OK; it seems a little scattered at times. Between the servers and the food runners, there's so much service, but most times it can be just too much or even too little. Its location makes it tough to get a seat at lunch and dinner hours, especially on weekends and they don't take reservations, but it's great to pop in for a bite or cocktail when you need a break from shopping! And of course, don't forget a piece of cheesecake, even if you have to take it home. There's like over 20 delicious varities to choose from!"
Rocco F.,"Howell, NJ",338,38,32,3.0,8/7/2014,"Typical CF with exception to the day manager, who seems to be overly protective of his inept wait staff. Food? Decent dishes and mile high cheesecake.  Steak Diane, slightly overcooked and overpriced"
Hana S.,"Paterson, NJ",0,7,,4.0,11/3/2015,"I've only been to The Cheesecake Factory a handful of times but I love it here! We always get great service (with the one exception of the somewhat awkward waiter we had once).  There are a lot of options to choose from, which can be both a good and bad thing, haha. The variety on the menu is great though, and there are a lot of items to pick from if you don't eat meat. Love their smoothies, I get one every time and they really fill you up (which makes it hard to finish meals sometimes, haha). Went the other day and was helped by Stephanie, who was super awesome. We had a hard time choosing what we wanted and needed extra time and she was really nice about it. In general, I just wish they would give us a few more minutes before approaching us so that we'd have enough time to look through the menu. Also, the lighting in the restaurant needs to be brighter. Having a meal here can be pricey but most often definitely worth it!"
P E.,"Delaware County, PA",48,1031,159,3.0,6/15/2014,"Service - very good Location - easy to get to Bar - large Food - appetizers outshine the entrees which are big on portions.   Quality is not bad for a chain place.   My cheesecake tasted like it was still defrosting or was kept too cold.   I'm not a big fan of the stabilized whipped cream either.   Coffee was fresh. Come for the appetizers and dessert.   Skip the ho-hum entrees on the ""War and Peace"" sized menu."
Christopher W.,"Nutley, NJ",54,238,42,3.0,6/20/2014,"I guess I could summarize this quickly.  The tap beer selection was small.  The appetizer selections were numerous and varied and quite good.  The entrees were poorly-executed.  The desserts were very large.  Portions tend to be good values overall.  The service was phenomenal. In detail: the steak was burned on the outside.  Medium-well is not an excuse to add charcoal to the steak.  The fish tacos had no flavor; various alternative sauces and apologies were administered to no success.  The quintessential picky-child ""pasta with garlic butter and Parmesan"" option tasted off, due to the cheese (too smoky). The Tots were tasty; the Cuban sandwich appetizer was terrific and well-worth a second try.  The battered Buffalo chicken was good, interesting in its execution.  The Ahi Carpaccio was a good try but the soy and guacamole didn't cut it for me.   The brownie sundae was too large by half, and so much whipped cream to avoid.  Overly rich.  Just not for me and my male endocrine system.  The apple crisp was a much better choice but too big for my son.  On reflection it would serve our family of four. I expected more tap choices for beer; in fact, I expected many craft beers but I guess that's not what CF is all about.  I didn't go wrong with a Sam Adams Seasonal -- no one ever has. The water flowed freely and service was very attentive, polite, apologetic of our concerns and lent the third star to the review.   In all, this reminded me of a diner with a grander vision than it could properly execute.  The service was outstanding, literally standing apart from many other dining experiences in the last year.  So, perhaps with a different mindset I'd return, but it's not likely.  Too many other local choices."
Kinan A.,"Cincinnati, OH",44,20,2,1.0,5/17/2015,Come on... it's the Cheesecake factory.
Jessica R.,"Paterson, NJ",20,34,23,2.0,6/21/2015,"I find the menu a bit overwhelming...the crab cakes are decent, the Cuban sandwich was not great at all (IMO) however the real MVPs at this place are the cheesecakes of course...I've tried several flavors on different occasions and they haven't disappointed. The 30the anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake is amazing as well as the Godiva one."
Jill P.,"Paramus, NJ",635,174,1165,1.0,12/19/2013,Inconsistent food...terrible service....kitchen lacks attention to details....never returning to this location
