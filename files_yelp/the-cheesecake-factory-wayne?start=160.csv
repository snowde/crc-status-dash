Priya B.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,18,3,4.0,8/26/2015,Just love this place. Awesome food pleasant ambience.any special occasion at home we r here. Love avacardo egg roles the most.
Samantha C.,"Livingston, NJ",0,13,1,3.0,5/27/2016,"Okay, so I would love to say I enjoyed myself here because the one in short hills is great. Unfortunately, while the food was obviously just as delicious, service was terrible. We waited like 15 minutes for the server to take our drink order, and another 15 for bread. Also bread plates were not clean."
Lauren S.,"Parsippany, NJ",28,74,49,2.0,6/5/2015,"Let me start off by saying that the food and service was absolutely amazing. I ordered a Salmon dish with almond couscous and my husband ordered the eggplant parm with pesto sauce. Everything came out in a timely manner and our server was very attentive. So why only the 2 stars? The horrific bathrooms. Even on a busy Saturday night, there's no excuse for bathrooms that are barely usable. These are the same bathrooms the staff uses before they make and serve our food. They should be spotless and not give you a bad feeling upon leaving. This location does very well. It wouldn't cost the Cheesecake Factory much to have an extra person or two if necessary on staff monitoring the bathrooms."
Private A.,"Morris County, NJ",0,163,,3.0,6/16/2015,"Décor is comfortable and roomy; Both table and seats needed to be wiped down;  Staff is not attentive but are knowledgeable and helpful; Food comes quickly but is not rushed. The Crispy Crap Wontons are delicious, the Teriyaki Chicken was fatty, and the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake was the best ever."
Yulissa V.,"CORONA, NY",164,131,29,4.0,12/20/2013,"You know what...this was not what I expected at all.  Anytime I've been to Cheesecake Factory it'd be to take out...cheesecakes, haha.  Well this time around I actually sat in and ate. So the wait was about half an hour but worth it.  Got a drink at the bar with my boo, my amaretto sour was just fine.   The place looked nice. Little tight, not enough spacing for my taste between tables but eh.   The place was full. Server was nice, listened to my 101 questions and answered.  Very attentive. I had the Moroccan chicken entree, it was delicious, absolutely delicious.  I don't remember what my boyfriend had but he had another chicken entree, I don't remember how that was either but who cares! My Moroccan chicken was...delicious! We had strawberry smoothies, they were pretty tasteful and fresh.  Not super sugary. Mmm, dessert, for the life of me I do not remember what it was called...some sort of coffee cheesecake that had Kahlua in it... awesome, awesome. It was pretty good stuff. I would definitely go again!"
Danielle M.,"Totowa, NJ",0,16,15,3.0,5/13/2015,I had the chicken Marsala a favorite of mine this time seemed almost microwaved it was real hot in a couple of spots and cool in others. But my LIT was made well the drinks are always pretty spot on.
Ahmed M.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,4,,1.0,1/18/2016,A huge cricket was in my salad. It was still moving! I realize some of their stuff is organic but thats no reason anyone should have a semi live bug in their food!
Vanessa P.,"Paterson, NJ",0,10,,5.0,6/24/2015,Came here for the 1st time today and I absolutely loved it! Ordered the chicken carbonara and tried the red velvet cheesecake and the dulce de leche cheesecake and fell in love with the atmosphere!!!! Will definitely be coming again!
Rose G.,"Lucas, TX",42,19,8,1.0,1/29/2014,"Just had lunch with a cousin of mine.  After having the waiter take our order, he sent instructions to the kitchen about our order.  The waitstaff bought out our order and it was wrong.  Had to send it back to the kitchen to have the rice removed from the dish,(we ordered it without) in addition to this, my  salad was undressed.  Wow! what a grave disappointment.   The waitstaff was great, however the kitchen may need some more training. No need to ever visit another one of these establishments."
Jennifer M.,"North Bergen, NJ",22,12,3,4.0,8/7/2013,1/2 price apps & drinks menu for happy hour (only in the bar area). Can't go wrong with that!
Layla S.,"Englewood Cliffs, NJ",25,13,32,4.0,4/1/2014,"Loveeeee this location! The one by me in Hackensack has such slow service compared to this one. The parking situation is kinda annoying but it's never that crowded when ever I go. The portions are huge, adequately priced, and servers are really friendly! And you can't leave without getting dessert.. The Godiva cheesecake is my fave :)"
Erasmico M.,"Glendale, Queens, NY",0,6,,3.0,4/24/2015,"The lady that attended us was very nice and on point. The table was very greasy though, i wouldn't recommend eating in or eating anything here besides cheese cake. The cheese cake is straight up lovable. Iv had plain simple hot plates and no good. But cheesecake hands down good."
Kevin B.,"Brooklyn, NY",60,118,2,3.0,8/12/2013,"The cheesecakes are good...shocker.  The food I had there was pretty good as well. MY Fiance was jonesing for Shrimp and bacon club so I obliged and she loved it. The Chicken Marsala I had was decent so I can't complain and the staff was pretty attentive. For a restaurant chain, it was pretty good."
Sierra L.,"Wayne, NJ",1,25,7,4.0,7/12/2015,Thai chicken wraps are incredible along with the egg rolls. And the happy hour is so amaaazingly cheap!
Mimi S.,"Butler, NJ",5,62,13,1.0,11/15/2015,This place used to be so good ... It's just going down . We were a party of 4 including a one and a half year old . We arrived at 7 tonight (a Sunday ) and sat around 7:30 fine ... Place was busy but not swamped ... Ok .. Why would you walk us to a table still dirty and not set up ? Also I asked for a booster ( not there ) anyway eventually got it ... Waited a few minutes for the waiter .. Fine again .. He comes over and I immediately ask for a burger for my daughter and chic fingers and fries for the baby ... He comes back with the drinks and I then place my order ( a salad ) and my husbands ( steak Diane and shrimp ) and an appetizer ( guacamole chips ) ok ... About 20 min or so later her burger comes out and then that started the mess and disaster ! No app ! no baby's food ! Um hello I specifically asked for that first ... Then about 15 min later app comes out and my salad and my husbands cold food ! ( mashed potatoes could have held the fork up they were so cold and dry ) I can't even finish the review I was so annoyed .. Manager came over and apologized but whatever ... This was the 4 th time our meal is ruined ... Just get it together already .. It's kinda sad cause the food is not bad but damn the service is horrible ... I'm officially over it !
Lina K.,"Edgewater, NJ",400,540,57,3.0,12/19/2013,"Typical Cheesecake Factory.  I always seem to enjoy my meals here, probably because I am exhausted after shopping.  I usually get a salad or the Thai Lettuce Wraps but every once in a while, and depending on who I am with, can pig out on the meatloaf and/or cheesecake.  Service is good, pricing is modest and food portions large.  The only thing that can be annoying is the long wait at peak times."
Pooja M.,"Morris Plains, NJ",4,6,,5.0,8/26/2013,wow... I just love this place. Have a very different and good menu.  Love the pastas here. Not too greasy and just the way I like it. you should try Avacado Egg rolls too. Its just mind blowing. Last but not the least the desserts.. the cheesecake. Love the pineapple cheese cake and Godiva chocolate cheesecake. So yummy.... :) They have such a huge list of cheesecakes I am sure you will something that you like.
Jake V.,"Montclair, NJ",15,69,25,2.0,10/16/2013,"Upon entering this location my boyfriend and I approached the both where the hostess gave us the most unenthusiastic greeting she could muster, with out even making eye contact... then we were seated by some dip ship waiter who mumbled something as he seated us. We waited for several minutes before catching the attention of our waitress.  We ordered a few apps and entrées both of which we had to wait extended periods of time for service.     Service was horrible!  Food was standard... Deff will not be back"
Michael D.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",3,23,3,4.0,5/18/2015,Just cant give all 5 stars here. Some times the food is not up to par with taste. Service is usually good!!!
Lois P.,"Nutley, NJ",55,10,6,1.0,2/22/2015,Slow service on a Sunday afternoon. Food came out undercooked and cold. Have been here for lunch a few times and remember it being better. Disappointed today.
