Landy S.,"Lutz, FL",18,42,16,3.0,1/25/2014,"I went to the cheesecake factory with my husband, on our way back from a trip to Atlantic city.  I mainly wanted to go because of their heavenly cheesecake, of course, and since we had a gift card, decided to sit down and eat.  It was very crowded and busy (on a Saturday) but we got a table right away.   We waited for about 20 mins for our food, the food was ok for me, big portions.  I ordered a pasta/chicken dish that tasted good.  My hubby ordered a rice dish, but complained it wasn't enough, so of course, he helped me finish mine ;P   The only minus point was the lemonade I ordered, it was waaay too sweet, it was like diabetes in a glass.   for dessert, I ordered the caramel flavored cheesecake...mmmh-mmmh DELICIOUS!  Rich, melting in your mouth, sweet goodness gracious!!! I definetely recommend it and will surely go back, the cheesecake is calling my name wherever I go...."
Aileen W.,"Wayne, NJ",17,23,8,4.0,9/27/2014,Food is good.  Very consistent. Huge menu so don't go if you are in a rush.  The noise level is high.  Great for a group. The wait staff is very well trained and attentive.
Andrew G.,"Summit, NJ",543,497,315,3.0,9/30/2013,"I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory - something about the corny ambiance just rubs me the right way. My wife is also a fan, but not one of chains...this is the exception. The service here was actually much more prompt than other CF's I've been to, which is always good. The bread, as usual, was fantastic. Ask for the balsamic vinaigrette to dip it into, it's a GREAT pairing... I got the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, which was good.  A Thai-based dish, it wasn't bad. Not spicy at ALL, which was a bummer, but the nice veggies and peanut sauce did it justice. Passed on the dessert this time, but that cheesecake...... DAMN."
Jay D.,"Dover, NJ",0,84,33,4.0,1/17/2014,Fantastic meal.  Can't say anymore than the other reviews.  The only thing I hated about this place was how close the tables for two were and the bags all the shoppers have. It was about two weeks before Christmas so maybe that is why.   Try to get a booth if you can and enjoy your meal!
David D.,"Caldwell, NJ",0,9,,4.0,5/7/2015,"Great food and drinks.  Has been one of my favorite places to eat for years.  Even when crowded, put your name on the list and can go shop for a little to kill time."
PatrickJ T.,"Bakersfield, CA",193,2912,14296,4.0,3/20/2013,"For the visit here, we bought four cheesecakes to go.  2 of the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, 1 of the Banana Cream, and 1 Original Cheesecake.  It costed about $30!!!  Way too expensive!  That's why they do not get 5 stars from me.  I know that the cheesecakes taste so divine, but they could get more business if they'd lower the price.  I know that I would make a lot more visits to Cheesecake Factory for their cheesecakes, if they would lower it by a couple of dollars.  Instead, I'll only go to one of their locations about three times a year instead of three times a month because they are too expensive! Just a suggestion from one of your ""thrifty"" fans."
Selma J.,"Belleville, NJ",33,29,,5.0,9/14/2014,"This is my favorite place to grab food. I come here for every birthday! Old-fashioned burger is my favorite, and always cooked to my liking. I also enjoy getting the caesar salad and some sort of pasta with my friend and then splitting it - more than enough food for 2 people! The vanilla sundae with melted chocolate is amazing."
Maria S.,"Wayne, NJ",0,6,,2.0,2/24/2016,No problem with the food or the service but why are the lights turned down so low?? We had to use the flashlights on our phones to read the menu and look at the check.  Did someone not pay the electric bill? No reason for people to need a flashlight in a restaurant.
Kris L.,"Clifton, NJ",69,14,3,1.0,3/25/2016,"They will not allow you to order a drink unless you were born in this country. So if you are visiting here or not officially a U.S. citizen yet, you will not be served here. I was so embarrassed for my boyfriend that this happened to, so I called the manager over and the manager wouldn't serve him even though he had ID showing that he is 26 years old. The waitress and manager were both extremely rude and unprofessional. I have a United States I.D. so I was able to order a glass of wine, but the waitress refused to let us have it at our table because my boyfriend did not have a US I.D. even though he had other forms of I.D. and is clearly a grown man. I went up to the bar and got the wine myself and the waitress had the nerve to argue with me about it. She wanted to take away the wine I had just bought at the bar, even though I had my United States I.D. She seemed to just want to pick a fight. At this point, I asked for another server because she seemed to personally have it out for us and was denying me what I ordered and paid for. Soon after we saw her telling the new server about what happened, but I ended up being nice to my new server. She was fine, and I tipped well like I always do. Basically, I felt like my boyfriend was discriminated against and then on top of that, the workers were petty and unprofessional. I haven't gone back because of this incident. However, I didn't let this horrible woman ruin my dinner because I ended up having a good night with my boyfriend anyway and sipped away on my wine! ;)"
John S.,"Wayne, NJ",9,77,26,3.0,12/14/2012,Cheesecake Factory is a Chain Restaurant !  Why would you even write a review for such a place?? The same Avocado egg rolls will be the same at any other cheesecake Factory!  Its like reviewing how good the soup-salad-and breadsticks are at Olive Garden........There the same as any other Olive Garden!  #dumb
Steve K.,"CORTLANDT MNR, NY",56,525,1726,4.0,7/26/2012,"We don't normally dine at any chain restaurant. Cheesecake Factory is an exception. For about $100 for four with tax and tip, you get a choice meal with something for everyone, including two drinks, and two desserts. Plan on $140 if everyone has one drink and one dessert. The service is consistently good, and you can tell that Cheesecake Factory recruits and trains well. We had one handicapped person...very accommodating. Desserts are a favorite with some family members. Tip:  Ask the price of any specials to avoid surprises. I ordered catfish, pecan crusted with two sides...most excellent for $17. Tip 2:  Call ahead to ask about wait times. Can be over an hour at peak times. Drinks are generally over-priced compared with the price of the meal. For instance, a martini was $11.25 in a suburban mall."
Christy D.,"Wayne, NJ",27,90,6,4.0,9/2/2012,"I probably lived at this place in a past life. I don't even come here for the cheesecake, just to gawk at the ridiculous plate sizes. This place is the KING of food porn! Instagram overload! I usually order from the skinnylicious menu being that I can never finish anything more than two fist sizes.  I've had the desserts and the cheesecakes...they aren't all they are cracked up to be. This place is great for groups- but I avoid it at all costs on weekends. NOT a crowd person."
Phillip B.,"Dover, NJ",49,245,267,4.0,11/18/2010,Who does not love cheesecake?  I know I do and my scale after going here will vouch for that.  Located right in the Willowbrook mall the Cheesecake Factory is a great alternative to typical food court dining.  I find that the menu is very extensive and they have almost every food on the planet.  After your meal comes the really fun part......Dessert! There are so many choices of cheesecake to pick from.  I think I have eaten every one they have.  If you happen to not like cheesecake or feel like something different fear not.  They also have a assortment of other desserts to pick from. They do get busy during the holiday season and weekends.  I have done take out a few times and they do a nice job packaging.
John S.,"Stamford, CT",0,2,,1.0,1/16/2016,Worst hostess staff/manager ever.  Restaurant does not manage expectations with wait times.  Intentionally tell you shorter timeframe so you stay.  Will never go back!
Pete G.,"Denville, NJ",89,25,,1.0,6/11/2012,"This is one of my wife's favorite places.  That being said this place makes me hate my life. The food is always cold, when you get the correct order and the service is always sub par. Last time we went was a sunday at around 2.  Nothing was right....It was terrible.  Our waitress could have cared less about us.    I would pass and hit the Olive Garden or Fridays across the parking lot."
Katie D.,"Verona, NJ",125,7,3,1.0,3/20/2014,"They claim to have a 'gluten free' menu. I ordered an item from the menu considering I do have a gluten allergy, and before I even had a chance to leave the restaurant I became extremely ill. DO NOT order anything gluten free from this location unless you plan on getting sick."
Chessy B.,"Wayne, NJ",0,7,,5.0,12/8/2015,Always a good meal with hood service.... My only complaint? Wish it was not in Willowbrook mall or there was another location in Wayne!! Always crowded alwAys a wait!! Parking nearby is always an issue!!!
Fabio D.,"Gardena, CA",13,2,,5.0,10/15/2015,"I had the most incredible experience here the other night. I often come to this Cheesecake Factory because of the excellent service and experiences I've had here. Yes, the menu is very large, and it is often crowded in the weekends, but trust me, it's worth it. I was seated right away and greeted with a warm smile by one of the waitresses, her name was Michele, with one ""L"", we made made a joke about that, so I would refer to her as ""Michele with one L"" whenever I saw her. I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea, and also ordered one of my favorite meals there, Shepherd's Pie. Everything was delicious, and I was quite stuffed. ""Don't forget to leave room for Cheesecake!"" Said Michele with one ""L"". Well, how could I not listen to that wonderful advice! As I looked through the menu, Michele with one ""L"" noticed I was struggling, I am after all, very indecisive. She recommended the new Salted Caramel Cheesecake, so I decided to go for it! I tell you this, I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times, and that was perhaps the best Gosh darn cheesecake I have ever had! After I licked my plate clean, Michele with one ""L"" once again, with that same wonderful smile, asked me how everything was, and I of course simply replied: ""PERFECT"". I don't often say that about a lot of places, but my experience here, and the exceptional service provided by ""Michele with one L"" and the Cheesecake Factory team was nothing less than PERFECT."
D H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,23,,1.0,8/16/2015,Want to eat in the dark?  This is the place to come. Went here on a Sunday night for dinner  while in town.  I should have known something was wrong when I arrived and there was no wait.  I have never seen that at home.  We were seated and within a minute the lights were dimmed so much that I had to use the flash light on my phone to read the menu. I thought I was imagining things.  Well the food arrived I tried to see what I was eating. I bit down into something hard which was strange in a salad.   I asked the waitress to see about getting the lights turned one enough so I could see what I was eating as well as the hard thing I bit into.  She said she would speak to the manager.  Either she didn't or he didn't care because I never heard from him.  I would think the manager would address the hard thing in my salad.   We also ordered Caesar salad which arrived in a hot bowl instead of a cold bowl to keep the salad cold. Guess we won't be coming back to this restaurant ever again
Michelle M.,"Montclair, NJ",1,19,68,3.0,9/12/2014,"I've been here a couple of times and I always feel the same when I leave. The staff is professional, the wait time isn't so bad on weekdays and on Fridays it's about 15 minutes or so.  The food is good, it's nothing spectacular but I come back from time to time because I know that I'll never be disappointed.  Avocado rolls are tasty, Chicken skewers are good, the Fried Cat Fish is so/so it gets too salty after a few bites and I can't finish it, the Crab Wontons are absolutely delicious , Chicken Parm sandwich is pretty good and the quesadilla is good. The Dulce de Leche hot chocolate is alright, like I can make it better at home, and the Piña Colada is good. The ambience is sort of noisy, but I like to come here when I'm in the mood to eat and talk freely, without feeling like no on else is being loud. Reasonable food and reasonable pricing .Cheesecakes are pretty tall and slices are around $8 bucks give or take a few bucks lower or higher depending on which cheesecake."
