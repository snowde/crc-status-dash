Denise H.,"Manhattan, NY",13,77,10,4.0,10/8/2013,My family's favorite meeting place... It goes without saying that the cheesecake (especially the s'mores kind) is to die for!
Food M.,"Caldwell, NJ",0,16,,4.0,5/31/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is amazing, the service is great, the restaurant is very nice and clean, the food is spectacular, the only reason I chose to give this restaurant a 4 star is because the menu can be improved, but besides that I highly recommend The Cheesecake Factory."
Bibek A.,"Wayne, NJ",0,2,,1.0,9/8/2012,"This is one of the worst restaurant from hospitality point. Having heard of good things about this place, my wife decided to celebrate my birthday here. There was no waiting and we were given a table and menu.  One waiter showed up and brought water for us and we waited for about 30 mins and no one came for taking an order. We also saw an old lady complaining that she was waiting on the table, every one else on her table got food except her and finally when she got it, it was not the right one.  Both my kids became impatient and so We decided to walk out and never go to the wayne restaurant.  Horrible experience in all"
Billy T.,"Montclair, NJ",128,25,8,3.0,1/6/2014,It's a nice place for happy hour. Drinks and appes are $5! The bartenders are nice but not all of them are consistent with quality cocktail preparations. I definitely would choose the Cosmo and well drinks over their mojito which just has floating mint garnish rather than a muddled incorporated drink. The food so far as been hit or miss. The nachos and crab wontons tasted great but the shrimp summer roll was bland and unremarkable and the buffalo chicken blasts were barely chicken and very greasy. The overall service  (including bussers and runners) have been respectful and happy and the bar area is a relaxing place to be at to chat after a hard days work. The mall is also a good spot to walk off the buzz without spending your life savings (hopefully).
Chris C.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",8,23,1,4.0,12/12/2012,Orange chicken is the best thing on the menu. Always a hearty portion. The only problem here is the wait time. The place usually gets very crowded but the wait is worth it.
Melissa D.,"Montclair, NJ",36,44,7,4.0,1/23/2013,I ordered the red sangria for the first time at Cheesecake and it was super sweet an lacked fruit. Other than that our waitress was super friendly and the food was perfect.
Joseph C.,"Riverdale, NJ",38,255,62,2.0,2/20/2011,You People are all crazy!!  this is an over rated diner with good cheesecake. Everything is over salted.  Everyone thinks it good because they have good ideas for dishes and they give you huge portions. But Quality means everything!!  But honestly there is nothing worth going here for...
Rodney S.,"Bayonne, NJ",7,39,83,4.0,8/24/2011,"Excellent for brunch on SUNDAYS. small seating area in front of the restaurant that is nice, Good service, Zero complaints."
Joanne E.,"Bloomfield, NJ",13,22,22,5.0,2/12/2013,"Great food! You can never go wrong at The Cheesecake Factory and the one in Wayne is no exception. Best calamari, big portions of food, staff is pretty decent too. Try the Red Velvet Cheesecake! It's to die for."
Andrea D.,"New York, NY",0,5,,5.0,3/10/2015,"Being in New York I couldn't imagine ending my trip without going to the Cheesecake Factory. I wanted to know what hype about it was. But trust me each and every word of appreciation I have heard in my entire life was true. There is no match to the flavor that I experienced at this amazing place. I can literally still remember the taste of the cheesecakes I had. I went to the CCF with 6 friends, so we decided to order several cheesecakes and share them. We had the white chocolate raspberry, banana cream, oreo, Dulce de leche, strawberry, cherry and the tuxedo cheesecake. Tuxedo was on the heavy side but the other ones were memorable, especially the strawberry one (well for my friends the oreo and the banana cream ones were the finest). It was a cheesecake party, seven people and seven different cheesecakes. The prices were totally worth the flavors. I would recommend it to anyone who is in Los Angeles to definitely visit this place."
Vineetha N.,"Caldwell, NJ",2,18,,5.0,2/1/2013,"The cheese cake factory at the Willowbrook mall is  my favourite dine in and take out place for the past three years ever since I have moved to NJ.I had conducted my college graduation party and several other small mini parties at this place and I have to say that their food, ambience and courteous staff are amazing. My personal favourites from their menu is their Louisiana Chicken Pasta, crab bites, dynamite shrimp, jamaican black pepper shrimp with rice, jambalaya, tex mex rolls , veitnamese tacos , potstickers .Im in love with their pina colada cheese cake , pine apple upside down cheese cake , mango keylime pie, white choclate rasberry cheesecake  and red velvet cheese cake.During the fall I must have their pumpkin pecan cheesecake.This is a place that makes me happy with their delicious food ."
John-Paul K.,"Kinnelon, NJ",0,10,6,2.0,4/14/2012,"I'm going to keep this short, because it doesn't merit too much time. Portions...  very big Food...  decent, but nothing I'm writing my mom about Cheesecake...  very good Menu...  WAY too big.  Seriously.  It's a phone book Prices... Astronomical.  2 star experience at a 5 star price. All in all, I'll eat here if options are limited, but once the check shows up, my regret does too."
Jai S.,"Mercer, NJ",27,131,35,4.0,1/20/2013,"Went here on a Sunday for brunch and ill be damned, no wait! The service was good, drinks we're mixed right, food was good... No complaints out of me! The parking was a B#%*h, but that's ok."
Carmela R.,"New York, NY",17,71,,4.0,5/25/2010,"*This review is specifically for the lunch I had on Sunday, May, 23rd* I'm in such a great mood, having fun watching American Idol finale and enjoying my very first elite badge (yay 2010), so I'm in a generous mood giving Cheesecake Factory a 4 star rating when probably they are deserving of more like a 3 to 3 and half star one.  Plus, I've had several happy times here with family, so, I could be a bit biased.  Having said that, yeah, yeah, I know how many of y'all feel about chain establishments, but I rather like the CF. Been coming to this location since they opened several years ago. CF is inside the Willowbrook Mall, so after a day of shopping, my sis and usually one or two of my nieces would take a load off needing post shopping fuel.  Each time I've been here, the staff has been pleasant and attentive. A small gripe: when they are as busy as they are on weekends especially, they can be a tad bit neglectful in wiping the seats clean. Tables are always clean though and reset for the next diners. Warm breadbasket arrives at the table with butter. A pumpernickel oat bread and a sourdough one. We had the lunch special that's offered until 5pm. My niece had a mini pizza (but big enough to share). I forgot the name of the pizza, but I can describe it. It had cheese, fresh basil and sliced tomatoe (no sauce) thin crust and was pretty good. It was accompanied with a caesar salad. Salad was well balanced with italian cheese shavings and dark leafy greens and not saturated in dressing. Sis and I had a barbeque chicken salad which was very good. It was a mix of greens, black beans, corn, avocado and white juicy chicken breast meat chunks, tomatoes and red onions. It was flavorful and zesty with a barbeque sauce finish. We passed on dessert, but my sis and I had a cappuccino that was just okay. Not enough substantial foam for my taste and the espresso  bean was just okay- a bit thin and weak. They were decaf though, so this could have made a difference. Perhaps the regular capps are stronger and more full bodied. At $5 a pop, I expected more. Although, it was served in a large mug more suited for a latte. So, in a sense, it was a generous serving.  The ambiance of this CF has a pleasantly attractive decor of earthy muted tones and dark wood furniture and lighter beige tables. The pillow bench chairs against the wall are comfortable if that's where you sit, or if you are on the isle, strong wicker comfortable chairs with arms will secure your tush comfortably and your back too. The lighting is on the dim side. The bathrooms were pretty clean and decently attractive.  People woo about the entrees. Some of which one would experience in top tier chef restaurants for quadruple the price just because you are in a trendy hot spot run by a popular chef.  To the right of us, I saw a couple's entree. A salmon dish with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans. The other entree looked like a good, hearty steak.  At another table I saw a woman eating a salisbury steak dish that looked appetizing with a fresh spinach side dish. While The Cheesecake Factory can be hit or miss at times (especially on weekends when they are super busy), I tend to feel a person will experience more hits than misses.  Oh, and both popular and pretty are the array of drinks from their full bar."
Kathy A.,"Totowa, NJ",1,42,,4.0,11/7/2013,"Went to The Cheesecake Factory for the first time in a awhile, we had a gift card. It had a decent crowd for a Tuesday night. We were seated right away & our waitress was very nice. I ordered the Shepherds pie & my husband asked for the waitresses recommendation & she suggested the Jambayla. Both dishes were excellent, we we were both very happy with our choices."
R C.,"Clifton, NJ",0,12,,4.0,1/15/2015,"Very friendly staff and good food. There was ALOT of people during the weekend, but it is a chain restaurant in the mall, so I understood. Considering the time I went, the wait was not too bad. I had the Louisiana chicken pasta which was actually really good, but just wish it came out when it was a little warmer. Other than that, overall it was a pleasant meal."
Amy N.,"Wanaque, NJ",0,4,,1.0,6/4/2014,"I've always liked cheesecake factory and never had any real issues with any of the locations I've visited. As of tonight I can tell you I will never go back to the one at Willowbrook mall in Wayne. I was craving some sort of sweet dessert so my boyfriend and I decided this would be a great place to go; he could get dinner and I could satisfy my sweet tooth.  We were seated right away but it took the waiter a good 5-10 minutes to come over and grunt at us - yes,  he actually grunted. He was completely miserable the entire time we were there. Inattentive, rude, and absentee are the nicest ways to describe the service. Then there was the food, the only thing that wasn't awful was my chocolate milkshake. I ordered the apple crisp, and was not impressed in the slightest. Mostly nuts and whipped cream with very little apple or what is usually added for ""crisp"". My boyfriend got the pan seared salmon with angel hair pasta. He was nice enough to wait for my food to get to the table before he started eating, unfortunately this lead to another 10 minute wait and his food being almost cold by the time he got to eat it. The pasta was definitely microwaved, clumped together, dry, and completely disgusting. The salmon was ok, but not well cooked by any means.  When the waiter asked how everything was, we told him about the issue with the pasta. Wet got another grunt, no apology, and he walked away. We figured a manager would be forthcoming at that point, and he was, again after a decent (15 minute) wait. The manager sort of half assedly apologized but explained that if the pasta stays in the window too long waiting to be delivered it gets dry and can stick. When the bill came we were shocked to see that we were still being charged the full $17 for his meal - even though half of it had been inedible.  Between the terrible service and the bad food, nothing could get me back into this restaurant. We actually ended up going straight to Chipotle afterward so my boyfriend could eat dinner."
Sean K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1290,212,1657,5.0,2/4/2010,"If there's one chain restaurant missing in Manhattan, it's a Cheesecake Factory. I'm still shocked over the fact that there is not one of these throughout the 5 boroughs. Cheesecake Factory is the most delicious, consistently good chain restaurant you can possibly go to. Being from Florida, I've been to CF dozens of times. The Miso Salmon is cooked BEAUTIFULLY, and flavored perfectly with a Miso-based sauce, served over a bed of rice. The Chicken Madeira is another great CF classic. The desserts are great, of course, as well. Still my favorite Shrimp Scampi as well, beautifully breaded shrimp in an amazing sauce with great, al dente angel hair. If there;s one restaurant Times Square' restaurant need to be worried about, it's a Cheesecake Factory. CF Would put all of those touristy places out faster than any other establishment."
Mike M.,"Paramus, NJ",0,8,,4.0,12/6/2014,Most of my Cheesecake Factory experiences have been good.  This time I had the Cajun Chicken Littles.  Not spicy at all and kind of dry.  Mashed potatoes and bread were good though and the waitress provided good service.
