Justine D.,"Newark, NJ",493,465,139,3.0,1/7/2012,"I have yet to go to a Cheesecake Factory where I thought, ""average."" I have no problem admitting my deep love for the Cheesecake, but I was slightly, only slightly, disappointed here.  The pasta was cooked horribly.  Pasta should be al dente, not crunchy.  Otherwise I was quite please that on an early Saturday evening we were immediately seated."
Brian T.,"Cedar City, UT",23,21,30,4.0,5/2/2012,Tonight I had the Boston House Appetizer salad.  It was big enough to be an entire meal - and it was probably the best salad I've ever had while dining out.  Samantha was an amazing waitress.  She was around just enough to be helpful but not bothersome...  Great food and service!
Staszek M.,"Montclair, NJ",0,19,5,4.0,7/24/2013,"Great food ! The chicken Madeira is my favorite dish, soft chicken ,dark Madeira wine sauce , mushrooms and cheese , served with mash potatoes and asparagus.  The service was as always incredible."
Saskia S.,"Dover, NJ",1,2,,3.0,4/9/2013,"Chicken castalleto was great, fish tacos good but service very poor... Waited over 30 mins for someone to arrive to our table. Our server was chatting with the table next to us and completely ignoring us. Very aggravating :/  I'm giving it a 3 stars because of the food."
Thomas R.,"Montclair, NJ",101,3,,1.0,6/22/2010,"One may consider Cheesecake Factory a gem for delicious quick and reasonable chain restaurant Food, and it is.  My first Cheesecake Factory experience was in Houston, Texas - and I fell in love.  Never before had I enjoyed chain restaurant food, or selection.  When this Cheesecake Factory started hiring I considered putting my name in. But disaster struck when I was visiting the Cheesecake factory with 6 of my friends. We sat there, and a cockroach was crawling across the bench seating.  I informed the waitress of the roach, she said she would send the manager over, the waitress came back minutes later and the manager had not.  Even our waitress was showing frustration with the manager not coming by.  When he did, he tried to offer us a free dessert.  I'm not sure if that is just instinct for dealing with issues, but I do not want to eat more food at a place I just saw a insect capable of mechanically transmitting disease organisms such as the bacteria which cause food poisoning. As disgusting as that is, I feel the bigger issue is I posted a status on Facebook of simply ""Guess who's never going back to the Cheesecake Factory"" and multiple friends commented of their experience with cockroaches at this same Cheesecake Factory. So, I will not knock all Cheesecake Factory's... but I will say this one is not one I want to visit again."
Luca T.,"Maplewood, NJ",6,273,,3.0,9/28/2012,Fantastic salad but slow service... nice decor but terrible hamburgers
Karol R.,,35,120,52,5.0,6/11/2012,"It's a chain, I know...but the food here was fantastic! Went here for the first time with a group of 7 adults and 2 toddlers. The hostess made sure our table was accommodating especially with the toddlers. The herb encrusted salmon was fresh, and the steak Diane was delicious! All in  all the party was satisfied with their meals. The cheesecake was good, even though I tasted better. All in all a good experience and I will be back."
Jessica H.,"Denville, NJ",64,64,14,3.0,7/23/2010,"Food is good, drinks are more sweet and fruity then full of alcohol and the wait is long enough to want to rip your hair out.  The drinks are always yummy if your looking to have a liquid dinner but never have enough alcohol to even get the smallest buzz. So if your looking to get a quick buzz before dinner stick to the fan favorites, beer and wine.  I have tried a bunch of food on their menu but my favorite dish by far is the the hibachi steak with the wasabi potatoes. YUM! Their cobb salad is huge and really good too. It could easily feed 2 adults. And the cheesecake, well, I don't even have to tell you that. It's the whole reason they exist and yes its good! This Cheesecake happens to be attached to the Willowbrook Mall and because it is so, it is ALWAYS A ZOO. I have waited as long as 3 hours to get a table on a Thursday night!  I want to say they don't take reservations but they do take call ahead seating. There is nothing spectacular about this location versus another. Just a good place to grab a bite and try something new.  Average price per meal including entree, appetizer and drink is about $35 per person."
Nicole L.,"Philadelphia, PA",262,493,33,4.0,9/5/2009,"The burgers were really good here. Came here for lunch on a Friday. The place was a little bit less than half full. There was parking in the lots outside, which makes sense because this Cheesecake Factory is part of the WillowBrook mall.  We were seated almost immediately upon arriving around 12 p.m. The server was very polite and rattled off the specials without a blink. We opted to get bread for the table (must be a cost-saving measure since they used to just bring the bread as opposed to asking if you wanted bread).  I ordered the Kobe burger (with friend mushrooms and caramelized onions) and my husband ordered the double stacker BBQ burger. They came with either fries or a salad, and we both opted for the fries. The burger was AMAZING. Both of them. The highlight of the burger was actually the toasted bun. Perfectly toasted so that the buttered inside was crunchy and added amazing texture. I asked for my Kobe burger ($13) to be cooked medium, but it came out well done. That being said, the texture of the meat was amazingly tender and juicy. Must have been because of the Kobe meat. The mushroom and onions did add to the burger, but not in a significant way (except to break up the texture).  I was told that the BBQ burger was also exceptional. It was ""what the Big Mac should have been.""  Since this burger ($11.50) was listed as a ""double stacker,"" we both expected the burger to have two beef patties. What we did not expect was for the patties to be separated by another piece of bread. That being said, the burger was cooked perfectly (also ordered it cooked medium), and the crunchy breaded thin onion rings they placed in the burger added significantly to the texture of the burger. There were two large strips of bacon and one slice of melted cheese. The fries were only mediocre because they were pretty dry. They likely cooked too long in the oil, or sat for too long under the hot plate. The service was polite and efficient. They brought out new glasses of water (unasked) when we finished our first. The second refill, I had to ask for, but I also asked for mayo for my burger and that was brought swiftly. The restaurant was a little chilly inside, but it was over-all, a very good experience. The portions are very large, but since the fries weren't very good, there was nothing worth doggy-bagging. It was a pretty expensive burger, but the great taste was worth it. Lastly, they will be running a promotion from Oct to Dec. where you get a free slice of cheesecake with an order over $30 (which can easily happen if you get an appetizer and entree). They bring you the coupon for this promotion at the end of your meal."
Nina W.,"Montclair, NJ",11,103,24,4.0,8/28/2013,"Just had a most delightful meal with hubby. Vietnamese spring rolls with shrimp, two dipping sauces. Hubby had a beet, apple and goat cheese salad. Nice plating and tasty. I needed some protein so had a petite filet mignon which was cooked perfectly. Hubs had ahi tuna carpaccio which must have been good since he didn't offer me a taste. To be fair I didn't offer him a bite of my beef. Good value, good service."
Wendy P.,"Wanaque, NJ",44,263,1011,4.0,2/22/2010,"I love this cheesecake factory. There drinks and food are great. I love the fried mac and cheese, avocado rolls, thia lettuce wraps are AWESOME and the combo shrimp scampi and chicken madriera is great. Just haven't been to thrilled with the pastas. Also love to stop in after a long shopping spree..."
Mortimer C.,"Newark, NJ",4,3,1,1.0,12/6/2011,"By no means am I a big complainer and when I eat out I'm usually fine with what I receive.  As a General Manager of a Chipotle Mexican Grill I can appreciate situations where guests can be difficult so I don't want to be that person.  My lady and I ate at Cheesecake Factory together close to 10 yrs ago for the first time.  The meal was great, portions fantastic!!  I had the shepherds pie and it didn't disappoint.  When our first dinner choice was not available I suggested Cheesecake Factory.   So we go there and we sit and peruse the menu.  Now mind you on the first page of the menu they go on and on about the generous portions blah blah, so I'm thinking about what to order and we decided on the spinach and cheese dip with tortilla chips  $11.00.  We get the smallest bowl of dip, I'd say a four inch by four inch by two inch deep bowl 75% filled.  Not terrible but you would expect more from a place saying their appetizers are huge...It was flavorful so we over looked that. On to the entree lol if you would call it that.  I decided on the Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane combo she ordered the Shrimp Scampi.  We waited and when our server brought our food we were amazed at what was placed before. Now when I ordered the combo I was thinking yeah this should be good and filling so I'm eager to eat.  Boy was I in for a shock!!   My over a foot long oval plate had three of the smallest bites of steak on one side with some mushrooms and onion with three shrimp all they way on the other side.  Now for $21( a dollar extra for sweet potato fries lol) I would expect a decent portion not the paltry amount of food I received!!  Hers too, big plate with five shrimp exactly and a small mound of pasta!!  I can't tell you how many other place you could eat at and spend $21 and get twice the amount of food of equal or better quality.Total let down and I know things are tight in this economy but that was just wrong how they did us!! So to sum it all up,  one guinness, pina colada and appetizer $27.. one Steak and shrimp combo and shrimp scampi $42..... two pieces of cheesecake for $16 a bill for $92!!!  and two people that will never return to this ripoff restaurant.........Priceless!!"
Jacqueline J.,"Hawthorne, NJ",4,61,1,3.0,1/20/2012,"Nice food, but unfortunately the service was not good (slow for everything).  On the plus side - the food was nice, with good portions/prices and if you don't mind the delays and chaos, then you would have a great experience."
Edwin M.,"Verona, NJ",11,73,,1.0,1/30/2012,So overrated! There is always a wait. Staff are ok at best. I got sick from a chicken sandwich here so I avoid this place...
Larry K.,"Brooklyn, NY",14,38,6,2.0,8/18/2013,wanted to try it  boring corporate  food
Amy M.,"Nutley, NJ",13,13,3,4.0,2/7/2012,"I just visited this location over the weekend, and I have to say that the food was really good.  The service was even better!  We had a very nice waiter, who was very attentive, and refilled our drinks before we even asked.  I think that is a true sign of a great server.  I ordered off of the ""Skinny Menu"" and I loved it!  I had the Chicken Salad sandwich with a salad.  For the app we ordered off the ""Skinny Menu"" also and we got the Chicken Samosas...they were awesome! While eating the manager did visit the table and he refilled our drinks.  He also asked very specific questions about our food.  My friend had left some food on her plate, and he was very concerned that she did not enjoy it.  I will definitely be returning to this Cheesecake Factory,"
Lovet O.,"Jersey City, NJ",291,590,347,4.0,11/15/2008,"Great food, never disappointed. Good prices. Long wait for tables but worth it. I love the herb crusted salmon and the calamari. And the portions are generous. I always end up taking food home."
Jorge S.,"Newton, NJ",0,77,,4.0,12/12/2011,Half off appetizers at the bar during happy hour. Get the fried mac and cheese balls.
Bermie H.,"Queens, NY",31,165,128,4.0,10/6/2008,"If a mall has a Cheesecake Factory, I'm there!  Never disappointing.  Always satisfying.  The wait for a table is usually 20-30 minutes for two at peak times and this one is no different.   The portions are very generous so that I don't have to worry about making lunch the next day.  Every time I go to the factory I try something different.  This time it was Chicken and Biscuits.  Mmm mmm good.  I was pleasantly surprised this time around that they brought me another glass of Strawberry Lemonade w/o my asking.  I've had to ask at every other CF.   6 locations down, 133 more to go."
Mel S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,,4.0,5/6/2012,The food was good.... the only thing is am buying a cake as gift and I was told i have to defrost for an hour....that was a bummer!
