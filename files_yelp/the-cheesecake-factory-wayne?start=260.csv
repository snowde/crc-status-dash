Elliot H.,"Philadelphia, PA",76,9,12,4.0,1/22/2012,"First off save room for the Godiva brownie,  which is tough given the portion size, good food decent prices and large variety make up the best of the restaurant, they are slow though, slow to seat, slow to serve, come there with patience and you will enjoy yourself, in a rush skip it."
Ben P.,"New York, NY",4,73,5,5.0,9/24/2014,cheesecake. so good. so indulgent. so decadent
Alva S.,"Harrison, NJ",0,1,,4.0,10/5/2011,Have been many times. Always need to wait on Friday evening. Expect its appetizer bread. But it always makes me too full when eating entree
Laurie D.,"Newark, NJ",0,2,,3.0,8/23/2011,I came here tonight for a nice date with my bf. Before I even got there I knew what I was ordering the fried mac and cheese and the pan seared salmon for my entree. We sat down and waited for a server to come. She took our order. We didn't get our drinks not two minutes before our appetizer came out. One bit into it and it was still cold. Kinda like they had them frozen and just threw them into the fryer for a min or two. The re- made it and this time it was not as cold but not hot at all. When our dinners came out they were excellent. The manager came over and took care of us. I love this place and I will be back. But next time I hope it will be a little better.
Kathy S.,"Fort Myers, FL",342,23,,4.0,3/11/2011,"Good food at a good price. Order carefully, as many selections aren't healthy at all. However, there are some very healthy selections hidden amongst the carbs. I always get the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio and Fire Grilled Artichokes. Delicious!"
Naomi S.,"Charleston, SC",60,19,2,2.0,3/20/2010,"Food is okay... drinks are HORRIBLE..almost no alcohol, had to order an extra shot on the side for every drink I got, horrible...waitress I had took around 20 minutes to bring my friend water...it's a nice family environment I guess... ehhh"
N. F.,"Butler, NJ",3,60,1,4.0,12/22/2009,"Dinner on a Friday night was well executed and priced reasonably. Two alcoholic beverages, two entrees, one shared dessert all under $60.  Do yourself a favor and order the chocolate-coconut creme cheesecake."
Natalie W.,"Caldwell, NJ",36,26,42,3.0,1/25/2010,"I would normally rate the Cheesecake Factory as 4 or 5 stars but I had to take a star or two away because they made my husband sick :( I normally love their food and ambiance, although the service is not always great. I usually have very good service. The crispy crab wontons and strawberry martini are my favorites."
Victor C.,"New York, NY",16,2,,5.0,2/10/2011,"Came here with my family after a rather long day of shopping and when we walked in, it is just an inviting, ready for you atmosphere. The people are really great and the service is awesome. Evelyn's Favorite Pasta is ALWAYS cooked the perfect way that I want it and I end up tipping extra for the servers. I am not big on cheesecake or sweets, but I do allow myself the enjoyment of some of their food now and then. Excellent location and I have been to multiple. It's a great company. Prices are average for a Cheesecake Factory chain, but it is still a great place to sit back, relax and enjoy yourself with family, friends or your phone (when you're alone). The mall is apart of it as well so it's always a great starter or ender to the day."
Yelper I.,"San Diego, CA",0,69,,3.0,7/9/2012,"I'm from Manhattan. That makes me a food snob. I prefer independent restaurants and generally avoid chains (I also generally avoid New Jersey). Anyway, as it happened, I was on my way back from a day trip in Sussex County and had very few late-night options. So... Cheesecake Factory, here we come. My wife, niece, and I experienced some food quality problems with beef sliders (a shared appetizer) and Thai chicken pasta (a shared entree). I won't bore you with the details, because they honestly weren't severe and I was prepared to happily ignore them. But... when the manager heard about the problems, she came over to the table, apologized, and - without hesitation - comped the whole meal. EVERYTHING. FREE. Then she bought us three desserts and coffees on the house. Her name is Janice and her genuine friendliness and customer orientation made us forget all about the minor hiccups. Seriously, she's a great ambassador for the brand. Are you listening Mr. Cheesecake? The truth is that I'm unlikely to go to any Cheesecake Factory again (because I prefer not to eat in a factory). However, for those who like to get a week's worth of sodium in a single appetizer... for those who have never actually tasted Thai food... and for those whose mouths are so big that a full-sized hamburger feels like a ""slider""... I say: Go to the Cheesecake Factory in Wayne, NJ. Overindulge. Take one step closer to an early grave. But definitely ask for Janice, because she is AWESOME."
Tiffany L.,"Spokane, WA",512,604,680,4.0,12/31/2008,"I have to say that out of all chain restaurants, The Cheesecake Factory is one that I actually like, and haven't had not one bad experience at. I think their food is decent, and the portions are absolutely huge (maybe even too big). They have really yummy soups and salads and I almost always get a pasta dish. My favorite is the Evelyn's Favorite. And the cheesecakes and desserts are of course good, seemingly so because it is named after it. Their drinks are also pretty yummy and the service is always good (for a chain restaurant). This one in Wayne is definitely my favorite."
Joe M.,"Cedar Grove, NJ",12,25,,3.0,8/30/2010,Good food. Gigantic menu. Greag Cheesecake
Andre V.,"Providence, RI",46,109,4,4.0,7/4/2008,"This is place is really nice, the staff is very friendly and courteous and decor of the place is really nice as well.  The food is great not just in taste but the presentation is fantastic.  But be warned the food comes in large portions so if your looking for bang for your buck its great for that as well.  But don't get stuffed on the entree...leave room for the best cheesecake around, you won't be disappointed."
Felicia K.,"West New York, NJ",73,346,17,3.0,1/3/2011,"I generally really like Cheesecake Factory, and this location is usually good aside from the fact that there is almost ALWAYS a wait, and a long one at that.  Maybe I'm just getting pickier as I get older, but I felt like the food here was a bit lower quality the last time I went.  I subbed green beans for the rice that came with my Chinese-ish chicken, and they came out looking like they'd been around the block a few times - limp and lifeless. Considering the long wait and prices, I expect more.  Also, they were completely out of avocados that day.  Maybe not a big deal for other places, but considering that those avocado spring rolls are one of the best items on the menu, a let down.  That fried tuna sushi roll appetizer though... so great.  In any case, definitely recommended if there's no or little wait, but if it's more than 30 mins., try somewhere else.  Also, beware if you parked your car on the other side of the mall and go here for a late dinner - you cannot get back into the mall from the restaurant once the mall has closed."
Matt G.,"Livingston, NJ",18,52,12,4.0,12/10/2009,"I have always said that The Cheesecake Factory is the best chain restaurant in the country, and I stick by this statement.  Consistently great food, attentive service, and large portions make this place one of my favorites.  The atmosphere is upscale but not stuffy and this lends to The Cheesecake Factory being a great dining option for a Wednesday night dinner or a graduation party, I really like how versatile it is. The menu is about as long as 'War and Peace,' it even has pages of advertisements!  It can be a bit overwhelming at first, but the good news is that whatever you order will be spectacular, you really can't go wrong.  I have been to The Cheesecake Factory about 1,000 times and sampled most things on the menu.  I would suggest trying the Navajo Chicken sandwich, the BBQ Chicken Salad, or the Chicken Romano.  I rarely have enough room for dessert, but I have tried the famed cheesecake on a few occassions.  The Adams Peanut Butter Cheesecake is money in the bank!  So if you want to grab lunch or celebrate a birthday or anniversary, head over to your local Cheesecake Factory and arrive hungry."
Jessie W.,"Clifton, NJ",28,35,,2.0,6/9/2010,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory a few times in the past, but it's been a while. When I was meeting up with a friend for dinner and drinks and we were searching for a place in Wayne, the Cheesecake Factory sounded like a good idea. We got a seat right away since it was a Tuesday night. The waitress was attentive without being obtrusive. We both ordered a mango daquiri and I must say I was very disappointed! First off, it was lacking any alcohol and secondly it was $8.50 for a tiny glass!! But I guess that's to be expected from any chain restaurant, right? I had the crabcake sandwich and my friend had the portabello sandwich, we both chose a salad for a side. Afterwards we decided to share a piece of Kahlua Cocoa Coffee cheesecake that was yummy. Although we enjoyed our meals and dessert, we were both sick that night. Not sure if it was the alcohol lacking daquiris (we only had one each), the salad or the cheesecake, but something was not right about our meal. I don't think I will be going back anytime soon."
krystle j.,"New York, NY",3,100,,4.0,3/11/2009,"i go here all the time, share a dish and a dessert or appetizer and you're golden sometimes there's a long wait though.."
