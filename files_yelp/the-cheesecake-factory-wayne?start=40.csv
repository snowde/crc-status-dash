Lisa C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,3,,5.0,9/30/2017,My friend and I went to the Cheesecake Factory in Wayne NJ on Saturday night. And our waiter was amazing her name was Alisa. She was totally awesome and the service was great! And the manager was awesome too!
Jon O.,"Es Castell, Spain",0,5,,3.0,9/30/2017,Good food.  The menu is a little daunting but the service is always good.  I highly recommend the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls and the bang bang chicken and shrimp.
Sim M.,"Wayne, NJ",0,5,,5.0,6/18/2017,I gave it 5 stars for the chicken Madeira with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The warm bread they bring with cubes of butter is really good. The manager in charge Mauricio was very kind and professional.
Liv S.,"Denville, NJ",201,25,16,3.0,5/3/2017,"Only three stars because the service was very slow. The table wasn't set; no silverware or small plates for bread/appetizers...had to ask for them. Then ordered our meals/drinks and took about 40 mins to get our food.  Ordered the skinnylicious chicken pot pie. It was okay, kind of reminded me of a TV dinner. Diced potatoes and carrots, few pieces of chicken and peas.  We came for my friends birthday and got her the birthday sundae; which was just a pile of whipped cream and maybe a tablespoon of ice cream. IF you come for a birthday, you have to specify that you want more to the sundae or a piece of cheesecake with a candle on it. We thought the pile of ice cream was subpar."
Stephanie G.,"Bloomfield, NJ",274,403,491,4.0,11/10/2015,"Mmm. Cheesecake. The decor is nice (somewhat Las Vegas casino-y? but one of the classy ones) but I like it. It is usually crowded here in my experience, and I'm sure getting closer to Christmas is only going to make that worse. Still going to have better lucky here than at the food court! I do like that they have a whole ""skinnylicious"" menu. Some restaurants have their light options and list 4-6 options. This has a lot of great choices. And as cheesecake is a requirement, it's usually best to go light for the entree. I always try to try a different cheesecake, so this time went with the 30th anniversary which is ""Layers of Our Original Cheesecake, Fudge Cake and Chocolate Truffle Cream."" It was rich and sweet without going overboard, although with the size of the slices (and the cost) you really have to share. Still every slice I've had has been so tasty but I only indulge on rare occasions.  The menu overall is a little pricey but has good variety, so it's definitely a good option if you are at the mall already and want to mix it up from the food court but it will likely be busy and some of the tables are really close together."
Andrea Q.,"Clifton, NJ",138,89,258,4.0,3/3/2017,"Surprisingly high rating for a chain restaurant. We came on Wednesday night at around 7:00 PM with no wait and the restaurant wasn't too crowded. For an appetizer we ordered calamari and it came out right away. The calamari itself was good but all of the breading fell off of it, so that was the downside of the calamari. My mom and I ordered the shrimp scampi combo with the herb crusted salmon. The combos are good because you can mix and match them (there are other seafood or chicken options) and the serving is worth the price of the dish ~$21. I was just sad that the scampi didn't come with angel hair pasta because that is my favorite! But it did come with a huge heaping of mashed potatoes. After our entrees came out, then we got the complimentary bread which I had been waiting for. It came when we were partially finished with our entrees but that was ok because we just took it home and I ate it for breakfast the next day lol! For dessert we ordered the macadamia nut white chocolate caramel cheesecake. It was good but I wish that the macadamia nuts were chopped into smaller pieces. Our waiter was very friendly. Overall impressed with the good service! Also, I really like that the menu has so many different options. Recently just getting into the ""super foods"" so there is a section dedicated solely to that with kale, avocado,etc. And they also have a skinnylicious menu! Small plates vs. bigger plates size appetizers. The menu is so diverse."
Kelly W.,"Newton, NJ",0,21,,3.0,11/19/2017,"My updated review is because I feel the cheesecake factory is going downhill. I have been here 2 more times since my original review. I ordered the mac n cheese balls which have gotten significantly smaller. The cheese triangles my friend ordered had no cheese in them. Burger was ok but again much smaller now the meat only takes up 2/3 of the bun. Getting less for same price which isn't cheap. My past 2 visits, the service has been substandard. The hostess was awesome tho because she was professional and accommodating!"
Roshni P.,"Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ",273,109,270,4.0,2/2/2017,This location is great on weekdays. The wait can get a bit long on weekends but the food is always great. Cheesecake is the reason for going. They have a friendly staff and try very hard to be accomodating.
Miko V.,"Bloomfield, NJ",155,19,8,2.0,1/9/2017,Came here on a double date. Food was absolutely horrible. Ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer. It was saltier than a NYC pretzel. I turned it back and the manager Brian came over to our table to apologize and took the calamari off our bill.  We also ordered Buffalo Blasts. They too were extremely salty.  The mashed potatoes in my chicken Madeira were the polar opposite and had no flavor whatsoever. We brought this to Brian's attention but it seems it fell on deaf ears.  Save your money.
DK N.,"New York, NY",12,71,96,4.0,11/24/2016,The place looks nice and clean. Good atmosphere. The food is not bad at all. Servers are friendly and fast. One star off for a screw up with the birthday girl. Only when everyone's food was brought in the server realized that they are out of hollandaise sauce. We ended up switching it to chipotle mayo...
Raphael S.,"Lake Hiawatha, NJ",219,126,454,4.0,1/8/2017,"Came here yesterday, it was pretty cold and my dad wanted to take us down to cheesecake. Our server was Zeta (I think that was her name). She was very attentive and quick with good service. She refilled bread and drinks quickly. She also was very knowledgeable of the menu, knowing lunch sizes and if there were options we had to choose from. The atmosphere was pretty dark but the snow outside brightened up the room. The music was stuff you'd hear from a light alternative playlist on spotify. Our family ordered the ahi tartare as an appetizer and I ordered the Firecracker Salmon because I wasn't that hungry. The ahi tartare was really good. The chips were incredibly crunchy and added to the texture of the raw fish. The avocado cooled things down and added flavor to the soy ginger sauce. It had a tangy and nutty flavor to it. The firecracker salmon was pretty good. Wrapped in a crisp wrapper tied off with some spinach. The salmon was pretty good, spiced but I couldn't taste it because the spinach kind of took over the show. Otherwise the sweet hot chili sauce made up for it. All in all, a good cheesecake experience and I'd come back maybe to try some more food and some cheesecake."
Tamika J.,"Wharton, NJ",10,181,632,4.0,1/23/2017,I always enjoy my food and service when having lunch/dinner here. Stuffed mushrooms is my fav app and the white bean chili over rice is my most ordered dish. I just recently ordered the chicken picatta which was tasty.
Mac W.,"Montclair, NJ",24,122,76,2.0,7/11/2017,Ate at bar early on a weekday night. Bartender had the place set up like the back kitchen. Staff coming up to gossip. Bartender was not too friendly. Food was average but certainly not higher than two stars. Will definitely not got back. Not sure why in world people are giving this place high rankings???
Charlotte P.,"Wayne, NJ",0,22,1,3.0,8/15/2017,"This is your typical chain Cheesecake Factory restaurant attached to the Willowbrook Mall. It is usually very busy and crowded. The food is usually decent (nothing bad, not extraordinary either). Overall it is not a horrible place to eat but if you plan on going to a five star restaurant this is not the place."
Vince M.,"Pequannock, NJ",11,125,279,4.0,6/2/2016,"First of all, the menu at Cheesecake Factory is mind-boggling. So many great foods to choose from, but including things that are healthy and lunch sized. Decor is classic Cheesecake Factory, with wide aisles and spacious ceilings, the only downside being the level of noise. I chose a green salad followed by the shrimp with angel hair pasta. Both were absolutely excellent! The large unsweetened iced tea was nicely made and clear, so different from the murky made from mix drinks at other eateries. Service was outstanding, and attentive but never intrusive. I just wished that Cheesecake Factory weren't so noisy."
John A.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",0,23,7,2.0,10/1/2017,Really disappointed and i havent even ate yet. We called a couple hours ahead and made a reservation for 6 it wasnt until 6:30 that we were sat down even though we arrived at 5:45. Weve also been waiting a solid 45 min for appetizers. As a cheese cake franchise this is a shame wont go here again. Much better up by rt 4
Cinthya G.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",124,46,15,5.0,9/23/2016,"I love this place!!! Their servers are great, any food you eat there is delicious but my favorite is the dessert. The cheesecakes are yummy and fresh. The wait times may be long sometimes but it's all worth it.  Definitely recommend this place =)"
Eriny M.,"Morristown, NJ",104,70,78,5.0,8/31/2016,Everything my party ordered was delicious. Service was fast and helpful. The free bread appetizers are addicting! The strawberry lemonade was so good. Definitely will be returning
Marison J.,"El Paso, TX",275,64,44,5.0,4/11/2017,"I always receive great service here. It's never too much or too less of service. It's perfect. If any problems arise with your food, they're willing to take the food back and correct it or just take it off the bill. The managers are very nice too. On this particular visit, we had Ryan as our server. He was exceptional. I highly recommend this Cheesecake Factory.!"
Shannon O.,"Denville, NJ",0,20,1,1.0,3/15/2017,If I could give negative stars I would. 2 words: Food Poisoning. Please do not order the fish tacos unless you want to be in bed nauseated with diarrhea headache fever muscle aches chills for 24 hours. I called to tell the manager and never got a call back. NEVER AGAIN will I step foot in this place.
