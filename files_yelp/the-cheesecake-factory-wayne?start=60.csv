Alexus C.,"Paterson, NJ",0,2,,5.0,7/3/2017,It was kind of crowded for a monday but we were seated within 5 minutes. But the service was good and the food was even better. I'm satisfied with going here overall!
Osvaldo N.,"Wayne, NJ",0,3,,1.0,7/2/2017,"Stay await from the bar, unless you want to get charged $10 for a glass of white wine which is filled about one 1/3 of the way 6 1/2 ounces .......ripoff (not the bartender fault)"
Mark S.,"Haledon, NJ",19,433,260,3.0,3/4/2017,"This was my first ever visit to a Cheesecake Factory. It was a Saturday at 12:15pm. I sat myself at the bar. I ordered the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta dish. I was asked if I wanted the larger serving and I said yes. I enjoyed my meal while listening to contemporary adult music that sounds like it should be popular but isn't and watching college basketball on ESPN on tv. It was a small portion. Bland and dry pasta with a jacked up price is tough to swallow. Obviously from being hungry since I had just eaten here, I ordered the Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake. That was pretty good and apparently very filling. There's a good staff and a vast menu but probably not worth the cost. There's no CF wifi and I couldn't connect to the mall's wifi but I did find a signal from a nearby store."
Peter R.,"Belleville, NJ",25,5,,2.0,11/27/2016,"Last month my wife and i went to the Cheesecake Factory to get one of our favorite delicious dulce de Leche cheese cake. I bragged to my wife about the size of the slice of cake and it was enough for both. When I ordered, the size was half the size of the original and the price was higher.  Ten years ago the cakes where enormous and enough for both of us and then some.  Disappointed about the change but, its still delicious. Will definitely go back but not as often as we did."
Jess W.,"Montville, NJ",0,7,2,2.0,6/21/2017,"The service was very slow. The food was mediocre. Fried calamari came out as a huge ball all clumped together. In addition, it wasn't crunchy. The breading was soft and a little moist? For one of the entrees, the rice was uncooked. It was still hard. The chicken riesling was okay."
Victoria T.,"Wayne, NJ",6,32,1,4.0,6/20/2017,"I have eaten here three times within a decade and had no problems there.  My husband adores their cheesecake and the people are always nice.  I think considering the size of it, some of the tables are a little too near to other people's, causing me to hear conversations I really don't want to hear.  The people who work there are always kind.  I never had to wait long to get in, which is also a plus.  Good food!"
Michele D.,"Wayne, NJ",441,255,1079,3.0,1/3/2016,"Such a huge menu, I always have a hard time deciding what to have. Recently had the Mac and cheese burger and wasn't impressed at all. Same with the spinach dip app, it was just missing something. Both items lacked flavor. Have also tried the hibachi steak in the past with was very good, a couple a pasta dishes which seem to be my go to here. Also their salads which are huge!"
Briaunté W.,"Queens, NY",903,519,2662,3.0,12/20/2014,"Dining with my family is always an adventure. It's very seldom that we find a place that meets all of our expectations. I'm proud to say that I'm adding TCF to that list. On a serious note everything about this place screams confusion. There's so much going on with the menu that you may come off indecisive if your waiter or waitress approaches you within 5 minutes of being seated (which our waiter did).  We started off with Tapas which consisted of Chicken Samosas, Mini Corn Dogs, & Cuban Rollers. Nothing was up to par when it came to the Tapas. My mommy ordered  the Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane as her entree. My dad ordered the Hibachi Steak as his entree. I ordered the Bang-Bang Chicken & Shrimp entree which wasn't good at all.  My meal was drenched in Curry Sauce & seemed as if an entire bottle of Coconut shavings was sprinkled all over my food. The Chicken & Shrimp was not served over the rice. It actually surrounded the Brown Rice that was placed in the middle of the plate. I ended up sending it back because it was painfully awful to take another bite. I couldn't pretend to enjoy my meal even if my life depended on it.  The waiter took it back without any qualms & replaced my entree with the Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane entree. My side was an order of Sweet Potato Fries. My entree was great. The only negative thing I'll say about it was the saltiness of the Sweet Potato Fries. A sprinkle of Sea Salt would've sufficed.  What's up with the extremely dim lights? I can't see what I'm ordering. I can't see what I'm eating. I don't find this place to be on a romantic scale where the lights have to be so dim that my dining experience is negatively affected."
Secret S.,"Flemington, NJ",0,21,33,3.0,6/1/2017,Good food and good service. Nothing exceptional but definitely not disappointed. They have a few gluten free options in both main dishes as well as desert. Also offered gluten free bread. It's great how the put the calories information on the menus.
CM M.,"Caldwell, NJ",8,35,1,1.0,11/27/2016,"The waiter got our order wrong.  We waited an hour to get the remaining members of our party served with their correct dishes.  Never saw a manager until I insisted on seeing one.  Waiter admitted that blur was his mistake but the food still did not arrive.   It was unusually busy and we went during lunch time.  I've been here during dinner hours and it was a lot busier.  The manager finally arrived to offer how sorry he was that we have waited so long.  While here speaking to us, the food arrived for our two remaining party. And yes, it was incomplete as well."
Anagha J.,"Hoboken, NJ",5,25,18,3.0,3/12/2016,"Huge variety of cheesecakes! Huge selection of food items! Terrible wait! Every. Single. Time.  I like the food they serve at this place. Garlic noodles is the best thing I like here. Subtle yet flavorful. Avocado egg rolls are the husband's favorite. Especially its dipping sauce. Yes the place is too dimly lit and yes its very noisy but we come here for the food not the whole experience. If we wanted to have a wonderful experience we wouldn't come to a chain restaurant now, would we?"
Sarah B.,"Leonia, NJ",73,28,3,3.0,5/16/2017,"A not busy lunch shift and we ordered tapas, but food took a pretty long time.  Huge menu variety, always enjoy my Asian chicken lettuce wrap tacos, food is always decent, with a few stand our items."
Nancy Beth K.,"Nutley, NJ",82,132,306,5.0,6/12/2016,"I have been here for lunch several times and their salads are always delicious and generous.   But their Sunday Brunch/Breakfast is what keeps us coming back.   Hubby got an omelet with Spinach, sauteed mushrooms, smoked bacon, melted cheese plus a bagel and Cream cheese and breakfast potatoes.   I got the California omelet: avocado, mushrooms, green onions, garlic, shallots, sour cream and melted jack, Swiss and cheddar.  Plus toast and breakfast potatoes.   Both omelets were super fresh and delicious and the portions were very generous.  I have always found the service to be very friendly and professional as well.  Thank you to our sweet server Rachel! As much as we would have loved to indulge in a piece of their outrageous cheesecake we behaved ourselves and passed but got to drool over their display case on the way out."
Adam M.,"Caldwell, NJ",50,16,,4.0,4/15/2017,"Great service great food, been there three times (not from the neighborhood) and never ceases to please"
V F.,"Boonton Township, NJ",9,65,23,4.0,3/9/2017,Thursday night. 5:15pm. Got seated immediately. Server Trever was very nice; he did not rush us. He was refilling drinks without us asking. (Thumbs up - I drink a lot of water.) Fish tacos were very good. Pasta Carbonara with grilled chicken was filling yet needed a bit more flavor. Tried the Reeses cheesecake for a change - didnt like it. I thought it would have actual Reeses buttercup pieces but it had peanuts. I will go back to my Cherry Cheesecake next time.
Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,937,15249,5.0,12/5/2015,"Back for our annual Christmas lunch today. Peppermint Bark Cheesecake is back!  We were seated promptly. Our server came quickly.  Her name was  Ebony. She was excellent. She was very professional. We were visited to see if we needed anything just enough without being pestered. Her service was very timely for desert, clear table, check, and exit! Very good! The food was great. My daughters burger was well done which is not how she prefers. She was so hungry she didn't care. She took her Peppermint Cheesecake to go. For me the lunch size Cobb Salad was huge and naturally I  ate the whole thing. I also ate half the complimentary bread.  I sit right there and enjoy the cheesecake! I had the Vanilla Bean which is now one of my favorites.   By the time we left around 1 PM the place was packed and people were waiting for a table.  They still don't have turkey. It doesn't matter, I can always find something to go with my Cheesecake!"
Stephanie H.,"East Rutherford, NJ",2,35,50,3.0,3/6/2016,"Ten minutes was the wait we were estimated by the host and were given the little hand held that buzzes when the table available. We literally stepped out less than 4 minutes to drop off our shopping bags. We ended up waiting 30 minutes because their handheld didn't buzz. Others were quickly sat in front of us. 4 pairs of two a party of 6 and 4... Need I say more? Surely not happy with their customer service at the host stand. Started off with the warm bread they provide. Highly prefer the brown bread, I just love it with some butter. I got the veggie melt sandwhich with French fries and a side of mayo. The waiter mistakenly brought white rice as my side instead of the fries but had no problem bring my the fries I ordered. He also accommodated me when I asked for some olives and mushrooms in my sandwich. This is a 'new item' on the menu so the chefs are still getting adjusted apparently. I would have rated it 2 stars all together but our waiter was a pleasure to have which averaged the place as a whole at 3 stars."
Danielle M.,"Little Falls, NJ",0,13,,5.0,2/24/2017,"It's rare that I'll dine out at a sit down restaurant by myself, usually it's either if I'm stuck in the city due to snow or years ago on business trips. But today I decided to treat myself to lunch. I've been to this Cheesecake Factory many times, some good times some not so great experiences. The food is standard Cheesecake Factory food. But what really earned them 5 stars today was that no one batted an eyelash that I was dining alone. The waitress was really polite, friendly and efficient. I didn't feel awkward or stared at at all and I completely appreciate that. Thank you for a delicious meal and a pleasant lunch."
Alex M.,"Seattle, WA",0,5,,1.0,8/12/2017,"If you want to order takeout they place you on hold for at least 10 min. This has happened to me multiple times. I ordered the ""antioxidant salad"" and it was a pile of lettuce...nothing about it was correct. When I let them know, I was given a rude looks. They brought it back the same...is this a joke? Don't put items on your menu if you cannot make them correctly."
Cynthia D.,"Pompton Lakes, NJ",0,5,3,1.0,6/24/2016,"My family and I decided to give the Cheesecake Factory a try after so many people we knew raved about it. The atmosphere has a luxury ""cafeteria hall"" experience. Once seated we looked at the menu. Although they had many selections, the food was like food you could get a Chillis/Ruby Tuesdays but over priced.  I ordered a Cheesecake Factory chicken burrito. The presentation was nice but once I cut into and open the burrito, it was 4 julian sliced chicken ""pieces"" of chicken with alot of rice and corn filling the burrito. Not what I expected for $16.99. My husband order the chicken. And shrimp gumbo. We asked how the portion sizes was and the waiter said it was ""big"". When the plate came it was a small cereal bowl size with a scoop of brown rice in the middle. He was also disappointed especially paying $18.99.  We were not ""wowed"" by the taste for the portions of food. We definitely won't be returning."
