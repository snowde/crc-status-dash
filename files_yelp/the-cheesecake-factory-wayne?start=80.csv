Luvleeda C.,"NJ, NJ",49,1,,1.0,8/19/2017,"Service is horrible! After I received my beverage of choice, asked the waitress for a water with lemon. She came back with bread (no water). I asked for a straw, waitress said ""sure no problem"" (never received a straw). I helped myself to some utensils, since none were available for the appiterzers have arrived. At this point, I was restrainning myself. I'm convinced it's her first day or a complete moron. I ordered my food, Jamaican blackened shrimp & chicken. She came back with chicken & spaghetti with prosciutto. After waiting for a 1 hour 1/2, she handed it to me, I was baffled. I told her this isn't what you recommended ""the blackened shrimp and chicken"" she was like sorry. Walks down two tables and comes back. I told her I'm not picky, but I don't eat pork. I saw the waitress conversing with someone to whom I thought was the manager. Unfortunately it was the cook who headed over to apologize for the delay, she was ""working on it"". Cool no problem. Right?!? I'm not even hungry now. Seriously though hour waiting patiently. The food came out placed it in the to go bag, asked for the check. BEST OF LUCK, to all the incompetent employees. WOW. Never again."
A. P.,"Wood-Ridge, NJ",4,44,11,5.0,7/16/2017,"Had the nicest waiter today believe her name was Jill, food was awesome wanted the chicken Madeira but due to diet had the salmon almond salad with kale. It was amazing! Had a great time, this Cheesecake Factory is way better then the one in Hackensack. Will def take the extra drive to go there"
Rachel S.,"Clifton, NJ",0,6,,2.0,7/31/2017,"The cheesecake is excellent, the main courses are average, and the service is downright POOR. My God are they SLOW there! Every time I go I wait 30-40 minutes for my food, not to mention the 20-30 minute wait just to get a table. There are always a ton of people present, and they seem to like to linger a bit too long after their meal as well, IMO. Perhaps it would be a good idea for the company to build another restaurant in a neighboring town? Just a thought. The waitstaff is clearly overwhelmed with the number of diners and just can't seem to keep up....sad. Such a shame."
Raven L.,"Little Falls, NJ",16,95,32,4.0,1/1/2017,"I do love the cheesecake factory, always and forever. Tuna tatake salad is always my go-to with a dirty martini with blue olives. This particular CCF is in the mall so it can be a little crazy but the wait staff is always doing their best to get you in and keep you happy. I will say the chicken ceasar salad is something to be cautious of, garlic breath for days!"
Karin G.,"Clifton, NJ",69,113,85,4.0,6/18/2016,"Love cheesecake factory! Visited this location on Wednesday June 15, 2016.  Our waiter was Joseph. My boyfriend & I ordered the chicken quesadillas as our app, always a perfect 10---I highly recommend this item if you haven't tried it.   My boyfriend ordered the teriyaki chicken.  Came on the bone with black seasame seeds garnish, white rice, platanos & grilled pineapple chucks.  He said it was delicious & he would definately get it again.  The presentation was great. I ordered the four cheese pasta with grilled chicken.  As always, it was amazing.  This dish NEVER disapppints & always more than half to bring home for another meal or two. We took home tirmisu cheesecake & the 30th anniversary cheesecake.  We loved it. I only gave four stars though because I always feel like there is an attitude at all Cheesecake Factory locations.  I don't find the staff to be friendly or approachable or happy.  I would love to see a softer nicer customer friendly focus for this company overall."
Stephanie W.,"Little Falls, NJ",0,6,9,4.0,9/4/2016,"I go back here all the time because the enormous menu has so many delicious and different food options! My favorites are the Mint Iced Tea, Tex Mex Tacos and Oreo Cheesecake!! The Sunday brunch is yummy, but crowded. On other days, I've gotten my food late or it was messed up, but it all turns out okay. I would still recommend it to ppl, but btw it's darker for older ppl lol"
Mary N.,"Verona, NJ",456,255,491,4.0,4/10/2016,I ordered crab hash with pouched eggs and the pouched eggs came out hard boiled. But I will say the manager handled it perfectly. He did offer to order something else and unfortunately we didn't have time to wait for another meal to be prepared. He offered me a slice of cheesecake which I declined (I'm on a diet) but between him and our server I feel the situation was definitely handled properly.
Daniel C.,"West Orange, NJ",11,15,19,3.0,9/9/2015,Had lunch with my girlfriend. The dining are was clwan and neat. I had Chicken Chipotle Pasta which I liked the taste of it. It was midly spicy Chipotle taste. It would be good for the people who likes mild spice. Grilled Salmon was nothing special.  Too me a while to get the food after ordering but the Waiter gave us free warm bread while we wait for the entree which was good. It's bit pricy for the college student like myself for the food even though it was a lunch special.
Sivin R.,"Belleville, NJ",15,17,4,4.0,7/13/2016,"Had a very pleasant evening here with the family as we celebrated my daughter's birthday. She wanted a fun place to go and requested Cheesecake Factory as her birthday dine out . Our server, Bianca, was very attentive to our needs, wants and requests. She was very patient and was always checking on us to ensure we were enjoying our time there. They had no problem adding Salmon to my salad which was excellent. The desserts were delicious and rich. The final check was a little pricier than anticipated but overall not too bad. We encountered no issues during our dining experience tonight so we will definitely return here."
Rachel D.,"Kearny, NJ",126,51,29,5.0,1/7/2017,As always I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. The tuna tar tar was usually enough for me and my husband to split as a small app but now I feel like it's gotten even smaller. The spinach and artichoke dip was good. Their salad (half portion) was really big and loaded with stuff. Their half portion pasta was the same deal. I believe what I got was some sort of spicy pasta dish. It could have used more chicken but it was still really good. I highly recommend this location!
Ralph K.,"Nutley, NJ",2,78,1,4.0,3/19/2017,We just came in for brunch and my wife ordered the  California omelet that was missing the sour cream and the three cheeses listed on the menu.  Our lovely server Alysa brought it back but it was  still missing the cheese.  My wife said it was a good omelet but how hard is it to get it right after two times?
dianna s.,"Livingston, NJ",4,9,3,4.0,12/5/2016,Dave was our waiter on the late evening and he was fantastic!!! We had to chicken samosas which are a must have a the crab bites for our appetizers. I had the bang band chicken and shrimp which is mouth watering. I will all ways choose cheesecake for a go to late night option.
Heather V.,"New York, NY",2,26,3,1.0,10/9/2016,"""Stupid"" does not even come close to describing the servers and wait staff. Slow, ignorant, zero etiquette and zero people skills. Everything is difficult for these morons. Took 20 minutes to get a glass of water. Never again."
Anthony M.,"Passaic, NJ",56,4,,5.0,1/3/2017,The food is excellent!  The prices are fair!  The cheesecake is delicious! I've been to this location plenty of times.  I've had no issues at any of my visits.
Jim S.,"Westmont, IL",0,8,1,2.0,4/30/2017,"I sat at the bar for a bit before ordering shrimp tacos, little loud and bar tender ordered me fish tacos.  Maybe the loudness and inability to hear me, who knows.  Was gonna try the fish and did not like the coleslaw on them.  Shrimp ended up coming out in half the time.  Let's say I should have ordered the chicken salad.  Waiting for cheesecake now, cheesecake was yummy.  Little disappointed little something not taken off the bill.  Sat at the bar and was almost 1 hour 40 mins out the door for one person.  For the hope, very disappointed!"
Jenny K. L.,"Oradell, NJ",166,489,472,4.0,5/2/2015,The food and drinks are solid like they always are at Cheesecake Factory; I can always rely on that. There guacamole however could use a dash of salt and line. Our server was great. She checked in on us at just the right amount of times and the bussers always asked before removing our dishes. We never felt pressure to order more than we did and to leave after we paid the check although when leaving we realized there was a long wait. I appreciated that kind of service for sure! I also love the loooooong booths.
Justin-Carlo D.,"Montclair, NJ",48,28,,3.0,11/3/2016,Food is always good. Love the chicken littles. But serving amount is inconsistent. Sometimes I'll order the same thing and get more food and then the next time noticeably less. And why is it so dark inside. I literally can't see the menu without using my cell phone light. Servings are usually big though feeding on what you get. And service is ok
Julianne W.,"Vernon Township, NJ",245,8,6,4.0,5/8/2016,"My boyfriend took me here Saturday around 4:00 and there was a long already trying to get a seat. Luckily we got seated pretty quickly, but where we sat wasn't really preferred. It was against a wall and I felt crammed and hidden. Once we sat down, the waitress didn't come to say hello or get our drink orders for a really long time. We picked our drinks, meal and even what dessert to get and she still wasn't there. Once she took our complete order she brought our drinks in less than 2 minutes which was great. Our food came out in less than 20 minutes but they messed up my simple order by adding something I said to leave out. They did take it back and fix it relatively quickly. The manager came to apologize and ask if I wanted a salad or something in the mean time for the inconvenience. I have to say that meant a lot that he came over to apologize, because it was brought to his attention that my order was messed up.  The food was really good once we got to eat. My boyfriend loves his barbecue burger and I got the four cheese penne. Our next order he got cheesecake and I got the sundae and the portion was huge. I felt my brownie could of been softer but I'll always order the Godiva sundae. It was the best dessert I've ever had and of course my boyfriend loved his cheesecake. He gets the same one every time he goes"
Thomas F.,"Hopatcong, NJ",35,3,1,1.0,11/6/2016,"Went 11/5 for desert.  The cheescake was okay.  Order two coffees and two shots of baileys to put into the coffee as there are no alcholic coffe drinks on the menu.  We were charged $9 for each shot of Bailys.  Mind you, it was less than 1oz of Baileys (1/8) the shotglass.  The waiter said sorry bro they always overcharge for alcohol and manager said they don't set the prices.  $18 for less than 2 oz of Baileys.  Took 25 mins to get the actual coffee.  $52 for 2 coffees and 2 slices of Cheesecake.  Never going there again EVER."
Jim V.,"Wilmington, NC",16,20,11,2.0,7/5/2016,"I always enjoy the Cheesecake Factory so I was extremely surprised and disappointing when we went to this one on the 4th and were told they were out of a few different items, but they have so much so no big deal right. I order Steak Diane, always fantastic but not this time, badly overcooked, tasted like pepper, no other flavor, hardly any sauce at all, and the sauce is normally amazing. My date got a burger, what could go wrong, also badly overcooked. The service was good as always and we should have complained but I just wanted to have a nice dinner and didn't want to bother with all of that. Unfortunate."
