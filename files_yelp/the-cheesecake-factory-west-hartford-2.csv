Matt J.,"South Windsor, CT",260,216,70,4.0,12/28/2017,"I was a bit put off by the low reviews I've seen for the West Hartford location for The Cheesecake Factory so I thought twice about going here.  We had a gift card, so I thought there was little risk.  I'm not sure where the low reviews are coming from because I had an excellent dinner, night out and date with my wife. The wait is very long.  This is the case at every Cheesecake Factory, no matter where you go.  I was prepared for a long wait and was actually ok with it only being 60 minutes.  I never get out of the house without the kids and having any alone time with my wife was amazing.  The Cheesecake Factory is located in the heart of Blue Back Square so it was not hard to kill an hour shopping.   We got back in just enough time and had a good seat.  Though you are lined up one table after another, you are not stuck in someone else's conversation.  The menu is overwhelming.  If you have not been here, please be prepared for this.  It's also ok to ask the server for a recommendation, I do so frequently.  We stayed with old favorites on the menu. The atmosphere for some alone time was great.  Our server was attentive which is impressive with how busy she was.  Our meal was very good and desert was terrific too.  We had a good time out, alone, no kids and had a warm cozy meal.  I would go back again."
Allie G.,"Canton, CT",122,69,46,5.0,12/28/2017,"I can't believe this place only has 3 stars!!!! I come here quite often and literally have never ever had a bad meal or experience.  Last night we went with my boyfriend and his parents. There was a 45 minute wait so we went across the street to Barnes and nobles. The buzzer told us to come back only after about 20 minutes which made us super happy.  We sat down and started with drinks. I got the pineapple Moscow mule. So refreshing and delicious! My boyfriend had some pink lemonade thing which he said was good as well. We shared two appetizers; the fried zucchini and their new hot spicy nuggets. I usually always get the fried zucchini so it didn't disappoint. My boyfriend and his father said the nuggets were great, super spicy which is what they love. As for meals we all went with pasta. Our waitress was very kind when we all had some type of modification we wanted to make to our meals.  My boyfriend had the Cajun chicken pasta which he added sausage to. Such a large portion he saved half for leftovers. He said it was so good and it was just the right amount of spicy for our liking. I had the chicken Riesling which I swapped out for shrimp. The saucy was a light garlic butter cream sauce that was cooked with bacon, mushrooms, and caramelized onions. One of her best pastas I've had there! I would definitely order it again.  The in laws had pasta as well. Father had a shrimp and pasta with a tomato sauce which must have been good because he ate the whole thing! Mom had a vegetable pasta in a light pesto sauce which she also finished!! She said it was delightful.  We had such a nice night out with them. Our waitress was great, super friendly, and tentative. We will alway come back here to the cheesecake in West Hartford!"
Tiffany G.,"Hartford, CT",182,130,2068,2.0,8/11/2017,"I'm not sure how long this place has been here, but I've been to this establishment twice in all those years. I was excited to go within the first year of when they opened, then I went back again this week. I eat out, A LOT. So when I've only been somewhere twice in all those years, it's because the food was not memorable, nor were the drinks. The only thing memorable is those drink prices!  Anyway, we had a new waitress, which was fine, there's a learning curve so I'm not even complaining about any issues we had with service. It was about 9:30 on a Wednesday so it wasn't super busy or anything. I ordered the Thai Chicken Lettuce wraps. Two others at the table ordered the Chicken Lettuce Tacos from the Skinnilicious menu, and they were no more impressed with their bland meals than I was with mine. They also ordered Skinny Mojitos for $12 and both agreed they felt and tasted not a drop of alcohol in them! One woman ordered a glass of house red wine, which was $9.50! I only know the price of the wine because it landed on my check erroneously, again, no big deal, it was removed and I just paid for my $14.50 lettuce wraps. So, it was years between visits, and it will be years again. I assure you that like this time, if I ever make it back it will not be my decision to go here. There are WAY too many options of places to dine in WeHa than to spend my money here. I forgot to mention the big basket of bread we got. That was good! I mean 3 out of 4 of us ordered things on lettuce to pick healthier options, but we still got tons of bread, lol. We also sat outside on a beautiful night, so if outdoor dining is your thing, then this is a plus."
Daniel D.,"Bronx, NY",182,12,2,3.0,1/2/2018,This place has really gone down hill. Our waiter looked like he just finished smoking a doobie and smelled like an ashtray. Not ideal for someone handling your food. Food was okay but not what it once was. Disappointing considering this was one of my favorite spots.
Sonya Mia M.,"Woodbridge, CT",17,14,,3.0,1/2/2018,"there are plain and simple too many things on menu. It just serves as a distraction for the amount of time it takes for you to order and then to receive your meal. This would be more like upscale take out . Nothing is awesome just ok. Multiple servers ,food didn't come out together....not horrible not great.. kind of a family place but dont take too many people because everyone has to wait for ever this location definitely beats the TRUMBULL CT location wont return there even for free food"
Brad D.,"Newington, CT",0,19,5,3.0,12/30/2017,I'm usually hesitant to eat at a place with such a large menu... Cheesecake Factory proves me right.
Esmeralda K.,"Newington, CT",52,94,167,4.0,9/12/2017,"I've always been a fan of cheesecake, its like the go to for birthday dinner. UNLESS its busy then you'll be waiting for HOURS. They don't take reservations unless its for a large group. The menu is a book, literally. i would recommend looking over the menu before you head over just to get an idea. I've pretty much had everything from appetizers to full on dinner and desserts. The food has always been good, same with service, the servers are always on top of things . I've never had a problem. Let's talk about the building itself and the inside, I've gone so many times and im always so obsessed with the structure they've build its so beautiful, with tall ceilings and shiny shiny floor tiles. They also have outdoor seating during warmer weather. You've got to try it at least once!"
Shawna W.,"Hebron, CT",21,118,3,2.0,11/5/2017,"We went here because we had a gift card. If I could just judge the cheesecake I would give it five stars. Cheesecake is amazing, and the ambience is like a Grecian palace. But the food was AWFUL. Completely flavorless. I chose the carbonara and was told it's extra saucey. Mine came completely dry. I asked for some sauce for it and waited..... and waited.... Finally everyone was done eating and the waitress came by and said oh they never gave you sauce? Anyhow we got six pieces of cheesecake to go, one for each of us, got home and had five pieces of cheesecake. Pretty annoying. I would return purely for the cheesecake because it was so amazing (I got the lemon raspberry cheesecake omg yum) but will certainly never eat there again."
Taylor Z.,"Wallingford, CT",11,3,,1.0,12/19/2017,"Okay, just wondering....how is it possible to be out of the brown bread, tuna, AND sweet potato fries? We came out here to celebrate and now we're just disappointed! What a disappointment. What's next? We're out of cheesecake?"
Loretta M.,"Hamden, CT",44,118,166,3.0,3/12/2017,"Love the Cheesecake Factory but it does have a few flaws.  First and a major one is not enough ""waiting"" area seating. Lot of handicap and elderly patrons and with the wait so long makes it difficult.   My second is the butter for the bread is always rock hard.  Makes it hard to spread  Third the got rid of my favorite cheesecakes. The pineapple upside down cake and the coconut chocolate.  Then the Dutch apple.  Now they have a new carrot cake which is not as good as the previous one I do love the variety of the menu.  You never get bored as you can have a burger, American or Asian to name a few.  The staff is always great and helpful."
SeongYoon C.,"Hartford, CT",50,82,113,3.0,3/23/2017,This was my first time back to Cheesecake Factory since high school. I didn't realize how many calories were in all their dishes so we ended up ordering our entrees off the skinnylicious menu and it was delicious! I had some concerns regarding flavor because it's a 'diet' menu but everything was delicious. We had the lemon garlic shrimp pasta and the Mexican tortilla salad. Both were delicious but skip the Mexican tortilla salad; it's just a salad you can get anywhere probably even cheaper elsewhere. But the lemon garlic shrimp pasta was super flavorful and just the right amount of food. I didn't feel overly full or felt like I just committed one of the seven deadly sins (gluttony). We even had some cheesecake for dessert and didn't feel like we just ate all our feelings. Will I be back? Yes. But this kind of reminds me of a more hip version of Olive Garden; it's your standard franchise.
Abbey B.,"Sixteen Acres, Springfield, MA",26,1,1,1.0,12/15/2017,They have amazing cheese cake but don't take reservations ? So we came and the said we would have a table for us within an hour. We show up they tell us we have to wait 3 hours? We drove out here over an hour for this and they wanted us to wait an hour. If your in a small party of maybe two it might be worth it otherwise I'd take a hard pass.
Amanda M.,"Waterbury, CT",306,167,124,4.0,8/6/2017,"I was very nervous yesterday heading to CF as a party of nine. As a patron that frequents as a normal party of 3-4, I figured we were going to have a long wait. I was pleasantly surprised when I asked how long the wait would be and the hostess said that a large table was available now. Especially when my friend and I walked in and there were about six or so parties waiting.  We were brought over to our table and our waitress was prompt, but I didn't get her name. We didn't feel rushed and the food and service were decent.  People complain and say that CF is expensive, but if you don't get the cheesecake it's a reasonable price for the amount of food you receive.  I do think the menu is way too large personally."
Kat M.,"Plymouth, CT",35,25,,3.0,12/8/2017,"The food is GREAT but the service is SLOOOOOOOOOOOW.  Frustratingly slow at all stages, it's even slow for them to take your credit card and run the bill.  I've eaten here multiple times and it's always frustrating, especially since the food is great."
Sabina B.,"Watertown, CT",0,3,1,1.0,12/28/2017,Usually always love the Cheesecake Factory but the last few times have been extremely disappointing. My boyfriend and I ordered our food and he didn't like what he got so he sent it back and we waited more than 30+ min for them to bring him a new dish after I already finished mine. Pretty ridiculous. won't return.
Tawana A.,"Springfield, MA",248,123,219,3.0,4/30/2017,I've been to the Cheesecake Factory a few times and the food was great but something was off about my recent visit. I ordered the shrimp Alfredo which is one of my favorite dish but unfortunately they miss the mark on this one. Not only was the pasta cold but it made me nauseated. They did take it off the bill but I was still disappointed. My friend had the Cajun pasta which he enjoyed. The Mai Tai was delicious!! Our server was pleasant and offered to make up for my meal. I would visit again for cocktails in the patio
Daryl P.,"Manchester, CT",437,124,215,3.0,9/2/2017,"Anyone that has been to this Cheesecake Factory in the heart of Blue Back Square is well aware of the long wait times it takes to get a table. Preferring to enjoy a happy hour here in the bar before the evening rush you'll find me enjoying a long island ice tea or a draft with a warm crab dip and the bread. It's a convenient location to come have a bite to eat before checking out the live music if you're inside or staying longer in the outdoor seating while taking in local artists and their music or people watching as they walk by. Not much of a scenic view but then again you are in the Square. You'll find your typical dishes here finishing off with cheesecake, go figure. They have their yearly cheesecake day celebration that you're better off grabbing your slice and eating elsewhere because waiting is what kills this place and with every night being a busy night service reflects that."
Anup B.,"Manchester, CT",38,92,296,2.0,9/19/2016,"One of those nights when your favorite restaurant does not leave any stone unturned to disappoint you to the fullest. I really did not expect this disastrous service by Cheesecake factory. It is understandable that you have a super busy night, but there is no excuse to a bad and slow customer service. Especially on a Monday night? Really? We were a group of 6 and ordered a long list of delicacies and ofcourse the ever famous cheese cake to end the supper.  1. Chicken samosa: if you have tried the original Indian version, this is a spoof of that. It is usually a good choice, but this time it was super salty. Needs improvement.  2. Nachos: delicious and authentic mexican. Even though I never visited mexico.  3. Tamale cakes: vegetarian appetizer option but really not worth if you don't like it sweet.  Main course: 1. Chicken bellagio : loved loved loved it !! Crispy chicken with noodles. Unique flavor. Must try.  Overall the food was good. But we had to pay a huge price for all this in terms of our valuable time. God knows how long we were kept waiting.  Drinks arrived after appetizers were gulped down the throat.  Dinner arrived when we were craving for the dessert.  Dessert arrived when we were ready to crash on our bed under the blanket. Nothing was in order.  Waiter apologized for the delay and promised that the dinner will super tasty and be served with extra love and care!! It was like a long boring movie. Management needs to take a step back and understand that there is a huge scope of improvement here. The place might look classy and fancy, but at the end of the day a satisfied customer is what matters the most."
Jaclyn N.,"Middletown, CT",439,202,966,2.0,1/17/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory does NOT take reservations...that SUCKS!!! We received a gift card to The Cheesecake Factory for Christmas and decided to use it towards a date night between my husband and myself. We were extremely upset to find out the restaurant wouldn't take reservations, even days ahead of time. When we got the the wait time was over an hour...terrible. After stalking the bar for quite some time we got 1 seat, my husband insisted I sit and he stood behind me. The bartenders were all very nice and the drinks were made well. We ordered our appetizers at the bar and when our table was ready the bartender made sure our appetizers were delivered to our table.  I do not enjoy the huge menus at The Cheesecake Factory. There are far too many selections, no one thing is done well. My husband and I enjoyed the stuffed mushrooms and crab bites we had for our appetizers. The Cajun jambalaya that my husband had was good and my beef dip sandwich was decent.  We did get dessert but brought it home. Two pieces of cheesecake for my husband and son and a piece of chocolate cake for me. My husband and son loved their Cheesecake and the chocolate cake was the highlight of my TCF experience.  The restaurant is clean, the service is friendly, and the decor is beautiful BUT they don't take reservations and the wait isn't worth the food. Next time I'll skip the wait and hassle and just order as much cake as my gift card will buy at the dessert counter."
Kimii L.,"Burlington, CT",1,39,195,3.0,8/23/2017,Over priced American food. There isn't anything really special for the food. I feel you can get the same food at another restaurant for half the price. Cheesecake is great but again wayyyyyyy over priced. I wouldn't recommend coming here for dinner but just coming for lunch. The lunch deals are excellent and there isn't a huge crowd during that time. If you come for dinner without a reservation be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes they are ALWAYS busy for dinner.
Jonathan Z.,"Wallingford, CT",0,28,4,4.0,11/1/2017,"Marcus was great.  Super professional, great dude, and took care of us.  Will be coming back again.  Food wasn't the greatest though it was past 10.  I'm assuming the kitchen was kinda slacking off and getting ready to close.  Food was barely cooked which is why I'm giving 4 stars.  Service was spot on though."
Jenny M.,"Theisseil, Germany",1,48,219,3.0,8/13/2017,"There is a reason why this place is always on three stars. First my family and i come here at least once a week or every two weeks because our daughter loves the butter pasta with parmesan cheese. They have lots of options in the menu. This place is a hit & miss, sometimes the food is amazing the service sucks!!! Sometimes the service is amazing the food sucks! Last night was not my night:( The potato soup was cold, she took it to the kitchen brought it back it was warm cold not hot, my daughter ordered the kids pasta she couldn't eat it because it has over cooked flapping bow ties with al dente bow ties tasted horrible. She didn't want anything else. I ordered a skinny burger with Cesar salad, guess what the brought the burger not the salad, incredible i was asking my self why? Something so simple it turned in to a very crapy service. The waiter got me a salad i said no worries i ate the burger already. The waiter explained ""we have new people in the kitchen "" ok that is not my problem those are excuses, for what the charge the food should be perfect. Simple food couldn't be cooked right."
Samantha P.,"Vernon, CT",2,11,,4.0,11/1/2017,"Took my mom here for her birthday dinner on Sunday the 29th. Taylor was our server, great personality. Seemed really busy in there for a Sunday, despite that everything w the meal & other tables seemed to flow smoothly. Food was what it should be for The Cheesecake Factory. We all left happy & full."
Alison D.,"Manchester, CT",9,19,14,3.0,2/22/2017,"We stopped by here on President's Day for lunch, our once a year trip to The Cheesecake Factory. The place was pretty busy because a lot of people had the day off like we did! We waited about 50 minutes for a table but once we were seated the service was very quick. Our server was very friendly and attentive. When our drinks were empty he came right over to ask if we wanted a refill.  We ordered mostly from there Skinnylicious Menu to save  some calories and room for a few bites of cheesecake!! We originally ordered the Ahi Tartare appetizer, however, our server came back to tell us they were out.  So we decided to start with the Fresh Basil Tomato and Cheese Flatbread and the Salmon Rolls. The flatbread was piping hot with fresh ingredients, our boys really enjoyed it.  My husband and I thought the Salmon Rolls were delicious, especially the Sweet Hot Chili Sauce but wished the portion size was a little larger. This appetizer would be good for 1 person but not 2 people sharing. On to our main entrées, one of our sons ordered the Cuban Sandwich. This was a large delicious sandwich(enough for a 2nd meal later that evening!) and the other had the Turkey Club. This was also a large portion with extra to take home for later. The only negative about the Turkey Club is that they use a lot of shredded lettuce instead of a lettuce leaf which would have been easier to eat. I had the Tuscan Chicken which had 3 thin sliced grilled chicken cutlets, fresh asparagus and tomatoes with artichokes and capers in a balsamic vinaigrette. The portion size again was large enough for a 2nd meal and very tasty for a low calorie entrée!! My husband ordered the Asian Style Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos. There were 3 ""tacos"" which were messy to eat but very tasty, he especially enjoyed the sauces that came with it. Now onto what they are most famous for the Cheesecake!!! We let our boys each order 1 piece of cheesecake, knowing that we would be able to sample it as well!! One ordered the Key Lime Cheesecake and the other one ordered the Oreo Dream Extreme, both were amazing!! The Key Lime was very tart and tangy while the Oreo Dream was chocolaty and decadent. All four of us enjoyed sharing them and even had enough to take home for the boys to finish later that night. Our family enjoys our once a year trip but wouldn't be able to visit regularly as the prices are to high."
Ashish S.,"East Hampton, CT",3,1,1,1.0,10/22/2017,"We waited 60 minutes for breakfast that came out cold to touch. Manager's resolution was to take one meal off the bill. NEVER AGAIN! Amazing how this franchise is allowed to represent the brand, rather tarnish the brand."
Robb T.,"Manchester, CT",0,7,10,4.0,8/16/2017,"Lots of poor ratings here because of wait times, which is a little unfair. The place is only so big, and it gets packed out. BUT PEOPLE KEEP COMING! MUST MEAN IT'S GOOD! I don't typically review chains, but this needed a little ratings boost. Food is great, servers are (normally) attentive. I ALWAYS get the jambalaya - large chunks of chicken and shrimp on top of al dente linguine keeps me coming back. And of course there's the cheesecake! Just turn off the logical part of your brain that tells you a store will sell you a whole New York style cheesecake for $12 while you're paying $8 for a slice. Do yourself a favor and avoid peak hours."
Vicki B.,"Tolland, CT",65,356,1072,3.0,12/9/2016,"If I rated on quantity not quality it would be five stars. Started with a cup of clam chowder which was a large bowl. That and their delicious bread would have been plenty. Had the Thai salmon which was too sweet for my tastes, although salmon cooked perfectly.  Could only eat a tiny bit of potatoes which were cold.  Server was amazing."
Nicole M.,"Wallingford, CT",0,8,1,3.0,1/8/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but today's visit was less than satisfying. We waited longer to get served drinks than to get a table. Our waiter was terribly slow and inattentive.  I took out food for my husband for dinner and it looked eaten and like half an order- chicken alfredo for $19.99, that I easily could have made for $5.99.  The 3 pieces of cheesecakes we ordered were dry.  And in total the bill was over $100 for 3 of us."
James A.,"Hamden, CT",85,122,4,3.0,11/28/2016,"This place is often very crowded, which we expected.  We came in at 5 on a Sunday and got one of the last tables without a significant wait.  The lighting is quite dim, we had a couple people pull out their phones to light their menus because it was hard to read. The food was pretty good.  I got a mushroom burger which I liked, but the fries are mediocre.  We got dessert, which was pretty good (lots of choices), but nothing particularly special.  For a place called The Cheesecake Factory I was hoping the Cheesecake would be a bit better, but to be fair it is a factory, not a artisanal shop or anything."
Kris H.,"Central Manchester, CT",6,159,150,2.0,5/26/2017,"I love the CF, but this location is a disappointment.  I placed a catering order that was 30 minutes late.  No price adjustment, no discount on a future order, not impressed with the customer service aspect of the experience.  The food was also a disappointment to all involved.  The cheesesteak sandwich wasn't even edible, fatty and three times more bread than filling.  Based on price and food quality I haven't been back.  Very sad, we visit CF's when traveling, wish this one was better."
Elise D.,"Hartford, CT",6,113,48,2.0,9/6/2016,"We were here this past Monday for dinner. I have to say that I was not impressed with the service here. That seems to be a consistent problem for this restaurant, and shouldnt be at the prices they charge. After we were seated we were not greeted by our server for a good 15 minutes. Thats really not an acceptable wait time. We placed our orders for three entrees which took fifty five minutes to come out. Again, considering the restaurant was half empty, this seemed quite excessive.  We were seated right in the booth by the kitchen so we could hear screaming, yelling, breaking of dishes and slamming of things all throughout our meal and it was LOUD.. Either remind your chefs and wait staff that this is a restaurant and act accordinly or place a wall or something up so your guests dont have to hear yelling for the duration of their dinner. Its really not helping the ambiance of the restaurant. Our water glasses were not refilled for 1/2 an hour, our bevarages were not asked to be replenished either. We ordered dessert, waited twenty five minutes (which seems excessive for two slices of cheesecake doesnt it??) and then said we would have to take them to go since we were now late due to the service here. When we were walking out, we saw about 20 plated pieces of cheesecake which led me to believe they were being plated, the servers just werent bringing them out. We enjoyed our cheesecake in the car, on the way home, after finding forks which they somehow forgot to include in our to-go bag.(??) I like the decor and food at the Cheesecake Factory locations but the service is extremely lacking and I cant say that we would be returning to spend another $100 dinner at this noisy and slow establishment."
Nicola S.,"Grayson, GA",95,40,5,4.0,9/16/2017,The cheesecake factory never lets me down. It's a go to restaurant for my family and i whether it be just a quick lunch or celebrating a birthday. This location has good service quick turnaround on the food and just like every cheesecake factory huge portions. It's a great place to share a plate or have a good amount of leftovers.
Desiree D.,"New Haven, CT",172,421,581,3.0,7/29/2016,"The CF has the worst for you food in America. Just look it up. LOL. However, this location is decent. Service was great, food was good. Cheesecake (of course) was slammin and the whipped cream is deliciousssssss. I found the ladies room was in total disarray, very dirty and toilet paper all over the floor. I had to let the host know about no TP in the 2nd stall - it was gross. Overall good, I would go back"
Dan R.,"Simsbury, CT",1546,2068,30593,3.0,1/9/2016,"We walked in tonight at about a quarter to six and The Cheesecake Factory was already in full weekend blitz mode. How about an 80 minute wait in a dining room the size of a skating rink? Luckily, our party of three scored a high-top table in the bar area and we were set for the night. I sure hope their drinks are reduced for Happy Hour, because our glass of Chardonnay ($8.95) and a rum and coke ($8.50) certainly weren't cheap. The opening bread basket  (light and dark loaves with butter) was terrific. The CF menu is absolutely gargantuan, but they get bonus points for offering a ton of calorie friendly choices on their separate ""Skinnylicious"" menu. Lots of veggies, little or no carbs, and the plates are less than 600 calories. We split a terrific appetizer -Thai Lettuce Wraps for $13.95. Six big Boston Lettuce leaves with grilled chicken Satay strips, cucumber slices, noodles, carrots, bean sprouts, and three yummy sauces -  Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew. It was a pretty big dish, easily fed the three of us and it seemed like a terrific value. We all ordered from the Skinnylicious menu. I ordered the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad for $18.50. It was advertised as having ""Fresh Ahi Lightly Seared and Served Rare with Avocado, Tomato and Mixed Greens. Tossed with Wasabi Vinaigrette."" It was four one inch squares of rare tuna, no avocado, 4 big tomato slices, and a lot of mixed greens. It was a pretty big plate of food for 600 calories, but understandably it was mostly lettuce and tomato and very little tuna. As I said, the avocado was AWOL. Service was OK -friendly but with no check-back on the food, and the dinner plates were brought out while we were still halfway through the appetizer. There was barely any room left on our high-top table with the three meals, bread basket, appetizer and glasses all over. It would have been nice to have timed the entrees delivery until after the appetizer was done, but I'll give them a pass because the CF was absolutely packed to the rafters. When we left around 6:30, the lobby was even crazier than when we walked in, as a huge line snaked all the way to the front door. I guess the CF is an OK place to dine after a day of strolling around Blue Back Square, but as a destination restaurant, I'm not really sure that the cattle-call atmosphere and pricing structure would give me a compelling reason to go back."
Nathan A.,"Holyoke, MA",23,8,,2.0,6/6/2017,"Mid afternoon on a Friday, place was almost empty yet we had to wait 20 min for drinks and the kitchen was out of certain items.  This was the second time I've been there and the kitchen was ""out"" of certain foods.  Service was extremely slow and our waitress disappeared for some time.  The cheesecake was good..."
Jon S.,"Bridgeport, CT",278,30,19,4.0,7/24/2016,"I came here expecting the servers to be rude but they have definitely come a long way since 3 years ago. My Cajun chicken Littles came out and were surprising moist on the inside yet crunchy on the outside. Serving size was big- about 10 pieces finger length with mashed potatoes and corn salad sides. If you don't want to park in the garages, try to find parking on the side of the street! Also TONS of PokeStops in the area."
Stephanie B.,"West Hartford, CT",112,74,289,3.0,12/22/2015,"This is the place to go for a GIANT selection of menu options! There is almost always a long wait. But, the best time to go is Sunday brunch! There is rarely a wait at 11:00 and if there is, it's 10 minutes. And there is a delicious grapefruit cocktail that is perfect for brunch. And you don't have to limit yourself to just brunch. The entire menu is available. The dishes are huge- bring half home or share with a friend. The bread is very delicious. All the food here is good. Service is good but plan on a long meal. We like to go when we would like to sit and enjoy conversation with friends over a nice, long meal. Oh, they also serve cheesecake ;)"
Gina G.,"West Hartford, CT",0,21,,5.0,11/25/2017,"Excellent go to restaurant, really good quality food and what I really enjoy is the large portion sizes! I've tried different items like the steak Diane and the combo seafood which is excellent; chicken dishes are really good too; happy hour has some great specials and prices and happy hour is excellent! Great cheesecake that has a variety of flavors and they are so good! The godiva chocolate cheesecake is superb! I enjoy this restaurant a lot and have never been disappointed by the food; I'm going to brunch there tomorrow and looking forward to the weekend brunch! If you don't want to wait long for a table, I would recommend going on the weekdays!"
Rachel S.,"Agawam, MA",0,1,,1.0,2/7/2017,"Honeslty, it was one of the worst experiences . The server didn't even know he was our server. He never checked on us. We had to get a manager involved. In addition , we believe friends of the server were being waited on and tended to. So much to the point we got mocked as they were leaving . There's no other way they would've walked by our table to sarcastically say ""have a great dinner "" when they left . Not only that , but they charged us for an appetizer that we never received . By far the worst. So disrespectful and inconsiderate . I was really looking forward to going here. 45 minutes to recieve a drink is absurd .  I wouldn't suggest it. Really unprofessional"
Bonnie H.,"East Hartford, CT",17,26,1,5.0,9/2/2017,"I had a great birthday lunch here on a fairly busy Saturday. I loved the cucumber lemonaide and the grilled salmon lunch portion with mashed potatos. It was  delicious and a rather big portion for lunch. I also enjoyed the bread basket and the keylime cheesecake which we shared was great. I also recieved a  complimentary shot glass filled with a hot fudge sundae when the server found out it was my birthday. Nice touch. Yes, I reccommend and will return again and again."
