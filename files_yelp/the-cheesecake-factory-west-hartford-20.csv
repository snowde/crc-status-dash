Chris M.,"Newington, CT",0,34,,5.0,12/13/2015,"My first visit here, on a busy Saturday night. Super friendly staff, ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, and it was big, fresh, and nicely presented. Nice balance of heat and flavor. Will definitely return."
Jim B.,"Glastonbury, CT",0,19,,2.0,4/28/2012,"I don't quite understand the attraction this place has. First you have a 30+ minute wait (regardless of when you go). Then you get slow service and food that really isn't very good at all. I've heard that the salads are huge and awesome. Well, they are huge -- but a large Carleton salad was almost all lettuce and nothing else. The New Orleans Shrimp was called ""mildly spicy"" in the menu, so I asked the waitress if they could make it ""moderately spicy"". Sure, no problem. Well, the result was extremely bland, about one step more flavorful than cafeteria food. I can only imagine what ""mildly spicy"" would have been. Now the cheesecake for dessert could very well be terrific, but we opted out. After waiting over 5 minutes for a dessert menu, I lost my appetite. Perhaps next time, I'll just go to the dessert counter and get a slice of cheesecake to go and skip the awful meal."
Terri D.,"North Branford, CT",4598,409,1301,4.0,3/2/2013,"Came last weekend for our first time. Went around 3:30 on a Saturday and had to wait about 30 minutes.  Rumor has it the wait could be roughly 2 hours later in the night. Wish the tables were spread out a couple inches more, a bit tight. Our server was great and on top of things (could also be due to our table being located right near the order placing machine he used.) I had the Firefly martini and my bf had a captain and coke. The bread was different than your standard, nice to change it up. We started with the Fried Mac and Cheese balls appetizer, they were awesome. I had the Monterrey Burger with sweet potato fries and my bf had the Kobe one with regular fries.   As for the cheesecake, AHHmazing. I had the red velvet one, can't really go wrong.  Wish I had a piece of it now (I couldn't even finish the piece I had when we were there!) My man had the Oreo one, is was great too. We had a $25 gift card but the bill was outrageous. Went over to the counter on the way out and got some cheesecake to bring home too. (We had coolers with ice packs in the car, we don't live right next door) Note: The parking spot we had was metered, but the bar inside Cheesecake Factory gladly made change for us while we were waiting."
David H.,"West Hartford, CT",1,17,1,2.0,8/1/2013,"Cheese Cake Factory is a favorite stop of mine for late-night drinks.  The dinner hours are far too busy to be able to enjoy yourself at the bar, but after 11PM it's nice and quiet.  Unlike most of the West Hartford bars, you and your date can actually carry a discussion without having to shout directly into eachothers ears. On our last visit I decided to order desert as well.  I wanted something lighter than the typical ultra sweet cheese cakes, so I tried the strawberry short cake.  It was terrible.  Piles of whipped cream and ice cream over a stale, smooshed up ""cake"".  It was truly unpleasant.  I ate the strawberry slices and left the rest. I also ordered two gin and tonics, neither of which contained any gin that I could taste."
Jason S.,"Southington, CT",162,362,255,2.0,2/28/2012,"Good cheesecake but otherwise the menu is just meh. It's a chain restaurant and they serve large portions but they tend to have nearly obscene nutritional values. Not my first choice but the friend I was with was buying dinner so hey, it was a free meal!"
Chiara D.,"Avon, CT",74,78,35,4.0,11/14/2012,Always SUPER busy so be prepared to wait.  HUGE food portions! Awesome and amazing though.  For being so busy they have great service and amazing food.  Try their mojitos. They are the best!
Marie B.,"West Hartford, CT",0,5,,3.0,6/6/2016,"I've been here several times. Typically on a Friday night and there is usually a 45-60 minute wait which is fine. The wait stuff is usually very good even though I know they are swamped and exhausted. I went one Sunday for brunch and was surprised to find how small the menu was for brunch items. I ordered a Creme Brulee french toast (I do not recommend - too sweet) and a mimosa which the waitress brought to the table and spilled everywhere. It was on my shoes, in my bag, all over my arm, on my lap and all over the table. The waitress just looked like she was having a bad morning so I felt bad, cleaned up the best I could and didn't say anything. The table next to us was complaining because 2 of the 3 people received their breakfast 30 minutes earlier and the one woman was still sitting there waiting to eat. It was weird the waitress (same waitress) didn't wait until everyone's food was ready to bring it all out together. What really bothered me was the waitress never once apologized to me. She asked if anything had spilled on me which clearly she could see I was covered in champagne but never once apologized. The manager also asked if anything had gotten on me and I said yes again but I cleaned it up and it was okay. I was a sticky mess but I didn't want that to ruin brunch with my friend or ruin the waitresses morning. It seemed as though I was more concerned for my waitress and her morning than she was for me... I did however expect for my drink to be comped or something without me having to complain or beg. That's just good business and good customer service. But nope, nothing. Then I went again last night on my birthday. We had about a 30 minute wait at 6:30 pm on a Sunday night. While waiting for our table a busboy carrying a chair dropped it on my foot and it hurt! A manager or hostess was standing right next to the busboy and they exchanged glances like ""oh crap"" and quickly vanished without an apology or anything. Again, I am not a complainer, I know it wasn't intentional but I can't believe the way these situations are handled. It's crazy! It's like there is all children working there. My waiter was excellent last night though. He explained my dinner was burnt by accident and they were making another plate for me and offered to comp a dessert or another appetizer for us. If you go I recommend that you asked to be seated in Ed Juanito or  section if he is working. He will take great care of you."
Marduke B.,"Newington, CT",0,1,,1.0,5/9/2014,"BECAREFUL OF LONG WAIT. Went here for dinner and the host told us there was a half hour, or less wait. Hour & fourty five minutes later they kept telling us a few more minutes. That's what they told us 20 minutes ago, and the same thing 20 minutes before that, and similar before that as well. Sitting at the bar we heard other patrons complain about the same thing. Also this is not the first time this has happened to us, after we just decided to give this place a second chance, what a waste of time. While waiting for our table we hung out at the bar. Drinks were overpriced with hardly any liquor in the blended mix drinks."
Laura C.,"Hartford, CT",0,14,,2.0,3/10/2014,"Where do I begin? It is very upsetting that this place does not take reservations on a Sunday... first of all ... why? And second of all it is located in one of the most busiest parts of West Hartford!! It is busy all the time - whether it is a Sunday or NOT.  So we get there for 5pm and were thinking -- oh it must not be busy on Sundays thats why they don't take reservations. WRONG! I walked into a mob a people waiting to be seated.  Right off the bat I was annoyed - we had plans to go to this restaurant all day and just because I couldn't make a reservation now I have to wait with everyone else for a table! Half hour wait so we decided to have a drink at the bar. I ordered a Mojito & my boyfriend had a Mango Crush -- some frozen drink. They were both good. Our buzzer rings about 25 minutes later so we leave the bar to go get seated .. and the host brings us back into the bar where we are seated at a bar table!! I was LIVID! I just had to wait a half hour for a table and my table is now in the BAR. If I wanted to eat at a bar I wouldn't have gone to this restaurant.  I ordered another drink to calm my nerves and ordered an appetizer. The crab wontons - so good. Super unhealthy but it was a cheat meal.  For dinner I ordered the fettuccine with chicken, roasted red tomatoes & a garlic sauce. It was the worst and most bland pasta I've ever tasted. I dont think there was one bit of garlic in it. I took about 4 bites and wrapped the rest... to be thrown out at home. I of course ordered some cheesecake - the snickers one. It was so good. Standard cheesecake nothing to freak out about. It came from a box. Overall, nothing impressive at all. And I am still mad that I could not make a reservation."
James C.,"West Hartford, CT",0,21,2,2.0,6/4/2013,"Their food is poor, their cheesecake is great, but do you really want to eat bad food in a crowded setting just for good cheesecake?   Their menu is about twenty pages long, probably 300-400 items, all done with complete mediocrity.  The menu is so large they can't do anything really well.  Also, the dozen full page advertisements in the menu make it feel really cheap.  Not inexpensive, but a really ""cheap"" feel. The only reason this doesn't get one star is because its a massive chain so everyone should know what they're getting into going there."
Lauren B.,"Windsor, CT",75,178,132,3.0,1/9/2011,"I'm still not a fan of Cheesecake Factory, but sometimes I just have to suck it up and go when the group decides to go there.  I have done a thorough review of the nutritional info for their menu and there is very little under 600-700 calories...so the last 2 times, I ordered the Tuna Tataki Salad, which has about 440 calories (hey, I'm watching my weight). It is actually really delicious and I will probably order it everytime I'm forced to go there. It seared tuna, mixed greens, tomato slices and avocado with a wasabi vinaigrette. Really, really good.  I finally tried the cheesecake for the first time, the regular cheesecake with fresh strawberries....so good. I'm not a huge cheesecake fan but it was GOOD. So maybe I like the place a little more than I did before (I added a star). I just wish they had a smaller menu and maybe worked on making things a little healthier...I'm not a health nut but even most salads are in the 1000 calorie range...come on. Salad is supposed to be healthy! I will definitely just stick to the Tuna Tataki from here on out."
Byron D.,"Wethersfield, CT",147,372,256,3.0,1/21/2012,"Friday night - 45 minute wait..  Everyone in good spirits - Bar area packed. The service here is really well executed.  Well trained waitstaff , an improvement over my last visit.  The bread..  I liked the brown bread! (Molasses maybe?) The Food:   If you leaf through the menu, there are so many choices it boggles the mind.  How can they prepare so many entrees that are so varied?  The kitchen..  It is ENORMOUS.  You can see a line of cooks plating meals prior to serving them.  This is barely 20% of the kitchen, the real work goes on out back.  This is a really large institutional type operation, not unlike a  high end, well run cafeteria.  The food was fine, ordered three apps, that were tasty.  I was underwhelmed with the main course, and did not bother to finish my entree.   I was a bit put off by their beer offerings as well.  Blue Moon & Sam Adams?    These choices are fine for many folks, but if I am going out to one of the restaurants in the area, I want some interesting beer.  If you are dining with a large group of picky people who have varied tastes..  you could do well to have the event here.  If there is a type of cuisine you are seeking in particular, go local!  This would be a fall back position as a last resort. Carbone's / Bricco - Italian  (Carbone's if it is romantic that you want!) Besito - Mexican (nice dinning)  Plan B - Beef n Beer  (casual) East West Grill - Thai Awesome (not upscale, former diner) Pond House - Eclectic - never disappoints (Brunch great too!)"
Megan P.,"Marlborough, CT",46,65,37,4.0,11/26/2013,"I feel like there isn't a whole lot to say about The Cheesecake Factory that hasn't been said before. We went there on Sunday for some apps and drinks before seeing a movie in the center. We had guacamole, which was better than many of the Mexican restaurants in the area, and the southern style chicken sliders. The sliders were good, think Chick-fil-a, but a little greasy on the buns. I have to say that the service was great this week.  Before getting our table we sat at the bar and the staff were so nice and friendly, we almost opted to sit there just because we were having such a good time with them. Our server was also super friendly and very attentive."
J L.,"Middletown, CT",138,743,262,2.0,3/26/2012,"Oh cheesecake factory, why do you try and do SO many things? Your menu reads like a novel, it's 28 pages including advertisements.  I have to ask, what's your average table time, because surely a 28 page document takes some time to get through. The shrimp n grits were awesome, i wish i could have gotten a bigger portion (they were on the tapas menu).  Although the shrimp on the top of the pile with a huge black vein running through it was pretty off putting. My ""navajo"" fry bread sandwich was BLAND BLAND BLAND.  Even salt couldn't revive it.  And the chicken was cooked beyond recognition, it was drier than the mojave.  My fries were the bottom of the barrel, dry and cold, mixed with burnt bits & scraps from the other fry bins.  I could only tell because my wife's fries were straight from the fryer, golden & delicious. Consistency is a problem here, except with dessert, the cheesecake is always good, and may be the only reason to go."
Janelle S.,"West Hartford, CT",128,244,51,3.0,4/1/2015,"Well, I am not one to normally frequent chain restaurants, but the food at Cheesecake is pretty decent.  My date and I ordered the nachos to split while we were waiting for a movie to start down the street.  The nachos were good and they were easy to eat due to the very orderly presentation in which they were delivered.  We're not talking your normal giant pile of chips and toppings on a plate, this was 2 flat rows of chips with toppings in the middle.  While normally I may not have commented on this, it made it much easier to eat in the dainty kind of way you may want to eat in front of someone you are still trying to get to know!  Our waitress was a bit intense.  It's nice to be checked on from time to time to make sure that we have everything we need, but the number of times were checked on bordered on comical.  It's not necessary to be checked in on 6 times during what we clearly said was just soft drinks and nachos!  I guess better to have too many visits than not enough though.  Overall, a good experience."
Jessica M.,"Hartford, CT",0,21,,3.0,9/5/2015,They offer anything you want to eat. If you want anything that's not on the menu they will try to see if they can still make it. A bit pricey though but oh my god the best cheesecake I've ever eaten in my whole life is their original cheese cake with strawberries. So good I'm addicted. The service could be a lot better though. I would love to see cheesecake be around forever. I just wish the hosts were friendlier. And the servers were more attentive.
Sebastian B.,"Tiverton, RI",0,5,,5.0,11/30/2013,"This place is AWESOME. This was the first time I ever went to the location in West Hartford. And boy it was amazing. I went with my grandma, and we ordered things of the Skinnylicious menu; all except for the cheesecake. We got the edamame, asian chicken lettuce wraps, sausage and ricotta flatbread, and of course, a strawberry cheesecake slice.  We ate EVERYTHING. Service was excellent, and prices are fair? YES!  The prices were completely moderate, nothing bad about them.  Next time I head to CT, I will make sure to think about going here again."
Frances S.,"Hartford, CT",23,9,,5.0,2/24/2014,"Flipping fantastic!!!!!! Love love love this restaurant - great food, great service and the cheesecakes are awesome!!!!!"
Emily B.,"Fairfield, CT",15,388,150,3.0,10/14/2012,"Went here last night with a group of 12. We put our name in around 6:30 and they told us it would be about two hours. We waited across the street for the full two hours and then we decided to check in. We then waited another hour for our table and we finally all sat around 9:45. I understand that we had a large party, but over estimating the wait by an hour seemed unusual for a chain restaurant.  Since it was so late, I avoided the main menu and selected the white chicken chili off of the SkinnyLicious menu. My meal was good and very tasty, but I think I had a quarter or third of the portion size of meals off the normal menu.  Everyone seemed happy with their selections and a lot of people took their left over meals home."
Ryan D.,"Coventry, CT",78,191,81,5.0,5/6/2014,"got the Santa Fe chicken salad -- a dinner portion at lunch -- and it was ridiculously good. i have been trying to duplicate it at home but obviously if you want the best thing, go here. i was skeptical of this place as I've heard it's on numerous lists for ""Least Healthy"" restaurant, but we went here for my son's 3rd birthday lunch after hitting up the Children's Museum in West Hartford.  Got here at noon and it filled up quickly after we were seated on a random Wednesday"
