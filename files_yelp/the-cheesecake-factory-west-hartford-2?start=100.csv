Madison B.,"South Glastonbury, CT",1,23,1,4.0,6/24/2016,"I love this place, but dang they got rid of my two favorite dishes: the hummus plate appetizer and Fettuccine with chicken and sun-dried tomatoes!!! Other than that, this place is to die for. Love love love cheesecake! Get the Fried Mac & Cheese if you are starving! Love the Tropical Smoothie too it is amazing. Go here when your in town!"
Rachel C.,"San Diego, CA",466,103,45,1.0,2/26/2015,"This is by far the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. To start it took our waitress about 20 minutes to come by and take our order causing us to miss happy hour, to which she shortly replied nothing I can do. Fine no biggie, I order a full price martini.  When she brings it, the glass is literally less than half full. I've never seen this at any restaurant, so I ask the waitress about it and she says they're all measured to be 1.25 ounces according to a standard recipe, not really worth $12, but whatever. We're sitting in the bar area and I see the bartender make about 50-60 drinks while we're there, all of them full to the brim and he didn't measure one single pour. Oh well. We move on to appetizers and the flatbread takes about 30 minutes to come out and it's burnt and half the normal size, I get them all the time, so two bites later we're done with that.   Then it takes another 40 minutes for the salad to arrive and when it does its all white iceberg lettuce, not the romaine it's supposed to be. I'm sure you can't get the freshest veggies in Connecticut in the winter but the salad was just fine at Chilis the night before. Oh plus the women's  bathroom was out of toilet paper and soap. Luckily I always carry tissues and hand sanitizer but major health code violation, I don't want to think about their employees obvious lack of hygiene."
Briana S.,"West Hartford, CT",0,10,,1.0,7/10/2016,"To start off the food was okay. The chicken was alright. There was too much breading on it and the chicken was dry. The mashed potatoes and corn were very good. The cheesecake was great as always. But when we ordered our cheesecakes, I told the waitress, Hayley M, that it was my friends birthday, (just a side note she was Puerto Rican). When we got our cheesecake there were sprinkles and a candle that she lit as she put the cake down.  That would have been fine if the white family next to us had gotten the same treatment. But when they got their cake the staff went over and were singing and clapping for the white family.  I don't know if it's the case that I think it is, but if it's true I think Cheesecake Factory should change that."
Lan K.,"Manchester, CT",83,180,269,3.0,3/23/2014,"Always a long wait here, at least after 5 pm, I've never waited less than 45 minutes. The service is always decent though and friendly.  Their food can be a hit or miss. Their Thai lettuce wraps from their appetizer menu is one of my favorite things to get EVER ANYWHERE. I like that they have a small plates menu and skinny menu since their normal portions are huge. I love their avocado egg rolls and tex mex eggrolls. However, their dynamite shrimp was not so good. From the description, I thought it was a spicy sauce like a chinese hot and sour sauce, but it was basically mayo with some cajun(?) spices. Pretty bland.  Many of their meals are mediocre too. I've gotten their alfredo shrimp pasta and it was just okay. Love their salads - fresh lettuce and ingredients. I stole their BBQ Ranch chicken Salad idea and make it at home all the time. It is SO SO good, but a lot of work so I still get it when I go there sometimes.  Really, their menu is huge. Finding something that sounds good won't be hard, but picking something that is actually tasty can be a gamble.  Their cheesecakes though, always a safe bet. Surprisingly, their Low-Carb Cheesecake is still scrumptious. It is my go-to cheesecake after, usually, eating their huge portions."
Semi C.,"Hartford, CT",0,12,6,4.0,6/27/2015,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory Restaurants all around the country, but haven't been to one in a while because of....CALORIES!  Last night, I stopped by with a friend and was pleasantly surprised to discover the new ""SkinnyLicious Menu"". This menu has a wide variety of much healthier options for slim-oriented people.  My friend ordered the Chicken Shumai and I had the Shrimp Potstickers. Very delicious and affordable at $6.95 each. The portions are smaller than what you would get if you ordered from the regular menu but very filling.  I'm really pleased that Cheesecake Factory is offering this menu as it speaks to budgets and health concerns without compromising on taste."
C N.,"Avon, CT",0,27,,5.0,6/14/2017,"My son pick the restaurant and my wife was less than excited. She was hoping to visit one of the new restaurants in West Hartford. We were anticipating an hour wait as there is always a line when we walk bye. Much to our surprise there was a wait to sit outside but tables were available immediately in the dining room. A quick look and the dining room was 95% full. Immediately after we were seated our waitress arrived and took our drink order and asked if this was our first visit. As we looked over the menu and it is a menu, we noted several new items. We ordered the chicken pot stickers and the sausage and ricotta flatbread. They were both excellent. I highly recommend the flat bread as it was delicious. For entrees we had clam chowder, the french country salad, the chicken, mango and avocado salad, and fettuccini alfredo with chicken. The kitchen was operating on all cylinders as each item was well plated and delicious. We all shared a taste of each others items and had positive comments for each. Hard to think that they would be able to make the food experience any better - until we tasted the cheesecakes. We ordered the  chocolate mousse cheesecake and the mango key lime cheesecake. WOW...the forks were smashing into each other as we shared desserts, Although we had a few doggie bags for our entrees the dessert plates were picked clean. Service A+ very attentive and timely, food A+.  And my wife was telling her friends later in the week what a great experience she had and was look forward to returning.  If you have not been in a while they are worth a visit."
Donna M.,"Ellington, CT",0,5,,4.0,6/9/2016,I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory! The menu is extensive and the portions are very big! I love the location in Blue Back Square. It's my favorite go to place where everyone in my family is happy! The Cheesecake is EXCELLENT!
Lauren D.,"Meriden, CT",106,127,179,1.0,12/20/2014,"Went here last night, arrived a little before 9. Ordered firecracker salmon as an appetizer these were delicious however feel like 12 bucks was a little steep for the 2 eggrolls cut in half but like i said good so didnt really care. Well about an hr since we ordered our dinners finally came out. My boyfriends was warm ,mine was ice cold! We both got steak dishes that came with mashed potatoes. Mine was way too cold so i sent it back. The waitress literally comes back with my same exact plate 5 mins later- i think they either threw it in the oven for a few mins or just threw the steak only on a flat top but either way everything was still cold (plate was hot). I couldnt eat it, she just said sorry and boxed it for me. 100+ bucks later didn't even get  to eat dinner and still paid for it. Ill never go back."
Giang-Tien M.,"Plainsboro Township, NJ",2830,1127,3869,3.0,5/10/2015,"Tasty americanized Asian fares in a nice decor with great service, clean bathroom, etc."
Jason M.,"Berlin, CT",118,1005,25,4.0,11/30/2014,"I'm ready to give them one more star, contradictory as it may sound to my previous review. Even though the corporatization of The Cheesecake Factory soars ever upward (HDTVs flashing high-resolution images of the same desserts served from the display cases below... seriously?), they are worthy of some praise, and the primary reason is value. Almost all of the entrees are below $20, with many sandwiches in the $12-14 range. Cheesecake is $7.50, and slices are easily shareable. Considering the high-class atmosphere they seek to put forth here, I think it's fair to say that you can have a very reasonably-priced meal at TCF. It took a recent visit to Fleming's (another chain restaurant) to realize all this. When a brief scan of the menu led us to realize that a Fleming's dinner would likely make us $150 poorer, The Cheesecake Factory started to look like an unmitigated bargain. It's pretty good. I do maintain my previous point - that I'd never wait more than a few minutes for a table here - but for a late night dinner or weeknight out, it's an option."
Melinda L.,"Meriden, CT",29,148,6,4.0,12/21/2014,"Huge... The food here is huge, the restaurant it's self is HUGE!  The taste was pretty huge too.  I had the Cuban rolls and I really liked them. A little on the greasy side but they contained pulled pork and were wrapped in a won ton type wrapper.  The real star was the Lemon Meringue Cheese Cake.  Oh my gosh.   The down side... It was super crowded and very loud.  I had to shout so my date could hear me. The foyer was so busy with people waiting for tables it was hard to get in or out of the building. On a good note though, the waitress was lovely and helpful.  I'd love to go back someday if I can get in."
Vermillion R.,"Springfield, MA",3,18,,1.0,11/23/2014,"I have eaten at Cheesecake Factories all over this country and I really hadn't had a bad experience until today. Honestly, all of my previous visits have been great, but my lunch today in the West Hartford location was kinda awful... How can a place mess up a cheeseburger? I took a chance on the buffalo burger and was truly disappointed by it. The onion ring batter tastes like the fryer oil hadn't been changed from having fish in it (nasty), the buffalo sauce was used sparingly, and the burger was not medium...  Pink is medium, but pink and cold means raw. Gross. The only thing that let me give it a star was the cheesecake. If your restaurant has cheesecake in its name, you had better not mess that up."
Kelly Y.,"Newington, CT",109,296,19,4.0,9/30/2013,"Take out:  way better than being there because there is still a 2 hour wait for no good reason.  a line to even give your name. the chicken potstickers were potent and delicious.  the fresh country salad was also fresh & good.  the bang bang was good, but not sure why it was $18.  chris's cheesecake was too rich for me.  but the lemon raspberry cheesecake was very good!  we got mini loaves and bread & butter, and lots of cutlery to go the take out lady was very nice and cheerful :D"
John D.,"Newington, CT",2,93,70,1.0,12/29/2014,"Ordered chicken wings for appetizer along with a crab dip and Mac & Cheese balls. Ordered plane wings with no sauce, rub or anything else one can possibly think up to mess up the taste. Wings came out with some batter flower thing on it. I questioned it and apparently they make the wings, freeze them and when wings are ordered they fry them up again. Let me tell you 1 they taste like leftover and 2 they are leftovers. The crab dip had way too much mayo. Nothing worse than old worm mayo taste. Finally kids had the Mac and cheese balls. They tell me they really liked it. They look good too. I typically order steak with a bone in it. My favor it is a bone in ribeye. They don't have a steak here with a bone in it. Steaks on the bone just have a much better taste. I'm sorry but they should know that. They seem to take the cheep way out ordering poor quality beef.  Overall the only good thing we had was the Mac and cheese. I'm sure there are other items on the menu that are good. I've eaten here before when I wasn't watching my diet. I seem to remember good pasta. So if you want to have a carb fest. This may be the place for you. Overall this place tAkes corners and the quality of food is low. McDonald's version of fine dining I guess. My kids seem to like it, but then again they would be ok eating a hotdog from a New York subway too."
Kitti O.,"Glastonbury, CT",136,186,306,3.0,8/27/2013,"I've been here a few times now, if I Never gave it another chance I'd be giving it 1 star. When you ask for a table it usually becomes a long wait, the service feels rushed, I'd get the waitress who asks how the meal is as I take my first bite and can't talk nor do I know if its any good yet...it all seems impersonal and the food is mediocre  However... If you want good service from staff who cares more... Seated at a timely fashion.. You should go straight to the bar.  Every time we ate there even the food came out better.... I really don't understand why but it really does. I can't comment on dessert as every time we considered it after our meals we were too full to actually try.  You have to pay for parking and the garage is your best bet, I'd hate running back and fort feeding a meter.  It's a nice safe area with plenty of shops and things to do, a really nice and clean movie theater across the street. This may not be your date night pick for a restaurant but if you are coming with your kids (family) this place is right for you."
K And A.,"Middlesex County, CT",2,33,2,2.0,2/26/2015,"I've been determined to review The Cheesecake Factory since my last visit, and now that I've finally become a Yelper, I can. A and I went here on a whim one cold night expecting a warm cozy meal. It had been a while since we had sat down in the restaurant, typically we order cheesecake to go because it's so busy and they don't take reservations.  The cheesecake will always be delicious (though I shouldn't tempt fate and jinx it) and is the only thing saving this from being a one star review. Not only was it cold outside but it was FREEZING in the restaurant. I sat through the entire meal with my coat on I was so cold. I kid you not, the waiter brought over a MUG OF HOT WATER to warm my hands over.  Service was slow. The food was forgettable in every way. A and I haven't been back since, not even for the cheesecake :( I used to love the cheesecake factory, it was a go-to spot, worth the wait. I don't know what happened to this location but I probably won't be giving the sit down, full meal experience another chance for a very long time. -K"
Natalie S.,"Holyoke, MA",68,18,2,2.0,7/14/2016,"Five minute wait right when we walked in, even though there were a bunch of tables unoccupied; maybe the restaurant was understaffed. Waitress came pretty quickly to table and brought us waters and we ordered an appetizer. A runner came and delivered us our ""Fried Cheese"" (aka mozzarella triangles) and when they came out and some weren't even filled with cheese! They were just the breading. Waitress came over next AFTER we finished the appetizer and hadn't even taken our main orders yet. I ordered the chicken parm and my boyfriend ordered the Cajun chicken pasta. Boy were delicious, however a second man brought this food to us, asked if we wanted Parmesan cheese (we said yes) and he never returned to the table with it. However he did walk by our table MANY times afterwards, simply adverting his gaze. The waitress also never stopped to check in how our food was, until the very end to ask if we need boxes. Sad because last time my service here was much better! Two stars because the food was good!"
Joe J.,"Cromwell, CT",0,8,,3.0,1/28/2015,I was with my friend and we want to go to a food place. So we just pulled in to the nearest one we saw. I order the chocolate cheese cake and here's what I thought of it. Pros: The cheesecake  had a great presentation. The chocolate was very good it had a great taste to it .  The over coding was great. The vanilla was superb and it was creamy. The vanilla combined with the chocolate was delightful. Cons: The chocolate was little to dry and it wasn't the best I tasted. The vanilla tasted little limey and little out of date. The wait was about 40 or 30 minutes long and we did not enjoy that. And it was too sweet.  Overall its not the best place but it's decent.
Zory C.,"New Britain, CT",53,9,28,1.0,4/18/2014,Called ahead to anticipate wait. Waited got called to wait again. Server hardly checked in.  Ordered classic burger after over 30 minutes of a wait for simple quick entrees my burger came out smothered in cheese which it did not come with nor did I ask since I do not eat cheese.  Disappointing visit further confirming us not coming back unless we absolutely have to.
Scott S.,"Durham, CT",1,12,1,3.0,12/4/2014,I have eaten here a few times in a few locations.  I don't know why but there is a wait every night.  You hear they are in trouble financially and that blows my mind.  They (at the time) charged $10.25 for a captain and diet coke.  I asked the bartender who decided that $10 wasn't enough and that they needed that extra  . 25. Now if I was a restaurateur and I had a wait every night I would make sure I had a few cocktail waitresses taking care of the people waiting since the bar was also packed.  In the hour I waited I probably would have ordered 3 drinks just to bear it while I just stood against the wall.  I fought to the bar to order our party of 4 drinks.  With a cocktail waitress they probably would have sold 10 and had customers having a better time during a painful wait.  We finally get our table and here comes my diner pet peeve.  A menu that is way too big.  How can you expect food to be fresh and prepared correctly when a chef has to cook 70 different dishes on the menu?  The food is no better than the other chain restaurants with the exception of........  Dessert. I would have given 2-1/2 stars if it wasn't for the dessert.  I do have a pet peeve here too though.  It seems that if it is slammed like when we are there there is a separate line for dessert and you have to get in it even from your table. We got our desserts to go and still had to wait 25 minutes because they were backed up.  Sorry and it may only be my opinion but if I just dropped $75 per person in you family restaurant I should be served before the guy who just walked in off the street (and I have been that guy in off the street a few times).  I should not have to wait souffle times for a slice of cheesecake. No wonder the wait for the table is so long when people have to wait an extra half hour for dessert.  I'm  Drinks- good Food- adequate Dessert- excellent
