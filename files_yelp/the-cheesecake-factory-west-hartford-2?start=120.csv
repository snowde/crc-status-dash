Sandra S.,"West Hartford, CT",4,23,,3.0,9/5/2015,"Positives:  Great location right in Blue Back Square, next to a movie theater!  Catch a flick and then a bite to eat.  Family oriented so a great place to take the kids.  HUGE portions.  Their caesar salad is, literally, large enough to feed 4!  Clean, nice interior, outside seating available, many choices on the menu. Two great frozen yogurt places nearby for dessert.   Negatives:  TOO many choices on the menu:)  In the sense that, sometimes with so many dishes, nothing is ""special"" or done really well.  For ex., I would not recommend an Italian dish.  My friend said he had the worst pasta dish of his life there.  Also, the biggest negative is the wait!  I have waited for up to 45 minutes!  Avoid the busy times.  Virtually no place to sit while waiting so be prepared to stand around with a big crowd of people.  They do give you a beeper, so you can wander off a bit... All in all, a decent 3 star family restaurant."
Marcela B.,"State College, PA",0,9,,1.0,7/1/2015,"I want to begin by saying that I WAS a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I have eaten at them in at least five different states, but this last experience has left me no desire to ever go to another one. It was one disaster after another, but nobody there seemed to notice, care, or be the least bit surprised. To begin with, the service was slow and then they brought us the wrong food. When we got our food,  shrimp wasn't cleaned and the salmon was over cooked. We paid a lot of money for really bad food. Our dessert was good, but they forgot to sing to my daughter. Sadly, one of the worst dining experiences in quite some time. Took us over one hour to get our meal and over two to get out! My advice is go anywhere but here!"
Patrick W.,"New Haven, CT",57,5,,2.0,6/26/2016,"The first time I came here it was a fantastic experience. Upon returning the wait staff remained perfect, but the food fell flat. Raw chicken, overcooked salmon, oily sauces, and missing ingredients in salads. Coming here looks like too big of a hit or miss to return to with it's high price point. We won't be returning."
Mai M.,"Manchester, CT",1,26,9,1.0,6/25/2016,"Ordered pick up and highly disappointed. For starters, I didn't expect to be greeted by such a rude and snappy cashier! Also, my shrimp was over cooked and tasted like chicken. Definitely wasn't worth the 30 minute drive or the money."
Lori G.,"West Hartford, CT",17,10,2,1.0,11/7/2015,Terrible food!!! Waited 2 hours and they messed up two dinners and screwed up the redo too!!!! I will never go back!!!
Anonymous A.,"Ellington, CT",3,17,,5.0,7/26/2015,"My husband makes fun of me (as he has travelled world-wide and has had many more dishes than I), but this is my favorite restaurant. I LOOOOOVE the Cheesecake Factory, and ask to go there every birthday. I try to convince my husband to go way more than that, though!  I always order the same entree: the bang bang chicken and shrimp. It. Is. To. Die. For. I never liked curry, have never been a huge indian food fan, but this dish is fantastic. It has apple slices in it which give it a little sweetness. You can order with white or brown rice, so if you are health conscious there is a choice for you!  We have tried the salmon rolls as an appetizer, amazing. Same for the pear and goat cheese flatbread. I tried their Georgia Peach cocktail and have started making it at home now.  The best? Their cheesecake. I love everything fall- related, so when they roll out their pumpkin cheesecake, I feel like twitching with happiness. My husband and I always joke around about a time shortly after we started dating, when we had visited this location and he had to use the bathroom: he gave me his credit card and told me to order whatever I wanted, and a slice of red velvet for him. Well, I ordered a whole pumpkin cheesecake for me, and one slice for him !!!  Joke ended up being on me as the cheesecake was frozen, but thats another story...  The service is wonderful, everyone is super friendly and knowledgeable about menu. I will continue to come to this location as long as it exists."
Lulu A.,"West Hartford, CT",17,123,68,1.0,7/2/2015,"I'm really quite bummed at our experience tonight. Appetizers were great, waitress was to the point. Ordered a $17 dinner of chicken with biscuits. They biscuits came out a step below burnt and hard as a rock. Carrots were cut huge and were a step above raw. Bland tasting dinner, but good quality chicken. Found a hair in the crust of my cheesecake. No Bueno. Spent $100 for two people. Really not acceptable. Was here for my friends birthday. Told waitress and when bringing out her cheesecake there was no singing just a candle, with waitress explaining ""we don't do that here"" and walked off. I would like to let management know this, but website doesn't have a way to email. May call in the am. Now looking looking through reviews it appears many 1 star reviews over the last week with same complaints of dirty, over/under cooked food and bland. It's a shame."
Ryan O.,"West Hartford, CT",3,16,6,3.0,1/31/2016,"Visited for lunch today.  Enjoyed the meal but experienced a slight table mix up.  To start we were brought to a table near the bar area.  Very well lit, in the middle of it all, a desirable location.  After about 15 minutes we were approached by the manager.  He informed us that we should not have been seated in that location as they were reserving a number of tables for a large group coming in.  He directed us to a different table.  The new spot was a booth by the kitchen and a cash register station.  Dark despite being mid day, not the best, slightly annoying.  I will say however that the manager was very professional about it and went as far as to comp us for our appetizer.  As the wait staff brought our drinks and food to the new location they forgot an item and I had to ask for it. Even further, when the bill arrived, the appetizer had not been removed, so I had to ask that it be adjusted as well.  I suppose it may not be the fault of the wait staff as they did not cause the original table mix up.  As always, extremely difficult to make a food selection based on the sheer size of the menu.  They seem to have anything and everything that you may want.  Decided to try the egg roll sampler.  Enjoyed all but the salmon egg roll.  Just a little too fishy for our liking.  Very pleased with the four different dressings/dipping sauces that came with the appetizer.  The lemonade was good and even contained a sugared rim, but it had such a sour taste to it that I needed to water it down.  We got the lunch size Pasta da Vinci and the Italian Turkey Sandwich.  Both portions were large enough that we couldn't even finish them there.  Enjoyed the food and the experience, while slightly annoying, was still quite enjoyable.  Certainly recommend visiting and we will be sure to return as well, as slight mix ups can always occur."
Alexis S.,"State College, PA",0,1,,1.0,7/1/2015,"I don't really yelp all that often, but I just had such a terrible experience tonight that I needed someway to vent out my displeasure. First off, we ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer, as I am a pescatarian and do not eat meat. However, when we tried it, it was very off, as it tasted nothing like crab and was liquidy and cheesy. After having eaten two bites, my mother realized that there was bacon in it. They brought us the entirely wrong appetizer, and I ended up eating meat. Next, it took 50 minutes to receive our food, which was overcooked and under seasoned. On top of this, the shrimp we ordered was not cleaned properly and two out of the four pieces were full of poop. After talking to the manager, twice, she assured us that the appetizer and the shrimp would be free, and dessert would be on the house as well. So we ordered our cheesecake and waited for the check. When they brought it back, we were being charged for everything. Our waiter then went to talk to the manager for a third time, and when they brought back the check, they only took off the ""crab cakes"" and the shrimp, leaving all of the dessert and a $75 check. Tired and just wanting to go home, we payed the check and left as soon as possible. Overall, it was a two-hour long, horribly bad, overly expensive meal, and an experience I would not wish on anyone else."
Maggie L.,"West Hartford, CT",74,119,110,2.0,5/10/2015,"I will never, ever understand why people choose this Cheesecake Factory over any of the hundred locally owned, well-run restaurants in Hartford or West Hartford. I went once for dinner and will never go back. Crowded, long wait, noisy... After waiting 30 minutes, we sat almost on top of the table next to us. Yes, the cheesecake is good, but get it to go from the counter! You can get a meal five times as good for the same price within walking distance. Don't bother with this place."
Monique A.,"West Hartford, CT",247,177,1278,3.0,12/4/2012,"Keeping it short and sweet. Good location, good food (now offering a SkinnyLicious Menu) for those who are health conscious. A laid back atmosphere and friendly staff. If half stars were available I would give it 3 1/2 stars. It's not a five star dining establishment but it serves its purpose and doesn't disappoint."
Mitch W.,"Monterey Park, CA",961,856,7732,4.0,8/5/2011,"After waiting 30 minutes for a table, we found a seat at the bar.  The wait on a Saturday night for two was about an hour (very busy Cheesecake Factory). We were hungry and ordered the Factory Chopped Salad and the Turkey Burger to share.  Our server/bartender was excellent!  She filled our water glasses when they were getting low, asked us several times if our food was prepared the way we like it, and took care of our requests quickly.  The turkey burger seemed slightly larger than other Cheesecake Factories we've eaten at, but it might have been our imagination.   I like the bar area because you can watch a little sports in addition to having an excellent meal.  Prices were the same as in California.  We had a great meal for $25 plus we had some of the salad to take home! Cheers!"
Rachel W.,"Wallingford, CT",15,10,2,4.0,12/1/2014,"I have never had a bad experience at The Cheesecake Factory. Sometimes there is a wait, which is to be expected on weekends. During the week, there is hardly ever a wait, and if there is it is only 10-15 minutes (if that). While it is a ""chain,"" they have so many dinner/lunch options to choose from, and whatever you order always comes out tasting fresh and delicious! Always friendly staff, good food and of course good cheesecake! The only negative is that some of the tables are very close together and not very private when you feel like you are eating with the person sitting next to you.. However, there are so many cheesecakes to choose from, it's always hard to decide. My favorite is the banana cream cheesecake or the white chocolate raspberry. You can never make a bad decision for dessert when you go to The Cheesecake Factory."
Michael H.,"Springfield, MA",0,3,,4.0,1/23/2016,"I went once last week on a satudary, the food was surprisingly great and the menu was a lot bigger than I thought and so was the serving size. The salted Caramel chessecake is out of this world. Only down side I waited 90 minutes to be seated was told it would be a 40 minute wait. They need a better system then everyone cramped in the doorway and street."
Qingyang C.,"Downtown Flushing, Queens, NY",15,6,2,4.0,9/1/2015,"Great food, great service! Luau salad is a goto gem. Just be aware, portions ae ginormous."
Alice D.,"East Hampton, CT",0,19,3,4.0,5/21/2016,"Pretty nice here. I'll go here with my boyfriend usually on anniversaries or for our birthdays. Very friendly staff, very clean restaurant. The only reason that it gets four stars instead of five is sometimes I'll have to wait in line for up to two hours and they often forget what order people come in... So they might seat someone before you that's only been there ten minutes while you've been there an hour."
Chris B.,"Hamden, CT",0,14,,4.0,5/17/2015,The Cheesecake Factory is best known for the delicious cheesecake and I would agree with that!!! Their regular foods Menu is vast. Once I had a great meal but yesterday it was just okay. The cheesecake however was fantastic!!!!
Garrick W.,"Hartford, CT",0,22,2,3.0,4/16/2016,"Really solid Cheesecake Factory. If you expect 5-star dining, don't come here. However, if you're looking for a family friendly environment and enough choices to satisfy even the pickiest eater, this is your restaurant. This place gets packed, especially on weekends, so try to come during off-peak hours. We came for dinner at 5pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately. Our server was friendly and attentive. We ordered the chipotle spicy chicken pasta, miso salmon, everything pizza, and caesar salad. Portions were great and everything was really tasty. We took our cheesecake to-go and on our way out walked through the crowds of people trying to get in for dinner at 6pm."
Cin D E.,"Manhattan, NY",180,57,55,3.0,6/20/2015,"Wanted to grab some lunch after checking out the REI sale. Plus I've never been to any of The Cheesecake factories. So we decided to eat here. They had outdoor seating but we decided to eat indoors since the weather was a bit hot and humid and it seemed less packed. We asked for a booth so there was like a 15 minute wait. Wasn't a big deal. After we were seated we the waiter came by and took our order. I had the Skinny Margarita. It was okay. I've had better. I ordered the herb crusted filet of salmon. It came with mash and asparagus. I was a bit disappointed. I'd assumed herb crusted meant it was a lil crunchy when you bite into it. But I guess not. Plus, I'm not sure if it was fresh or perhaps defrosted when prepared, it tasted fishy and smelled a bit fishy. I wasn't really happy about that neither. We also ordered the Mac n Cheeseburger and french fries. The burger wasn't bad. It was cooked just right. The fries on the other hand were a bit too salty. The presentation of our dishes were nice. So of course I took a picture before tasting it. The service was really slow after we got our food. We wanted some ketchup since we ordered a burger and fries. Usually it comes with it or there would be a bottle of it on the table or the waiter would bring it out with your order or even ask if we wanted it or not. So we had to flag someone else down to get ketchup. I'm sure sometimes it may get busy servicing other patrons but it was a bit annoying. I wouldn't mind checking other Cheesecake Factories elsewhere but I probably won't come come back here. Nothing personal."
Shane B.,"Wethersfield, CT",0,2,,1.0,5/16/2015,"Horrible!  After a 2.5 hr wait ( yes we were a party of 11 however we were promised a 1 hr wait), the service was mediocre,  food -so so,  drinks - weak. Cheesecake Factory is the Chili's of West Hartford Center. Do better for yourself."
