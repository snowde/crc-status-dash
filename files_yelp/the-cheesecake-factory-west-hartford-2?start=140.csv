Mackenzie Q.,"Avon, CT",10,87,53,4.0,6/14/2015,"It's the Cheesecake Factory so what else can be said? The staff are courteous, the food is what the menu says and you know you'll be in for a wait. But we still go cause it's predictable, and yummy!"
Patricia P.,"West Hartford, CT",2,34,,1.0,12/11/2016,"Had to review this icon. Last evening, we went for some Christmas cheer with friends. There were 4 of us at 5:30. Totally full. Crowds spilling over into alcove. We were told 40 minutes. Ok doable. Well not so.  1 hour and 20 minutes later we were angry and ready to leave. Very uncomfortable with hoards of people complaining and upset as well. The staff looked frazzled. Don't blame them. We were brought to our seat at exactly 1 hour 20 minutes. Then we get a waitress who was new no doubt. Felt bad. But we waited 15-20 minutes for just water. Now starving asked for bread. Yup 20 minutes later. We decided on apps and cheesecake after that. Took 45 minutes to get our apps. Thai lettuce wraps, crispy crab wontons that were burned on edges, corn tamales, crab dip with burned bread. We were told several times they were sorry. We served our own water from a pitcher nearby and took butter from the same serving counter as our waitress was flying no where near us. The appetizers were ordinary at best. We were so hungry we ate them up. Only one of us ordered a cheesecake. We were so disturbed by the service and so so food. We left around 10 arriving at 5:30. We will never go back. By the way, why were all you people waiting. Expensive and Definately not worth the ordinary food."
Lauren B.,"Agawam, MA",105,1,,3.0,1/10/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory and am a frequent customer. However, my last experience was not so great. After waiting 2 hours (being told an hr max), we had a great meal. I ordered 2 cheesecakes to go that were wrapped up and received the wrong ones (two cheesecakes with nuts in them, which I can't have). I wouldn't be so upset I'd the cheesecake didn't cost 8 dollars each!!! Love the place and am a frequent customer but didn't have the greatest experience."
B D.,"Meriden, CT",11,50,,4.0,3/15/2016,"Let me start with the bad news...as I am sure everyone is aware, the wait on the weekends and even on some week nights is long.  Expect to wait 1-2 hours to get in this place.  We got lucky and we were able to sit at the bar and wait for a table.  The drinks here are really good and the ambiance is cool too.  Despite it being so packed, once you get a table, you don't really notice.  The menu is huge and it takes time to decide what you want.  I've been here twice and the first time I got the chicken parmesan and it was huge!  I got 3 meals out of it.  The last time we went, I got the steak diane with mushrooms, a yummy sauce and mashed potatoes.  It was delicious.  If you come here say on a date and you are ordering drinks, food and dessert, expect to spend at least $100.  It is worth the money though because the portions are huge, the drinks are great and obviously, the cheesecake is amazing.  Also, both times we went, the service was really good.  Our waitress and waiter were on point.  If you want to just a have a relaxing quiet evening, try to call ahead and do it during the week, otherwise you will wait and it will be packed."
Lynn R.,"Weatogue, CT",1,35,,5.0,10/26/2014,We ate here for the first time when my father-in- law took all of us out to dinner this summer to celebrate my husband's birthday. None of us were ever there so that was an extra bonus.  They don't take reservations so you either have to arrive early or be willing to wait. We got there early so we were seated right away in a nice booth.  Having a diet restriction I am always reluctant going out to eat wondering if the cook will make my meal according to my wishes. The waitress wrote down carefully what I wanted and told me that it wouldn't be a problem.  My meal arrived along with the others and everything looked great. A few moments the waitress returned making sure my meal was make correctly. Everyone was friendly and we couldn't have asked for better food or service.  We definitely will be returning in the future!
B G.,"Windsor Locks, CT",0,10,2,3.0,8/1/2015,My husband and I ate here last night. The food was decent but nothing out of this world amazing. The appetizer of Vietnamese spring rolls was not anything I would recommend. I had some at a farmer's market for $1.50 a roll that tasted the same instead of $11 for 3 rolls. My husband had the Jamaican blackpepper chicken and shrimp which was good. I had the spicy chicken chipotle pasta which was also good. The portion size is quite generous but for around $18 a plate it should be. The cheesecake was the best part. I had Chris's outrageous Cheesecake and hubby had the mango key lime cheesecake. Both were delicious.   Now the service was not good at all. Our waitress Genera (I'm not sure of the spelling) was too occupied speaking with the woman next to me. Apparently her name is Mallory and used to work there. Now multiple wait staff came over to sit or stand right there and chat for the entire time we were there. It's also rude to give your customer shitty looks. She did get a little better after I started talking shit to my husband about her attitude.  I assume Mallory said something. Best part was the end ans her trying to be sure and pouty saying thank you hoping for a good tip. Regardless we always tip well bc we have both been wait staff before.  We requested a booth but all were taken in the areas with wait staff. We sat in a long communal bench with tables and chairs on the other side. It was literally one long bench. It was like the movie theater when you have to quick decide ass or crotch to the next people just to get to and from the bench. I was nice and didn't glide my ass by Mallory's food and face so she got the crotch. I know so nice of me right? So this would have gotten another star but service and seating sucked. I'd go back for the cheesecake.  PROS: Generous portions               Good flavorful food                Quick seating                CONS: Pricing on some items               Seating               Waitress
Margaret W.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",0,4,,5.0,7/19/2016,"We had the eggplant parmesean and fish taco's.  Took the Oreo cheesecake to go.  The food was great.  The Cheesecake Factory never disappoints, food and service were great."
Linda C.,"Hartford, CT",161,202,33,4.0,5/25/2014,"The prettiest Cheesecake Factory I've been to in CT. The walls are super tall and the restaurant is in front of a water fountain.  The service has always been really good and I really love their bread.  As for their actual food, it's always been okay. Not phenomenal, but not bad either. They have a huge menu, so you may want to look at it at home first.  Their green tea is really good! Unlimited refills so it may be great for the thirsty.  Their alcohol has always been a bit on the weaker side.  Order the Linda cake! It's a fudge cake that makes you want to forget about your summer diet. It's worth those extra miles on the treadmill!!!!"
Rachel C.,"West Hartford, CT",118,17,,5.0,11/14/2015,"I see most of the complaints are about the dinner wait. If you avoid this busy time,  the service is very good. I've only ever had one bad experience being turned away from the cheesecake counter thirty minutes before closing but I emailed them and the manager personally called to apologize. The server was new and they gave me a card towards cheesecake! A+ customer service, especially for a chain."
Biota M.,"Hartford, CT",262,157,304,4.0,2/11/2014,"My two friends and I went on a Monday night around 6:30 PM to celebrate a birthday, so our wait time was maybe two minutes. All the other times I've been here (generally Fridays or weekends), I've had to wait at least 45 minutes to an hour. A note on their reservation policy, they do take them, but only on certain days within certain times: - Monday-Friday from 11:30 AM - 5:00 PM - Sunday from 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM Certain holidays when they may get a lot of people coming in, they may revoke the reservation policy (such as Valentine's Day this Friday), so I would definitely call in advance to check. I've never gotten drinks here, but since we were celebrating a 21st birthday, that part was practically obligatory. I tried the Georgia Peach (very well made--just a sweet and fruity drink without any alcohol taste), and one friend got a pina colada (which didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary). Our drinks were $10 and $9.50, respectively, so I would suggest you save the money and order an extra piece of cheesecake to go instead. From my past experience, their entrees are hit or miss--especially considering the prices, which are usually on the higher end. But they do offer huge portions, so I usually end up eating half and then saving the rest for lunch the next day. I've tried the fish tacos, which were very mediocre. But on another occasion, the veggie burger was one of the best I've ever tried, and you can opt to have the veggie patty served without the bun and wrapped in iceberg lettuce for a healthier option. This time I tried their California omelette, subbing out the breakfast potatoes for mashed potatoes, and they were both excellent. For the toast, they only had white or wheat bread, and they overtoasted it to the point where it was almost inedible around the edges. They also didn't provide any butter with it (they had taken away the complimentary butter and bread basket at this point). Service has always been great here. Servers fill your glasses without prompting, and they're good about checking on you throughout the meal. The cheesecake is really the main reason that I would choose this restaurant over most others. Don't care how full I am from the rest of the meal--I'll always be getting dessert! My favorites are the Godiva chocolate cheesecake and the 30th Anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake. If you're getting a drink/appetizer, entree, and dessert, plan to spend around $40/person (not including tip). This place is a little pricey, but definitely worth the trip once in awhile."
Rana P.,"West Hartford, CT",124,223,177,3.0,2/5/2015,"The mediocre rating I'm giving the Cheesecake Factory probably doesn't accurately reflect my unhealthy addiction to this place. With that being said, I come here at least once a month. Don't get me wrong--the food is always delicious and the cheesecake never disappoints. However, it's always crowded. To a fault. The wait for a table for dinner is always 45+ minutes on a WEEKNIGHT. The seating is also very closed together so you're always nice and cozy and within eavesdropping distance to the high school couple on a date next to you."
Juan L.,"West Hartford, CT",1,3,,2.0,3/9/2014,"The Lemonade.. Probably the best lemonade I've ever drank. Must've been squeezed from real lemons - that's why I gave it a two stars.  Now let's get to our food, We ordered our steak medium - we got a black brick. Mashed potatoes - tasted like a old baked potato. Burger - ordered well-done came back still moo'ing. In conclusion, I was better off going to McDonalds.  The manager did take off two meals so for that I do respect the care."
Katie H.,"West Hartford, CT",297,325,77,3.0,1/19/2013,"I'd only ever had good experiences at the Cheesecake Factory before, but my last time there, I left disappointed. My favorite crab cake sandwich was no longer on the menu so I got the Chicken Bellagio, which came highly recommended by friends. It was just okay--tasty, but a little overpriced for what is your run-of-the-mill chicken and pasta dish. Perhaps I should have ordered something else. My friends got the orange chicken, lunch portion, which they all enjoyed. I tried some and while it was splendidly crispy, the slightly bitter rind flavor in the orange sauce wasn't to my liking. I'd eat it if it was in front of me, but probably not order it myself.  Our waiter was very chipper and friendly, but unfortunately, he got swamped with tables halfway through our meal and it was almost impossible to get his attention for anything. We waited for 15 minutes and eventually had to flag him down in order to order dessert, for which he just threw our menus down on his way to another table and had his busboy take our dessert orders. We then had to wait another 15 minutes to get our desserts, and my peanut butter, banana, and honey milkshake (good but a little too sweet) was mostly melted and soupy by that point. After that, we had to wait again before we could flag him down and get our bil and again for him to take it. Our lunch ended up taking over two hours because of all of this, and my friends had to dash off late to their next engagements. I know it wasn't our waiter's fault, as he was well and truly swamped and doing the best he could, but perhaps they should hire more waitstaff for the lunch shift to better handle all the tables. Average food + high prices + poor service = bad experience. Try harder next time, Cheesecake Factory."
Alberto C.,"West Hartford, CT",9,33,114,3.0,4/16/2014,"We arrived at 1:30pm for lunch, they had a 20min wait. When seated it took our server a while to introduce herself and take our drink orders. The waitress was polite, but everything took longer than usual to come out. I've been to a few Cheesecake Factory's and this one usually not the best when it comes to the kitchen. The presentation is not the best and the kitchen is not consistent with there food. As for location, I think it's great right in a Blue Back Square West Hartford and the parking garage is very close by so I don't understand the complaints in regards parking and regards noise level it's a chain with a bar so it should be expected to be on the loud side especially when it's crowded."
Gern B.,"North Granby, CT",0,15,,2.0,5/30/2016,"Visited 5/28/16 2PM. Restaurant busy but not slammed. High backed booth seats not comfortable. Wait staff was slow, wait for food was unacceptably long. Food quality was good, excepting the wisdom of creating a hamburger on a hard crusted bread that immediately expels the contents upon biting into it. Not sure we will be back due to long wait once seated."
Mitchell S.,"New Haven, CT",16,102,455,4.0,3/13/2014,"I'm  definitely a fan of this fine establishment. The string  beans, corn, and the  mashed  potatoes  were  good. The only complaint:  the fried catfish was slightly  greasy.  Nevertheless, the greatest part of this endeavor was the awesome cheesecake. I had the chocolate mousse cheesecake & my Queen had the mango key lime cheesecake, and it was pure decadence!!!"
Sevasti G.,"Bristol, CT",0,4,,1.0,1/15/2015,"Each time my boyfriend and I come in, we always get the same bad service. Each time seemingly gets worse than the last. We really tried giving it a chance a few times, but being a waitress myself I know what good service is supposed to be, and every time it's far from it. This place is a little overrated. The only good thing is the key lime cheesecake. We will be doing business elsewhere next time we go to West Hartford."
Lydia R.,"Springfield, MA",4,11,48,2.0,5/28/2015,"Food was decent. I'm not a fan of the menu it's just ridiculously big way to many items. I only go here if I have a gift card and ""have"" to use it. It's just not my cup of tea :)"
Kirk K.,"East Bronx, NY",35,3,1,1.0,3/12/2016,"By far the worst visit I've ever had at any restaurant I've been to... Waited for 1 hr & 45 mins to be seated.. They claimed they only had one table that could seat a party of 8... You can only imagine how upset our part was.. Here trying to celebrate 2 birthdays and 2 children in the party... This night went from celebration to complete disaster...When the buzzer finally went off... My g/f walked up and slammed the buzzer on the counter to protest the way we were treated and wait time. As we were going to be seated I asked to speak to the person in charge.. The ""mgr"" I'm assuming said my girl was wrong because she displayed her anger...I'm a manager in retail and I told the ""mgr"" that and I said... ""The customer is wrong?"" We're paying you for service that as been subpar and the customer is wrong? No one claim up to us to say ""hey we're working on the table, or apologized..."" Utterly disgusted and ashamed to even say that I work in the restaurant business after this experience.. I hope this never happens to anyone ever again... I'm sure that ""manager"" will look back at this interaction in the future when she has grown and developed in her role that regardless of what she feels... The customer is always right..."
Farrah M.,"Hartford, CT",42,57,87,4.0,5/19/2012,"The selection is overwhelming but I keep ordering the same thing.... I get the endive salad every single time. For entrees I go for burgers or the chicken over pasta with arugula and prosciutto.  Can't think of the name right now but I love it. The serving is enormous, I can eat it for two more meals. Cheesecake....well, there's almost never room for them but I always order them to go. I love this place, it's beautiful, there's something for everyone. Parking: Garage or street Attire: Casual to dressy depends on the occasion you're going for.  YOu'll see people who just worked out to dressier folks on a date. Age group: babies-grands TaKE OUT is Great!!!! they come to your car with the food. LOVE this feature! CONS: There's always a wait Cocktails are expensive I only gave it a 4 because one time my chicken was undercooked. But i keep going back."
