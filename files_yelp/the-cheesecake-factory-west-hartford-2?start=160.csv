Ivonne L.,"Danbury, CT",0,3,,1.0,11/6/2016,Extremely upset with my last two car side orders. I use to love going to the Cheesecake Factory but it hasn't been good at all. Three weeks ago my daughter and I ordered kale and quinoa salads with grilled chicken & when I got the order the kale was old and soggy I had greasy fried chicken on both orders with bacon. I ended up throwing out the food because it all looked disgusting & not what we had ordered. I figured tonight I would give it another shot so I ordered avocado egg rolls which were brown I also ordered Asian chicken wraps and my lettuce was old my daughters chicken Piccata was cold not even warm very dry and bland. It seems like it was sitting in the window for long or it was an order that someone didn't take. I ordered a cheesecake that I paid for and they never gave me the cheesecake I got home and I wasn't going to go back for it. The dishes were similarly unsatisfactory. For the prices that this restaurant charges I should be getting fresh warm food I probably will not be going back any time soon. Look at your orders before you get home
Nkebea J.,"West Hartford, CT",12,31,17,5.0,2/18/2015,Been going here for quite a while and the food is always good.  Crab cakes are to die for as well as the salmon and Jamaican shrimp .  The drinks are also very good. Wait time can be a bit long but it always seems to be worthwhile.
Taylor V.,"Longmeadow, MA",206,205,66,4.0,4/7/2015,"Once a fan, always a fan. Exceptionally quick and friendly service, an (almost too) extensive menu, and delicious cheesecake (duh). My friend and I each started off with a couple of the signature cocktails, and they were both very tasty. A little too sweet for my liking, but the flavors were good. I had a chicken dish with mushroom sauce that was amazing. I was so full, but I couldn't stop eating because it was so good. Overall, a very pleasant experience. It's a bit pricey, but definitely worth a visit every once in awhile."
Penny M.,"Arlington, VA",108,170,,2.0,8/3/2013,"Meh. Just meh. I just don't understand the draw. Why is this place so packed? Food was ""ok""... Nothing to write home about  - but at least I got my money's worth - I brought half of my meal home for another day! Anyway, I digress....the service was terribly slow....we did order dessert - because that is what you are supposed to do here - right??? We waited 45 minutes for our dessert! We just ordered a piece of cheesecake - nothing that should have taken that long... And yes, it was really good cheesecake....but 45 minutes???? Anyway- the bottom line is - come here for dessert - just dessert. Eat your dinner elsewhere."
Karen M.,"Dover Foxcroft, ME",0,54,6,4.0,7/15/2014,"Food is excellent-I had the shrimp scampi-large gulf shrimp and the sauce is light with roasted garlic cloves-so delicious!! My hubby had teriyaki chicken which was also very good, although he was disappointed the chicken was on the bone, but he's just weird that way. Service was great also...& the lemonade is fantastic! Was a little disappointed that they don't open until 11:30 for lunch-which is a little late."
Bob B.,"Granby, CT",0,8,,1.0,4/8/2015,Menu was much to big. Portions were the only thing they has to offer. Chicken Marsala I could have made myself for a third if the price. Wont be back
Jenny C.,"Dayton, OH",82,227,258,3.0,3/13/2014,"Parking is difficult, as previously mentioned. It's best to park in one of the two garages if you're in the area. H and I have been here multiple times by ourselves and with a group of friends. It's always bustling and packed with people so each time we've come, we've had to wait at least 20-30 minutes for a table. This is a chain restaurant, so there's always something for someone. Personally, I've ordered the Pasta da Vinci for yearrrrrrrrrsssssss and regardless of which Cheesecake Factory I go to, it's always the same and it's always delicious. My H is a little more adventurous and orders different apps and entrees each time we go. I will admit that the only thing I absolutely love is the Pasta da Vinci and the oreo cheesecake (possibly due to a child memory?) everything else is ok. Also, wine selection is meh. I'm not a wine savant and have no knowledge of wine... except whether or not I like it. The waiters and waitresses don't seem to have any knowledge either."
Evan K.,"West Hartford, CT",10,15,,2.0,9/20/2014,"I'm not sure why this place is popular to be honest. It took a while to be seated (initially I figured because it is popular but later I realized that's only part of the reason why being seated took so long). Once we were sat it took about 10 minutes for anyone to come over to our table to introduce themselves and ask if we wanted drinks... It then took another 10-15 minutes to get us those drinks. About 25 minutes after sitting we finally had the opportunity to order our food which took another 20 minutes to come out. Yes, we were sitting for about 45 minutes before we ate our food. When it came to dessert, once we ordered our cheesecake it took another 10 minutes to get the cheesecake. Everything in this restaurant seems to take forever, and that is why it takes forever to get a seat. The turnover of tables is terrible here which is why it takes forever to be seated. The food is subpar, the service is extremely slow, and the wait is not worth it. There are two other downsides to this restaurant which are HUGE downsides and things to avoid in the restaurant business. 1. You can barely talk to the people at your table because the restaurant is far too loud. 2. The menu is MASSIVE which makes it impossible to choose something. This is a BIG no no in the restaurant business. I still can not figure out why people like this place... I hated it."
Jay O.,"Hamden, CT",78,277,27,3.0,1/11/2015,"I used to be a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory.  I know it's a chain but I always felt that the 2000 menu options were well-executed, flavorful, with great portion sizes (unless you're on a diet-but if you are, you're probably not reading this right now).  I hadn't been in a while so I can't tell if it's this particular location, the restaurant decline in general, or my own evolution BUT I was certainly much less impressed at my recent visit.  The wait was long...fine, it's par for the course but the rest of the visit was just ok.  The service felt spotty and rushed...we had two different servers during the course of the meal because of a ""break"" which I know happens but it made already ""just ok"" service even worse.  The food was all decent at best but not what I had remembered.  It felt like the portions got smaller, the food got less tasty, and the bill got larger.  All in all, a bad combination.  Maybe we just hit it on an off night, but it was off enough that I probably won't be back for a while."
Shauntay B.,"Hamden, CT",4,13,138,4.0,10/22/2013,I had the macaroni & cheese balls to start which were to die for. They came with marinara on the bottom of the plate. I had a Cajun pasta but my boyfriend had the gumbo which was everything. I loved it. I would def. go back.
Dan O.,"Milford, CT",30,61,299,4.0,12/7/2014,"Not sure why this Cheesecake Factory gets such poor reviews. I see a lot of them impacted by the extensive wait times. I get that it's often annoying being told you can't get a seat for an hour, but how do you hold that against the restaurant? The very fact that they are that busy is testament to the fact people really enjoy the place. Not only do they have an enormous menu, everything is always on point. How they manage to hit a home run on 90% of their dishes is amazing. It's not fine dining, but it is really good food at respectable prices. Portions are big, and there is something for everyone. Great place to come with family or friends."
Sayya A.,"Saint Albans, United Kingdom",38,42,91,4.0,2/14/2012,"I don't care what anyone says I love The Cheesecake Factory because it's a one size fit all restaurant that has selections available for everyone. This is the place you go when you're out with a group of friend and you don't want to make anyone uncomfortable. Especially when there is a vegetarian or a dieter this is the place you pick because it will save tons of bickering and hurt feelings.  I always turn to The Cheesecake Factory because of the extensively long menu.  I can take my picky fish eating sister here and I know for sure she will be able to find something she likes.  Wait: The place is right in the center of ""The Center"". The wait can be as long as 45 minutes. But when with friends just find a spot on one of the few couches and wait for your pager to alarm.  The wait shouldn't be a problem when out with friends because you're there to spend time with your friends. If you're out with your partner, consider it time to share an uncomfortable moment.  They have pagers that will work if you want to head to the bookstore. Folks it really isn't that bad.  Food: HUGE portions that will satisfy everyone. The food isn't comparable to the likes of Max and Grants but they cater to mainstream diners. I like their nachos for sharing and the firecrackers are good too but they leave me craving for more.  I come for the cheesecake. I'm not cheesecake expert but I love the selection and the variety.  I've had bakery made cheesecakes and was never impressed. Many bakeries will charge you the same price as The Cheesecake but their cheesecakes usually aren't of the same sugar fused sugar coma stimulating cheesecakes that can only be found at the Cheesecake factory.  I usually start working on my cheesecake at the restaurant, pack it to go, work on it for a late night snack, have some more for a mini breakfast snack, nibble some for lunch and finish it off for my pre dinner snack. Seriously the cheesecakes here are huge and it is well worth the calories. Price: For the dieters who want smaller portions you can pay around $15 and get something that's of a healthy portion. For those who are eating machines like me expect to pay $20 an entrée. Add a $7 piece of cheesecake in and you'll be wiggling to your car with a full belly.  Service: I can't complain but I detect lots of servers here with the fake nice attitude. They come to your tables, force a smile and then expect an amazing tip.  Parking: Garage parking. No other Cheesecake factory in the state so either you pay for parking or go without Cheesecake."
Marleena C.,"New Britain, CT",12,329,3,2.0,8/26/2013,"Of course the cheesecake here is phenomenal and some of the appetizers are pretty good, but the main courses are a big fat HELL NO. For one there are 10 pages of food for NO REASON and the dishes are very low standard. Salty as all get up for one and one meal is basically all the calories you need for a full day!!! It is essentially fast food with a a big price tag. I suggest if you do come here just come for the cheesecake and maybe a drink and appetizer. Otherwise you will feel bloated for days with bubble guts and sluggishness. Service on a happy note is very good and and attentive...which is a huge plus and makes coming here much more enjoyable..and of course they make good drinks...just skip the main meal and you will be fine."
Lana G.,"West Hartford, CT",0,7,1,4.0,1/8/2015,"We have been coming here for years, but every time is a different experience. My family and I love the food here, but unfortunately the serve has been poor as of recently. Food: My daughter always orders from the skinnylicious menu. She either goes with the chopped salad or the vegetable salad. Last time we dined here, she ordered the chopped salad and politely asked for no meat in the salad because she is a vegetarian. But unfortunately, when she was halfway through the salad, she found a few pieces of ham or bacon mixd in... we couldn't really tell what it was. She wasn't mad and didn't send the food back, but it was disappointing to pick out the meat. Even if we did want to point this out to our waitress, she rarely approached the table and did not ask how our food was until we were already finished. I always order the turkey burger, which is great and I have no complaints about it. My husband orders the mushroom burger and also always enjoys it. Service: Unfortunately this is the reason I took away one star. You have to get very lucky to have an attentive server at this place. We don't get very lucky, and the past few times we have had a server she seems like she doesn't want to be there and rarely checks on our food. On top of that, she didn't even approach our table for a long time while we had been seated! I am usually not judgmental on small things like this, but this happens often. After we finally did place our order, it took a very long time for our food to come out. About 40-50 minutes, and we didn't even order appetizers. Another issue was my daughters salad was brought out at least 10 minutes before the other entrees. In reality, all entrees should be brought out at the same time! Decor: Of course this place looks beautiful inside with all the marble and mirrors. Never any complaints about the appearance! Overall, my family likes coming here for the pretty good food, but service has been poor lately. Hopefully next time we will get better service."
Reina F.,"Westfield, MA",1,39,89,4.0,5/21/2014,"I love the atmosphere. The music can be a little loud at times to have any meaningful conversation. The food has always been the best, the right temperature, and if there are any issues the servers are happy to correct them.  I have never had a bad meal or a server that didn't deserve every dime of their tip. The service staff is top notch. The place is amazing and well worth the wait. The only reason why I'm giving them a 4 is because of the wait time. We always have a 45 min wait for a party of 2 but it is worth it. We combat that issue with getting their early and doing some shopping. If you have a large party, I suggest you send someone early because the wait at dinner/weekends is at least 1 1/2 - 2 hrs."
John B.,"Glastonbury, CT",111,40,33,3.0,7/19/2014,"If you don't get there by 4pm good luck. It's a typical chain with a 60 page menu and all processed food, almost looks like plastic. The decor is nice, mixed with contemporary Asian fusion, in background are mirrors that make the place look bigger then it is. The bar area is first come first served. Mainly 4 tops, the tables are for waiting list. The have happy hour special drinks, tops shelf liquor & a Patio. They have a cheesecake display along with takeout it's in the wrong spot cause it's also the waiting area for guest, gets cramped.  Anyways I'm not a fan of chains, but they do have subpar cheesecake which is made in a big ol distribution center and shipped frozen cross country, been spoiled, nothing compares to Juniors in NYC!!!"
Maureen M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,3.0,9/30/2013,"This restaurant is so-so as far as the quality of the food is concerned, but the atmosphere is nice for a night out. However, if you do decide to visit this location on a weekend evening be sure to call ahead and make a reservation because the wait can get veryy long on a Friday or Saturday. The cheesecake is a no brainer and great to order from the bar to go. Tip- don't order the cappuccinos or coffees because they don't have the best taste."
Joe C.,"Farmington, CT",72,148,103,3.0,2/2/2013,"I mean, it's the Cheesecake Factory. The most unhealthy menu in America. Anyway, I digest. Brought my friend and his gf out for his 30th birthday. I had chips and salsa app, and the salsa was fresh and hit the spot with the chips. The fresh bread they brought out was actually really delicious. I had the brown grain bread but it was so flavorful! My main course was the vegetable salad with no cheese or meat or dressing except a tablespoon of EVOO and it was exceptional. Hearty and hit the spot! I finished it with a bowl of fresh strawberries for dessert and those were plump, juicy and cold: just the way I like them! I was able to eat healthy and still have a delicious meal! My friend got the fried calamari for his app and said it was too 3 he's ever had. He got the ny sirloin and loved it. He ordered medium well but it came out medium/ medium rare which made me happier to see. He said it was still really good and it smelled incredible. His dessert was a banana chocolate honey milkshake which sounded great and he confirmed its yummyness. His gf ordered the avacado egg rolls for her app which look and sound good. She loves them. She got a Kobe burger with mushrooms and caramelized onions and bacon, cooked medium well (communists I'm telling you!), and said it could be the greatest burger she's ever had. Her dessert was a red velvet cheesecake with a hot caramel apple cider. She loved it all. I was jealous of their meals, but happy how everything went. Wasn't as pricey as I thought it would be which was nice. The waitress thought I was stingy because of my orders, then got her 30% tip and realized who she was talkin to! I do love their cheesecakes though. If you don't want to eat there, stop in for their cakes. You won't regret it."
Alfred F.,"Hartford, CT",123,193,197,3.0,2/5/2014,"One of the rare times we went out Friday night and went somewhere other than our go-to place. Guess we had a yen for something different...and Cheesecake Factory was the almost-unanimous choice. Nestled in ""beautiful"" Blue-Back Square in the center of West Hartford, Cheesecake Factory has been characterized by a thriving bar, a huge menu, a devilish listing of anthem-style desserts, and interminably long waits for a table. This evening, we were lucky, and only had to wait about 40 minutes. I will say that, once you are seated, the service and attention you receive are consistently very good. Within 2 minutes our waiter took our beverage order. He came back with the drinks, and CF's signature breads - sourdough and a dark multi-grain. Both were hot, soft and yummious. Our order was taken, and we began nibbling, sipping, and trying not to stare at the cheesecake station that was situated just a few feet from us. Our meals came in a very reasonable amount of time. All were hot, and well-presented. My wife had Chicken Marsala, which was wonderful looking, covered with fresh sauteed mushrooms, just the way she likes it. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her trio of chicken tacos, which came with a small bowl of Mexican-style marinated vegetables, which for me was the highlight of the meal...they were extremely fresh, and complimented with a light cilantro-lime marinade that was perfectly balanced. I felt like some home-style comfort food, so i ordered the chicken & biscuits. 3 quaint chicken breasts, served over mashed potatoes with a few large biscuits, home-style gravy & mixed vegetables. It hit the spot. Dessert...well we were all too full to eat anything else, but that didn't stop us, of course, from ordering a few slices to go! we had apple, red velvet, and Godiva cheesecakes. All I can say is that if it weren't for a bit of well-placed discretion, the containers never would have made it to the recycling bin! The only annoyances were the usual wait, and the fact that we had to shell out $5 for parking. Other than that, Cheesecake Factory delivers everything you would expect...good food, friedly and efficient service, and CHEESECAKE!"
Anthony P.,"New Haven, CT",45,747,1565,3.0,2/2/2013,"Should I give this place 2 stars for: The fact that it's a franchise with large portions of marginal quality food? The fact that this place looks like it could be high class, but the service and food are on the level of an Applebee's or Chili's? or Should I give this place 3 stars for: It being in a nice area such as Blue Back Square, it has a nice layout, and you get to leave with large portions of food? I had the chocolate cheese cake, red velvet cheese cake and the classic burger. I thought of them to be okay. As a matter of fact, I have come to the conclusion that I do NOT like cheese cake. There was one place in New York that tickled my fancy, but after that I have never found a cheese cake from either a mom and pop store or franchise that made it the way I like. So what could I rate this place? Maybe a 2 or a 3. I don't know, I can't make up my mind."
