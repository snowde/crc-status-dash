Mari K.,"West Hartford, CT",217,476,1613,4.0,1/16/2014,"It's often really busy,  but you can eat and the bar and the service there is fast and friendly.  Huge menu,  and pretty good food.  I love the burgers and sweet potato fries,  and the pasta dishes are really good.  It's nice to have a consistent chain.  The wine is marked up a whole lot,  but I guess that's standard."
Heather C.,"New York, NY",150,765,477,4.0,10/23/2011,"After reading the reviews on here, I was worried this could go either way. I also had a grumpy, impatient boyfriend who was saying ""this better be the best freakin food I ever ate"" for you dragging me here - to his credit he had some work due for his college classes. First of all, no entree is more than $20, for the most part. I don't know where you people seem to think that there's $40 seafood dishes, because there isn't. The amount of food you get is borderline obscene. I got the Chicken Bellagio, which was fantastic and I can definitely eat the rest for lunch at work tomorrow. $13 - evens out to less than $7 for a meal considering I can eat twice off of it. My boyfriend got the Kobe burger, which he was impressed with (thank god, I didn't want to deal with his disappointment at something less than stellar.) and he only ate half of it - which is saying something because he's pretty much a human vacuum. Our waitress Kristy was very attentive and we didn't wait a whole long time for our food either. At 5:00 on a Sunday we waited about a half an hour for a table - nothing too ridiculous. The crowd outside was a little deceiving, I was thinking at least an hour as we walked up. The decor was pretty ridiculous, I felt like I was at Foxwoods to be perfectly honest - maybe the next location in Connecticut should be there...haha.  That said, despite the almost palatial egyptian tacky Mediterranean decor, it was very nice and spacious - and given the fact we were seated right by the door and the bar - not all that noisy. Our damage for the night? $50 INCLUDING tip. Way less than either of us were expecting. We've spent more at 99 for crying out loud. Of course THEN we bought a 7"" Tiramisu cheesecake to take home for $25...which I think is freakin RIDICULOUS, but it is really good. We'll be back."
Tee R.,"Enfield, CT",0,4,4,5.0,4/28/2015,"Perfect. The food is a little pricey, but worth every cent! I love the atmosphere and staff. My food was made and served in a relatively short amount of time. You can't go wrong with this place. It's simply amazing. I would go more times if I could!!"
John P.,"Manchester, CT",76,165,252,2.0,11/17/2012,"A very nice ambiance but the sound level is too high, and the food is okay for the price you pay.  Pro's: -They serve water but must ask for straws -Start everyone off with a nice tray of warm baked bread -Beer was good -Crab cakes appetizer was just right:) -As I mentioned in the beginning, beautifully located restaurant, bar, and decor. -Service was good -bathrooms were beautiful and clean ( a plus, since most neglect this area) Con's: -Friday night music playing from their speakers too loud for conversation  -Would like to be asked if we prefer a table or booth next time.  -Out of ice-cream??? Poor... -Confusion between waitress & patrons on paying because they automatically charged a gratuity for 6 -worse yet, took them even longer 20 minutes to fix this problem -at this point they should've comped a meal for the pain & agony of us waiting another 30 minutes in total. -Would've been happier if a manager would've walked over 15 steps more to our table to apologize for the inconvenience and comped us for our troubles.  -I would've been happier to see a Pro-Active Manager step up at this point and at least address to us that the problem was corrected rather having us sit for 1/2 with no knowledge of anything going on while the waitress tried to fix our problem. Summary: If you go with a party of 6 or more, please ask for separate checks. Would go back but the prices are too high, ladies complained of $10.50 drink prices too. The Cheese Cake Factory in White Plains is run much better..."
Acadia C.,"Hartford, CT",10,10,1,2.0,10/11/2015,"I went to the cheesecake factory last night with friends  and experienced some of the worst customer service by the hosts. it was very busy and we were told an hour wait and given a buzzer thing. An hour and a half later, we still were not called and people in front of us were being seated. A host told my friend it was policy to seat smaller parties before larger parties (we were only 4 people) and admitted it was ""unfair"". Okay then don't do it??? Eventually after almost 2 hours of waiting we were in pain from standing (one of my friends just ran the Hartford marathon) and starving. I had to go to the counter and basically yell to get attention. Both women at the counter told me it would be just a little longer and I said no its been 2 hours and finally a manager overheard and said ""just seat her now"". Luckily we had a great server but he was juggling a million tasks at once so it was clearly understaffed. I was hoping the manager would apologize and offer to comp something as a sign of good customer service. Nope. Basically I believe the management is poor and there is no communication. Awful experience just barely saved by the server and decent food."
Jasmine G.,"Meriden, CT",62,5,,2.0,2/24/2016,The food is amazing here which is why I gave it that extra star. I just wish i could have enjoyed it more if it weren't for the waitress that kept coming back every 10 minutes. My boyfriend took me out to dinner for my birthday and she completely ruined my delicious night. she kept interrupting me asking me if I was done. I've never felt so rushed while eating. After being rushed she ends up interrupting while I'm eating my delicious s'mores cheesecake I was eating almost half and she sees me eating and still had the nerve to ask me if I was all set and if I wanted it to go. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding because she kept interrupting and talking while I was talking but she ended up throwing away my cheesecake. I sat there for a good 25 minutes waiting for her to come back with it in a box and received nothing back. I tried looking for someone but now one seemed to be around and she completely was gone. It was my first time there and I have to say I was not impressed by staff. Date I went December 22 she was tan and looked Spanish hair black and was in a bun
Sarah M.,"Bristol, CT",0,2,3,4.0,8/15/2015,"Really good menu, something for everyone. Excellent customer service, anytime there has been a wait or forgotten appetizer, the manager is present and rectifies the situation. Usually a wait on the weekends, but never too long."
Tony C.,"Hartford, CT",5,154,15,4.0,1/4/2014,"Ive been here a few times, always a wait at the door. Tonight was an hour wait. I always say I'm not coming back. Service was great, once we got seated. The apps were great, fried mozz and the fried mac n cheese. But, i had the fish tacos which really had no taste.  If you don't mind the wait and your having apps or the cheesecake then this is your place. Some of the main dishes are not worth the wait or the price"
Noelle M.,"Plainville, CT",87,172,32,3.0,5/7/2013,"I've only been here a handful of times, and always sat outside to enjoy the weather. Menu is gigantic and has a little something for everyone, though prices are quite high and one starts to wonder about quality when there are SO many choices. All I have ordered has been a bit above mediocre - nothing stands out as amazing, but perfectly edible. $50 for two people for lunch is a little out of my usual budget, though, and we didn't even get cheesecake. Will opt for another area restaurant next time I'm looking to lunch on the patio. 3rd star is only for the fact my salad was huge."
Amy E.,"Hartford, CT",0,6,1,4.0,3/16/2015,"Always a wait, but the food is great.  A little upset I waited 45 min for 2 people when I was told it would be 15-20.   I had some gift cards so I decided to splurge a little.  The loaded tater tots were awesome and the filet mignon was amazing!"
M H.,"Hartford, CT",6,106,8,3.0,11/5/2012,"I should preface this review by stating that I enjoy good quality food and to be honest, chain restaurants aren't my thing since quality isn't their game. I have to dine at them sometimes while traveling for work but on my own time, I steer clear. I ended up at this CF because my dining companion had a gift card so we figured we'd grab some lunch. At noon on a Sunday there was no wait but it was pretty packed. Like with any chain, the food is the same here as it is in (FILL IN THE BLANK WITH ANY OTHER CF LOCATION).  CF's food is a notch above Applebee's or Chili's but hardly worth waiting 5 minutes for, let alone 2 hours.  I don't hate on CF just to hate on chain restaurants. For $25 for lunch, you can do so much better in West Hartford which is why I am always astounded by the lines at this place. However, if you are wielding a gift card like we were, it's totally worth it."
Tom T.,"South Windsor, CT",80,130,161,2.0,9/16/2012,"1. Friday 5:30 early enough to grab a table for 4? Nope, took a buzzer for a 45 min wait and got seated after 65 mins. Place was packed! No surprise 2. Our server was due for his mandatory break so a sub came in and took care of us. Then our original returned, he was busy so service became slow. 3. Food - We didn't order apps, so on to the entrees. Portions shockingly small! Two of us got the steak and shrimp combo for $20. 3 pc shrimp, 4 pc beef. Tasted good but I was getting ready to go to Moe's afterwards if we hadn't looked forward to Cheesecake. Dessert was nice, but towards the end I was tired of the taste. So sweet but I finished it.  4. Conclusion - If I come back I'd go for the burger/sandwiches for like 12 bucks, it'll fill me up fine. But for that why not Max's burger or a more casual joint? I'd come back for dessert unless forced to come for the food."
Kal L.,"Wethersfield, CT",0,84,,4.0,8/27/2014,"I have probably ate at over a dozen Cheesecake factories in the last ten years.  Never had a bad meal, but always had to wait for a table. This review is on the West Hartford location. You will probably have to pay for parking in one of two garages.  This restaurant is located in an upscale shopping area called Blue Back Square. Menu is huge.  Many selections.  Easy to get confused. Most restaurant ""experts"" recommend a smaller choice of menu items.  Cheesecake Factory apparently believes the opposite.  But my wife and I have a favorite.  It is Chicken Romano..   We both always order this item and the meal  is always good and we take home half  of our meal. Service is always good.   The restaurant offers two choices of bread.  The bread is tasty..  We went on a Monday night in August.  Still had to wait thirty minutes but it was worth the wait.. Our other Cheesecake factory we go to a lot is the location in Boca Raton, Florida.  As good as the West Hartford, Ct. location. We always order one slice of a cheesecake ( different one each time).  We splint the slice.  Delicious and fatting. One suggestion: Each Holiday season. After Thanksgiving, each $25.00 Gift card purchased gets you a bonus gift card for a  slice of Cheesecake ( usually you must redeem these bonus cards in the winter months).  Cheesecake will let you redeem as many gift cards you have at any time as long as you do it in the time allowed.  We redeem several at one time and took them home.

Brit T.,"Windsor, CT",13,18,27,5.0,9/28/2014,"The buffalo blast appetizer was amazing!!!!!!!! I ordered the Crispy chicken costellA very tasty, also the red sangria is probably the best sangria I have in sometime. My dinner companion ordered the ribeye steak, it was average in taste and quality. Service was great, and surprisingly there was no wait. I went on a Sunday around 5pm.."
Frenchelle W.,"Bloomfield, CT",24,43,,3.0,5/29/2012,"Ambiance, good to great.  Long wait, loooooooong wait which is a pain when there's nowhere to sit and you have on heels.  I do find that you can go to B&N and browse without interferring with the buzzer thingy.  The waitstaff, a bit snobby.  The food is not great.  Every time I go I have good appetizers.  The dinner dish always needs tweaking though and I never look forward to doggy-bagging it, I just don't want to eat it anymore.   But the cheesecake....  I could easily ruin my life with their cheesecake.  Some may find it pricey but with me, money is no object when we're talking about good cheesecake.  It is top of the line the best.  I've tasted no cheesecake that compares.  I mean I literally make noises when eating it... Not sexy noises either... fat ass noises.  I have no shame."
Margie H.,"Hebron, CT",14,32,4,2.0,7/28/2014,"The food was alright, nothing really to brag about except for their cheesecakes, which are awesome. I tried four different kinds of cheesecakes. Good place to just grab a salad or finish a meal with a nice sweet dessert complemented with a cappuccino, but the wait is way, way too long. It's my second  time trying this restaurant. Had a really, really good Reuben Pastrami Sandwich and soup and came back to have this sandwich again. I found out that it was removed from the menu. Was very disappointed. :("
Emily W.,"New Hartford, CT",0,7,,5.0,1/27/2016,"Went here recently for lunch. The food was amazing. I went for the antioxidant salad (after the Mac and cheese balls of course!!) and it was amazing! The flavors all went so well together and the dressing was just right. It was a great healthier alternative. Our waiter was fantastic, very attentive and polite. We will be back. :)"
Katya L.,"Canton, CT",0,6,,1.0,7/13/2016,"We have been coming here for years and never have had such a terrible time as tonight. Went there with my husband and a couple friends. The wait time to get in was OK, we ordered our drinks and food. Got my appetizer about 10 minutes later (which I specifically requested be brought out with my dinner), fine. 45 MINUTES LATER our food still had not come. We could barely track down our waitress to ask what was taking so long. She said she'd go check and another 7 minutes later, she and the manager brought our food out. When we asked if the kitchen was backed up because we had been waiting almost an hour for our food, the manager just chuckled and said, ""Oh I'm sorry."" The food looked less than appealing and we could tell it was sitting out for a while, as most of it was pretty cold. 2 tables who came in AFTER us got their food before we did!! And they had more people in their parties! The waitress came back once to check on us, no refills, nothing. We will NOT be back, I don't know how this place is still open."
Stephen R.,"Agawam, MA",1,49,122,1.0,5/24/2014,"PASS ON THIS ONE!! Been to several of them, bar far the worse location. Mess up your meals, food cold, service horrendous! Very disappointed, went several times at varying times/days. No matter when no difference. Your better off going into Barnes & Nobel to Starbucks and getting a snack from them!!!"
Revan L.,"Middletown, CT",1,55,46,3.0,2/9/2015,"I really hate to give one of my all-time favorite restaurants EVER a 3 star review. However, the curbside service has only worsened throughout the years. It used to be superb. Now, it has shot to hell. Our family gets cheesecake factory 1-3 times a month wherever we are in the country! This location is one we often frequent..it is such a shame that when you order curbside you must now check every single item before you let the server walk off because 99% of the time your order is completely messed up. Once I realized my order was messed up I had to spend 45 minutes waiting for the manager who still didn't even get the order right once all was said and done. He admitted being embarrassed and ashamed of such a simple meal (tamale cakes, ago egg rolls, mac cheese, artichoke) had gotten so messed up and ultimately ruined. Still went home with cold food and the wrong order. We will always love cheesecake factory ...it's simply addicting. Unfortunate that the curbside has gone so down hill, it used to be wonderful where you would never think twice to have to check your order to make sure everything is met."
