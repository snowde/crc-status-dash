Middletown D.,"Middletown, CT",2,14,,4.0,12/13/2012,"What can we say about The Cheesecake Factory? Since one of The Middletown Dining Club members has a phobia of cheese related desserts, he will not be taking part in this review. We went there for dessert. Three things to know. Big cheesecake slices, a bit pricey, delicious. We definitely recommend sharing, because even the manliest of men could not finish one of these slices all by themselves after a big meal. While the varieties seem nearly limitless, we recommend the simpler the better. Stay classic, stay tasty. Sincerely yours, The MDC"
Kara S.,"West Hartford, CT",234,274,55,3.0,5/9/2009,When CF opened in BBS I couldn't WAIT to try it.  Now that I have a few times I've boiled it down to these things to relay to you: The desserts rock.  They are worthy of stopping in and getting something to take home. The portions are huge--for everything they serve. I love their potstickers. I wouldn't wait longer than 10 minutes for a table.   that's about it.
Sandi G.,"West Hartford, CT",0,47,4,2.0,1/23/2015,"Food is ok, drinks are incredibly overpriced; with all the choices in Blue Back and WeHa Center, there are many better options in my opinion."
Rosa M.,"Key West, FL",41,15,,3.0,5/19/2014,"It was a nice place. Just what you would expect out of any Cheesecake Factory. My only complaint would be the seating. My boyfriend and I were sat on a long booth next to a family with two children. We wanted to be able to speak in private and not have people listen in on us. But other than that, it was fine."
McKenzie C.,"Hebron, CT",1,18,,5.0,5/31/2015,"I have been going to this restaurant for years and just recently started going more often and its become one of my partner and I's favorite date spots here in CT. The food is priced reasonably and the quality is perfect. I highly recommend going around lunch time as it can get busy at night, especially Friday and Saturday. The service is always great, even when they make a mistake they always fix it. For example, the one not so good experience we had was because of the wait (over an hour and no food) the manager came over and apologized multiple times as did the waiters and they did their best to get the food out as quickly as they could. On top of that, the manager took our meals off of the bill and we only had to pay for our desserts. The selection is also something that I love about this place. I really suggest you try the Stuffed Mushroom and Samosa appetizers. The Cuban Sandwich, Parmesan Chicken and Steak Diane are incredible. As for the Cheesecake, its the best Ive had outside of New York City. The Chocolate Mousse , Tiramisu, and Peppermint Cheesecake are among our favorites there. The lighting is a bit dark but I actually enjoy it, its very romantic but its also family friendly."
Chrissy L.,"Middletown, CT",44,133,67,4.0,5/20/2012,"What can I say that others haven't already said?  Hmmm... The atmosphere:  Was great.  It was a little loud in there, but we were there in the middle of a Sunday afternoon and it looked like there were several large parties celebrating graduations.  :)  The place was packed! The wait time:  Eh, it was OK.  I think we waited 10 or so minutes?  They wouldn't let my friend put her name in until we were all present, which I kind of get, but is annoying. The menu:  Is long.  And it has ads in it.  I've never seen that before.  Does that make me unworldly?  But because there is so much that they offer, there is something for everyone.  They also have a special menu of reasonably-portioned meals. The food:  I have some food restrictions, but I try not to be obnoxious about them.  I had the turkey burger without the bun, and broccoli instead of the fries.  It was delicious!  And for dessert, the three of us split a slice of cheesecake three ways.  We go the key lime/mango, at our waitress's request, and it was such a good suggestion! The service:  Our waitress was very nice.  She was knowledgeable, flexible, and quick with the water.  But the food service felt kind of slow to me.  I don't think that was her fault.  I think that's because the kitchen was so jammed. Oh, yes, I will go back!"
Rosanna M.,"Jacksonville, FL",145,179,733,4.0,5/2/2013,"I have been here so many times, dined indoors and outdoors, and each time I come I always get something different. This past visit I had the kale salad, 30th anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake and a Mai tai. The salad was really delicious with just the right amount of dressing and very light (so that I can have cheesecake!). The cheesecake itself was really good, I loved the combination of cheesecake and the chocolate cake with the chocolate truffle cream and the crispy chocolate balls at the end of the cake. The Mai tai had the right balance of alcohol and fruitiness. Service is great each time I come. The only thing is the wait, depending on when and what time you come. But there is a Barnes and Noble nearby where you can browse or even use the free wifi while you are waiting for your pager to notify you that your table is ready. The only thing that I don't like (well, my fault actually) is that I live too far!"
Albina C.,"Willimantic, CT",1,28,24,4.0,5/10/2009,"My friend took me here for mothers day. We had to wait 90 min. for the table but it's holiday so I knew it was going to be like that. We were so hungry!!!  we thought that our watting pass didn't work, but finally it vibrated and we were seated.  For appetizer, we had avocado egg rolls and they were sooo good.  Then I had Caesar/chicken salad and my friend had herb-crusted salmon salad and both were delicious.  Portions are huge, I took half of mine home.  For drinks, we had pineapple mohito and I like it a lot Dessert is excellent, you must try Tiramisu cheesecake. We will defiantly go back with our husbands. Today, they were very busy, but still service was great."
Jeff J.,"San Jose, CA",221,488,226,2.0,2/26/2012,"It's never the fairest thing to rate a restaurant based on a non-specialty (in this case Sunday brunch), but if you're going to offer it, it better be good.  Otherwise, don't offer it at all. I ordered lemon zest ricotta pancakes with fresh strawberries.  Pancakes were ordinary, I could hardly taste any lemon, the ricotta was just haphazardly scattered on the plate, not integrated into the pancakes, and the strawberries were cooked and reduced, so it wasn't readily apparent whether they were fresh or not.  So, you ask... what was I really eating?   Not entirely sure.  I might as well have gone to the local diner."
Kristin G.,"West Hartford, CT",11,43,5,3.0,3/7/2014,"I had a wonderful bartender for the lunch hour. The food at the cheesecake factories is never good enough to write home about but it is consistent and 'ok'. I do enjoy the drinks- oddly enough they make the best frozen piña colada I've ever had in the states, despite being absurdly decorated with massive pieces of fruit. Their cheesecake I feel used to be better- but I still enjoy it. One slice is enough to serve 2 easily."
Christopher S.,"Hartford, CT",6,128,11,2.0,12/29/2012,"if hell was a chain restaurant, voila.  really when i walk in there from now on i just expect somebody to jam a buzzer up my  ass and tell me to fuck off for 45 minutes. only to come back 45 minutes later and the buzzer still isn't vibrating and my butt isn't tingling.   then the blank stare of 3 idiots when you ask them a question or where you are on the list to be seated. the food is mediocre, service is shit, and the pricing is some of the worst around.    no desire to ever come here again, any cheesecake factory, not just this one.  they are all the same.   all the ""i love this, oh i love this, this, this"" are from people who don't get out of their 10 mile radius box to eat, or have ever left the state, or are just fat and food is food, fuck it."
Yush K.,"Terryville, CT",28,72,25,4.0,4/28/2012,I love this place because of the enviroment.... the portion size... and you never say that it was not good. Oh yea...the food looks pretty! Okay. So today I had fish and chips... I know pretty silly I was craving them... NOT GOOD! The fries sucked I dont know how you can fail fries?  I have been in love with their louisiana chicken. That is masterd recipe. It spicey yummy crunchy and I just cant explain how good it is. You must try it! Cheesecakes are incredibly good. The pineapple upside down! and Godiva chocolate cheese cake are my favorties! Bit overpriced... but hey its west hartford. Servers are sometime stuck up... not sure why?!? They dont provide you nutritional info ... sad. Only on the back with smaller menue. Brunch is only on Sundays... which is not cool.
Bryan R.,"Hartford, CT",101,588,542,2.0,2/9/2011,"The food is above average and definately not worth the wait.  I have never gone when there isn't a 2 hour wait and usually it ends up being more like a 3 hour wait.  Yet, the don't take reservations, go figure...  In summary I wouldn't go here if my grandmother was having her 100th birthday party.  I hate it that much."
Murielle D.,"Rocky Hill, CT",80,42,,3.0,4/2/2012,"CheeseCake Factory never fails to satisfy my appetite! The portions are very generous and the quality of the food is ""average-to-great"".  Service is typically good, both with the personnel and the time to order and have your meals prepared.   The two main things that avert me from dining at CheeseCake more often is (1) The lllooooonnnnnnnggggg wait (every half hour that elapsed, they'll tell you it will be only 5 more minutes - Don't fall for it; You'll be there for a 'minute', trust me!); (2) Encyclopedia-like menu to select from - By the time I got to page 22 of the menu, I forgot what I wanted for Appetizer from page 9 thru 12, and then couldn't make up my mind for desserts, which were in pages 40 thru 66 (I'm exaggerating just a tad about all the pages, but you feel my drift!)"
Terence F.,"Bristol, CT",389,9,3,4.0,2/26/2013,"Very good food, good service, low cost parking nearby and of course fabulous cheesecake!"
Andre S.,"Farmington, CT",13,60,10,4.0,1/20/2014,Alright service and good food if you chose the right things if not then it hurt you. When asking about a drink selection it had a lot to be desired. Honestly the prices were higher than I would of liked to pay for specific foods. But all in all I would say come and eat here just pay attention to the selection.
Aimee A.,"Honolulu, HI",65,71,31,3.0,12/18/2011,"good old cheesecake factory... i love their chicken gumbo and tex mex rolls. my roommate and I always end up ordering these. Oh, and factory nachos too. The only reason why we hesitate coming to this place is because it is always packed and you have to wait at least 30 minutes for your food to come out.  Sigh...the wait is almost always worth it though...;)"
Ed A.,"Somers, CT",5,18,13,3.0,4/26/2012,"Having a Sunday brunch with the family, California omelette, it's was very good. Service was good as well. Can't wait for a piece of cheesecake!  I didn't  care for my cheese cake and way overpriced for such a tiny piece of cake."
Margaret S.,"Norcross, GA",19,20,2,3.0,2/2/2014,"Let's start with the food--very good. Everyone enjoyed their dinner & cheesecake.  Waitress was wonderful.    We went to celebrate my step daughter's birthday. A party of 10, including a elderly person & toddler. When we came here last year with same group, we waited less than an hour to be seated. This year, it was over 2 hrs. We were able to get the elderly a chair to sit on but we had to find a sitter for the toddler. They do not take reservations at all. They should take reservations for parties 6 or larger. The number of tables for larger groups is limited so it would definitely improve customer service."
Elizabeth P.,"New Britain, CT",0,6,,5.0,7/31/2014,This is the place to go if you have a group of people who can't agree on a specific food type.  The menu is HUGE and diverse...at least 20 pages...not including the 2...or is it 3 pages? of cheesecake and desserts.  I would recommend coming here for lunch as there is quite a wait for dinner.  Your luck might be a little better in the summer when more people are outside at BBQs instead of dining out.  I think it's safe to say CT needs more than two Cheesecake Factories...come on now!  With all that demand why isn't someone building another one?  The West Hartford location needs to at least get a second floor...the high ceilings are interesting to look at but are a huge waste of space.
