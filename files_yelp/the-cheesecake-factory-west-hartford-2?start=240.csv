Sharon R.,"West Hartford, CT",21,13,,2.0,2/1/2014,"Overrated, unhealthy, always a long wait. They should just sell cheesecake, their cheesecake is amazing!"
K L.,"Norristown, PA",95,135,191,4.0,11/18/2013,"It can be a long wait to be seated (and get food), especially without being able to make a reservation. The menu is extensive and has something for everyone. The food comes in large portions so I take the other half back or share my entree with someone else. The cheesecakes are delicious."
Nicole D.,"Bristol, CT",341,1543,221,5.0,12/31/2010,"I. LOVE. The Cheesecake Factory!! Be prepared to take some time reading the menu... it's 230498230948 pages long!!! Yet somehow the wait staff seem to have the whole thing memorized. The portions are HUGE, the service is great, and if you somehow manage to have room left for dessert.....the cheesecake menu is impossible to pass up. SO many options, all of which seem to be wonderful. The Sunday brunch (10am-2pm) is also great - huge portions, and you don't have a wait - every time I've gone I've been able to walk right in and sit down! LOVE this place!!"
Ph B.,"West Hartford, CT",5,55,1,1.0,2/1/2011,The food is boring and not very good. What I have tasted seemed like it was cooked sometime ago (in a universe far away?) and then warmed up. The decor is not to my taste at all.  Have only been when it was someone else's choice.
Kim M.,"Avon, CT",1,47,,4.0,10/1/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is a more upscale American restaurant. THE POSITIVES: Food- Delicious! I love the Chicken and Pasta Entrees! The appetizers (hello macaroni and cheese balls?!) are superb Variety- SO MUCH FOOD! There are so many things on the menu I just want to order it all! Location- Located conveniently in Blue Back Square Decor- I love it! It's like modern Egyptian mixed with just a modern and classy feel THE NEGATIVES: Price- It can get pricey just warning you. I  think cheesecake can go for about $15 a slice and entrees range from about $15 (salad) - $40 (seafood or something) Service- It isn't horrible but it isn't great Seating- I was at my friend's birthday dinner and the 8 of us were sharing a big round booth but it was very tight I thought.  Waiting- This used to be worse when it first opened but sometimes you have to wait a very long time before you are seated. Portion- Now, I don't know why people complain about portion size. You get sooo much food! I would rather get extra food to take home rather than not enough food! YAY FOOD! Overall The Cheesecake Factory is delicious and I wish I went there more often! - Kim :)"
Pete E.,"Torrington, CT",23,207,52,4.0,6/5/2009,"We thought it was good! As chain restaurants go, there is a degree of mediocrity to be expected, but this place surpassed my presumptions. The wait staff was friendly and service was prompt. The food was rather good, actually, if not a bit over-indulgent. They even managed to muster up a pretty decent Caipirinha upon request (!), which is literally a first in my drink-ordering experience in this state. I'm lucky if I don't get a raised eyebrow over a Mojito at some places... Sit outside, order their massive appetizer sampler and embarrass your accompanying diner with an inconspicuous slip to the host(ess) that it's their birthday. It'll be an enjoyable setting and a throwaway excuse for a drink before five."
Megan R.,"Rocky Hill, CT",72,149,243,2.0,4/6/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is a place that I usually avoid.  My friend organized a ladies night out, and this was the spot, so of course I found street parking after a couple drives around the block and went on in. Upon arriving, I realized that I was the first one, so I left my name with the hostess and went to the bar to wait. The bartender was very nice, and offered menus while I waited. I bypassed the cocktail list, and ordered a Bombay Sapphire gimlet. I didn't look at the cocktail list because I assumed the high priced drinks would have been filled with fancy fruit juices.  Well, my gimlet was delicious, and $12.75. The ladies arrived and we were brought to a big round table for the six of us. We were chatting and having a blast, but I did notice the long gaps between seeing a server, getting our waters, then getting a drink order, and so on. I was set with my drink, but the other girls were waiting for a good amount of time. The server, was very nice, explained to us that the menu was about 20 pages and overwhelming to most.  In my opinion, diners should be the only restaurants with that much menu. The only thing 150 menu items makes me think is how much of it has been frozen in the back for a month? Plus, most everything is overpriced.  We decided to order a bunch of small plates (not appetizers, those were on page 8) and share everything.  Now, don't get me wrong, get a bunch of female friends together, give them each a drink, and stick 10 plates of food in front of them, everything is going to get eaten. But to be honest, nothing stood out so much that I can even remember specific items that we enjoyed! I know the Ahi Tuna Tartare was not too bad, and I also like the fried artichokes. There was a avocado spring roll (?) that we like also. As for dessert, we went for a Reese's Chocolate Cheesecake and Oreo Cheesecake to share.  I had an awesome time with the girls, and the staff at The Cheesecake Factory were very nice and professional, but I probably won't go back just for dinner, or recommend. I might order cheesecake to take home, though."
Jim T.,"Chicago, IL",7,85,,4.0,8/18/2013,"Located in a cool spot in West Hartford. Typical Cheesecake Factory fare - better, if not the best, among national chains. Servers were all cool and very attentive. Will definitely be back -  Thanks!"
Ray V.,"Queens, NY",103,279,369,4.0,3/12/2010,"We decided to go to Cheesecake Factory with a bunch of my friends. Got there, put our name in and waited about 45 mins to get a table. I said to myself, ""This better be worth it"". Let me start my review by telling you that my server, Jen, is the most attentive and friendly server I've ever met in this part of the Northeast chain restaurant. I wanted her to quit her job and work for me as my female butler. Anyway ... Ordered a mojito to start the meal. It was OK, not the 'real"" mojito I get back in NYC but it's drinkable. Wouldn't recommend it though. For appetizers we ordered the Buffalo blast, spinach and cheese dip, and avocado egg roll. They all came out great, especially the avocado egg roll. Creamy avocado and crispy egg roll skin. Definitely recommend it. For dinner, I ordered the Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira combination (served with mashed potatoes). I was told by the waitress that you can substitute mashed potatoes with steamed veggies if you want to cut down on the carb. The steak are little medallions of juicy and delicious meat. It comes in medium rare like I ordered so that's another thumbs up. I'm not too excited about the chicken, it was rather bland for me. To end this gluttony fest, I ordered a Key Lime cheesecake. Sweet and sour key lime taste ended my dinner with a smile and the conviction that Cheesecake Factory is unbelievable good and taught me not to doubt chain restaurants."
Anthony L.,"Hartford, CT",2,70,2,4.0,11/29/2010,"I recently went on a Saturday afternoon with some friends.  This wasn't my first time there but my friends have never been so we gave it a try.  We got there 30 minutes after they opened and was seated immediately.  We decided to order a bunch of small plates and appetizers so that we could save room for dessert. We started with the Dynamite Tempura Shrimp.  The shrimp was small but tasty.  Next was the Stuffed Mushrooms.  They were very good.  Next we tried the Fried Zucchini.  I was hoping they would be similar to Eggplant Fries like they have at Joey Garlics but not the case.  They were OK but nothing special.  We also had the Vietnamese Tacos.  It's basically a take on the Chinese roast pork bun (char siu bao) served in the same type of bun that usually accompanies Peking Duck along with some pickled vegetables.  It was decent.  The final small plate that we ordered was a Wild Mushroom Pizzette.  They're basically flat breads (pizzas).  They tasted good but I thought that the crust should have been a lot crispier.  All the small plates were a decent size, basically the size that you would normally receive as appetizers from other restaurants and priced similarly. We also ordered two appetizers, the Thai Lettuce Wraps and Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip.  First of all their appetizers are huge, the size of entrées at many other restaurants.  They cost a bit more but that is to be expected given the portion size.  The Spinach Dip was accompanied by a huge portion of nacho chips.  They were tasty.  The Thai Lettuce Wraps were also very good. For dessert we ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake and the Tiramisu Cheesecake.  They were both ultra rich and both really tasty. For a chain restaurant, the Cheesecake Factory does a good job.  I've always enjoyed my experience.  The food has always been tasty every time I've went, the portions are huge and a good bang for your buck.  Service has always been attentive and helpful.  The only issue I've ever had is how ridiculous waiting times for a table can be."
Mary P T.,"Branford, CT",17,33,,4.0,5/30/2015,"Today we went to this Cheesecake Factory and a very nice, tall, dark, long-haired man sat us at a tiny corner with a very small table. I said could we be moved- he said the other tables are all the same size. I asked can we be sat at a booth-none available. He seemed put out, but he did it. Next thing you know we see two lovely, thin, svelte gorgeous girls get shown to a booth right where I was asking to be seated. I am not thin/svelte or young-but we did spend well over $85 at this establishment and the two thin lovely young girls got water and a sandwich to split and then sent it back. So who won? I got a good app, great meal and a delicious Oreo cheesecake dessert at a lousy small corner table and the Cheesecake factory lost a customer. The food was great and so was our server, Keith. The host/person who shows you to a seat was a dunce and a poor choice was made by him to cater to two pretty thin girls instead of two pretty girls who actually like to eat and spend $. We won't be going back"
Stephanie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",355,280,325,2.0,7/9/2008,"While I generally love the Cheesecake Factory, I have to say otherwise for this one. We went for lunch. I LOVE this area...it's got some really nice shops and a nice area to eat outside, although we opted to eat inside. I got my regular meal...Chicken Costoletta, which was tasty as usual. Our waitress was very nice and attentive...but not overly. I also ordered a pineapple mojito, which was yummy too. J and I split the Tiramisu cheesecake.  However......three hours later and I was SO sick. Now, normally I wouldn't let this affect my rating...but this was the only place I ate that day. And J was feeling horrible as well. I want to be forgiving...but what else could it be?"
Sara W.,"Central Manchester, CT",151,156,39,3.0,12/30/2010,"Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple. That's all I have to say. (Okay okay....the meals are decent too - HUGE portions.  Like RIDICULOUS sizes.  Makes for a good second meal, though!)"
Ashika B.,"Hartford, CT",118,402,90,3.0,1/20/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is everything you expect from a popular chain restaurant-unacceptably long wait times, noise, crowds and absentminded staff. That said, you can also expect a large menu where everything is good, every time. The Factory Meatloaf and Shepards Pie are my favorite dishes. The portions are obscenely large but who doesn't love good leftovers? The $8 Sunday brunch is a great value for families. It's a chain so it doesn't take itself too seriously and neither should its patrons. You pretty much know what you're getting. Chains have their place and if you can endure the wait, the Cheesecake Factory will generally hit the spot."
Riordan R.,"Farmington, MI",1,29,,4.0,11/16/2012,"Nice place, awsome atmosphere.  Located in the heart of the charming West Hartford, so you can't go wrong there. The food is good, the cakes to die for... I was a little disapointed with the expresso after dinner, but nothing that would make me not going back.  Excellent place for a quick fine lunch, not too expensive, good service. I would take a date there with no problem at all... Worthwhile the experience !"
Anon Y.,"Rochester, NY",2,99,1,4.0,8/21/2012,"Bread is great. BBQ salmon with mashed potatoes and succotash is great. Fish tacos are great. Herb encrusted salmon, not so great. Server-recommended shrimp jambalaya pasta, not so great.  Cheesecake, of course, is great.  Wait is long, and it's noisy. But the the food is almost always good and the atmosphere so beautiful that I always feel pampered on the rare occasions my husband takes me there. To the elitists decrying chain restaurants: a chain restaurant was once a local place that was so good it went viral. So let's stop being counter-culture and just enjoy some good food, shall we?"
Christy H.,"California, MD",13,22,29,5.0,11/15/2012,"Great service off and on here, busy at times, however, never had an issue at all-peak times are weekends of course and later in the evening! Try their Sunday Brunch! Blueberry & the Classic Cherry Cheesecakes are my fav's!!! :)"
R L.,"Austin, TX",5,14,6,3.0,7/11/2012,"I came here with a group of 8 old friends from college to get together and catch up. The cheesecake factory isn't really my kind of place but my friends chose it and they figured it'd be good for a larger group. I've been to the Cheesecake factory multiple times in Boston and Baltimore (always my boyfriend's choice)  when we've wanted to just get a quick, casual lunch usually while traveling. The food's always been fine, service fine, etc...a solid 3 stars.  But my latest experience in West Hartford has really soured me from this chain because of our server. She was completely transparent in that she did not want to be there and did not want to be serving our group. For such a low key, undemanding group of 9-10 people, I would have thought she'd have been happy for the opportunity to get a large and easy tip. I'm usually reluctant to criticize a server because  I understand it's hard work and that everybody can have a bad day. But I left the restaurant feeling almost insulted by her thinly veiled annoyance.   And now that's the feeling I will recall when I see a Cheesecake Factory...so no thanks to friends' future proposals of a Cheesecake Factory visit. I still gave this restaurant 3 stars because I believe one server does not reflect an entire restaurant or a typical experience at said restaurant. I spoke to another server during the same night who was extremely pleasant and helpful. Everybody in my group was also fine with their food and drinks and our  servers in the past have been fine. So if you're looking for a casual bite to eat and don't mind chains and everything that comes with a chain - go for it. It won't be amazing but it should be fine."
Walter G.,"Southington, CT",5,2,,4.0,7/14/2012,One of my favorite restaurant chains with consistently good service and food at this location.  The menu is more like a book that should satisfy just about any craving.  Prepare for a wait during evenings but take advantage of beautiful downtown West Hartford and walk around.  I suggest to avoid a sick stomach or the feeling that you're going to pop.....either share a dish or take your dessert home.
Samantha M.,"New Britain, CT",0,8,1,1.0,2/21/2014,"Whenever I come here the hostesses look at me as if their confused as to what people are doing there and what their job is. Usually I have to greet them after silence.  On my last visit, an off the clock employee sat herself next to my table. My server ignored us to chat with her. He also lost our order and had to retake it ten minutes later. When our server was sat again he and the hostess started to argue INFRONT of my table. The off duty waitress had her son blasting his game on his iPad for the entire dinner. And to top it off, our server complained loudly that his last table stiffed him, but would just give himself a tip by over charging their giftcard. As a server, I was completely shocked by the behavior of the staff at The Cheesecake Factory."
