C T.,"Waterbury, CT",0,9,,4.0,12/14/2013,This is a great restaurant i have been here several times and the variety of food on the menu can't be beat and everything I've tried so far has been great. I usually get the chicken chipolte pasta and its always constantly awesome the cheesecake factory in West Hartford is definitely one of the best restaurants in CT and by far the best chain restaurant i have ever been too. The only negative is the wait time to be seated for this place on the weekend is usually lengthy but if you go there expecting to wait its well worth it for this restaurant.
Amanda P.,"Bristol, CT",136,22,,4.0,4/25/2011,"Great place to go for any occasion ....brunch, lunch, dinner, dessert!  They have a variety of food so it is great to meet there if you are with people who like different kinds of food and can't make up your mind on where to go to please everyone.   Their cheesecake is SO yummy!!!  But the food is amazing also and the drinks are also great!!   The outdoor seating is great in the summer!!"
Art S.,"New Haven, CT",104,463,19,2.0,3/31/2009,"Let me tell you why I hate CF. Because everything on their menu actually sounds really good. And then the food comes out, and it's mediocre at best. Which is fine. It's a chain restaurant. I'm ok with mediocre. What I'm not ok with is when things are supposed to taste a certain way and end up tasing like something else. Exhibit A: Tex-Mex Egg Rolls. Chicken, corn, peppers, etc. Some kind of avocado cilantro sauce thing, I dunno... What I do know is that it tasted like sausage and black pepper. That's it. Mind you, there is no sausage in it.  Now, I'm not against sausage... when that's what I order. But, this crap that they served me was atrocious. The girl who was our server took care of it, and asked if I wanted anything else, so I just ordered sliders, because I didn't want to think about it. The sliders were fine. But, shit, how can you screw up mini-burgers? Anyway, really, there is only one reason to come here. The cheesecake. It really is fantastic. We had the white chocolate blueberry swirl, or whatever it was called. It was really good.  So, the recap: Cheesecake: 5 stars Food: 0 stars Service: Good enough. Bottom line... it's ok to come here, just keep it simple. And stay for dessert."
Marcy K.,"Chelmsford, MA",59,342,1,3.0,4/18/2009,"To celebrate our niece's 21st birthday, we headed to this Cheesecake Factory and were immediately seated at 1:30. Couldn't believe there was no wait, as there is ALWAYS a wait in the Cheesecake Factory in Burlington, MA. Everyone said their Mai Tais and the Watermelon Margarita were tasty. I liked my Fresca.  Appetizers included fried calamari, margherita pizette, and the crispy fried cheese. The fried calamari was the best we've tasted since the outstanding order we had in San Diego at C-Level, and we've tried many. Mr. K and I had burgers on wheat loaf, but we had to send back the fries because they were unbelievably salty. Mr. K ordered the crispy onion rings with his meal, but they almost slid off the plate from the grease and gave me acne just from looking at them. The others had four-cheese pasta, Cajun jambalaya pasta, and farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. The burgers were so-so and should never have been placed on wheat loaf because they were two combating tastes. I ate my burger without the bun. The jamabalaya got rave reviews, but the other two dishes were meh, although there was plenty to take home.  How can one go to the Cheesecake Factory and not get cheesecake? We ended up ordering blueberry cheesecake, kahlua cocoa coffee, and another chocolate one whose name escapes me. All were yummy, of course. The waiter, who was very nice, brought out my niece's cheesecake with her name scrawled in chocolate on the side, and a few of the other waiters sang happy BD. The coffee wasn't worth it. We parked in a garage for $0.75 a half hour. Just like Boston ;-)"
Jeannette B.,"Sarasota, FL",74,46,4,4.0,6/14/2012,"I finally figured out when to come to this place and not have to wait. Sunday afternoon, around 3 pm. There was no wait time...at all...Typical chain restaurant fare, menu is a bit overwhelming if you have never been here. Went for the red velvet cheesecake (to go since I was sooo stuffed)"
Veronica M.,"New Britain, CT",3,12,2,4.0,8/5/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of those places you go to for the experience.  This restaurant is perfectly located amongst many other businesses in a fairly quiet plaza with minimal car traffic which is what draws me to this place time and time again.  The food isn't anything too spectacular, but it isn't average either so you're guaranteed a delicious meal every time.  Back to the experience.  The ambiance in this restaurant is what earns its 4-stars and is better than anything I've ever experienced in any other restaurant.  It's romantic, it's intimate, and it delivers this each time without fail.  The wait may be long, sometimes up to 2 hours, but it's well worth it.  It's not overly loud or too quiet.  The staff is always friendly and there to cater to you while giving just enough space to make your dinner selections without feeling rushed or forgotten.  There are different options for seating whether you like sitting in a bar area, on an outdoor patio, or general booth seating.  A table for two may be somewhat uncomfortable so I'd steer clear of those, but the booths offer more than enough room to really feel comfy.  The high ceilings, architecture, and atmosphere all make this the perfect location for a date night.  Although the wait may seem too long to be worth it, the area makes for a perfect stroll during your wait which just adds to the experience of your evening.  If you're looking for a new place to dine and care more about having a lovely evening, this place will absolutely not disappoint."
Brigid L.,"Rocky Hill, CT",2,2,1,1.0,5/8/2013,"Read how the Cheesecake Factory really feels about persons with disabilities! Called your West Hartford location to see if they could accommodate 20 disabled people. Was told I can't make reservations or hold a table or call ahead and get put on the wait list. Was told it was a first come first serve basis. We were still going to come but then the person on the phone said that my whole party had to be there to seat us. I explained we were coming from the arthritis foundation fundraiser and most of these people can't stand for more than a few minutes and are severely disabled. They said no. I said so you're going to push away business, a guaranteed 20 people, appetizers, meals, desserts, drinks? And he said I guess so. Well this party of 20 is boycotting and telling their friends."
Mike B.,"Springfield, MA",7,60,1,5.0,4/23/2012,"First time at the cheesecake factory, it was great. The food was awesome, and obvisously the cheesecake is amazing!! i had brunch there.."
Chandara B.,"Meriden, CT",64,2,,1.0,5/21/2012,I went to go eat there on the Sunday of 5/20/2012 and the food and service was awful. There was fruit flies flying everywhere around my food and it even landed in my food. Terrible service and none of the meals served at my table was fully cooked or over cooked.
J.. M.,"West Hartford, CT",0,12,,2.0,4/15/2014,"Service was good.   Crap wontons had no flavor. I do not recommend.  I ordered a ""plain"" cheesecake to go, which also means no whip cream.  I received a cheesecake with the whip cream smeared off the top.  Disappointed.  I expected better quality."
Tom H.,"West Haven, CT",0,7,,1.0,4/7/2014,"It was my first time there and it took us an hour to be seated. Waiter tells me, "" I don't know what I've been missing, we have over 300 items on our menu"" and I ask myself, is this a Greek dinner or a real restaurant. Ordered the tex mex spring rolls which were decent. I go to use my fork and found food stuck to it. My friend ordered a fruit smoothie that was watered down. The music they were playing was way to loud to enjoy dinner over. It's sad that people actually think this place is cool when its a total gimmick."
Christopher C.,"Naugatuck, CT",6,70,,4.0,3/31/2012,"I ate here for the first time today and even though there was a 45 minute wait for a table they did give us a wireless pager that tells you when your table is available... so we walked around this beautiful section of West Hartford while we waited.  The service was excellent. The waitress was very nice and checked on our table 5 times, which seems to be rare these days. Most of the places you eat at you're lucky if the server checks on you 3 times. The menu is huge with a wide variety of foods. I know a lot of people dislike large menus but for me personally I am big on variety and it is nice to have a wide selection. I chose the chicken stuffed soft tacos which comes with black beans and a small corndish. I'm not a big fan of corn dishes but that was the first thing I tried and it wasn't bad, however the cream that comes on top of it tasted a bit out of place. The black beans were quite good, but it's just black beans. The chicken stuffed soft tacos were pretty darn good. They were stuffed with all the usual ingredients and topped with melted cheese, salsa, and finely diced tomatoes. It was quite good. My only complaint at all is it was slightly bland for my taste, but I tend to have greedy taste buds and like things having a bit more kick than the average person. The portions are huge, some of the biggest I have ever seen, in fact. You have to be mighty hungry to finish it all in one service. The cheesecakes are just absolutely perfect, and with such a wide selection I doubt you'd ever get bored trying them. They also have some light cheesecake selections for those on a diet and the same goes for the entree menu. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience. However make sure to bring a big wad of cash when you come here. Also be prepared for a very loud environment as this place seems to be packed to the brim at all times. PS - Giving a place low rating because its food has high calories is STUPID! I can't believe how many negative reviews I see based on the lack of health food. if you want health food go to a health food store and buy it. Obviously a place called CHEESECAKE FACTORY is not going to have much low-fat low-calorie food."
Ryan M.,"New York, NY",121,63,1,5.0,4/7/2009,"People in CT need to get over their hate relationship for anything chain owned! OK: So to start I had a long standing urge to visit this place upon hearing many oh so excellent rumors. Finally at long last I convinced a friend who had also never had the pleasure to join me. Finding the factory isn't hard, it's right in the middle of blue back square. Easiest landmark for the square is the giant white Crate & Barrel along the main road.  The interior is a big step above most local establishments. Kinda reminded me of being very Disney like, sort of a toned town and family oriented Aztec Temple. Huge ceilings which help really make the place seem open.  And since it's a restaurant: FOOD: There is so much! The menu really is near biblical in size. So much to choose from it helped the waitress was very attendant and helpful throughout the meal. We started with just cheese sticks as an appetizer, taking a Burrito for myself while my company went with salmon salad. Portions are huge and all sides were served on a separate dish which was nice. I mash it all together anyways! For drinks we went with a Pom Frozen Margarita & a Long Island. Drinks were the only pricey part - $12 and $14 but otherwise the meals really didn't come across and any pricier than other local joints.  One Bonus: The To Go boxes are sturdy and washable for reuse!"
Molly S.,"West Hartford, CT",0,3,,3.0,3/20/2014,The only reason to go here is the cheesecake. Food was mediocre. Not worth going. Over rated and over priced!
Ashley C.,"Buffalo, NY",67,149,7,4.0,11/5/2011,"I've been here three times, twice to the West Hartford location, and once in the one in Smithtown, NY. Both times, the service was prompt, despite the volume of patrons. I find the décor to be pretty cool, Egyptian-influenced. The food is pretty tasty; my favorite appetizer is the spinach dip. The cheesecake, however, is absolutely amazing (in my opinion). My favorite is the tiramisu cheesecake. My only warning is that the food tends to be pricey: a group of four racked up a bill of about $120 (shared appetizer, entrees, cheesecake, and coffee). Still, if you can afford to splurge a bit, I think it's worth it. Definitely one of my hits in West Hartford."
Sarah L.,"New Britain, CT",44,200,509,2.0,10/15/2011,"Only good thing is the cheesecake.  Outrageous portions on the rest of the menu. I only go and get the cheesecake for takeout. If you like ridiculous chain restaurants, then you'll love it. I only go there if forced to! Plus, the wait is always crazy and I don't think it is worth the wait."
Evan G.,"New York, NY",45,332,35,3.0,12/21/2008,"I went to the cheesecake factory this summer because a friend of mine wanted to go for her birthday.  I have been before and never really been overly impressed.  Yes the cheesecake is good, but it and the food are EXTREMELY overpriced for the quality, and there always is a long wait.  We had one person go ahead and put our name down since they wanted to shop anyway.  They were told it was a 2 hour wait, turned out to be well over 3. The only food we got that I really enjoyed was the fried Mac and Cheese.  Everything else we got, although might have been good was probably $5 higher than the quality. Unless its under similar circumstances I probably wont go back.  I have no personal interest in going, but sometimes the company is more important."
Chuck C.,"Vernon, CT",116,190,3,4.0,7/28/2011,"As a fairly new restaurant, the Cheesecake Factory is modern-looking and elegant. Having been here several times, I can say that the food is consistantly excellent. The servers have always been attentive and professional. Remember: Most parking for Blueback Square is in the parking garage, which you must pay for. Alternatively, you can park in the Whole Foods parking lot. It is frowned upon by Whole Foods, but I've never heard of anybody being towed or ""found out."" The Cheesecake Factory can be a bit expensive compared to a Friendly's, but it isn't much more than the Olive Garden, and the food is much better."
Christina R.,"New Haven, CT",0,63,2,5.0,9/30/2009,"This place is amazing. I don't care if it's a chain. Yes, the wait is usually long, but with a place that good, you could understand why!! The food makes the wait worth it. Last time I went I had the orange chicken dish for lunch and I had to take half of it home. The portions are very generous. The cheesecake is absolutely delicious.  The staff is also very nice. My only complaint is that it's a little loud and makes it hard to hear your waiter, but it's all good in the end. I wish I didn't have to drive almost an hour to get there!"
Ryan B.,"North Haven, CT",28,145,,4.0,2/16/2009,"Man, this place is getting a bad wrap on Yelp. I'm all about independently owned places, don't get me wrong, but if I am going to a chain...this place is a more than worthy choice. I've been to the one in Providence numerous times, and you can see my review of that too if you'd like, but I think I honestly prefer this one. The Blue Back Square area is very charming and as a result, this place is always packed. However, their wait times are really honest and accurate.  The menu is full of annoying ads, but if you ignore those and focus on their options...you're in for a treat. There is something on the menu for everyone and everything is really tasty. Check out their fried mac and cheese for an appetizer! Although I am not a huge desert guy at all, I always at least split a piece of cheese cake because it truly is amazing. Tonight I got the chocolate chip cookie dough slice...yum! Really good staff tonight too."
