Max Z.,"Windsor, CT",25,39,15,5.0,12/17/2012,the wait was 30 minutes then it went up to a hour and when i went up they said an hour and 10 minutes and then someone else went back up and the hostess said four tables in front of us and it was the worst service ever the food orders got wrong and we got the cheesecakes in a bag not on a plate
Gina K.,"New York, NY",191,533,1052,4.0,5/2/2011,"Came here with a friend on a Friday night. We went inside and received a vibrating/blinking device to indicate when we would able to be seated. The woman at the front said it would be a 45 minute - 1 hour wait. An hour later, our device buzzed and we were promptly seated at our table. Our waitress came by to ask what we'd like to drink, and I ordered a skinny long island iced tea (150 calories or less) and my friend ordered a gin gimlet. Our drinks were both really good. Not as strong as I would have preferred, but it definitely got the job done. For our appetizer, we ordered the ahi carpaccio. It came in one big piece, which made it a little hard to navigate/break off with a fork. The soy sauce dipping sauce went well with it. There was also some kind of aioli drizzled on top. I really liked our appetizer. It was a nice refreshing start to the meal. Our entrees came out shortly afterwards. My friend got the thai chicken pasta with peanut sauce while I got the fish tacos. The pasta was pretty good. I love peanut sauce, and they also sprinkled a very generous portion of crushed peanuts on top. The chicken was cut into sizeable cubes and it was a good portion. However, there were a few chunks/clusters of pasta that were stuck together and it was hard to pull apart. Other than that, I really enjoyed this dish. The fish tacos were also really good. You could get the fish tempura or plain/regular. I opted for the tempura fish because that's the way I'm used to my fish tacos. The breading was super light and perfect for the fish. The fish tacos came in a corn tortilla. I've never really been that huge of a fan of corn tortillas (I prefer flour tortillas), but it was still really good. The portions of our meals were so huge that we barely finished half of it. We took the rest to go. Overall, I really enjoyed my first Cheesecake Factory experience. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful and made sure we were comfortable throughout our whole meal. The bathrooms are also well-maintained and a prett decent size. They also have a veryyy extensive menu, which actually made it very difficult to choose an entree for me. They pretty much have anything you could be craving, so that was good. I would recommend this place for people who've never been."
Kevin K.,"West Hartford, CT",44,102,170,3.0,5/23/2010,"What's the most overrated restaurant in the world? The Cheesecake Factory!  All the middle aged women out there need to calm down about this place,  Go to the Pond Hose in Elizabeth Park if your trying to charm your date.  The food is good, but nothing to write home about."
Ryan L.,"Farmington, CT",0,25,,3.0,12/21/2013,"Over-rated!! Stars for a beautiful looking restaurant and good service. But the food is good but not great especially for what you are paying! There is a reason why this place is in the heart of Blue Back, it is so darn expensive for what you get. Expect to pay 12 bucks for an average burger and a few fries. The food itself is also some of the most unhealthy you could possibly eat. A good place to eat but I don't understand the lines for this place. An okay restauraunt"
Gordon E.,"Tempe, AZ",4,168,238,2.0,5/26/2012,"Ugh. Why bother?  It's a large chain.  Same average food.  Huge lines with long waits on the nights you'd go.   You can do better for a night out in West Hartford/Hartford.   The side cheesecake bar makes getting a slice easier if you need a fix.  Yes, the cheesecake is good.  I get it."
Madeline L.,"Springfield, MA",24,20,16,2.0,9/15/2012,"Went on 09/14/12.  Great atmosphere, Good App, I had the Spinach and cheese dip. It was good but not cheesy enough.  The entree sucked big time. I had the Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon Combo dish. The Steak medallions that I received were well done or close to burnt from the medium that I asked for, all 4 of them, and the herb crusted salmon wasn't crusted at all and about  the size of my 4 yr. olds palm. It had no crust, it looked grilled or baked and had a pesto like cream on top.  I'm no complainer, i wish I was but I didn't complain, the mashed potatoes were horrible, and cold. The waiter did ask to fix my dinner, but I didn't want to wait to get it redone due to how full the place was. The drinks were good and the waiter Robert was very attentive and patient with our group. I guess my highlight was the red velvet cheesecake. It was delicious. I guess that's it. Will I go back again, Maybe but most likely no."
Jason P.,"Bristol, CT",9,7,4,4.0,4/9/2011,Go to brunch here on Sundays and get there early!  Everything on the menu is available plus some more.  Everything tastes great!
Kris V.,"New Haven, CT",90,205,13,5.0,1/24/2011,You must try the Mediterranean Mahi Mahi and the Passion fruit mojitos!!!
J M.,"West Hartford, CT",0,13,,2.0,7/26/2010,Went the other day with my family from out of town in celebration of my moms 70th birthday....and was less than impressed....this place is just another chain restaurant and is WAY OVERPRICED!  12 dollars for a martini????? Go at your own risk.....and make sure your pockets are fat...you'll need it!  Jeannette~
Nish S.,"Hayward, CA",0,20,,3.0,10/5/2010,I liked the food variety and selection. Lot of vegetarian dishes (as I don't eat meat) Clean but crowded always. Over all a good experience.  Go there specially to eat its cheese cakes
William A.,"Springfield, MA",0,9,,4.0,6/5/2013,"I have been here several times. The food is good and service is fair to good. The last time I was there was to celebrate a few things, 2 of the menu items they ran out of after we ordered the meal. That was a bit of a disappointment. The rest of the food was good, but do you really go to the CCF to get food?!?!?! Not really. The deserts were awesome. I have traveled the nation a fair amount and tasted many cheese cakes. They definitely have the best and the biggest variety. The location is a great place to make a night of it. Lots to do in Blue Back Square."
Karen P.,"Hartford, CT",1,27,,3.0,10/10/2009,"First-time visit today.  The place is huge, and everything is oversized.  The booths, the tables and chairs, the door handles, the plates... do they want you to eat a ton, or what?  I wasn't crazy about the pseudo-Tuscan/Mediterranean decor, but the colors are warm and inviting.  The service was prompt and our waitress was friendly without being overbearing. The menu is way too long, and from what we tried today, the meals are overpriced and not very tasty.  We had a selection of their appetizers-- nachos, fried mac & cheese, summer rolls-- and a portobello mushroom burger.  The food was mediocre at best and totally nasty at worst.  (Save yourselves the trouble and do NOT order the summer rolls!)  Long, multi-page menus are not often a good sign.  It's like the chef is saying, hey, why work on making a selection good when I can bury it in pages of other options? Anyway, so the meal was a bust.  If I were only rating the meal food, I'd give this place one star.  The desserts, on the other hand, were crazy rich and crazy good!  We had carrot cake, a caramel cheesecake, and limoncello cake, and they were all delicious.  I would definitely come back to try other desserts!  It's big and corporate, but sometimes you have to have a ginormous piece of cheesecake."
Hansen C.,"Hartford, CT",2,18,,2.0,2/13/2012,"The description for the 2 star review on here fits Cheesecake Factory perfectly-- ""Meh. I've experienced better."" I personally have a hard time seeing this place as anything but a chain restaurant, and patrons are blinded by its marketing. This is the type of place you'd frequent if you think Panera is a cute, quaint little cafe. The 2 stars are for the cheesecake alone, which in actuality is delicious, but I HIGHLY doubt they're even prepared fresh on premises. All in all, it's an Applebee's with marble floors (but even the entrees at Applebees may be better)"
Ellie B.,"Springfield, MA",0,13,,1.0,12/22/2012,"In a beautiful location, but it's noisy and cramped (we were shoved into a corner inches away from a table full of strangers). When we left, there was a line out the door. The food is overpriced, and my (very simple) meal was messed up twice. I might try it again when it isn't so busy, but avoid it at all costs on a Friday night."
Frank R.,"West Hartford, CT",0,5,,1.0,2/26/2011,I dont get it. With so many great restaurants in west Hartford why is this place always packed? I'm sorry but I'd rather have fresh cooked food over these microwaved frozen dinners anyday. I'll stick with briccos!
Kate O.,"Frankfort, IL",0,4,1,2.0,12/2/2012,"I was in from out of town visiting West Hartford, quite the charming city with overall terrible service. Me and one other girl went out for Brunch on a sunday. It was slightly crowded, but not quite packed yet when we arrived. We waited just a couple of minutes to be sat, and then the torture began. We waited roughly 15 minutes without even a hello from one of the many servers walking past us and staring. I finally decided to let the hostess know, in case no one had been informed. We waited another 5-10 minutes. A waitress finally peaked her head in and said she'd be back in a few minutes... hooray, not.  We ordered our food and drinks because god knows when we would see her again. We joked that our water wouldn't come until after our food.... but wait, we were right. We also ordered hot tea, with honey and lemon. That came much later, and without tea bags, and no honey or lemon. It was a terrible experience. We debated some cheese cake, but the check was dropped... so no go on that!  Overall I was very disappointed. Mediocre food, with terrible service.  Sidenote, the waitress kept apologizing for the delay and saying that it was just crazy in there, lady, I'm a waitress also, not okay."
John B.,"New York, NY",4819,650,195,1.0,12/18/2008,"In a state and region with so many good locally owned restaurants why would anyone ever consider coming to this corporate food monstrosity? Exactly. If you're looking for a decent lunch, Max's Oyster Bar - two blocks away - is the same price, locally owned and the food is terrific. And Max's isn't the only option for Blue Back Square shoppers. In fairness, I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory because a friend [reassessing the level of friendship, frankly] loves the food - especially the cheesecake - and I didn't want to disappoint her cravings with my superior palate and enthusiastically [to her face] went along and braved the experience. My suspicions confirmed: Cheesecake Factory is more 'factory' than restaurant."
Jeff C.,"East Longmeadow, MA",0,8,,5.0,10/8/2012,Excellent food and always great staff. I recommend Adams Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple cheesecake. In a great downtown location.
Jay M.,"Bristol, CT",1,5,4,4.0,2/28/2009,"We went on a Saturday around 5pm and only had to wait about 15 minutes, must have been lucky I guess. The food was great, the servings were generous for the price and the cheesecake was absolutely the best. My only gripe was the parking."
Brendan O.,"Rockingham, NH",4,25,,4.0,8/16/2009,"Have gone on a few occasions. varied time to wait on a table. Food came in a reasonable amount of time and were large servings. Over the top when it comes to interior design, great for group dining."
