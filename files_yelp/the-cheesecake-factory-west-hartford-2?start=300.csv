Oski B.,"La Crescenta, CA",54,543,229,3.0,6/19/2009,"Arrived at 11:30 for a work lunch.  Apparently, this is when they open their doors and there was a crowd gathering outside waiting to be let in.  Our server, Bethany, was very nice and the food was fine.  Lots of older people seem to enjoy dining here - not the cougar set, but the cougar + 20 set.  It seriously looked like an AARP convention."
Erika S.,"New Haven, CT",145,254,19,4.0,10/21/2008,"So despite all of the negative reviews, I had a really good experience at Cheesecake Factory.  Maybe it was because it was early in September and we sat outside and didn't deal with the crowds of secretaries or maybe it was before pumpkin cheesecake was making it's Blueback debut, I'm really not sure...but I really have no complaints. We were doing some shopping on a Friday night and headed over to CF for dinner.  We experienced a 25 minute wait and decided to grab a drink at the bar while waiting.  I decided on a sangria and my date decided on a Patron El Diablo.  Both drinks were made very well and the bartender was attentive as could be with the demands of a Friday night.  Our little buzz card went off and we took our drinks to our table outside.  Outside was a nicer dining area than I had expected.  There was music, the lighting was good, the seats were comfortable wicker chairs.  We're off to a good start.   We were given a chance to look over the menu and had decided upon Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls for an appetizer; I had chosen the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and my date had chosen the Farfalle with Roasted Chicken and Garlic.  By this time we had finished our drinks that had come from the bar and had decided that we had wanted wine and ordered a bottle of the Cheesecake Factory Chardonnay by Robert Mondavi.  They had Chauteau Ste Michelle on the list but hey, when in Rome, right?! Our appetizer had come out and was presented beautifully for a chain restaurant.  The people here really take pride in what they do.  I was impressed.  This was an excellent dish.  It was fresh ahi tuna seasoned with garlic and green onions then wrapped in nori and flash fried.  YUM!  We had noticed by this point though, that our wine had not come out, so we had flagged down another waiter and asked if they could find our waitress.  A different waiter came out with our wine and apologized for the delay with the wine and explained that our waitress had never done wine table service before and was afraid to do it.  To me that's really not an acceptable reason for disappearing and making a customer wait and wonder where our wine is.  However, the new waiter was funny and made up for her, which is cause for the only one star deduction.  Now that I'm done with the whole wine debacle, I will say that the CF chardonnay wasn't disappointing at all...it was surprisingly very good. Our dinners had finally arrived and in huge portions!  We both ate about a 1/4 of our dishes anticipating a cheesecake finish.  The Louisiana style pasta was excellent and I managed to steal a sample of the farfalle which was equally as tasty. I did notice that it had huge cloves of garlic in the dish, which would have grossed me out if I had bitten into it mistaking it for something else.  Glad it wasn't my dish. Onto the dessert menu.  After careful consideration, we had agreed upon sharing the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  I might go as far as saying this cheesecake was better than some of the most serious retail therapy that I've done!  It was THAT good!  It was heaven on a plate.  Flourless Godiva chocolate cake, Godiva chocolate cheesecake and chocolate mousse .......my night was complete.  Served up with whipped cream and a Godiva square on top. I would definitely come back here, but probably not until spring.  I can imagine this place gets JP'd with holiday parties and cranky shoppers looking for some sweet relief."
Frank G.,"Chicopee, MA",0,35,,5.0,2/14/2012,"The food is great here, everytime I come back I have something different on the menu and I have yet to have had a bad experience. Everything is always cooked perfect and I have always had a nice waiter or waitress and I have been pleased with the service. The only downfall is the extremely long wait times!"
Char A.,"Manchester, CT",0,13,,4.0,12/29/2011,"I am a fan because of the overall atmosphere and food quality. Not a fan of the super dim lighting- I know it's meant for a cozy mood,but not all customers are couples, and I would like to be able to see as I navigate through the restaurant. Their cheesecake is definitely something you have to try- no arguments there. I've had 2 bad experiences with the wait staff- 1st time was during Happy Hour with my sister and I ordered a sandwich that ended up making me stuffed so i put the rest in a to go box- one not eaten sandwich half, and then one half eaten sandwich. When I got home,  I realized the waiter threw out my half eaten sandwich half, and kept the uneaten one with some fries. I was really annoyed that he just threw my half-eaten piece, i was going to eat that one too, but he probably assumed. The second bad waitstaff experience was when I was with 3 other friends and we decided to split the bill at the end, and the waitress gave some serious attitude. She said we should have told her before we ordered, and perhaps she was right, but there was absolutely no need to respond to our request in a tone laced with nastiness and dismissal after returning our receipts to us-slamming the book on our table."
Bryan P.,"Washington, DC",0,238,,4.0,7/9/2013,"not sure why they get such a bad wrap, but maybe the meaty options are disappointing. for vegetarians, this cheesecake factory offers plenty of excellent options. bonus points, too, for a rotating, seasonal menu, which offers up interesting salads."
stacey n.,"West Hartford, CT",19,24,,4.0,5/19/2008,"Let's see........ we went on a sturday afternoon for lunch, so it was quite crowded, however, we chose to sit outside. The service was good, waitress friendly, helpful. The menu is a bit intimidating....around 200 items to choose from!!!  We had the kobe burger and pulled pork sanwiches...... the quality was great and the quantity...........we all had leftovers. Try the cheesecake! We split a slice for dessert..(double chocolate oreo)......very good, very rich.......all in all, a nice lunch experience."
Brian K.,"Wales, MA",1,46,,3.0,6/20/2011,"The food is good and the portions are huge.  the menu is so big I dont knwo hwo they do it.  On this trip, whcih was farthers day, the service was aweful.  Once we got our food we never saw the waitress again.  Our drinks took a long tiem and she blammed it on the fact that she had just gotten there.  Then when we wanted to order dessert she stopped over with another waitress and told us he woudl takening over cause she had to take a required 30 minute break?  WTF?  you just said you just got here."
Jim N.,"Simsbury, CT",1,66,5,1.0,1/2/2008,"Why in who knows whose name would I wait two hours to eat in what is best a mediocre  restaurant?  There are some restaurants in the world I might wait two hours for.   Perhaps Mario Batali's Bobbo in NYC (oh wait, he takes reservations).  There are many good restaurants in West Hartford Center, Brico, Grants, Barcelona, Muraski , Max's Oyster Bar and Arugula.  All of these take reservations so I can plan my evening.  I ate at a Cheesecake factory once while on a business trip. It was late, and out in the burbs in an unfamiliar town.  The choice was  Burger King, Crackerbarrel and Cheescake.  I already had the misfortune of experiencing a Crackerbarrel in my life, and the I will not step foot in the place again.  So it was Cheesecake.  I would have been better off at the Burger King.  At least there, I know what I am getting and its cheap!.    Ok, the food was marginally better than Applebee's but I give Applebee's negative stars.  So that i is not saying much.  The salad greens were good, but man, could they have taken out of the fridge a couple of hours ago (I hate ice cold salads, sort of masks the flavor), but the dressing commercially bland and the pasta entre was Ok. but nothing that didn't suggest a box of Barillia penne with a jar of  decent  marinara sauce.   It was later in the evening, I figured they couldn't screw this up. Given size of the menu, I figured they had to prep this same way I might.   Go to the freezer, get that one serving portion of sauce, nuke it,  boil the pasta and plate it.  It was OK, I could feed my whole family that meal for less than one entre and  it only takes 20 minutes to heat the sauce and boil the water and cook the pasta.  I didn't have to wait in line and it was near the hotel.    As is it was OK.  If I had waited in line for  2 hours and got the same meal, I would be fuming.  I guess I just don't see the attraction."
nicole h.,"Wallingford Center, CT",1,90,,3.0,12/5/2011,"I went here last Tuesday with a group. We had reservations for that night for my friend's birthday. I didn't get the Egyptian statue, but other than that the ambience and decor was very nice almost to the point of fancy. It wasn't loud at all at the restaurant. We parked in the parking garage near the restaurant since there was no open parking spaces on the street. The restaurant is in a plaza area, so parking can be difficult on the street. Service was pretty fast, however the waitress didn't check on my group to see how we were doing. Menu is extensive! There are soo many different selections of food to choose from. I think there's something for everyone here. I had two Georgia Peach drinks. Amazing drink. It could have used some more alcohol because I couldn't even taste it. Of course, the peaches probably hid it very well. However, I had two of those drinks and didn't feel a thing. I ordered a veggie burger without anything on it, not even a bun. I get the burger and there is a thin layer of salt on the burger! I sent it back because I don't put salt on my food and I wanted the burger without anything on it. The menu didn't even say that the burger comes with salt on it. The waitress didn't mention the salt either. The burger was fantastic! It's a homemade veggie burger and it was so moist and delicious. I also ordered a side of fresh asparagus and a side salad. The asparagus was al dente, which I don't like, but I find that is usally the way that asparagus is cooked in restaurants. It was very fresh though. I was pleased with the salad too. It was fresh and was a mixed greens salad, rather than iceberg lettuce. I thought the price of my burger was a great price. The asparagus was expensive though. I didn't have any cheesecake, but the slices of the cheescake are huge (other people in my group ordered cheesecake). I don't think the other food portions are huge, but just enough to satisfy. I eat a lot so that is my opinion. I can't wait to go back here again."
Meghan R.,"Boston, MA",15,194,,1.0,11/11/2007,"Alright, I get it.  The Cheesecake Factory is wonderful.  Everyone adores it.  Let's throw everyone's birthday party/bridal brunch/baby shower here.  Let's have every secretary's retirement party and 23rd birthday party here.  And then let's all wait for 2 F'ING HOURS TO BE SEATED.  Cause right, let's not allow RESERVATIONS, let's have our bartenders ignore the people waiting for 25 minutes for drinks and then, when those guests are just about to order, interrupt them and say ""um, that'll be ten more minutes"" and walk away.  Because I bet that's a great place, a place where all that goes on.  I understand, people seem to really like this place, despite the screwed up interior design that tries to mix a country french with... classical architecture?  Reasonable.   The food here is actually good, so maybe people have a reason to sit in line for hours to get a table, but I just don't get it.  People should demand more from their fooderies.  I demand better service.  And reservations.  And for every 40-year-old woman and her eighteen coffee-talking secretary friends to not spend 40 minutes chatting after they finished paying their bill.  Oh, I really don't have this much hate for secretaries.  They're wonderful people.  Who wear Mom Jeans."
