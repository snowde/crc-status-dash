Miss R.,"Simsbury, CT",5,44,6,5.0,8/5/2017,"After eleven months of a self-imposed Cheesecake Factory ban, I have to say I've been back to this location twice in two weeks and boy, have things changed...for the better! The second most recent visit occured when we had no place to eat and my son begged to go to CF since we were practically right in front of the restaurant. Although I was extremely uneasy about returning, I did have the $25 gift card that was mailed to me after my past experience sitting in my purse, so I decided to give it a whirl. We literally had a fantastic experience from start to finish. There was virtually no wait on a Saturday night, our waitress Alyssa G. was phenomenal - extremely friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and so funny - and our meals were delicious! I don't know if it was because this experience was so much better than the last, but if I could give it more than five stars, I would. Fast forward to last night...we had yet another fantastic meal and experience. Our waiter, Robert B. (who we've had before and always provides awesome service) didn't let us down and gave us his usual superb service, attentiveness and knowledge of the vast menu. I am pleased to say my last two experiences at this CF location are what I remember them to be from years' past. I don't know if new management has been brought in or perhaps internal changes have been made, but I am a fan again. Keep it up!"
Abram M.,"New Britain, CT",58,43,110,4.0,2/7/2017,"I'm a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. What makes it good is its' incredibly deep menu; it's literally a book. You can find something for anyone at the Cheesecake Factory. The only thing that is a little bit annoying is how you can't make reservations. I'm not sure if this issue is nationwide with Cheesecake Factories, but the one here in West Hartford works that way.  Aside from that, and the long wait no matter when you go (unless you go late at night, or at an odd lunch time) the experience is great. Service has always been good.  The flavors are always right and you get what you pay for, in a GOOD way. The portion sizes are very good.  It's good for every occasion as well, dates, friendly gatherings, graduation meet and greets, whatever. At times it can feel a little classier because all the people that are there on dates or celebrating something, it makes the atmosphere a little extra special.  Lastly, get the buffalo blasts.... trust me, you WANT to get the buffalo blasts. As a meal, as an appetizer, whatever... GET THE BUFFALO BLASTS. LOL"
Meg D.,"Charlotte, NC",233,48,57,4.0,2/6/2017,"I'm personally a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory. The menu is quite large (it's basically a book with ads and some actually menu pages) but almost everything that I've had is quite delicious.  I'm a huge fan of their Fire Roasted Artichokes- 3 1/2 half artichokes grilled with a delicious garlic aioli and balsamic sauce. I love artichokes overall but this is some of the best artichokes that I've ever had. Their appetizers are quite large but have a wide variety so that there is something for everyone. I was impressed with their Ahi Carpaccio, which looked like a flat plate of tuna but had some pickled ginger, cucumber and a soy sauce. With a wide variety of entrees, there's something for everyone. I really like their Herb Grilled Salmon, which has a significant amount of herbs and is served with mashed potatoes and a veggie side. I've also been impressed with the Shrimp Scampi and Steak Dianne. Their to-go process has much improved. I've tried doing to-go orders there before and have been on hold for over 20 minutes just waiting to order and then had to wait 15 minutes past the time that I was given. When I tried to do a to-go order last week, they answered the phone almost immediately and had curbside service (which is very convenient after a long long day :) ) I believe that this is new and it is very helpful/quick. Overall, it's a chain but not a bad spot to head to for dinner or a drink."
Rob M.,"East Hartford, CT",0,9,15,1.0,10/17/2016,"This place is a gun free zone. Might as well advertise to everybody ""come on in and rob us and everybody in here"".  I'll never eat here."
Katy H.,"Windsor Locks, CT",0,19,1,4.0,3/5/2017,"My husband and I went here last night, Saturday.  We called ahead to see how long the wait was (1 hour).  We ended up waiting about an hour and fifteen minutes to be seated so don't come here on a Saturday if you have time restrictions!  We sat at the bar for a little bit while we waited.  Service at the bar was excellent- fast and friendly and my drink was amazing (Mojito).   Once we were seated, we had kind of wished we stayed at the bar because the dining room gets pretty noisy but that is to be expected.  We had the egg roll sampler and the truffle grilled cheese sticks as an appetizer.  They were both wonderful, I recommend the egg roll sampler it is fantastic!  For dinner I had the Skinnylicious Steak Medallions and my husband had the combination platter of Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira.  Both of our steaks were cooked perfectly and we agreed that the food was worth the wait. Service was excellent! We had two servers, when we arrived our server was on her break and the gentleman covering for her was very prompt with our menus, drink orders, and taking our food order as well. Once our server returned he let us know and she was great too! She checked on us a few times, refilled our drinks, and brought the check back promptly.   This place is extremely busy on a Saturday night however besides the long wait I would absolutely recommend coming here."
Katelyn M.,"East Hartford, CT",120,77,,4.0,1/20/2017,"The food is well worth the wait....just be prepared to wait! I always order the chicken carbonara, and have enjoyed it every time."
Justin V.,"Plainville, CT",104,17,5,2.0,1/20/2017,"I'm not sure I've ever had a good experience here. They don't take reservations. The wait can be absurdly long. The menu is wayyy too large, and I never feel right after my meal.  Their only saving grace is the cheesecake itself. Although a bit pricey, it is very good and they have some creative combinations."
Jawad A.,"Irving, TX",3,11,,3.0,7/21/2017,"This place is pretty nice, cheesecake obviously the best part! But quite overpriced for their quality of food"
A P.,"Littlefield, TX",0,41,1,2.0,7/30/2017,"First time here. 15-20 minute wait (short in my opinion) been seated for 25 minutes and still no silverware.... have asked about it twice they said they were ""out""... how do you run out of silverware? Brought out our salad and we have no silverware to eat it with... Update: the food is good, waitstaff sucks clearly unprepared for a Sunday afternoon crowd"
Tiffany F.,"Bristol, CT",1,11,1,2.0,11/3/2016,"It was fairly quiet early lunch time, which was a good thing, having read other reviews where the wait has been bad. The restaurant looks really nice and has an array of booths and individual tables to cater for different group sizes. The first difficulty was in trying to order an appetizer. Both myself and my partner are vegetarians, and we spied numerous items that looked suitable. However, our waitress pointed out that _any_ fried food is fried alongside the meat. Okay, so let's try the stuffed mushrooms with cheese? They're stuffed with crab meat - *Which it doesn't say on the menu*. Why not the spinach dip? The tortillas are fried the same way, so that rules out the quesadilla too. At this point we gave up with appetizers.  Drinks took quite some time to arrive, okay, one was a custom Bloody Mary order. The other was Guinness, in a can. Which the waitress just dumped on the table along with a glass. Call me odd, but when I'm served a drink from a can in a restaurant, I quite like it poured. Just for a touch of class. The Bloody Mary was also really bad. Onto the main course; which was one 4 cheese pasta dish, and one Evelyn's Favorite pasta - which was a sad, sad attempt at pesto topped with vegetables that couldn't save it. The 4 cheese was bland as anything; I'd have been saddened to get the end result with a 99c box of pasta and a jar of pasta sauce from the shelf of the grocery store. At this point the manager came out to apologise and refund us, which was a professional gesture at least. And he seemed genuinely apologetic. We didn't bother with dessert; which might have been really good as you'd hope a place with cheesecake in their name can deliver something outstanding. Worth pointing out, we 'dined' here on a gift card so it cost about as much as it was worth (imo) in the end, however in left a pretty bad taste in my mouth, and as for my partner? Well, she pretty much ate a few mouthfuls and was done with hers. The service was okay; our waitress was knowledgeable about what vegetarians couldn't eat on the menu, but this was unfortunately most of the items we were interested in. I truly can't recommend this venue for, well, anybody."
Caryn M.,"Middletown, CT",200,125,346,3.0,9/27/2016,"You can always count on a solid meal from The Cheesecake Factory. With an extensive, multi-page menu you're bound to find something for everyone in your party. This location tends to be pretty crowded and the wait on the evenings and weekend can get upwards of an hour or more.  On this particular visit I tried the shrimp sandwich which was fine. I imagined it being similar to like a po boy, but it wasn't. The shrimp had a tempura like coating, very similar to the dynamite shrimp which is more asian, even though this sandwich marketed tartar, remoulade and chipotle mayo. Change the breading on the shrimp to be more of a southern style and you've got a winner. This version was just ok.  They serve bread to begin the meal and of course there's always the option of a wonderful dessert. My favorite is the carrot cake cheesecake but I didn't splurge on calories this time. Overall the service is always pretty good and the prices are slightly above average. Overall, I'd recommend giving it a try especially to please different palates!"
Maggie K.,"Central Manchester, CT",140,312,375,4.0,5/3/2016,"I love the ambience of this particular restaurant. Love the location, summers you can enjoy the weather while you sit outdoor. The staff is friendly but there is always waiting time during weekends. They have a separate take away counter along with their famous pastries (cheesecakes). And I must say I love all their cheesecakes. When it comes to food I am not that happy coz the vegetarian menu is limited. But my favorite is their AVOCADO EGGROLLS these are so crispy outside and heavenly combo of stuffing inside. They have pizzas and burgers as a safe bet for vegetarians."
Flint G.,"Avon, CT",7,19,,2.0,8/14/2016,Appetizers: 1 Entrees: 3 Service: 1 Wait time for food: -5 Typical mediocre experience at best.
Kathy M.,"Wethersfield, CT",0,1,,5.0,7/6/2017,"They have the BEST cheesecake ever!!  I try to get there at least once a month and get the 7"" strawberry and can pick it up right outside their door.  I then go home and literally moan as I eat it.  Love love love this place. Have eaten here quite a few times, too, since my sister-in-law works at the WH pd.  Good food, service.  You gotta try the brunch"
Kathy E.,"Manorville, NY",57,7,,1.0,6/1/2017,"We came here for Mothers Day brunch and we were the second group to be seated. We had high hopes for a nice relaxing brunch. Unfortunately this was not the case. Our server greeted us promptly and took our beverage orders. She returned about 10 minutes later with half the beverages . We placed our orders at this time, and waited an hour and twenty minutes for our food, which arrived cold . The portions were generous and I am sure they would have been enjoyable if they were served at the correct temperature. Our server disappeared after she took our order. I do understand  that Mothers Day is a difficult day for good service, but the service was on existent. We spoke to a manager at the end and she adjusted the bill and offered to make sure everything would be better the next time. She promised us her business card but we never received it.  Very disappointing Mothers Day brunch. We will give it another chance the next time we are in CT."
Fernanda S.,"Middletown, CT",19,4,,4.0,3/9/2017,"My boyfriend and his brothers love this place. I like it too, the decoration is very pretty, it looks very classy. The food is a bit pricy but I cant complain. The service is always good and the CHEESECAKES OMG go and try it!!!!! I don't like desserts too much but I can eat an entire cheesecake from there"
Brian B.,"Southington, CT",95,34,8,4.0,4/14/2017,"My wife and I went here the other day for lunch. The place was busy but we were seated right away by a friendly hostess. Our waitress Michelle came over promptly and greeted us with a smile. She took our beverage order and she told us that she will be bringing out our bread with it.  The menu is as huge as it is rumored to be. We ordered the Nachos as our appetizer. Get the Nachos! Make sure you get them to share because it would be a meal in and of itself for a normal person. My wife ordered the mushroom Swiss burger and opted for the side salad. I ordered the fish and chips. We had hardly got into our conversation between bites of cheesy Nachos and our meals were delivered.  My wife's burger was very large, juicy and delicious. She had to cut it in half to eat it. Not because she wanted to be neat and dainty about but because she had to! My fish and chips came in a large basket with wonderful big pieces of white fish and a bottom layer of fries.  We finished it off with the original cheesecake and Tiramisu to go. We both had to get to go containers for our leftovers, the portions were that generous.  If I had one complaint is was that the ""To Go"" containers were not large enough to take home all of my leftovers and I had to leave some fries in the basket.  The parking was easy enough in the parking garage. We didn't see any available on-street parking right away as we drove into Blue Back Square so we just went to the garage. The price of parking was reasonable and well worth the ease of obtaining a space.  We will go back again."
Puneet K.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,20,4,4.0,4/29/2017,Cheesecake Factory is really a factory where you can find almost everything. If you are not one of those who never like to go to the chain of restaurants then this restaurant will never disappoint you. They have one some of the best cheesecake desserts u can ask for. When in doubt go to Cheesecake Factory :)
Samantha M.,"Sanford, NC",2,8,1,2.0,10/22/2016,"Second time at Cheesecake Factory was not as good as the first for me. The main problem was all the waiting. We waited 20 min (not too bad for how busy it was at 4 pm), and was sat at a 4 person booth for 5 people with a chair put at the end. Our server wasn't super friendly but not the worst. We waited 30 min for food and only 3/5 arrived. The other 2 meals came out about 10 minutes later. We ordered 3 cheesecakes which took another 20 minutes. Then it took 15 minutes to get a bill, then another 20 min to actually get it back. Although, after all the waiting, 2 cheesecakes were taken off our bill. The food running needs to be improved and the time management on the server's & kitchen's part."
Meghana A.,"Manchester, CT",56,290,1088,4.0,2/19/2016,"Hate the wait... Love the food I have always waited for a minimum of 1 hr to be seated...and I think to myself is it really worth it... But den anything for cheesecake (which u can always get to-go)... The lengths we go to for our stomachs...unbelievable! Great atmosphere.... Inside and out... Always high energy There's really not much to say about their extensive menu (which you must already know by now)... Btw, Are they in the Guinness book for that?  My Must have favorites: Tex mex egg roll Chicken samosa  Kaluha cheesecake Tip: get a beer at WOB(next door) while u wait."
