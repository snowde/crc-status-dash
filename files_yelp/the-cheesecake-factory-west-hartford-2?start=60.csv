Ginny M.,"Wethersfield, CT",0,4,,2.0,8/24/2017,In the midst of Blue Back Square. Nice that there was a lot going on in surrounding area. Wish we had gone to the restaurant next door. Very expensive for what we got ...certainly not worth it.....especially when the tacos were nothing to write home about. Thankfully we were able to eat outside rather than inside where it is so noisy. Wouldn't go again.
Kumar P.,"Manchester, CT",0,3,,4.0,3/17/2017,Loved this place.. I was in their west Hartford outlet.. portions are too big so plan or order accordingly.. staff are cordial and good part is they have good vegetation options.. needless to say the options on desert a little on the expensive side so watch your wallet
Jazmyn E.,"Brooklyn, NY",100,26,31,3.0,4/16/2017,So I've been to the Cheesecake Factory a few times at this location and my experience has always been average. My family of 7 decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory today to celebrate Easter and the overall experience was below average . The wait time to be serviced was extremely long...after being seated we waited at least a good 30 mins before our order was taken. My chicken sadly tasted like a burnt pancake and was supposed to be one of their best chicken dishes...sad.  the fried calamari wasn't fried long enough..it was extremely undercooked. The meatloaf was terrible. The meat looked processed and tasted just as bad. You're definitely better off cooking it yourself. The corn that came with the meatloaf was not properly cut off the cob and was extremely stringy. As far as appetizers go the guacamole and chips were delicious as well as the shrimp and chicken gumbo !!!!! The burgers and fries were also pretty good as well. I recommend ordering the shrimp angel hair pasta or tomato basil..you can never go wrong. Our server was nice but he wasn't very personal or engaging...didn't check on us or see if  we needed refills for our water. And of course the Cheesecake.....I had the snickers Cheesecake and for my first time tasting it...it was pretty good. All in all the meals were okay...the service was average and therefore I don't see myself going back here anytime soon.
Courtney C.,"Long Beach, NY",216,197,95,5.0,9/14/2015,"Great food, service and location. I sat at the bar for lunch and had a great conversation with the beyond friendly bartender. He was helpful and quick (and most importantly willing to keep me company while eating alone during lunch). The location is great - right in the middle of Blue Back Square in West Hartford. Tons of shopping within walking distance! Only downfall is that you have to pay for parking (street and a garage around the corner).  I tried the guacamole salad off the power foods menu and very highly recommend it! Where I usually leave Cheesecake Factory in a complete food coma, this salad was a perfect size (still quite large but not enough to make you feel awful). Had to resist the temptation to try the cheesecake that the couple next to me was devouring. Maybe next time."
Melita G.,"Springfield, MA",2,8,24,3.0,6/19/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is great because it has a great variety of soooo many foods that you could get lost in all of the options, which also can be a negative aspect because it takes so much time to actually choose. It has good service but it usually gets super busy around dinner time making you wait for at least 15 minutes. Overall, this place is yummy and caters to all age types... But I warn you : do not get their chicken dishes! Mine always come out super soggy and really thin and drowning in oil.  On the other hand, the cheesecake is delicious!! My absolute favorite part about eating here... It so exciting to choose from the plethora of flavors! So stick with the cheesecake. It's what makes their restaurant!"
Alyssa H.,"West Hartford, CT",0,7,,3.0,8/15/2017,"If it weren't for the service it would be a 5. We live in WeHa and have come to this location before and usually really enjoy it. The positives - no wait for Sunday lunch for two and egg roll sampler was fantastic. The negative - our server, Ronald. He was very inattentive - after taking our order he didn't come back to check on us for the rest of our meal. He walked by numerous times and never asked how everything was. We had to flag him down for our check which also took a while."
Dawn O.,"East Hartford, CT",231,233,630,4.0,7/29/2015,"I like the Cheesecake Factory.  And each time I decide to come here....I'm smart...I make a reservation.  It's located in a high foot traffic area...of course it's going to be packed people it's located in a shopping mall.  And everyone tends to eat at the same time.  If you go on off times you get a seat pretty quickly without a reservation.  Enough with that.... Once they sit you down you are handed their Ginormous Menu....damn...decisions decisions ugh!  Do yourself a favor go online and look at the menu beforehand.  Your server should also bring out a basket with fresh bread.  You'll get a couple pieces of french bread and some brown bread topped with a smattering of oatmeal...tasty and warm. Unless you are really hungry or have a big group of people you might want to skip ordering an appetizer.  But, if you do get one the Avocado Eggrolls are really good and they come with a really tasty tamarand-cashew dipping sauce.  The Thai Lettuce Wraps are really good also...I will sometimes get this as my entree.  They can be a little messy and you must like eating with your hands can't really knife and fork this dish. During lunch time you can get half sized portions but these are quite big also.  I really like the Luau Salad and the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad's.  The burgers are nice sized and flavorful you can get fries or a side salad with them if you want to pretend to be eating healthy. They retired my favorite cheesecake and saying I have a favorite cheesecake is kinda funny because I am not a lover of cheesecake's. Although, after trying a few others I do really like the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake it's on top of a Macaroon crust and has a layer of mango mousse and a mango swirl."
Anthony T.,"Southington, CT",0,24,,1.0,11/6/2016,"Ordered takeout a few months ago and didn't notice they forgot to give me the 2 slices of cheesecake I ordered until I got home. Called and spoke with a manager who said she would credit my credit card for the cost of the cheesecake. Never happened.  Received a gift card so figured I would give it another shot. This time the herb crusted salmon w/ asparagus that I ordered turned out to be dry salmon with no crust and with broccoli. They can't get an order right, they don't actually fix the problem when they say they will, and parking is such a hassle.  You couldn't pay me to go back here."
Nichole G.,"Vernon, CT",3,60,14,4.0,6/11/2016,"What a wonderful experience!   We had the most amazing Tuna Tartat, crab cake balls and spicy shrimp. The Cesear Salad I got with mixed greens was out of bounds,  and I'm a salad snob. Not a fan of romaine lettuce.  Smokehouse Burger, seasoned well and cooked a perfect medium. Fries where piping hot and crisp not oily and soggy.  Will be coming back."
Amanda L.,"New Britain, CT",102,95,243,3.0,6/16/2015,"Before I ever tried The Cheesecake Factory, I was given the impression that it was the almighty/ultimate hangout/dinner/cheesecake manufacturing/ grand Budapest looking/ you gotta come here no matter what/ going to have my wedding/bar mitzvah here...kind of place. Now I look at it today and think...their relevance is about the same size as the amount of effort they put into their food.  LOOK AT THEIR MENU IF YOU HAVEN'T YET. Overwhelming. So many awesome sounding items on their menu, I mean the list goes onnn and onnn it's like the receipt you get after a large shopping haul at Costco. So long that you can wrap  it around your child like a mummy on Halloween. Items like chicken samosas that you are better off getting at a reliable Indian buffet or the Thai lettuce wraps that you can go to the Thai place for. I feel like the factory tries too hard to fulfill so many aspects of food on the menu that they forget about the importance of quality for each and every one of them because there are so many items! Less items/better quality or more items/less quality? That is the notion I am getting from a lot of other reviewers.  I ordered the fresh basil, tomato, cheese flatbread. This was only an appetizer but enough to fill me up. It was a good and safe choice. I was not about to order a fancy steak here as I was skeptical by the opinions of other customers.  I also tried their Caramel pecan turtle cheescake. This one was alright. I managed to have a decent experience here but it still doesn't prevent me from feeling skeptical about coming back here for more."
Will H.,"Chicopee, MA",207,185,92,5.0,10/10/2016,"I enjoyed it very much, not a bad experiance what so ever. Just as i remebered it from like 10 plus years ago living going to the one in carle place, ny. Clean tons of light. Food was amazing, almost where we couldnt order a cheese cake, but who drives almost 2 hours and doesn't get one, not this guy lol. Waitstaff was great! Hot food, quick service, it seemed busy but some workers seemed bored."
Miss L.,"Hartford, CT",0,33,6,5.0,7/2/2016,"Food was delicious, waiter was awesome. We had a peanut allergy person in our group, so she asked for a chicken quesadilla and by mistake they dropped lettuce,  so she got a new one and it had a piece of plastic,  OMG ,was it done intentionally or just a human mistake? The manager came over and apologized, manager stated that they take peanut allergy very serious. Regardless we still like Cheesecake Factory. Im having a Key lime cheesecake."
April D.,"Hartford, CT",0,4,4,3.0,7/1/2017,I went in with my family and we got seated about five minutes later. Food was overall good but the wait was pretty long.
Chang L.,"New York, NY",0,2,25,5.0,6/28/2016,"Nice brunch with my wife at Sunday. We have been order a lot. Everything was great, tasty. The best delicious dishes is the classical cheese cake."
Alicia E.,"Wallingford, CT",184,67,45,5.0,8/14/2015,Love the food! They have a new skinny menu that's delicious! They even have the salad I love to get that's a little healthier! Service is always great and the vibe is perfect  perfect way to end a week!
Erin R.,"Glastonbury, CT",0,10,,5.0,1/2/2017,first date here. going back soon to see my favorite waiter to ever exist: Robert. I see him as a dad and he made my amazing relationship happen without him i'd be single. going back every month anniversary for my fave. also the food was good.
Jennifer D.,"Cranston, RI",82,60,160,2.0,1/13/2016,"Let me just start by saying that it is VERY rate for me to give such a low rating.  So, if I give one, it's because it deserved to be there. So after a long day of training that I had attended in CT for work, a few co-workers and I decided to venture out and grab a bite. One of the people we were with was Glucose free and Lactose sensitive. Due to that, our options were really limited for what was close by. We were able to settle on Cheesecake Factory figuring they would have a wide range of options to chose from. When we first walked in, I will mention that this location is HUGE compared to the Providence one. The decor was inviting with lots of Browns and oranges and fancy lighting.  Had a very clean appearance. We were settled into a booth (there were 4 of us) immediately, which during dinner time was pretty impressive. Although it was a Thursday evening so not sure if that had anything to do with it. Our waiter, unfortunately I cannot pronounce or even spell his name, was very friendly and attentive...... At first.  We ordered a round of cocktails and appetizers. They arrived fairly quickly. Again, very impressed. My appetizer was the Macaroni and Cheese balls. Sooooo flippin good! I really didn't want to share, but I did :0) Well, after placing our dinner order is where things started to fall apart. The co-worker with the restrictions asked our waiter questions about glucose free items and he had no idea. She actually had to suggest if he could ask someone. It took him about 15 minutes to return with an answer. They do offer a gluten free bread. Anyway, after we placed our dinner orders, we waited almost 40 minutes. We literally ordered some burgers. Nothing fancy and nothing that should have taken that long. I did notice the restaurant was a little busier than when we originally arrived and I started wondering if maybe they were short staffed. Either way, once our food arrived, one of the burgers was completely wrong! And we were missing an order of sweet potato fries. When he asked if we were all set, I asked him about the fries and he said ""they would be right out"" and I mentioned to him one of the burgers was wrong, however in his defense, my co-worker did not want to send it back even though he offered to take it. Back to my fries.... The fries that were coming right out, took about 20 minutes! Ummm something tells me the order was never put in to begin with.   I had ordered a mushroom burger which I have to say looked really, really good, but after biting into it, the excitement fell a little flat and the taste really left nothing to be desired. There was really no flavor to it. Everyone else agrees that the food was only ""okay.""  Once we were finished, we watched our waiter going back and forth and it took him about a half hour before acknowledging us. We were finished and ready to get our checks and go. We asked for some boxes along with the check. Yet again, another 20 or so minutes has passed us by. When he finally arrived, I waited patiently for an apology that never came. I understand being busy and overwhelmed and short staff, but at least acknowledge it with an apology. We could have complained about the many long wait periods we experienced and yet chose not too. We never asked about refills on our drinks or how we liked the foo. Unfortunately, if given the option, I would chose not to return there. There were several waitstaff just standing by the kitchen (we were seated pretty close to it) just chit chatting and gabbing away.  There wasn't even a manager around to check in and see how we were doing and the food did not make up for the terrible service.  Based on my and my co-workers experience I felt the 2 star rating is appropriate. Admittedly, I have to confess..... I did grab a slice of Banana Cream Cheesecake TO GO and it was to die for!"
David G.,"Chicopee, MA",23,93,103,5.0,12/7/2015,"Decided to stop in on a Saturday for dinner for my first time at cheesecake factory. I was with a party of four and we got their pretty early, around 5:00. We had to wait about 30 minutes to get seated. I was very impressed with the atmosphere in restaurant and also outside. It was in a very nice location downtown with many other businesses around. I ordered herb salmon and Steak Diane. Both were very good. Huge selection of cheesecake as one would imagine, but didn't order any. Service was excellent and friendly."
Erica K.,"Plainville, CT",138,310,332,2.0,2/16/2015,"No. There are so many better places in the area that I would skip this chain, and go somewhere local. Food is standard. A lot of the apps are frozen and ehh. Salads are huge and entrees are as well -- but it's not worth it. It's mass produced and so full of calories, I feel guilty just walking in there.  And always a line!!! Not worth it."
Dan R.,"East Falmouth, MA",103,1615,5633,4.0,1/28/2015,"This weekend during the snow storm we decided that we needed to get out of the house, so we grabbed some friends from town and made the trip to the Cheesecake Factory. When we arrived parking was a little tough to come by and honestly we didn't want to pay for the garage. We ended up finding street parking but the meter was very expensive. When we walked into the restaurant the place was mobbed, but it was great because there was only a 30 minute wait. We ended up walking around Barnes and Noble across the street instead of hanging out in the lobby which was better than twiddling our thumbs. When it came to dinner our waiter Markus was great and the food was delicious. The potstickers were amazing and the Cheesecake was obviously great as well. We ended up eating from their Skinnylicious menu which ended up being incredible. In the end, we loved the food here and the service was great. The only criticism is that the cost of the meals were high for the quantity and quality."
