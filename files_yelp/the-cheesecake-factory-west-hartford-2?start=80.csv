Lea S.,"Guilford, CT",37,39,23,2.0,11/15/2015,"Unfortunately I have to give this visit a 3 because I got an upset stomach after eating. I ordered the Shepards Pie last night and it was extremely rich and garlicky, more garlicky than normal and not nearly enough mashed potatoes on top. My cherry cheesecake came with two cherries on it which hardly qualifies it as cherry cheesecake. It was more like cheesecake with a cherry on top! I had an upset stomach when I left but assumed it was from the drink I had however when I ate leftovers of the Shepards pie earlier today and got a stomachache all over again. Yucky!!!! I was disappointed with this visit. The only decent thing we ate was the Tex mex rolls appetizer and the freaking bread."
C L.,"Morris, CT",0,1,,5.0,4/18/2017,We come to this location often and always enjoy ourselves. Food is always good. We went for a late lunch yesterday and were seated right away. Our server Tyler did a great job.
Maki S.,"Everett, WA",56,275,231,2.0,4/18/2013,"I wanted to celebrate passing my final exam (therefore guaranteeing graduation!!) with 5 other interns and our former supervisor. We decided to come here. I was SO excited, because all of my friends have been to this place before and it has over 70 items to choose from....but it fell flat.  There was no wait time, since there were 7 of us. The waiters were pretty nice, but not overly so and even rolled their eyes at customers who were in their way. It goes further downhill from there. The warm bread to start with was nice, but why is lemonade $4.50 ? Why is a SLICE of cheesecake $7? I've made it myself for less. Seriously. I ordered saliisbury steak. The mashed potatoes were fluffy and didn't need any extra butter. The greens were fresh. Everything tasted nice, but fairly bland. In fact, it was so bland I didn't even want to lift my hand to put salt or A1 sauce on it. As for the rumored ""huge portions"": that's B.S. It's average compared to most, and small compared to Asian and Indian restaurants. Perhaps if it wasn't hyped up for the last 3 years of my life, I would of been more enchanted by this place, but I could get a lot more for a lot less. I'll likely never return."
Harry F.,"Westport, CT",0,4,,5.0,8/31/2016,y'all crazy Cheesecake Factory is da  Every time we eat there it's on point their desserts are delicious they have so many things on the menu there are a lot of waiters their bar is also fun if you want to eat alone
Sarah N.,"East Granby, CT",4,4,,5.0,8/21/2016,I love love love this place. I have been to three different Cheesecake Factory places and I've loved them all. Two times we went only for the cake. And I was still absolutely full. They have a new Nutella option that is to die for. The only down side is that I get totally greedy and want to try all of the cakes. They should really make a tapas option!!! OMG I want cheesecake tapas!!!
Dru L.,"West Hartford, CT",11,42,13,5.0,8/9/2016,"Tried the Shrimp Bistro pasta dish for the first time, such a good choice.  Tried the newest cheesecake flavor, Hazelnut Crunch.  So divine!"
Aaron S.,"Glastonbury, CT",852,175,751,5.0,9/20/2014,I have always been a fan.  How they can do comfort food so well is a mystery.  With an enormous menu I could not possibly ever try everything but all that I have ordered has been tasty and fresh.  My only complaint is that the portions are huge....I am always too full for dessert.  And the desserts are incredible.   Thank God for takeout!
Margaret C.,"Middletown, CT",1,11,10,4.0,9/5/2016,"Came here last night for some drinks and apps. We wanted to sit on the patio. Both inside and outside were on a 30 minute wait. We put our names on the list, and started at the bar. The bartenders were great. Very friendly, made delicious drinks, and attended to us well. An hour and a half went by and we never were paged. No big deal, we were happy at the bar. But odd our pager never went off. Thank goodness we found seats!"
Abhishek U.,"Mansfield, CT",53,5,2,4.0,2/15/2016,Big fan of chicken samosas and godiva cheesecake. Will visit again for redvelvet classic cheesecake
Patrick D.,"Hartford, CT",110,267,46,2.0,8/4/2014,"I wanted to like it. I really did. Because it's so expected to slam the big chain...especially with so many great options in West Hartford. But there were just too many things wrong to give them more than two stars. First...the good. It's a nice place. Big, cool decor, great location...this is ""event"" dining on a mainstream, chain-restaurant level. And the staff was nice. And yes, the menu is practically never-ending. Which brings me to the bad. My daughter (it was her 11th birthday) ordered one entree. 5-10 minutes later, we were informed they didn't have it (and would comp us her meal, which was a nice touch). So we ordered a second entree. And yep, 5-10 minutes later, we were told they were out of that, too. So the never-ending menu is not so never-ending. By this time, some of us already had our entrees and my daughter still hadn't successfully ordered one. And the entrees came out staggered, leading to lots of that ""no, go ahead and eat...don't wait for me"" awkwardness. All in all, it turned out okay, and we had a decent time. But not quite a three-star time, not with all the other places to go in West Hartford."
Todd Z.,"East Hartford, CT",21,100,193,3.0,7/21/2014,"This place reminds me of a Walmart for food. When you walk in its gigantic like a department store yet the tables are soooo close together you're literally touching shoulders with the couple next to you..  I'm not a hermit... But I'd like to not be on top of a stranger for my meal and have some what of a private conversation .  The menu also fits a Walmart role.. Its large enough to house the entire inventory of a warehouse store.... They just do so in food format. This makes for a long and silent start to a meal as you need 5 minutes per page and there's only about 86,896 pages... In all fairness to them though almost everything on the menu sounds/looks great which makes the decision even harder  We ordered their version of crab Rangoon as well as a crab and cheese dip. Both were large portions (happy hour special so cheaper but huge portion) and both were very tasty. We also had numerous... And I mean numerous amounts of mixed drink all which were good and came in am extremely timely fashion .   Would have been 4 stars but the whole speed dating style seating they've got going on is definitely a turn off."
Amanda D.,"Wethersfield, CT",1,16,11,1.0,7/29/2016,First off we waited about 20 min for our drinks. We arrived at 5pm before the dinner rush. We sat in the patio and it was not that busy yet. We had 2 children with us who's meals took very long to come out. We ordered  2 Thai lettuce and wraps for dinner and one came out with a giant hair across the top and the other came out with wilted brown lettuce. So after reordering we waited another 30 min for our food. This is my second time here this month and clearly this is becoming routing because the last visit was just as bad and food took forever but thought it was that one time clearly it wasn't. So it is now 7:25 pm and we are late for our movie. Not sure if the patio is short staffed or the kitchen but cheesecake is really falling off. But 2 hours and 25 min later with 2 5 year olds we are not happy with the experience.
Chris R.,"New Britain, CT",95,270,533,4.0,12/3/2014,"We've dined here a number of times over the last few years. It should be noted that as we don't generally wait exorbitant amounts of time for tables anywhere, we don't bother coming to the TFC on weekends. Weeknight dinners have been an easy in and easy out experience. Up until our last experience we usually get the easy(low $) salads and burgers. Which are just right and nothing too special. Last night, we decided to try some better entrees and an app. The corn tamales, were fantastic. Very sweet which rich corn flavor which was balanced with the citrus-y tomato and savory slices of avocado. Definitely something I'd order again. Since it was 4:30 my wife was able to get the lunch portion (offered before 5PM) of her Luau Salad. It was enormous! I can't imagine what the dinner portion looks like. It was crispy and delicious.   I ordered the Steak Diane. The steak was served to order and was tender and savory. The toppings weren't as exciting, I expected more flavorful mushrooms and onions. The meal was a bit more peppery than I expected but not in a bad way. The mashed potatoes were done well enough to pair well with the meal with the meal. I am not sure I'd order this entree again with a 19.95 price tag. The kids grilled cheese made me jealous. It was thick, gooey and quite tasty when my toddler insisted that I take a bite.  The service was friendly and the food was served quickly, overall a great experience. And as usual, we took some great desserts to enjoy at home."
Lakshmi J.,"Manhattan, NY",185,10,3,4.0,5/6/2016,"This is a great place to go when you have a big group with diverse interests. The selection is pretty insane. And all the food we got was pretty good! Only negative was that it gets loud so our party had to raise our voices to be heard and we were adding to the noise. Our group tried the following  Appetizers:  Avacado egg rolls: very fresh avacado and pretty tasty and crunchy. Even though it was a fried appetizer it wasn't too oily  Fresh bread with garlic and cheese: loved this! Not sure I got the name exactly right but the bread was hot, stuffed with cheese and flavored with garlic and herbs.. amazing  Entrees:  Chicken marsala and mushrooms: my friend had this and he loved it Pesto pasta with eggplant parmesan: the eggplant parmesan was incredible. Light crispy fresh and very tasty.. the pasta was a little under done in parts and well done in others.. even the pesto was not uniformly mixed with the pasta.. but that being said, the pasta and eggplant parmesan combination was very tasty"
Rich G.,"Temple, TX",19,10,3,1.0,8/7/2016,Well there was no wait when we got here but that doesn't mean they can't suck. The appetizers took a half hour to come to the table and the food took well over an hour. To top things off all the meals were missing something and we all got our side dishes late. The waitress actually almost hit me in the face with a plate for the sides and when taking them away. And I'm not even a big guy just lack of skills. The manager did apologize and take things off the bill but the service was terrible my glass of water was almost always empty. And the waitress was also rude grabbed and snatched anything on or off the table even my side of fries that came late and I ate one fry....
Chris K.,"Bristol, CT",19,47,17,4.0,7/6/2016,Typical Cheesecake Factory locale. Located in a nice upbeat shopping center. The menu offers many choices at reasonable prices. The dessert menu is huge too. The outdoor seating is very nice during the warm spring and summer months. Service is pretty good too but sometimes it can take a while to get waited on due to the sheer volume this locale does. Overall a good dining experience
Z Z.,"Amherst, MA",24,150,47,1.0,4/13/2015,"Justification for the one star as there was no way to comment or leave feedback in person before we missed our movie: Service was difficult and banal. Our waitress asked how our food was several times- we sent back one salad and received the same salad back with the same four chunks of chicken, we poked and barely finished one dish, and when asked how our cheesecake was, we said it was just okay. Radio silence. By and above our favorite moment was the large slice of onion in the bottom of our pitcher of coffee cream. Our coffee was replaced in a good 10 minutes and we paid for them both. No compensation, no apology, no interaction with anyone other than our waitress. From start to finish, a two hour meal."
Paul P.,"Hartford, CT",103,219,,5.0,5/18/2014,"This review is just a mention for a new cheesecake flavor discovery: I was at a Barnes and Noble bookstore in Wilmington, NC recently and what do I find? Orange creamsicle cheesecake.  Never seen it before and it's about time!  Very good. Tasted just like the creamsicle bar from the Good Humor truck.  Add to the list of their excellent cheesecakes."
Jenn D.,"Bristol, CT",0,7,,2.0,1/26/2017,I'd have to say I never come to this place..but I get gift cards here so I try to give it another chance. I had the filet mignon [wich you would hope is delicious] ...to no surprise it was ok..bland..nothing great...always loads up on the mashed potatoe [ that I do not care for] ...the meal was expensive and was just ok. BUT the only thing that saves this place for me...is allllllll the cheesecake! The cheesecake in my opinion is the only thing keeping the buisness going.
Ray B.,"Bristol, CT",1,77,,1.0,3/30/2016,"Not a huge fan of this one. Look the cheesecake is obviously amazing. Original, s'mores, and the peppermint bark at Xmas are fabulous. With that said the food when it's not cheesecake leaves a lot to be desired. I always ask people when they say Cheesecake Factory is great.... ""What is your fave dish"" because I think their menu has way too many options and don't specialize on one thing. I mean it's not terrible just nothing they do great except cheesecake. As for this location... Very slow service and long wait. Bar is small and when I've gotten cheesecake to go they are uninterested and rude. Again very slow from getting a table to getting cheesecake. If I'm in West Hartford center I'd rather go to 15 other restaurants to be honest."
