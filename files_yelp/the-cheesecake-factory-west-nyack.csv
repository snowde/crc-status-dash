Mark Nowell M.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",98,99,186,4.0,12/10/2017,"Perfect for the family! Must try food and cheesecake place! Location: It is located in the ground level of Palisades Mall. A lot of seating if you go early! Intimate for the family! Service: The service is always amazing! They don't hurry you and gives you recommendations!  Food: Renee's special is a regular turkey sub, the salad that comes with if does not have any dressing, the soup is so good tho reminds me of clam chowder. The carbonara pasta is good, very creamy and noodles cook perfectly. Seared tuna tataki salad is good for the salad lover out there, comes with perfectly seasoned tuna. My favorite is the Combination of steak Diane and herb crusted salmon with asparagus and mashed potato, it's a taste of two of their best sellers in one plate. Price rating: 6 out of 10. Price is okay. Recommended for the family, a lot of seating and variety of food! Try all their cheesecake!"
Kevin M.,"Buchanan, NY",12,3,,2.0,1/7/2018,"Met my cousins for brunch at 12 on a Sunday  Place was not crowded at the time . Lights were set to dim  From the time we sat to the time brunch came out was 1 hour 45 min  We had 6 people all wanted coffee we asked for milk and cream - only one small ""shot cup"" of each  We all had about 3 cups of coffee each while awaiting food and each time after coffee was left we had to ask for more milk and cream Each time waitress brought coffee - never removed any of old cups  We kept shuffling them around  When food finally arrives 1 one order was wrong and had to be sent back - she said 5-10 min 25 min later pancakes came out and she never brought out syrup  When we asked she brought out a shot cup of syrup - my cousin who is a waitress couldn't eat anymore because she was aggravated  Myself , my cousin and my sister are all in the service business so we deal with customers each day  She may have been New we cut ""some"" slack but we left at 2:45pm , my sister had dinner plans in 2 hours after that  Was frustrating trying to catch up with family which is hard enough in this day and age with the busy schedules we all have but most of the time we were complaining about the horrible service  Sad -  Food was not great either I had eggs Benedict and Canadian bacon was dry as well as the English muffin  We will probably not go back again or it will be a Very long time if we all do  We didn't order dessert because like I said my sister had dinner arrangement only 2 hours later and dessert probably would just be coming out"
Karen L.,"Putnam County, NY",12,251,423,4.0,10/13/2017,"Typical Cheesecake Factory food. It was good. No complaints. We started with the fried zucchini sticks and ranch dipping sauce. Yum!!  I ordered the pineapple shrimp and chicken with brown rice. It was good.  My sister had a mango avocado salad?  She was satisfied and like it. We finished off with a piece of cheesecake which was thick, creamy, velvety, and smooth. Delish! Major tip:  not a fan of the white bread. Request the brown bread with oat flakes. Much better choice.  I do want to add that they changed the menu and got rid of my favorite meal so I am still annoyed over that. Bring back the chicken costoletta Please!!"
Roy H.,"Spring Valley, NY",6,67,111,4.0,11/10/2017,"I've never had a bad experience here. Food is always good. Dessert is always amazing. Today I tried the Mac N Cheese Cheeseburger and it was AMAZING!!  Had the side salad instead of fries. Too filled up for dessert but I wanna come back and try the Celebration Cheesecake that's on the menu Meal portions are usually quite big here and will fill you up, or take the rest home. Or split. This place can get pretty busy so expect to wait for a table on weekends and holidays."
Alicia B.,"Floral Park, NY",4,86,65,2.0,4/23/2017,"This was my first visit to one of their chain restaurants.  My first issue upon arriving at around 8PM on Sunday, was they barely had any seating( to wait for a booth). I was told by a host I could wait outside but they would not come out there to call me. No big deal I went out, and came in when a family got up.  Upon being seated, my table was clean, and neat. Though I highly disliked my silverware being on the surface of the table and out in the open, especially since there was a fly ( tell you more in a bit). Dana was my server, I let her know it was my first visit, and asked what she recommended, she thought chicken Marsala. I ordered the combination of chicken Marsala and shrimp scampi. When she returned to drop bread, she literally didn't not stop at the table, it was one motion, keep walking and place the bread on the table . When she returned with water for my toddler, it was in a glass. When she dropped my coffee, it was room temp.  To make this experience even more adventurous, when my food came, the portion wasn't even enough to fill my toddler. I literally had a boneless chicken breast with two stalks of asparagus, mushroom madness, and 3 SHRIMPS PLACED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLATE( IS THIS A MEAL???). Nonetheless it was nice to try something new, and the flavors were nice, not overly salty like every other chain restaurant I've been to (sole reason for a second star, first was for cleanliness) I requested a hotter coffee for a refill, an apple juice for my son (came in a kids cup this time). My requests were honored, and I greatly appreciated it. THEN THERE WAS A FLY! (See photos) it was on my son's pizza, then my plate... & I was done, I requested my check and wanted nothing more. She was much nicer and patient, and actually stopped walking at the end, than she was at the beginning.  I'm highly disappointed, and I felt like I had to babysit the process."
Lana S.,"New York, NY",11,71,278,5.0,8/27/2017,"We love the Cheesecake Factory, but not every location has the same service or quality of food. Our server, Tabia, was stellar. She checked on us every 10-15 minutes, made sure our water was always full and even got our children a bread plate with sliced bananas--on the house! I was feeding my son puréed food out of a personal jar, and she offered to wash it for me. Children's plates are very generous, we ordered children's pizza for my daughter and she barely ate half. My husband and I got the Mexican tortilla salad. Our favorite item on the menu. Definitely recommend this location!"
Francisco C.,"New York, NY",49,59,49,3.0,7/31/2017,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory for a long time. My fiancé and her grandparents decided to go and have some appetizers and a lunch meal.  We ordered an order is avocado rolls and wings. Both tasted good. For the lunch meal, I ordered the orange chicken, which tasted very good. I ordered it from the lunch special and they still serve you plenty.  The service was ok. It could of been a little better. The waiter came over once on his own and all the other times was because we called him over."
Jennifer A.,"Nanuet, NY",86,38,44,4.0,12/23/2017,"Terrible service...    I was there on December 20th for lunch with Another Step,  Food was delicious,  The cheese cakes are awesome.  My meal was a little Spicy but good.  We had to wait 35 minutes until our food arrived.  My check came out to 22.65 not bad at all but maybe a 15.00 lunch instead.  The bread was great.  I might return  for a good meal that I love.   Happy Holidays...."
Nicole M.,"Mahwah, NJ",204,35,8,4.0,12/22/2017,"I ordered the santa fe texas egg rolls  and mac n cheese balls. Both very good. Waitress was attentive and great timing with refills. I just dont like the lighting..smh..always soo dark, too dark. But its their thing."
Marcin G.,"Queens, NY",35,87,305,5.0,7/18/2017,"I love cheesecake. Period. So of course I love The Cheesecake Factory.  They have a great selection of food, and an even greater selection of cheesecake. The service here was amazing, and the food and cheesecake were delicious.  No complaints here. 10/10."
Linnex M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,6,4.0,10/14/2017,I love love love this place! The menu is absolutely endless. It ranges from tacos to burgers to pasta and sandwiches. Let's not forget to talk about the cheesecake. I had the Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake but my boyfriend had the Original strawberry cheesecake and they were both amazing. The dining utensils were a little dirty we had to ask for some new ones. The waiter was okay but he could have interacted more. The food overall was everything and the wait wasn't as long as told. Big shout out to the host!
Lisa A.,"Lodi, NJ",414,338,505,2.0,3/6/2017,"Ugh first and last time eating here.  We had a $100 gift card and decided to come here on a Saturday night to use it up.   I knew it was going to be busy, but I didn't expect the mayhem that ensued.  The lobby, bar, and entire restaurant was absolutely packed and the wait for two people was over an hour.  Who waits that long? Luckily, we found a space at the bar and decided to stay there the night.  We ordered a few drinks and some appetizers.  We ordered the shrimp rolls and the kale salad.  They brought out the wrong appetizer and the bartender gave us so much attitude and acted like it was our fault.  The kale salad was way overpriced for what you get.  For entrees we both went with the hibachi steak.  This was actually really good and the highlight of our night (the only thing that warranted a second star).  I went to the bathroom before I left and it was absolutely disgusting.  So bad that I couldn't even bring myself to use it.  There were huge piles of water (or other liquids) in each stall.  The toilets and floors were so dirty and disgusting.   Needless to say, I will not be back here!"
Charity D.,"Weiden, Germany",80,52,230,5.0,3/13/2017,Seriously love this place and of course the location! Our waiter was super friendly and informative. We came right when they opened so there was zero wait time. (MY new favorite time to come!! Before I shop!) You can never go wrong with any of their cheesecakes. All around best sit down place when you want an above a food court meal!
Brendon D.,"Vilseck, Germany",3,180,172,5.0,3/9/2017,Took the wife here. Got here early in the day. Got seated quickly. Service was friendly. Waiter let us know what the specials were. Gave us time to order. Food got out quick. Waiter checked on us. Food was tasty. No complaints here
Karen C.,"New York, NY",17,80,9,1.0,11/1/2017,Awful service. 10 minutes for water. 15 minutes for bread. Dinner took 30 min to arrive in pieces. Sides came later. Check took 20 min to arrive. I should've eaten at the costco food court.
Katie S.,"New York, NY",201,236,299,3.0,1/30/2017,"Have eaten here probably 15 times over the past 10 years on trips to the Palisades Mall with my family. It's a solid three-star place with consistently good food, service that can sometimes be quite slow and imperfect, and almost always a wait for a table, especially on weekends. The good:  - Food is reliable and menu, as at all CF locations, is huge, so it's easy for everyone to find many things that appeal to them. - The space is huge, so it's a good place for groups. - Cheesecake to-go counter is usually quick and efficient. The bad: - We're almost always there on a Saturday midday, and there's always a wait. This past Saturday, we waited for 35 minutes for a table for 3. When our table was ready, we were led to the back to a table along a banquette -- where there were 5+ empty tables for 2, despite lots of other waiting parties. Not sure if they're understaffed or if they just didn't have any waiting parties for 2, but we were wondering if there was some reason they weren't pushing tables together to shorten the wait. - Service can be hit or miss. At our meal on Saturday, our appetizer came out right away, but we had to wait almost 20 minutes for entrees."
Willis T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,,1.0,7/15/2017,"My family and I haven't had Cheesecake Factory for awhile and I always remembered this chain restaurant is a family/kids friendly place; however, it was not the case anymore.  Service was awful and no quality check when the food were served to our table, the food were over cooked, re-fried sweet potatoes fries, late bring bread, etc. And some dishes were came very late!  What a disappointment to my & friend's kids.  Restaurant management should do something about it; otherwise, you will continue having unhappy customers."
Steve K.,"CORTLANDT MNR, NY",56,525,1726,4.0,12/10/2016,"Met friends here from Florida. We met in bar area during Happy Hour. Location is Palisades Center closer to Route 59 entrance with an outside entrance next to Bed Bath & Beyond and Macy's. Generally, we avoid all chain dining but The Cheesecake Factory is consistently one of the better chains. * Friendly, attentive staff. Menu is huge, with something for everyone. Our experience was overall better than most reviewers here. * We chose mostly from the Happy Hour menu. Especially enjoyed Avocado Eggrolls with Dipping Sauce, Chicken Pot Stickers (would have preferred pork) with Soy-Ginger-Sesame Sauce, and Roadside Sliders. * For Happy Hour drinks, our group chose 16oz brewskies on draught, house bourbon of Jack Daniels, and Margaritas. Mojitos and Cosmopolitans also available. * Also enjoyed entrées of Stuffed Chicken Tortillas and Lemon Grilled Salmon Happy Hour Alert:  Like most places these days, Happy Hour applies only in the bar area. Limited seating in that area for 4 people. We hung out at the bar for 15 mins until one of the bar area tables opened up. Happy Hour Monday-Friday only. Promotion Alert:  Free Cheesecake with purchase of a gift card in 2016. Gripe:  Don't know if this is management carelessness or malicious deceitfulness. Bill included suggested tip levels of 15, 18, 20 and 22%. No problem with that. But tip calculation included state sales tax resulting in tip miscalculation. Huh? Mathematically challenged? Disappointed by a management that would allow this to happen. TCF is more ethical than that."
DJ S.,"New Hyde Park, NY",133,67,7,3.0,11/13/2017,"Decent chain. Food was delivered as ordered and staff was friendly. Good location in the mall for food, drinks, or dessert on the way in or out"
Robert B.,"West Nyack, NY",72,2,1,1.0,8/31/2017,"If you enjoy sitting for thirty plus minutes to wait for a waiter to even acknowledge that you are present for a drink order, come here. You'll sit around waiting for a table only to be awkwardly stared at by staff. Upon contacting the management you'll be told that there was a ""miscommunication."" The food is average and bland, as to be expected with a chain of such caliber, but with such poor service and attention to detail at this location; one cannot dine with any level of decency. Buyer beware."
Christine M.,"Rockville, MD",87,109,416,3.0,12/31/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory had me disappointed and I'm a big fan of this restaurent. I decided to try a new dish and regret that I did so. My Cajun shrimp pasta with linguine was absolutely bland, had no taste or seasoning to it. I was highly upset that this dished tasted the way it did. The meat nor the linguine was seasoned. Although the food was a disappointment, the customer service and appearance was stellar as usual."
Mike K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,3,1.0,12/17/2017,Never go here starting with front host said 10 minutes which made us wait 35 minutes food is bad even there cheesecake no alcohol 2 pax check was $108.05 plus tip it's waist of money
Christopher S.,"Nanuet, NY",12,6,3,5.0,11/8/2017,"Enjoy coming here for a pleasant meal with family and friends. There are a large variety of foods to choose from and the prices are wry reasonable. Tonight we were greeted by Lou Ann who seated us a comfortable both toward the back of the restaurant. She immediately informed the waiter Donny that we arrived and he came to introduce himself and obtain our drink order while we reviewed the menu. There were 3 of us and we chose, Cuban rolls, zucchini sticks, mozzarella sticks, chicken lettuce wraps and Cajun jambalaya . The food was phenomenal portions generous so we decided to bring half home and get dessert. We got Godiva cheesecake and carrot cake. They have the best carrot cake in the county! Our waiter was friendly and professional. Checked on us throughout the meal, ensured our order was correct. Refilled our drinks when needed and made sure we were comfortable. I would give him 10 stars but they only allow 5. Excellent place to get great food in an nice environment with amazing staff"
Joel L.,"Tarrytown, NY",37,34,1,2.0,10/23/2017,"Went here yesterday for dinner and as others have stated food was good service awful. portions much smaller then they used to be. Waitress scrambling back and forth dropping food on table and running off. Water never refilled and never checked up on us. Bathroom looked like it went to combat.I'm sure management will respond to this with the same generic answer as the other ton of similar complaints( we're sorry, we'll look into it, please give us another chance) I got a better idea, FIX the problem."
Dwayne A.,"New Windsor, NY",22,27,98,5.0,6/17/2017,"Always enjoy going here. Drinks are always great not watered down. Food always fresh and hot. Always love the Jamaican blackened shrimp and chicken with black beans and plantains. Spicy and delicious,if you're not into spicy foods stay away from this. Also for dessert,the red velvet cheese cake always creamy and velvety. All in all this is always a great restaurant to go to."
Nora A.,"Portland, ME",70,156,486,4.0,11/26/2016,"The cheesecake factory has the best cheesecake in the world! No argument in this corner. My favorite has to be the red velvet cheesecake. The very best. Their cheesecake is not the only best thing, their dishes are also amazing. The best dish on their menu is the jambalaya pasta!"
Priscila R.,"Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY",36,47,125,5.0,5/11/2017,"Can't ever go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. Food is always great. Service is always great, drinks are on point. Love this place"
Ashley A.,"Park Ridge, NJ",91,8,,1.0,8/18/2017,"I usually frequent this Cheesecake Factory location, but I never will again. I've always known they do a poor job at maintaining the bathroom but I've always ignored it....Until I spotted a HUGE cockroach running across the floor a few weeks ago. I can only imagine what's in the kitchen!"
Lucas N.,"Stony Point, NY",0,1,,1.0,8/5/2017,"I am appalled by the service I received at The Cheesecake Factory today. Not only did I receive no service... numerous waiters walked past my table and didn't even acknowledge me. It's such a shame that Cheesecake Factory provides amazing food but such bad service. I have never experienced this before and I am so upset. Maybe next time the staff should actually focus on all customers instead of just seating them because they want to look ""good"". This is completely unacceptable. Never come here if you want actual service because I didn't even receive any. I would rather drive 40 minutes away then go to this terrible establishment."
Misha J.,"Mount Vernon, NY",158,31,82,5.0,2/5/2017,Ok so I love going to Cheesecake Factory cause food options are endless ... but I jus wanna say to Vanessa thanks . Her service was amazing ... it's rare when I go out to eat with my daughter (2 year old). And the service is on point ! And the server is as patient as she was.  She made sure my baby food was out first (as requested) chicken sliders and fries.   The Apps and drink came out on time too. We got buffalo blast for the table. JW lemonade was good. The entrees were good I had bang bang chicken and shrimp.  They sang happy birthday to her. Lol . She loved it.  Would I go again ?? Yea. It's really accommodating for kids Should you ?? Sure. It's in the mall.
Jacqui J.,"Montvale, NJ",57,41,15,4.0,4/19/2017,"I have eaten many delicious meals at this location. Most recently I tried the macaroni and cheese burger (10/10) and the eggplant parmigiana (7/10). The tiramisu cheesecake was delicious, but the waiter initially got our order wrong. He was nice about it and fixed his mistake."
Jay W.,"West Islip, NY",2,12,,2.0,4/13/2017,"So, we order sangria. 86 on the sangria at high dinner time.  Next, we order avocado egg rolls & salmon Michael F, our crappy waiter, forgets the appetizer.  Does he try to make it up to us?   NO! The salmon was good, but our service was horrible & uncaring. Will give other Cheesecake Factory business, but staying away from Palisades Mall location"
Franklin C.,"Cortlandt, NY",12,7,1,5.0,1/23/2017,"Great Steak from the Cheesecake Factory, I have been to several Steakhouse's in different towns and I can honestly say this one was in my top 10 steaks and delicious."
Min L.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,14,43,3.0,5/12/2017,"We went there for the mall, every thing is ok, service was slow, plus there only few tables. I have 3 yrs old girl, waiter didn't ask to give my baby sliver ware."
Linda N.,"Albertson, NY",0,34,10,1.0,6/23/2016,"I really wish I could give zero stars. We went to this location last weekend and the service was hella slow. We were a party of 2 adults and 4 children. Instead of going to the food court for lunch we thought it would be better to have the kids contained in one place so we chose Cheesecake Factory.  Big mistake. Here are just a few reasons why I won't be returning to his location EVER again.  1. For one, I think they seated parties that came in AFTER us first. Not cool. When I went up to the counter to ask, they said we had not been called yet (we took the kids to the restrooms while we waited and there were more people who weren't there when we came in).  2. When they finally seated us, I asked the hostess if they had any crayons and activity paper to occupy the children as we waited. Nope, but I can give you some paper and pen, she said. What kind of family friendly establishment doesn't have at least crayons for the kids??  3. Our server, Dean, introduced himself and took our drink orders. All seemed well until he brought us a drink (seltzer) with remnants of what appeared to be chocolate syrup in bottom of the glass from its prior use.--GROSS! When he brought it to his attention, he quickly apologized and looked intent on replacing it. He disappeared for a good while until we got another. Meanwhile the first one just sat at the end of the table. He didn't bother to remove it even when he brought the new one. We had to ask him to remove it!  4. Then it took some time till he got over to us to take our orders and when he did, he seemed flustered..a box of cigarettes hanging loosely out of his smock. He was fumbling to find a pen and pad and in the midst of doing that the pack of smokes fell out of his smock. My friend's 7 year old went and picked it up for him.  5. I don't know exactly how long it took to get our food finally but it took a long time. The kids were complaining of hunger and we adults were not having a ball either. We arrived at 11:30 and didn't leave there until 1:30. We ate our food real fast when it came to us. We literally spent more time sitting and waiting than eating.  When we were looking for our server, he was nowhere to be found. We asked for more bread because the kids were starving and even that took a while. By the time the food came, they had filled up on bread. Imagine how long it took to get the check. I couldn't leave there quick enough.  I would avoid this location at all costs unless you like to watch the grass grow."
Lisa L.,"Nanuet, NY",0,12,,1.0,8/23/2017,"The service was terrible. We had a party of four and two of us waited 20 minutes to be served after the other two. I then accidentally left my wallet on the table after I paid and left, and returned literally 2 minutes later to be told my wallet ""disapeared"" by the waiter. I have seen other reviews similar to this. This restaurant is staffed by thieves. Be cautious using your credit card here."
Maria R.,"New York, NY",328,13,2,1.0,10/29/2017,"Horrible service!! Started with the long wait for dinner. Sat at bar with a friends. Get to the table,started by ordering drinks the waiter takes everyone's order except mine I had to stop him and say hello I'm here too.. we then ask for bread the bread was burned, drinks where seating at bar for a good 10 minutes,, he then comes and start to take order. Of course I was last for him to ask me what I wanted.  Then the food comes mine is last one to come. My friends pork shop was raw still bleeding needles to say he ask them to cook it abit  longer. Once I get my plate not only was the serving size below what I was expecting!!! The plate was (dirty) looks like they just ran a napkin around it and used it again.. so i return plate manager comes to table to try and say that's one of their most sold out plates!! I didn't eat ask them to take off bill he agreed! Then we ask for bill and the item was still on the bill.. not only did I seat there watch my friends eat they expect me to pay!! So I called another manager and they took it out horrible horrible"
Shirley W.,"Pine Brook, NJ",15,8,6,1.0,10/15/2017,"Went there last night at 9:30. Hostess seated us at 9:40p. We were a party of 4. Our server Alfredo took our drink orders then came over with another server (Lisa) and told us we were going to be taken care of by her since he was to go on break. Lisa visited our table twice more. Once to check and again to take our orders. After this we did not see Lisa again at all and were abandoned. We are not demanding people and our orders were pretty basic. An avocado salad w shrimp, a bacon cheeseburger (medium) w fries, a steak taco platter (onions & chipotle sauce on the side as onions trigger migraines on me in large quantities and chipotle sauce on the side as I wanted to test the heat level on the sauce before eating it), the last order was fish tacos (with chipotle sauce on the side). Well... this is where the entire experience went downhill. We waited about 30 minutes. A staff member came with food in a bag and said ""here's the shrimp scampi!"" All in our table w puzzled looks on our faces said to her ""we haven't even gotten our food yet!"" She stated ""well I'll just leave this here"" and left the bag at our table and walked off. We were all left puzzled. About 5 minutes after this, the same girl brought 2 of the platters for our party. The bacon cheeseburger & the avocado salad. We waited for about 15 minutes then Alfredo resurfaced asking if everything was ok. We pointed at the table and stated 2 of us didn't even get our food! He shook his head and apologized and went off to find out what happened. At this point the manager visited our table for the first time apologizing & stated he would take the 2 taco platters off our bill. Shortly after this the fish taco platter made it to our table. Chipotle sauce was not on the side as ordered but the member of our party ate it nevertheless as she was now too hungry. Still no steak taco platter. At 10:55p the steak taco platter finally arrived. Not seeing onions or chipotle sauce on the side, I took a bite of one of the tacos. My mouth was immediately on fire and it was evident that not only chipotle sauce was in the tacos, onions were also present. Alfredo came by again. Asked him to please take the steak tacos back as at this point they were inedible. We waited another 20 minutes. At this point I was no longer hungry. Alfredo surfaced again w the steak tacos & at this point I told him my entire party had finished eating long ago, and I no longer wanted to eat (especially because in my mind this food was now made in bad faith). The manager visited our table one last time & did make good by comping the entire bill for this catastrophically bad experience. He simply stated ""i have no excuses for how bad this went tonight. All I can say is I hope you will give us another chance to make it right on another occasion."" We looked for Alfredo and tipped him nevertheless as we recognized it wasn't all his fault. This visit was an embarrassment for the Cheesecake Factory. Needless to say we will not be returning any time soon."
Peter S.,"Bronx, NY",2,25,11,1.0,12/19/2016,"I am extremely disappointed at this location. My husband and I went in for Lunch. After waiting 20minutes, we were seated at a table with the vent right over ours head.  The temperature outside was at freezing 32*. For whatever reason this place had a heavy draft coming out of that vent over our head. My husband requested to the same person who seated us.. male in his 20's, thin with glasses, to move us over one table that had no direct vent. He shrugged him off and said we have another party coming. He offered zero alternative seating options, nor did he give a damn. So what is there to do? Stay and be uncomfortable, or leave? Yeah, we left. I will NEVER EVER patronize this CCF. VERY, VERY poor interpersonal skills and obviously customer service. That guy needs retraining asap. We ended up going to Chili's where the staff was outstanding and super friendly."
Paulette S.,"Kearny, NJ",74,87,25,1.0,9/26/2016,This place has continously gone down hill. Yesterday was the final straw for me.  I promptly vomited all that I ate 2 minutes after getting up from the table. Our waitress was slow and inept at best. There were flies buzzing all over us.  The entire experience was disgusting. I'm kind of over this place.
