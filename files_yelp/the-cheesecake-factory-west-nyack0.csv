Pawida K.,"Nanuet, NY",9,19,34,1.0,6/27/2014,I would have giving  a zero ! Would never come back to this cheesecake factory. I ordered herb roasted chicken  .. and they serve me burned chicken and fixed with saute chicken that tasted like noodle soup and manager tried to lied and said the reason they sauté it because they didn't want to burn it again. I was like I ate this 5000 time before and you acted like idk that your oven have a timer!!! Apology with a lied. I don't appreciate!  And time before this they burn down my dynamic shrimp appetizer too and the Waites lied said that how the dynamic shrimp look liked ( it's funny how they don't know I used to go there almost 2 twice a week ) and the sauté chicken that I couldn't finish and told them I didn't want it end up I got food poison.  I send the food back because the chicken wasn't fully cook and still have pink inside. After 4 bites I paid for the price when I came home later that night!  This place went down hill they will need a new kitchen manager and some honestly people to work in there.  Not just try to save there own ass and lies.
Nick K.,"Newburgh, NY",0,21,1,1.0,5/14/2013,I Despise this place. I took lady there and they shoved into this tiny table that could not fit drinks and salad let alone the main course! They where extremely rude we asked for salad dressing and the server came back and said  here is some lemons and the pepper is on the table you can mix it yourself.  EXCUSE ME!!!!!  as much as your charging me you have the nerve to say that!!! I contacted corporate and there so arrogant and full of themselves they sent me a 20$ gift certificate on a 70$ bill and said they shouldn't even be sending that. Yeah seriously . Go take a leap!  I will never ever positively ever be back to this flop of a place.  P.S Lets no even get into the state of the bathrooms!!

Wendy C.,"Brooklyn, NY",29,130,93,4.0,8/7/2013,"4.5 stars, I had a good time here when I came after shopping in the mall with my friends. We waited half an hour for a table, I was surprised at how busy this place is given the number of tables this place can hold. I guess everyone wants a fix of some cheesecake! Our waiter, Jonathan, was entertaining and attentive and was the highlight of our dining experience. My friends and I all ordered salads, I ordered the Waldroff Salad from the new tasting menu and it was delicious and just the right portion (smaller than the regular size salads). We also ordered 2 small appetizer plates, the zucchini fries were godly, i would definitely order them again. When time came for dessert, Jonathan our waiter explained what cheesecakes were available and what were his favorites. I ordered his recommendation, the new S'more cheesecake and it was delicious! It had graham cookies and melted marshmellows on top of the chocolatey-fudge cheesecake. I gained 2 pounds from this dinner."
R W.,"Blauvelt, NY",0,17,1,3.0,1/14/2014,"Excellent service, great salads but the Santa Fe salad didn't have nearly enough chicken. Of course, the cheesecake was great."
Lisa B.,"Bronx, NY",17,70,7,1.0,8/11/2013,Nasty food. Bad service. If you get a waiter named Michael run for your life.
Jon K.,"Paramus, NJ",1710,331,534,4.0,8/16/2010,"SHE MADE ME GO HERE!!!! I did not want to have lunch here on a recent Sunday.  I would have preferred a non-chain outside of the mall. Good call Wife! Fresh brewed unsweetened iced tea...perfect. We started with two of the small plates.  One was sweet corn fritters served with a nice remoulade sauce.  I had half of one.  It was warm and sweet and contrasted nicely with the spicy sauce.   The second was an order of Vietnamese soft tacos.  Small pieces of grilled pork along with pickled vegetables (cucumber, red onion and carrot) along with fresh cilantro in a small steamed bun.  You get 3 of them.  Excellent! Wife had a nice looking ahi tuna salad and CAS had a buffalo chix sandwich with fries. My main was a green chili cheeseburger a la New Mexico.  A very large size perfectly cooked (medium rare) with lots of green chili and a side of sliced jalapeno too!  There were also very finely diced tortilla strips along with cheese on the burger.  I paid the additional $1 for sweet potato fries.  Great burger. We passed on dessert. Service was great."
R O.,"New York, NY",94,224,4,4.0,8/8/2010,"I worked here for a few months during college in 2003.  A few things to note from the inside: The kitchen is IMPECCABLY clean.  You never have to worry about weird food handling or how the kitchen looks behind the scenes.   From working behind the scenes and seeing how the food is prepared, I would say the food is definitely over-priced.  But  it is set up so you are paying for the brand-quality, hyper-clean kitchen, somewhat-attractive staff, and pumped up marketing.  The restaurant also prides itself on the tastiness of the food.  The food is not exactly healthy though.  The founder is morbidly obese."
Adriana D.,"Harrington Park, NJ",85,4,2,5.0,10/30/2013,"This restaurant has amazing food (try the shrimp with angle hair pasta omg) with huge portions (I had lunch for the next day) amazing desserts (the cheesecake will rock your world) and an amazing wait staff. It is a tad pricey (3 of us-entrees, dessert + tip $120.00ish) but worth every penny."
Daniel G.,"Haverstraw, NY",89,49,5,4.0,5/16/2012,I come to the cheesecake fac. Often I always have the fried Mac and cheese and fried calamari. The best!  The service is always good and fast
Kathryn G.,"Framingham, MA",32,51,,5.0,9/6/2013,I love the Cheesecake Factory because they have fried macaroni and cheese and delicious cheesecake. Plus they have other great food and so many choices. You will need a few minutes to go through the menu! The staff is great and it is clean. The only negative is that it is so crowded with a long wait to be seated (depending on when you go of course). Enjoy!!!
Crystal B.,"Alexandria, VA",62,57,26,4.0,7/2/2013,"Probably the best restaurant in the mall. It gets 4 stars because you don't have to enter the mall to get there (that place is huge). Food is what you expect from the chain which isn't always great. However I actually like their small plates a lot. My favorite thing off the small plates menu is the arugula salad. I like to pair it with a protein like the bang bang shrimp! Of course, don't leave without sharing a dessert with your eating companion!"
Jonathan S.,"Metairie, LA",224,139,,5.0,1/26/2011,"Love the Cheesecake Factory.  Took the family there a few weeks ago.  I had a cajun shrimp pasta dish.  My wife had some cheese enchiladas with some of the most awesome cornmeal cake things I've ever had. The cheesecake was the only thing we weren't huge fans of.  The restaurant is huge and very nice, the menu is massive, and everything we ordered was prepared very well. Great service.  Good place."
J Q.,"Newark, NJ",0,10,,2.0,10/7/2014,"I typically frequent the one by Riverside Square Mall in Hackensack and usually order the same dish - BBQ Ranch chicken salad. I was near the Palisades Mall and decided to go here with a friend for lunch.  All I can say was the quality of the salad was poor- the romaine wasn't fresh, barely any avocado or chicken.  I think I'll stick to the one at Riverside. Very dissapointed."
Kristin B.,"Westwood, NJ",125,204,6,4.0,3/18/2010,"I feel kind of weird reviewing The Cheesecake Factory because it is...GASP a chain restaurant ::shudder:: Say what you will.  Judge me.  Excommunicate me.  I say it loud and proud: I. love. The. Cheesecake. Factory.  I'm not ashamed.  It's a similar love to the one I have for Starbucks.  I don't always love the service (in all fairness, sometimes I do, particularly at this location).  And I don't always love the wait.  I don't always love the company.  But I always love the food. They have this newish page on the menu (""Small Plates and Starters"" I believe its called) with a delectable endive, bleu cheese and candied pecan salad.  Extremely reasonably priced; they're great little dishes to grab with drinks.  Also, if you like avocado, GET THE AVOCADO SPRING ROLLS.  You will write back to me and tell me you don't know how you went a day in your life before knowing those babies existed."
Ian S.,"Port Jervis, NY",33,163,1,3.0,9/19/2010,"(Representing 3.5 stars) We've been here a few times, so a review is overdue. This place really is a factory. Run with military precision and phenomenally clean - apparently they go through $50,000 worth of detergents in a year - the servers here have a robotic, ultra-rehearsed vibe to them, and one can only picture the kitchen: the menu here is a 20-page monster. Devoid of natural light, you'll be desperate for a candle if you're sat anywhere over by the bar, but that's a minor niggle. The food is overpriced and colossally unhealthy, but above par. I've had some excellent jambalaya here, as well as monstrous sandwiches and chip/dip combos. Really good drinks selection too, and a full-on bar. And yes, the cheesecake is superb. Expensive ($6.95 per slice) but superb. I don't doubt that they're all delicious, but I can only personally vouch for the Banana Cream or Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. If you go to this particular branch, by the way, cross your fingers and hope you get Chris as your server. This guy is a machine."
Daniel Z.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",8,54,,1.0,3/3/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory chain is so overrated in my opinion! The atmosphere is a little pretentious for a chain restaurant and the food is well average at best. I had a shepherd's pie that was very greasy and a slice of Snickers cheesecake, which was okay, but definitely not worth $7.95 or whatever it was. I don't know if it was the food or if I had a stomach bug, but I was feeling queasy afterwords. The only saving grace was that the service was nice, friendly and kept refilling the drinks. Overall, I still wouldn't come back."
Tasha S.,"Bronx, NY",56,102,11,3.0,5/10/2010,"So It's Mother's Day and my friends and my son just got out of the movie theatre. When we first got into the mall, The Cheesecake factory looked crowded. Ofcorse. I said I wanted to atleast get a cake to go before we left. When we were leaving, it was alot better. No wait at all so we decided to stay and eat dinner.  I had the Edamame and crab cake appetizers. You can't really go wrong with soy beans but the crab cakes were juicy and well seasoned. I didn't care for all the unedible plate decoration but they gave me 3 reasonable size cakes. The dipping sauce was delish as well.  My friend had a chicken club sandwich that looked amazing. He was done with it beforw I could ask for a bite.. lol. The waiter was attentive and polite. He took very good care of us and was patient. (It took a while for us to figure out what we all wanted to eat) he gave recommendations and didn't show any signs he was annoyed with our indecisiveness.  I left with a medium chocolate rasberry cheesecake for my mom and sis and they loved it. From what I can tell by licking my fingers from cutting the slices, they were right. I've been to Cheesecake Factory before but I almost forgot how much a pleasure it is."
Phillip B.,"Dover, NJ",49,245,267,3.0,2/19/2012,"Cheesecake!  That is the theme of the restaurant, but they are so much more.  The Cheesecake Factory has one of the biggest menus I have ever seen.  I always go and think I know what I want, but then the server comes over and I draw a blank.  The Sesame crusted Tuna is really good as is Chicken Bellagio,  I also recommend the corn fritters for an appetizer and the Macaroni and Cheese Balls.  Don't forget the cheesecake for dessert.  I always take mine home since I have already filled myself to capacity."
Jessica S.,"Nyack, NY",0,11,,1.0,11/2/2013,Ugh! Where to start...I have known several people who worked here.  They treat their staff like cattle and expect you to act like a robot. If you don't say and do exactly what they want-they fire you without blinking. Staff members eat off of plates and touch that yummy bread with their bare hands! The stories could go on...I would never eat here. It has really gone down hill-not to mention it is located in a mall that smells like poo.
