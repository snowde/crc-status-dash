Purpose T.,"Hillside, NJ",1159,301,100,4.0,12/28/2015,"It's always great to grab a bite to eat here before or after a movie upstairs in the mall. Great food, as always. Good service, too. No complaints! Being that it's located at the mall, you can expect a long wait to be seated. I always prefer to go when it opens."
Dana M.,"Yonkers, NY",2,37,20,2.0,1/31/2016,"Went here on friday during the early afternoon. Some waitress came over to us and said ""what do you want for drinks""... I then asked her ""are you our waitress?"".. Due to her not introducing herself I had no idea if she was ours or just covering our table. She then replied ""yes""... And that was it!!! No name?! No ""hi how are you guys today"" ""thanks for coming to the cheesecake factory"".. NOTHING! So the second time she came to the table I had to ask her, ""what is your name"", in which she replied Frankie. Personally, I do not think she is very good at her job, as the first impression was horrible, and secondly because she does not know the menu at all, and thirdly you are constantly looking for her because she never comes back to the table to see if you need anything else. We asked for lemon, and got one slice, very generous! Oh and 4 little slices of bread for two people! You can tell the other slices of bread were ripped off!! The portions were very small, but the prices were still high!  I do feel this restaurant is over priced! The food seems to be going down hill, the customer service or lack of, tremendously needs help! Also, they need to do a better cleaning job! Sitting on the previous guests' crumbs is just gross!"
Ladydipset88 ..,"Spring Valley, NY",0,10,5,4.0,5/24/2016,"I love cheese cake factory. I went there yesterday with my boo for my birthday.  Pros: - I love the pumpernickel bread they serve with butter..yum!  - I loved the strawberry lemonade  - the waiter was alright... - the food came out quick or maybe me and my boo were too much into our conversation I didn't realize lol - the strawberry cheesecake slice was delicious  - clean atmosphere, kind of fancy looking  Cons: - the chicken pot stickers were too salty. They were good but salty I almost couldn't finish it but my boo took some  - the steak was good but not great (I ordered the hibachi steak). The edges were kind of hard and I avoided eating them so the pieces wouldn't get stuck in my teeth  - it's too dimly lighted in there. If you want to take good pictures of yourself and your food, the flash has to be on.  - it's freezing in there. Good thing I wore a cardigan sweater."
S H.,"New Windsor, NY",0,29,38,4.0,11/11/2013,This is a great place I love the food. I've had the shepherds pie and the crab cakes . The crab cakes are in the small plate section they really should make them an entre.  The portions are nice and large. I don' t like how close the tables are in the back there is no privacy to talk. The distance between tables is about.  12 inches . The waitress stood between the table and her butt was in our face touching the table. Now for the cheesecake. I've had it twice and both times I was disapointed. They just are not that good. If you want great cheesecake get it from JR's I definitely recommenf
CD R.,"New City, NY",1,11,,1.0,12/30/2015,"This West Nyack location used to be my go-to place when at the Palisades Mall. I can now say that I will not be going to this restaurant anytime soon. For a year or two I have seen a decline in the food quality, the wait staff, the cleanliness, etc. But, the last time I was there, the experience was the worst of all.  Cleanliness: We were shown to our table which was set up but had crumbs all over it, food remnants under the table (pieces of broccoli, French fries, and who knows what else) and dirty silverware. We had to get the waitress to have the table cleaned, swept and all place settings replaced. In addition, While sitting during our meal we had to keep swatting away fruit flies. And the ladies bathroom was absolutely gross- toilet paper all over, wet floors in the stalls, etc.  Food Quality: I tried to order a salad (I think it was a Mediterranean salad) and was told they ran out of it. It was fairly early in the evening, so I thought that was very odd- perhaps they just don't stock the ingredients because it was not one of their larger salads.  We were served bread while waiting for our food and although the bread was fine, the butter patties were totally melted and the butter tasted like it was spoiled. The soda was served and was flat, our food orders all came out at different times and we found the food very salty- especially the French fries. In addition, for a restaurant that is known for its large portions, the salmon that was served was very small- I would say less than 1/4 of a pound for $19.  For dessert we ordered cheesecake and when it was served to us it had fallen over on the plate and part of it had probably fallen on the floor in transport. No apology by the server or offer to get us a new piece.  The Wait Staff: During our meal we had at least 5 different waitresses/waiters. The first girl who had to re-clean our table, went on break during our time there so another waitress came over to say she was covering. That was the last we saw her and then a waiter came over to address the soda being flat. Then a different waitress served us 2 of our three orders with another waiter serving the final entree. A completely different waitress took our dessert order and served it and gave us the check. Not one of these people came over during our meal to ask how everything was and at the end of the meal no one asked if we wanted coffee or dessert- we had to ask for a menu to order dessert.  All in all an expensive and unpleasant experience and one that unfortunately is not uncommon to this restaurant."
William C.,"Pine Bush, NY",1,16,1,3.0,2/28/2016,"The food is good but I can't think of a menu item that had the wow factor. It was clean, but it was stuffy, cramped and  loud prices were on the steep side and the price of a piece of cheesecake was ridiculous. This place is good but to expensive for some mediocre food and NO entertainment."
Ryan A.,"Walden, NY",0,11,10,5.0,7/12/2015,"This location never disappoints! Don't agree with service complaints, never have had an issue here! Last night we had both the nachos and Cuban pork rolls, nachos were HUGE!!! Then for an entree I had the factory burrito grande and it was MASSIVE, only got half way through and saved the rest, you could share its so big! Finished off with a nice slice of the infamous original cheesecake, never let down there! Extremely satisfied great spot for a BIG meal"
Sarah T.,"Highland Falls, NY",0,30,1,1.0,7/14/2016,This is the THIRD time we have tried going to this location we have been craving for weeks and every time we go in the heat is so disgusting we can't even make it to the hostess !!!!! The heat in there is unacceptable it was hard to even walk in yet alone sit and eat. This time we walked in a there was an IRATE women there flipping out over the heat and lack of customer service. I myself had the same concerns but after watching her and the manager and hostess walk past her we quickly turned around and went to Dave and busters. It's upsetting because this is the third time trying to eat there! When will the AC work ?! Will we need to wait until fall or winter to eat again!??? Not fair for the customers to dine in like that and definitely not fair to the staff to work under such conditions. Hopefully this review sends a corporate member in to experience what staff and customers are experiencing... Disappointed and craving cheesecake ...
Maegan P.,"Stony Point, NY",21,2,,1.0,4/29/2016,I use to love this place! After 2 BAD visits in a row I'm done! Very long hair BAKED into my cheesecake and then another visit I had more long hair in my pasta dish ... GROSS! Have they ever heard of hairnets ?!  i should have learned my lesson after the hair was baked into my cheesecake  smh
Betty Ming L.,"Westchester County, NY",60,357,42,3.0,1/8/2014,"This chain is reliable -- and predictable. But if you're gonna be in the Palisades Mall and want a nice place to lunch, The Cheesecake Factory works just fine. The room has a dark wood, upholstered look, which is soothing and fits the upscaling mood that the mall is undergoing right now.  The bathroom is reasonably clean too but not spotless. Service is very friendly and efficient.  The extensive menu also includes a separate, small gluten-free menu. You have to ask for it; it's not automatically offered. Most of the items show up in various spots on the main menu. I didn't see the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad ($17.95) on the regular menu but found it easily on the gluten-free menu. It was pretty good -- the tuna slices were served sashimi style, just a bit grilled around the outer edges, which were also finished in something that was slightly crunchy/spicy.  My friend ordered from the regular menu and there was more than enough to make a filling meal: A cup of tortilla soup ($2.95) that was actually a bowl of soup, and a big chicken salad ($10.50)."
Rachelle L.,"White Plains, NY",30,10,35,4.0,5/9/2015,I been here several times. They have a great lunch menu with skinny-luscious options. They also have gluten free and lots of vegetarian options.
Kim M.,"Manhattan, NY",13,28,13,5.0,1/22/2015,"A long time friend and I went last night for dinner after doing some shopping. I had the spicy chipotle pasta dish and my friend had the macaroni and cheese burger and fries. Also, of course, cheesecake. My friend had the caramel turtle and I had the dulce de leche...I love dulce de leche anything! Wonderful servers and ambiance. Please visit. You are sure to have a great time."
Chris J.,"Bronx, NY",0,3,,1.0,4/9/2017,"Do not waste your time or money at this location! Service is horrible! Manager is an idiot! I took my 5 and 12 year old nieces out for dinner as a treat at this restaurant and had to walk out upset with 2 hungry kids because of the lack of service and courtesy we received there. We waited almost half an hour for a table-which was fine because they are always busy. The waitress seemed to have been in a bad mood because she barely made eye contact or even spoke to us. We waited at least 15 minutes for bread and water to come to the stable, when a helper finally comes out to the table-she practically flung the basket of bread on the table to the point that one piece fell out of the basket. And do your know what she did??! She picked up the piece of bread with her bare hand and put it back in the basket!!!!! Then she just walked away-when I tried to call her back and get her attention-she ignored me!!! At this point-Our waitress (who still looks like her dog died) is in the corner whispering to a guy, watching all this happen but never coming over to check on us at the table. I eventually gets this guys attention to tell him what happened and this is not a lie.... the guy just stood there looking at us like ""what do you want me to do about it!"" I became so upset and just got the girls and walked out. I have been going to Cheesecake Factory for many years and I did not expect that interaction. I know not all locations are the same but the one at the Palisades Mall is horrible! Take your money somewhere else!"
Chris L.,"Paterson, NJ",92,998,737,4.0,5/10/2013,It's CCC what's not to like? Service is always good.  Free bread. And massive portions. I rather come here than other franchises.
Raquel P.,"Bronx, NY",27,36,9,4.0,10/30/2014,"I wish there was a Cheesecake Factory in New York City! The plate portions remind me a little of the plates at Carmine's. The food was good, but could not finish it so if it's only two people I would recommend possibly sharing a plate or two. The best part of course is the cheesecake! I don't know how many times I would have to go to the factory to try out every cheesecake, the list is so long! The cake is so good too. Too bad there aren't any cheesecake factories in new york city."
Danya A.,"Valley Cottage, NY",3,24,26,4.0,10/1/2015,Good food.  I feel like it's one of the better chain restaurants. The service can be a little slow at times
Ron V.,"Newburgh, NY",96,33,7,1.0,8/2/2014,"Seriously disappointed! Been to Cheesecake factories all over and this one is by far the worst. Took 20-30 minutes to get our first drinks. The entire restaurant is disgusting. My girlfriend went into the ladies room where she found a dirty diaper sitting next to an employee washing her hands... Diaper was ignored and trash was everywhere.  Food was prepared poorly. Ordered a burger medium and it was served rare with cold Fries, the Louisiana chicken pasta had rubber chicken and undercooked pasta.  Will not return."
Lisa M.,"Nyack, NY",24,48,,4.0,9/22/2015,This new review is a year later at the aventura fl location.   The miso salmon was the best yet. Very different from pallisades ny.   It seems even in the summer  the turnover is far greater than my local cheesecake factory. And it shows in the taste and the chef/cook.  Anyhow  waitstaff is ok. Manager said hello.  Alls well if the food and server is good.
Anthony B.,"New Rochelle, NY",81,44,,3.0,12/24/2015,Very corporate so you know exactly what you are going to get when you go to any Cheesecake Factory. Service was good. Crab & Artichoke dip is my girlfriends go to but this time the bread it came with was rock hard. Chalk it up to a busy holiday shift and some things slip through the cracks. 1 thing that always gets me though is that the French Fries are ALWAYS cold! No matter what location! Get better Fry Boats PLEASE!
Shep O.,"West Nyack, NY",106,9,,4.0,2/14/2016,Service was good. Food was enjoyable. Always have a pleasant time here. Cheesecake is always a weakness of mine. I stop in at least once a month to eat. Never have had a bad time here.
