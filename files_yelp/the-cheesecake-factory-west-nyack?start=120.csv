Sunil R.,"Bronx, NY",0,44,22,2.0,1/23/2016,The food were great the service were horrible. The Establishment had advertising postings for a particular offer and when ask about the offer I was told that they were  no longer running that promo. Both the server and I were very confused. After contacting  the Manager she did not seem to want to offer any type of solution. Neither did she seem to want to be bothered. Not how I thought the situation should have been handled.
N W.,"Hartsdale, NY",4,102,17,3.0,11/29/2014,The service was solid. The waitress was nice. The food was good. Always a solid option for families.
Dawn V.,"Wurtsboro, NY",32,3,2,5.0,2/28/2015,The most diverse menu I have ever seen at a box restaurant. And the ingredients were fresh. The service was speedy and efficient. It was an excellent experience and the price was great!
Zoranlly C.,"Cortlandt, NY",69,7,,1.0,12/29/2015,"If I could give a zero, I would. Never have I gone to an establishment with less customer service than this Cheesecake Factory. Upon arrival, my husband was ignored and others were given their tables. We went there with a large group of 9 and we were told we had to wait 1.5 hours because they had to give us the party room, regardless of our request not to do so. However, a party of 7 and 12 came in right after us and were immediately seated. The manager, Amanda, wasn't helpful either, she just agreed with the rude comments made by the hostess. Unfortunately, we did not wait the unreasonable time in an empty restaurant on a nonpeak hour, instead we gave our business to another location. My family and friends will not be recommended this location or the establishment itself."
Ally G.,"Nyack, NY",155,155,52,4.0,6/7/2015,"What can I say? I love the Cheesecake Factory! I know the food is massively sized, and not the best, but as far as chains go this is one of my favorite. I am never disappointed with the food or dessert or service. I'm happy it's here!"
Mike C.,"Valley Cottage, NY",90,12,,3.0,1/28/2017,"Went on a Friday night and got called after 15-20 minutes which was fine. Sat down and the waitress arrived somewhat promptly and asked what we wanted to drink. It took a longer time than I thought to get the drinks but it was a little busy, so I get it. Afterwards she took our orders (table of 2) and everything seemed fine. But we waited and waited for bread to come to the table. When our food was ready, a different waitress brought it to our table, and we didn't see the waitress for over 5 minutes when she asked how our food was. A few minutes later I ran out of soda and wanted another, but the waitress was nowhere to be seen; the table next to us had the same waitress and they asked a different waitress to get her because they needed her too. I sat there for over 10 minutes without a drink. She then proceeded to refill it with the wrong soda, but by the time she brought it back I was nearly done so I didn't even bother bringing it to her attention. I ended up riding dessert to go and had to wait another 10 minutes for a piece of cheesecake and the check. After she dropped of the check she was quick to come back to see when we were done. Overall, poor experience."
Meera P.,"Mahwah, NJ",39,48,30,5.0,10/23/2015,Out of all the Cheesecake Factory restaurants I have visited this is definitely my favorite! Consistent quality of food and wonderful accommodating staff.
Tiffany B.,"Bronx, NY",2,38,52,3.0,10/19/2014,"If I want to go to cheesecake factory, I usually go to the one near my house at ridge hill in yonkers. I went to the one at the palisades mall since my friend lives nearby. We went one evening and it was packed.  it took us a few minutes to get seated. I ordered the jamaican black pepper shrimp and chicken which came with mango salsa, white rice, black beans and plantains.  It's a huge meal! I always end up taking the rest home. Since the place was packed, our drinks didnt come until we were getting ready to leave.  The waitress and manager were very apologetic. It's a good place to eat if you're at the mall and dont want fast food. They have a huge menu so you're bound to find something that you'll like."
Lorraine B.,"Nanuet, NY",5,49,34,3.0,8/19/2015,I don't always go out for lunch but I was at the mall and didn't want the food court so this seemed like a good option. The skinnilicious menu was filled with great choices and I had the chicken salad sandwich and my daughter had the turkey avocado sandwich and I can report they were delicious and not over the top calorie wise. Each came with a salad and lunch was filling without leaving us stuffed. I've also tried their flatbread on that menu and it too was tasty. I'd also recommend the passion fruit tea. The waitress was efficient and friendly and this was a pleasant experience. We shall return!
Ana S.,"Butler, NJ",0,3,,5.0,11/28/2015,"Amazing quality of the food. From the stuffed mushrooms and beet salad, to the ribeye and shrimp scampee! My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVED our server, Patrick T! He was Phenomenal and so professional! Loved the salted caramel cheesecake he recommended with the double espresso. Perfect dinner. We will be back!!"
Rob L.,"Monroe, NY",9,8,5,5.0,9/19/2015,The Cheesecake Factory never fails to deliver good food.  They have a huge menu which should fit anyone's tastes. Always had good experience at the one in Nyack.
Shellene O.,"Hebron, CT",79,245,44,3.0,6/3/2014,"My first time at a Cheesecake Factory.  TONS of choices for both food and desert.  The one is located in a big mall and was really busy the entire time we were there.  Our service suffered a little bit because of the volume of traffic, but our waitress did her very best (even gave us credit for a meal that came out WAY after all the others at our table).   Something I'm willing to try again (but not for any more than a 15 minute wait)."
Stefan B.,"West Nyack, NY",6,113,1,3.0,4/7/2014,"""Huge"" is a word that I think is very fitting for this place. For starters, it's housed in the huge Palisades Center Mall. As such, the restaurant space itself is huge. Couple that with the fact that the waitstaff may be undermanned and your service could suffer as mine did during lunchtime on a Saturday. Waiting lines can be huge.  The menu is huge, almost to the point that it's overwhelming. There are so many things on the menu that simply deciding what you want can be considered an event in itself. Portions are huge and also pack a punch with calories. The Cheesecake Factory is notorious for being amongst the worst chain restaurants for the health conscious. For this reason they created a ""Skinnylicious"" menu, which is also huge, and if you're looking through that AND their regular menu, you're going to be there a while. My disappointment in their cheesecake was huge. I didn't get anything fancy, just a standard strawberry cheesecake. It wasn't special. For a place named the Cheesecake Factory, I was definitely disappointed. But I was more disappointed for the huge price for one slice of cheesecake ($8.62!!).  Outside of their astronomical cheesecake prices, everything else seemed reasonable. The food was good for a chain restaurant, but let's not confuse this place with Jean Georges. I like it as a nicer lunch option in the mall than say, Chili's, but I'm not sure I'd come here for dinner or go out of my way to eat here if I wasn't already in the mall."
Lisa D.,"Glen Cove, NY",62,274,,2.0,10/21/2012,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory before and had better experiences.   My brother ordered some type of lettuce wrap yesterday and one of the pieces of lettuce was torn and dirty.  The waiter was a bit lame about it (he picked it up off the plate--now who wants to eat off that plate?)  and then the manager brought a few pieces of broken lettuce (not good for wraps) and launched into a description of their salad spinner.   Sadly, the new lettuce had salad dressing dripped on it.  The manager accused us of putting 'sauce' on it.  (I'm middle-aged and my brother has grey hair.  We are not teenaged pranksters trying to get a 'free' $5 lettuce wrap.) They finally comped the plate, but really, folks.... badly done"
Andrea T.,"Manchester, NH",5,14,16,3.0,9/29/2015,"Food was good as usual. However, we got our appetizer before the complementary bread and butter. The waitress also messed up on the check which took them forever to fix."
Sans P.,"Bronx, NY",6,67,70,5.0,8/17/2014,"So this was actually my first time dining at a CF restaurant. There was about a 30 to 40 minute wait, as expected as it was the weekend. Approximately in 30 minutes, my buzzer went off. Within a few minutes, our waiter came to the table.  Our food didn't take long to come and our waiter checked on us frequently. He was awesome. I enjoyed my crab cakes and to my surprise, it was very meaty. I had the Cajun shrimp and pasta. It was good but spicy (as it stated on the menu).  I took a slice on mango key lime cheesecake to go. Nothing special about it. Next time I will go with my heart and get the snickers cheesecake."
Brian T.,"Branford, CT",3,30,3,2.0,1/11/2014,"I've been here for perfectly pleasant lunches once or twice in the past, and as long as you don't expect the food to be particularly creative or fresh, the Cheesecake Factory can certainly be an agreeable place to have a meal. However, let's not forget that it's called the Cheesecake *Factory*. I don't know what parts of the menu are prepared fresh in-house and what's prepared long in advance on a bleak production plant floor in a faraway land, frozen into chunks, and mailed to West Nyack for defrosting, but the ""Factory"" part of the name isn't just a quaint affectation. The kitchen does not have a production line of ten quirky local grandmas preparing the cuisine from scratch and sending it out to the tables with love and pride. The name really should be your first clue that certain rules of logic and reasonable behavior may be suspended when you walk through the door. When you have a giant chain pretending to be a bistro, occasionally the cheery façade will peel back, and the dystopian nightmare beneath will reveal itself. We came in for dinner on a Friday night, and it was a 30-minute wait for a table. That's not my problem at all, since they told us it would be that long and gave us a pager. We even got a drink at the bar while we waited. The insane parade of incompetence only began when we actually got our table and sat without any contact from the Cheesecake Mill staff for about fifteen minutes. During that time, we saw an animated argument going on at the other end of the restaurant between a woman who would eventually become our first of three waiters and a man who later turned out to be both our second waiter and the manager. Eventually, waiter #1 finished her argument, came over, and immediately began acting bizarre and standoffish, as if making eye contact us with was a problem and her top priority was to get away from us as quickly as possible. She was remarkably more chipper when she checked in on the tables near us, so we think it had something to do with our table in particular. I really don't think it could have been anything we said or did, since we were friendly, despite the delays, and since her attitude was already going in full force before either of us said a word. I am relatively certain that our party did not smell of dead cats, though that would also have explained her behavior.  Another explanation that would fit all the facts is that she assumed--accurately--that we were a couple and had a problem with that because we're both men. However, I don't think we did anything that would distinguish us from two friends having dinner and drinks, so that theory may not explain the facts as well as rank incompetence does. Regardless of the reasons for her behavior, after that first weird encounter, #1 disappeared for about fifteen more minutes before coming back with menus and water. She also took our drink order before leaving the table. Then, she apparently fell down a well somewhere in the New Jersey countryside, because we didn't see her again for quite some time. As the search parties continued their tireless efforts to find #1, #2 came over about fifteen minutes later and re-took our drink order, introducing himself as the manager, apologizing for the delay, and explaining that he'd be our waiter from now. Everything was going to be fine. We smiled. We were genuinely nice about the delay. Who cares? It's only been a half hour. The manager has taken a personal interest. They'll take great care of us from here on out. Fifteen minutes later, in a neat plot twist, a third individual came over and explained that he was actually our waiter. He took our drink order, of course! His attitude was courteous and professional. Everything was going to be fine. We never saw him again.  If you're keeping score at home, that's two menus, two glasses of water, three waiters, one manager, three drink orders, forty-five minutes, and no food.  Another fifteen minutes or so later, #1 was extracted from the well, cleaned up, and returned to us with a round of drinks. Her bizarre attitude was, if anything, worse from here on out. It was perhaps the most awkward service I have ever received in a restaurant. Things then alternated between uncomfortable and tiresome right up until we finally stepped out of the Cheesecake Ironworks over two hours after we were seated. In that time, we got one round of drinks and one course of mediocre food. Waiting twenty minutes for the check was a nice touch at the end. Cheesecake Sweatshop of the Palisades Mall, you get two stars because I've had a lunch there at least once that wasn't devised in the mind of an evil genius to torture the innocent. But this dinner was not only terrible; it will forever serve as a reminder of why it's usually better not to try to have a nice evening out at a corporate chain with ""Factory"" right in the name."
Liam M.,"South Salem, NY",0,55,,1.0,6/12/2016,"Horrible! The second we walked in, it seemed the air conditioner was broken! So we just left and went to Dave and busters instead!"
John J.,"Mount Kisco, NY",3,23,1,5.0,8/15/2015,My favorite spot in the world the staff is lovely and there drinks are great. I strongly recommend the avocado wraps and the ahi tuna tartar so yummy.
Dinah B.,"Manhattan, NY",907,144,152,3.0,12/22/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is just somewhere you go when you're already in the Palisades mall. I would never come here just for the food.  The food is ok. I mean most chain restaurants aren't meant to provide culinary adventures (except for Morton's or Houston's) and most picky eaters can at least find something to their liking (I mean their menu is basically an entire book. If you can't find something here then I'm glad I don't know you).  Their salads are a safe bet, but most of the other meals are either deep fried or swimming in oil. I'll admit that I used to enjoy the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, but after reheating my left overs and seeing all of that extra oil, I was just grossed out. I usually go for the Cobb Salad or the Santa Fe, while the BFF goes for the Chinese Chicken Salad. If you order the Caesar salad, just know that it comes with lots of chopped anchovies (not my thing, since the flavor was overpowering and my breath reeked for about two days).  ALWAYS say yes to the bread, always say yes to the cheesecake and always take advantage of the bottomless refills."
