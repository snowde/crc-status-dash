Vanessa B.,"Nanuet, NY",585,160,321,4.0,6/18/2015,"chicken madeira, *hibachi steak*, chicken marsala, steak diane. frozen iced mango. so good. atmosphere is really nice, food is always fresh. the cheesecakes are delicious, as well as the deserts. i just can't stand the hour long waits to get a booth on the weekend."
Jan E.,"Arden, NY",0,148,4,4.0,5/14/2015,"I really like this place. The service is usually good, love the bread they serve when you sit down.  Portions are huge, even the lunch selections. I've had many different appetizers, all good: fried zucchini, spring rolls, etc. Salads are wonderful, pasta delicious. And they are really good about special requests. The hardest part about eating here is deciding which cheesecake to order for dessert."
Vanessa F.,"CHESTNUT RDG, NY",45,63,105,4.0,11/5/2013,"My God sister was in town this weekend and she had us all gather here for dinner to catch up. We were a group of 9. The waitress got everyone's order, there was no mix up and no issue. We all chose great selections of appetizers and shared and passed this and that between one another. I ordered the fried macaroni and cheese balls as well as the mini sliders with fries. I have to say, i never ordered appetizers as a meal before but it worked and I enjoyed it. Also someone got the avocado egg rolls and I hate avocado but I love their egg rolls! Some people ordered a shrimp platter, however i forgot what it is called but they loved it. All in all, our complimentary bread baskets were never empty and our water glasses were kept full. I don't really come here, but I'm glad we did this time, I had a great time."
Anthony C.,"East Otis, MA",0,12,,3.0,12/27/2015,It's okay if you don't have high expectations. It's a chain restaurant. Everything made has too much of everything in it to appeal to taste buds.
Love F.,"Wurtsboro, NY",2,9,52,4.0,9/24/2015,Great place for lunch or anytime of the day. We have been here multiple times already.
Abe D.,"West Nyack, NY",0,8,,1.0,4/23/2016,"Used to like going here and ordering in from here, but it has gone downhill fast. I haven't ""written off"" many restaurants in my life, but this is one of them. Will not be going back unless someone reports they have made a massive turnaround."
Ruben V.,"Ringwood, NJ",15,32,11,3.0,4/21/2014,Wasnt that packed and took a bit to sit us down. Seems like they were low on staff. Took a while to bring out drinks and food. Didnt bring the food out all at one time. Other than that. The food was great as usual. I loved the avacado rolls.
Naomi K.,"Suffern, NY",0,21,,3.0,5/10/2016,Service was quite poor and slow. We ordered 2 Salads and one omellete. Half an hour for food to show up??
Josh C.,"Mahwah, NJ",195,211,142,1.0,3/10/2014,"After yesterdays experience I am never coming back here again.  A piece of cheesecake to go. How long do you think that would take? I mean, this is cheesecake that's already prepared so I would think it's not rocket science to send these things out rapid fire. Over 30 minutes. Yes 30 minutes wait for 1 slice of cheesecake from a place that has cheesecake in the name of the restaurant.  The workers here were clearly irritated. Not just one but the entire team. I'm not sure what this was stemming from. Perhaps they weren't used to the dinner rush or they were short staffed. However, with dozens of people waiting for a slice or two of cheesecake it just baffled me. I was frustrated just watching them trying to figure out how to put a piece into a to-go container.  Normally this place is a bit slow but yesterday just absolutely turned me off from coming here again. Stay away."
Emmanuel U.,"New City, NY",1,22,3,5.0,8/31/2015,"I used to go to the cheese cake factory when I was a child and it was a very glamorous and luxurious restaurant. Now that I'm a full grown adult, I don't know if my perspective on luxury and glamour changed but it honestly looks so bad now. The waiters and waitresses seem like they could care less about being there. The food is poorly prepared. The restaurant is showing signs of age to an extreme level. I probably just have sentimental value in the restaurant, but it's not what it used to be."
Michael S.,"Cornwall, NY",34,9,1,4.0,8/15/2015,Great atmosphere and staff. Good is good for a corporate place. Will definitely be back
Chao L.,"San Francisco, CA",10,9,,5.0,4/14/2015,"Love this shopping mall and this cheesecake factory! We went on a Saturday afternoon and had a wonderful lunch! We got miso glazed salmon with green curry sauce and bang-bang chicken&shrimp. I've been longing for the bangbang chicken for a while, and it tastes so good! I like the milld and flavorful sauce! The miso salmon looks good and also very flavorful! The service was amazing. Love this place!"
Neil P.,"New York, NY",49,131,51,2.0,9/11/2013,"Ok.. I did the mall thing.  Pretty cheesy, but we had nothing else to do. :(  She had the burger, and I had a chicken sandwich on navajo fry bread.  I remember that my sandwich used to be so yummy.  But this time? Meh.   Not only that, we had to wait  those Cheesecake Factory lines and our kids didn't even like their mac and cheese and chicken fingers.  Not sure if I'm returning."
Latasha C.,"Bronx, NY",6,22,21,2.0,5/11/2013,"I'm not going to give a long story about this place b/c it's just not worth my time.    I don't really want to mention names but my waiter (Michael), was totally rude. He practically threw the bread at our table, which we received 20mins after we ordered instead of when he first came to our table. I was turned off from this place at that point. I ordered the shrimp creole. It was good but nothing to cry over.  The whole time we were eating the waiter never came over to ask if we were okay or if we needed something else.  All in all, I will not be returning to this place and due to the bad service I refused to give MICHAEL a tip. I have no problem tipping for good service, not to have bread thrown at me like a pigeon!! Here's a tip for him:  waiter 101, once the party receives their food and has indulged a bit, you should check on them b/c your tip may depend on it and I'm a very good tipper!!"
Rochelle C.,"Stamford, CT",36,303,1211,4.0,12/15/2011,"There's usually a wait whenever we come here but the turn around is quick... I LOVE the frozen iced mango. Calamari appetizer is not to be missed. In terms of entrees, I usually order any of their asian dishes. For some reason, I really like how they make it here!!! Huge portions so there's always left over for lunch the next day."
Alex W.,"Edison, NJ",40,26,2,3.0,10/19/2014,"Sub par food experience especially for a Cheesecake Factory. Some flying gnats, bad  shrimpi scampi and shrimp alfredo.... I would recommend not to go to this place. It's probably an overworked restaurant with people who don't care about their food quality"
Danny G.,"Congers, NY",116,48,4,4.0,3/10/2014,I find that the cheesecake factory is always consistent no matter which one I go to and they do certain menu items extremely well. I usually line to order their Mexican food items. Their Factory Burrito and Chicken Tortillas are two of my favorites. I should have stuck with those on my recent visit. I ordered the Factory burger and was disappointed.  The servers are very attentive and responsive. Overall I enjoyed my experience as usual.
Nicole L.,"Philadelphia, PA",262,493,33,4.0,12/18/2013,"Love coming here, even if they don't take reservations! The service is always friendly. The bread (and butter) delicious and never-ending. The food is pricey (relatively), but quite consistently good. The deep fried and battered veggies are good for the kids (and adults), and I'm always a fan of the chocolate cake. The entrees are generally good, but I'm still sad that they got rid of the BBQ beef ribs. *grumble grumble*. This is still my go-to place for a (relatively) expensive night out."
Mehwish K.,"Atlanta, GA",29,228,14,4.0,11/25/2013,I have never been to a cheesecake factory before but had heard a lot of good reviews so I had high hopes. The location itself is beautiful. We were seated right away even though it looked a little crowded.  I got the veg. burger and my friend the angel shrimp pasta. Both were pretty good. The complimentary bread were fresh and warm. We of course had to get to the cheesecake with strawberry. We decided to share one and couldn't even finish that because it was so rich.  Service was exceptional. The waiter was attentive and friendly ( a bit too much I thought!)
Winnie W.,"Pearl River, NY",240,40,70,4.0,12/18/2013,"Love the food here ! I most of the time order salmon with angel hair, ahi carpaccio and porkchops .. all very delicious . The service is pretty good and the environment is relaxing . The place is always busy and the food is relatively pricey but I would say it's worth it . Their cheesecake slices are huge and delicious . I love the Oreo cheesecake :)"
