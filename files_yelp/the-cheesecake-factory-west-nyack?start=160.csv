Reesie R.,"Manhattan, NY",40,314,50,5.0,9/29/2013,This is for Cheesecake Factory in general.  Hands down the best chain restaurant.  Favorite is the combo dish - chicken madeira and steak diane.  Nom nom.   You must NEVER leave without a slice of cheesecake. :P
C B.,"New City, NY",0,34,,2.0,9/26/2016,"I used to enjoy this location, but I was disappointed the last couple of times we went. I forgot the name of the dish I ordered, but I ordered a chicken dish and my friend ordered a shrimp dish.  They were not supposed to be the same, yet they appeared very much the same except for the obvious chicken versus shrimp.  The chicken on my dish looked like assembly line chicken - like half the chicken dishes on the menu must get that same chicken because it's frozen and and they grab it out of the freezer, toss it in the fryer and then on top of the plate.  More than that, though, is the rushed service.  On at least two different occasions the entrees were brought to the table while we were still working on our appetizers.  That's a pet peeve of mine.  The server never offered to hold the entrees or anything, they just forced the extra plates to fit on a very crowded table.  The last one even suggested I combine the food from two plates onto one in order to make room.  The place may not be fine dining, but it's not cheap, either - turnover should not take priority over a positive customer experience."
S D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,23,31,3.0,4/9/2016,"Place is beautiful kind of reminds me of the Venetian in Vegas inside,beautiful murals on the ceiling,low lighting,plenty of comfortable variety of seating. I sat in a booth next to the window. Wait to be seated was quick, I didn't want my first seating option and requested a booth,waited less than 10 minutes for booth - passed time looking at menu. Service could be more prompt and attentive.  Calamari was average. Eggroll sampler was really good don't remember exact pricing - about 11-13$ each. Pasta with shrimp and sausage again just average-17.50, pasta da Vinci much tastier - about 16.50. Had a coke3.50 but huge glass with unlimited refills.friend had a hot chocolate but not very hot -she sent it back and promptly got a new drink that was warm. Had to request the complementary  bread for table - it wasn't warm. Place is clean and large, bathroom the same as well. I didn't have any cheesecake .overall decent, step up from the usual big chains  (tgi Friday's, Applebee's, UNOS ). Would give 4 stars but 2 adults paid over 80.00 for average food,could pay less for more intimate, tastier, authentic food."
Christopher L.,"Monsey, NY",143,154,189,3.0,2/4/2015,"I consider this place the modern dinner. Big menu that will satisfy everyone. Prices are decent. Food, Drink, and Service are always good. Food has tons of favors. Only thing I'm kinda disappointed about the cheesecake. Why do i want to go the restaurant for frozen cheesecake defrosted. Cheesecake factory doesn't make cheesecakes at the restaurant. They come in frozen. Sad but true. I say its a 3.5 Stars! So close to be 4 Stars!"
Stacey F.,"Brick, NJ",24,97,23,3.0,12/8/2013,"I was at a CF location years ago and I remember eating a ""Navajo"" sandwich and loving it. Apparently it's not on the menu anymore, so this was like a first time visit for me.  We waited for 30 minutes and our buzzer went off. We go inside and then proceed to have to wait in ANOTHER line of people whose buzzers went off. Annoying.  The restaurant is inside the mall. It's too small. 80% of the tables are on top of one another and personally, I don't like being SO close to the tables around us that it's like  eating with another 4 people. On top of that, the chairs are just so damned uncomfortable. We immediately requested to be put in a booth for a. a little more privacy and b. more comfort.  So we moved to a booth nearby. I watched them clean it, however, it was still filthy and sticky and my spoon had a giant piece of pasta stuck to it. Ew! I just wanna say that the menu is WAY too big and WAY too all over the place. We ordered the Buffalo Blast appetizer which was GIGANTIC but eh. My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Madeira which was wonderful and I ordered the burrito which was also way too big. I asked for a box the second she served it, already knowing I couldn't finish it, especially since I knew I wanted a piece of cheesecake.  BF ordered the Oreo Dream cheesecake. He seemed to really like it. I thought it was ok. I ordered the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake and it was DIVINE. However, on the way out we passed the cheesecake case and saw there were a bunch of flavors not on the menu, so definitely check it out during one of your waiting periods, ha! Bathrooms were clean. Our waiter changed half way through because she decided to take a break, so tipping was weird. We ordered all that food and it came to $63, which is less than we thought it would be tbh. Everything seems so expensive.  I think we'll go back for the cheesecake, but not much else."
James G.,"Rye Brook, NY",2,4,,1.0,9/13/2014,"I am usually not a fan if national chains, But Cheesecake Factory is one of the few I enjoy. I have been to CF all over the country, and the one in the Palisades Mall is by far the worst. Food is not consistent and worse yet, the service is horrendous. This happened my previous visit, I and thought it was a fluke. This location is giving the chain a black eye. Not coming back, and telling all my friends."
Isabel J.,"Sunnyside, NY",820,1466,1100,4.0,8/5/2013,"I was shocked there was no wait since there is always a wait at any Cheesecake. I ordered from the lunch menu and I was pleasantly surprise how big the lunch portions were. I had the pecan chicken salad sandwich, soup and salad. I had to take half of It home since the portion was huge and the best part it was only $11."
Aaron A.,"Gravesend, Brooklyn, NY",0,35,,5.0,5/3/2015,So effin amazing. Always taste so good and fresh. Service is pretty good. Come here all the time. Love the bread they give when they first sit you at the table. Huge menu wit a lot of delicious choices.
Amanda D.,"Westchester County, NY",122,129,38,5.0,1/4/2013,I'm never disappointed by the wait staff or delicious food. I love their crusted chicken Romano. The ambiance is fantastic and comfortable seating no matter how crowded it is. This is my favorite chain restaurant.  The only issue is that the Factory doesn't take reservations and always has a very long wait.
G G.,"Maplewood, NJ",16,19,,5.0,1/15/2013,OMG!!!! Best Mac and cheese from a franchise woooow!!!!! This place get my thumbs up
Sadri B.,"White Plains, NY",5000,1934,449,4.0,5/3/2015,"i have always been a fan of ccf ,but the long wait to get seated i am not. i was doing some browsing at the big palisades mall and saw that it was not crowded yet and plenty of booth seating available so lets get busy. as soon as we entered pretty hostess seated us at booth in the back and server lady followed a few minutes later. the decor is typical ccf , booths, tables and bar area with seating for plenty and the ceiling has that cool modern painted sky like mural. now the menu is like a phone book, but not as big as the past, but still big and my fave thing about ccf is the assortment of food choices. american, asian, italian, tex-mex, greek ,etc. the funny thing is that i dont like cheese cake at all, but other desserts are yummy. now  for apps so many picks but i like the tex- mex egg rolls which are delicious and a meal on its own, always fresh and stuffed . the entree is another hard pick with endless choices like the chicken burrito or meatloaf platter, tonight burrito platter, the portions are big.  i an never dissatisfied, and even when i have an issue about food or service its usually rectified. the place is clean and service is on point and friendly. the prices are fair and the place is huge so no feeling of being cramped, which is the norm with every ccf i have visited.  now for dessert i always seem to go with chocolate mousse which is rich and has a creamy texture, i am full and satisfied. the weekends are really crowded at any ccf i have visited, but lately the wait is not too bad, but its worth it regardless. good food with many choices and friendly attentive service with a casual atmosphere, whats not to like."
gary m.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,261,144,3.0,9/8/2014,This is a fancier option compared to your Applebees and Outback chains with grand decor and the waitstaff in all white.  The menu is full of variety so you'll be looking through the menu for a while.  The servings are large except my chili dish could've filled me up some more.  The main draw obviously here is the cheesecake which can be ordered by the slice.  Hopefully you'll have enough space in your stomach to eat this.  Prices are average here so don't be afraid to come here.
Anna K.,"New York, NY",8,30,11,5.0,10/23/2012,"This was my first time eating at the Cheesecake Factory and my oh my do I now know why people rave about it.  We started out with 3 appetizers: avocado spring roll, calamari and corn fritters.  While all 3 were amazing, the one that stood out the most and was the clear winner was the fried avocado spring rolls.  It was just heaven on earth. I had a regular burger (after watching Big Bang Theory - I must try the burger) and it was good - not impressed since it wasn't amazing but it was a good burger. We all shared a tiramisu cheesecake for dessert and it was just heavenly.  I originally wanted the red velvet cheesecake since it's one of their popular dishes but the cake in the bakery area did not match the picture in the menu - there wasn't a good cream cheese icing to cake ratio. Nevertheless, I had a good experience and I will definitely go again!"
Dropkick M.,"West Nyack, NY",132,2,,1.0,1/30/2016,"THIS PLACE WAS TERRIBLE. As a mall employee I placed an order via phone call at 5:37, but didn't receive my food until 6:45 even though I was told it would be a half an hour wait! My coworker and I waited at the desk for 40 minutes for my food, while continuously being told it will take another five minutes. Had I ordered an extravagant set of food I'd understand, but two burgers and a sandwich should NEVER take this long! When I finally got my food it was COLD! I checked the receipt and according to the top where it says what time it came out of the kitchen, and my food was ready BEFORE SIX O'CLOCK. I will never be ordered, or paying any business to this establishment again, hands down one of the most awful experiences I've dealt with in a restaurant in a long time! DO NOT order from Cheesecake Factory, unless you like seven people behind the desk ignoring you and chatting or acting like complete idiots while the one woman helping you disappears for twenty minutes all in the pursuit of mediocre food and a lack luster dinner experience."
Grace P.,"Chester, NY",149,30,3,4.0,7/26/2012,"I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants. I prefer the family-owned/small business type of joints, although I must say that I DO love me some Cheesecake Factory! I recently took a trip down to the Palisades Center Mall and stopped in to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. It was a very pleasant experience! Our waiter, Tom, was wonderful! Totally professional, attentive and knowledgable...oh, and kinda cute too!  My friends and I chose to split a bunch of appetizers and a salad from the new ""diet"" addition to the menu. We got shrimp summer rolls, Asian lettuce wraps, a yummy flatbread and the French country salad. The food was really very good. We will definitely go back...even if it's just so that we can flirt with our cute waiter! :)"
Kalvin R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",220,250,54,2.0,8/21/2012,Floors are disscusting  Probaly the dirtiest CCF ever Food was fine
Neah P.,"Northvale, NJ",51,19,,4.0,11/28/2014,I went there on my second wedding anniversary for lunch. And for the first time since I came here. I loved food and service. They had pretty amazing interior. Little expensive but worth the money. Even the liquor I ordered was of good quality.
Pauline G.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,18,,1.0,3/23/2015,"We had dinner last night right before closing. We would have been out of the door 30 min earlier, if the waiter wasn't dragging around. I understand and have been there, waiters hate last minute parties. But we thanked him for serving us that late, on what he said  ""I'm sure you will do the right thing at the end"". That douchy comment ruined the whole experience and of course we did the right thing at the end! Asshole"
BreeAnna S.,"Ardsley, NY",0,4,2,5.0,1/7/2015,Best cheesecake in the world. Service is great. Really attentive staff and the quesadillas are to die for
Roy W.,"Suffern, NY",54,22,7,3.0,12/28/2014,Great menu selections. Waiting area too small.  Bread plate at table was dirty. Prices are very good as is the food.
