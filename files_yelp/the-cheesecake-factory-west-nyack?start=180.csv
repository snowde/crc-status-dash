Maura D.,"Dobbs Ferry, NY",102,45,428,4.0,12/10/2012,I love their martinis.  You can't go wrong with haft of the menu that is why I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory.
David Z.,"Emerson, NJ",0,1,,1.0,6/26/2016,"If zero stars was an option, I'd choose it.  Mind you this restaurant is in a busy mall and gets very busy for dinner rush, but what restaurant isn't?  My party of 4 (myself, wife and 2 kids) were seated fairly quickly, this was the lone high point of the experience.  The waiter came by and took drink orders and babbled something about waiting on clean glasses, laughing about it as he said it.  It took a solid 10-15 minutes just to bring drinks out.  We ordered our meals.  We had just seen a movie at this mall so I was half full of popcorn and just ordered nachos off the app menu.  My kids got their food (thankfully), my wife got hers, but they told me there was a ""slight mix-up"" with my order and they were rushing it right out...who mixes up nachos?  I wait 5 minutes, 10 minutes, while the waiter cruises by to say they'll be right out.  At the nearly 20 minute mark I wave him over and tell him just to cancel it....everyone was done with their meals and I was done waiting....he actually laughed when I told him to cancel saying how he didn't blame me, he'd have done the same thing...unbelievable.  A manager swooped in very briefly with a half-hearted apology, taking the drinks off our bill and offering free dessert.  Yeah, that's what I want to do...spend more time in this disaster of a restaurant and eat free dessert after not even getting my meal...(by the way, did I mention that they failed to deliver NACHOS???!!)  I just took the check, paid and left without even making eye contact with the waiter or manager.  While we were there, the table to the left of us also got each of their meals at ridiculous intervals, and the table to the right of us waited almost 15 minutes before their waiter even made an appearance at their table.  This franchise needs to stop offering a 45 page menu and invest into a better-trained staff and higher quality service.  I will NOT be returning even though I still have credit on the gift card I used."
Anna P.,"Milton, NY",1,2,,1.0,5/25/2016,"On March 24 the a group of friends and I decided to go to here for dinner at 5:00 we were seated quickly but our waiter was not attentive. Our food was by far very good. But the waiter you can tell was a little frustrated and nasty. We were not checked up on we waited an half hour for cheesecake. Which makes no sense cheese cake is already made all you have to do is cut it and put in on a plate. After he gave us our checks we had three separate checks he asked us how we were splitting it and then got one item wrong. We waited 27 mins for him to come back and fix it. We asked to speak to a manager from a nice lady we saw her walk up to the manager and told him we wanted to see him. He never showed up after we paid my friend spoke to the manager and he said ""that no one spoke to him"". Through the whole dinner the waiter would walk past by us multiple times and not even look our direction. I have never once stayed at a restaurant for more then an hour. We left at 7:30. It would have been quicker if the waiter would just been more attentive and actually listened."
Chica O.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",122,364,14,5.0,2/23/2012,This is my first time eating at this particular Cheesecake Factory. We had about a 30 minute wait for a table. (wasn't to bad) the waitress we had was very attentive and quick. The food was good but the cheesecake is always better. If I'm ever out this way again I would surely revisited.
Allysa P.,"South Ozone Park, NY",213,231,121,4.0,1/13/2012,"Like every other location. Friendly service :) I don't know if its just me, but I feel like their floors are too slippery. I feel like I need sneakers to go eat there lol. Food is always good and who doesnt like to indulge in cheesecake"
Shel B.,"Bronx, NY",60,171,90,4.0,8/27/2012,"Went here  with my fiancee' and our parents for a Sunday night dinner. The queue to get a table is fast and easy, within 5 minutes, we got seated right away. A Plus for me. the place is huge. Our server is nice and efficient. Three of us orderes Steak Diane and Herbed salmon combination, an orange chicken, cheese burger and for appetizer, I ordered Ahi Tuna and Endive salad. I have no complain at all ! The Steak is tender and the mashed garlic potato that comes with it is superb. It goes very well with the steak and salmon. The Orange chicken is good too.  I prefer this location than the one in Ridgehill even though its miles away from me. Its worth my time and travel."
Michelle P.,"Hopewell Junction, NY",55,73,6,5.0,6/22/2014,"The wait is always really  long, however the food is worth the wait. I wish they had a gluten free menu though!"
Robert C.,"Fort Montgomery, NY",113,51,8,4.0,12/31/2011,"The menu is so large that it should have a glossary. It already has chapters for appetizers, seafood, pasta, etc etc. Most menu items are good, but the cheesecake is great! Portions across the board are ginormous.  My favorite tactic is to order cheesecake as an appetizer. Why spoil your appetite with a hearty entry? There is a reason it's called the CHEESECAKE factory. Eat the cheesecake first and take home the rest of your food, or just order a real appetizer as an entry."
Mister A.,"New York, NY",0,65,2,3.0,6/29/2014,The food is not bad. They really need to work on the service. It took a very long time to get a table and then it took an even longer time to get the food served. The drinks we watered down. And the food was warm by the time it came out. You have to keep on top of them or you will be there forever. The waiters are friendly but very slow and forgetful. The only thing that saves them is the food which is not bad. And of course the amazing cheek cake and desserts.
Mike M.,"Valley Cottage, NY",2,10,,1.0,8/28/2013,Terrible food and the entire place is filthy. I went here to eat and the floor was a mess  we were then brought to our table and it was still filthy from the last people who sat there. The food was awful in case I forgot to mention that and when we complained about it nothing was done. The worst thing about it was on the way out we saw a dead rat near the front entrance. DISGUSTING
Chas F.,"Tampa, FL",22,268,41,5.0,12/28/2011,"Love all the cheesecake factories!  The French country salad is a must for me! I love the sweet corn cakes, avocado rolls, orange chicken, chicken picatta, chicken belliago, chicken tacos, Kobe burger, hibachi steak. It's all good, I've never had anything bad here. And of course the cheesecake!!! My fav is the classic with strawberries! But I'd try any of them!"
B G.,"New York, NY",383,154,30,3.0,6/13/2012,"3 stars due to slow service...consistently.   3 starts due to an extensive, creative, and delicious menu. 3 stars, you could just order a bunch of small plates with a group of friends."
Christine L.,"Parsippany, NJ",36,63,52,4.0,6/15/2011,"I've been to several Cheesecake Factory's and I deem this one is the best I've gone to so far. The service is great (despite the long assed wait) and attentive and the food is always good here.  Unfortunately, the one near me at Willowbrook Mall isn't nearly as good in quality of food which is a bummer so we need to drive a little farther to get good food.   Our favorite salad is the Fresh Vegetable Salad.  It's a huge portion and it's easily shared by 3-4 people.  My favorite entree is only offered at this location - the Pan-Seared Salmon.  It's a piece of salmon, pan-seared perfectly on top of a bed of spinach with mushroom and caper lemon sauce and served with angel hair pasta.  So divine!  And at a price of 14.95, it is truly worth it.   Dessert:  Of course you must get the cheesecake.  That's like sacrilege if you don't at least get a piece to go.  The red velvet is a favorite and I just tried the Dulce de Leche over the weekend.   So yummy! I ordered a pizza under the kid's menu for about $5 which comes with a juice or milk.  I swear, that pizza was larger than a personal pan pizza.  Very worth it! And it was very good, too!  We ate what my kid couldn't eat. I would order that, if I could, for a snack or something. ;)"
Eric R.,"Woodcliff Lake, NJ",40,3,,4.0,9/15/2012,"Oh Man! Ginormous portions. The service was great. They said we had a 5 to 10 minute wait. Actually what the hostess meant was that we had a 5 to 10 second wait.  Food was great and the desert was indulgent. It was great to be in a mall to walk out the food hangover to be. I had the Buffalo Blast which were spicy and fried to a crisp.  I had the Pasta with Garlic sauce which was fantastic. It was well balanced with the chicken, shrooms, and peas.  I recommend!"
Alexander A.,"San Diego, CA",69,55,4,4.0,8/12/2011,"I didn't think it was possible, but they have made a chocolate cheesecake even better than Godiva! and that is the incredible Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake, I couldn't stop thinking about it and that was 3 weeks ago! I have become a fiend."
Olivia L.,"New York, NY",1,20,,4.0,8/28/2011,"The food and service is usually good. Sometimes there's a long wait, but that's to be expected of busy restaurants with a large clientele. Servers are usually very friendly, if a bit slow sometimes in getting refills and dessert.  I usually order the Crusted Chicken Romano, which is consistently good. The chicken is coated and then fried, and served with spaghetti that's lightly coated in tomato sauce. Yummy!!  The slices of cheesecake are decadent -- sometimes there's a little too much whipped cream on top. At $7-8 a slice, you're better off just getting an entire cake to take home!"
Nat W.,"Kapolei, HI",241,1882,1401,3.0,9/24/2009,"I have been to Cheesecake Factory in other areas a couple times before but never been to this one in Palisades. I took my sister from Japan after shopping at the mall, thinking this place might be good for her to experience a typical American food.   We ordered appetizer Calamari and a Red Velvet cheese cake to share....That was more than enough for both of us and we still could not finish them all.  This is exactly what I was looking for....Huge portioned food with tons of fat and sugar lol   The calamari was tasty and the red velvet cheesecake was okay.  Definitely not my favorite....my favorite cheesecake always has been Tiramisu flavor.  I just hope we can lessen the portion and the price so that I can actually enjoy from an appetizer to a dessert."
Kim N.,"Nanuet, NY",28,70,9,4.0,11/13/2013,"Love coming to this Cheesecake Factory. The servers are always so pleasant and helpful. Never had a bad experience here, the food is amazing. And they have they always give their honest opinions on what foods are better than others. The only downfall is the wait most of the time to just get seated, but it's typically not that long for a smaller party. Would recommend calling ahead for reservations if it's near dinner time and you know you want to eat here."
Tish F.,"Middletown, NY",42,28,,3.0,3/14/2014,"There was a point in time where this was our go to ""Oh look we're at the Palisades"" dinner place...it was a simpler time, and one that I remember fondly.  We never had a bad experience, or a particularly bad meal - but there are just so many better choices.  I'm sure we'll go back from time to time - with friends who will share cheesecake.."
sarah e.,"Charlotte, NC",162,209,37,2.0,9/12/2011,"I normally wouldn't have even considered eating here but since we were in a mall in a suburban sprawl why not, right?  The service was great and the food was just what I expected : over salted and greasy. Oh well.  Perhaps I should have just had cheesecake :-/"
