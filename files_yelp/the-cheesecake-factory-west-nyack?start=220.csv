Kelly M.,"Tarrytown, NY",7,60,15,5.0,2/24/2012,"Love TCF!  Huge menu..  great bread... great atmosphere.  The staff at the Palisade's Center CF is very friendly.  Weekends get pretty crowded, and there is usually a wait.  If you don't like crowds or waiting its best to go on a weeknight.  If you don't have room for cheesecake you can always take it to go =)  I often buy people gift cards here, and they are always pleased to receive!"
Jay E.,"Goshen, NY",21,48,6,5.0,2/10/2012,"Loveeeeed it! On my engagement, it was amazing! and I have returned a few times after, the food is more delicious than most restaurants!"
Jennifer D.,"Bronx, NY",131,151,7,3.0,4/10/2011,"It's a Cheesecake Factory, much like any other Cheesecake Factory. Do know that on any Thursday Night - Sunday Afternoon, you NEED reservations."
Aaron C.,"Fort Lee, NJ",118,13,2,5.0,3/20/2014,"I really love this place. All of their food is delicious, portion size is good, and cost isn't to bad.  I love going here for dinner and usually get chicken and biscuits or some pasta dish.  Their bread they serve before the meal is really good.  It is always hot and fresh.  Beside dinner, i went there for brunch for the first time and i have to say they didn't have many choices for breakfast but you can pick basically anything on the menu.  Their french toast is awesome.  So fluffy with powdered sugar and strawberries.  They serve big slices of bread to you, (2 pieces, but 4 pieces when cut in half) along with a choice of french fries, roasted potatoes.  price isn't an issue.  average cost per person would be around 10-15 bucks depends on what you order.  The service is really good, respectful, always ask about how the food is.  Lets not forget what they are known for, cheesecake! Definitely worth the price because their serving sizes are really big, with whip cream on it as well. You will leave satisfied and wanting to come back another day."

Andre P.,"Wayne, NJ",0,6,,2.0,5/10/2014,"I had to write a review.    The food is typically good at Cheesecake's so this is not about the food The  service at this particular one was terrible.  The staff at the front counter were more interested in socializing amongst themselves rather than servicing the customers waiting to be checked in.   Staff were walking around checking cellphones and texting where we had to walk around them in the walkways as they were so focused on their phones.      Dining out should be a pleasant experience for each and every diner.    We are paying good money for that experience and creating jobs as a result of it.   I would recommend that management lock up phones in a locker or changing room.    If there is ever an emergency, they can get a phone call at the restaurant.   The customers should be attended to with smiles and courteous service.   If the staff is unhappy with their jobs, I am sure there are better candidates willing to take their places.     I hope management sees this post and does something about it as I do like the food there.  Thank you Andre"
Hector M.,"Jersey City, NJ",525,513,2227,5.0,1/22/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory is my kryptonite.  It doesn't matter how long the hostess tells me the wait is (expect 40 minutes to an hour on Saturday), I will happily agree to wait everytime.  I'll sit amongst the crowded masses and ""people watch"" to pass the time.  When I finally get seated, I devour the brown bread/butter and read their massive menu like a novel.  You can't go wrong with anything, but here are some of my favorites: Appetizer:  - Avocado Eggrolls Entrees:  - Louisiana Chicken Pasta - Farfalle with Chicken - Chicken and Biscuits - Cajun Chicken Littles (think I like chicken?) Dessert: Craig's Crazy Carrotcake Cheesecake"
Matt W.,"New City, NY",0,18,,2.0,2/21/2014,Consistently the worst Cheesecake Factory in the area. Service is awful & it always takes forever to receive meals (even when the restaurant is not busy). Last time I ate there I had a beautiful piece of plastic on the inside of my sandwich (management claimed it was from the bag that they put their bread in). Either way it was gross.
Bryan B.,"East Stroudsburg, PA",18,68,17,4.0,1/15/2012,It was my first time here.  At this site the wait was about an hour.  But it was well worth it.  Try the Buffalo Blast.  The Kuala CO-CO Cheesecake was amazing!.
Fred J.,"Stony Point, NY",1,18,,2.0,8/8/2014,"I'll start off by saying I've been going to this restaurant since it opened and I always like it.  Went there recently and I gotta say that the place has really gone down hill. It was a hot summer night so a nice air conditioned restaurant was what we were looking for, but this place was warm and stuffy.  It also wreaked of stale food.  We were somewhat acknowledged by a server at the front desk but he kind of ran away.  A host then came by and sat us.  We were brought to a table that was wiped down just in the center. (I know this because it was still wet). There were crumbs on the rest of the table.  Dirty silverware, sticky seats, a fly buzzing around, the place was filthy.  My wife drinks wine and always enjoyed their selection.  We'll that's gone, the entire wine list was cut in half.  I ordered a beer and it came in a warm pint glass. Food was okay.  I had some sort of shrimp and chicken with curry and rice.  (Bang bang chicken?). The rice was below room temp and there was a film on the curry sauce like it was baking underneath a heat lamp.  I'm guessing they added cold rice right before it went out. Wife had salmon that was bland.  We decide on cheesecake, so we ordered the key lime to go.  We get home and the thing is a mess.  And I'm not sure it was cheesecake, I think it was just key lime pie.  The bathrooms were disgusting too.  The fact that the place was so dirty was alarming.  I'm guessing they are feeling the effects of The Yard House being upstairs and have cut labor to deal with the lost of sales.  I'll stay away from that mall all together.  BTW the servers that took care of us were great, so you can always be assured you get good service there."
Michael R.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,,4.0,3/11/2014,"The food is good and reasonably priced. They don't take reservations, so the wait can be long. Their bread is excellent. The Thai lettuce wraps are great. Their chicken salad sandwich is very good too. Of course, their cheesecake is to die for."
Audrey D.,"Yonkers, NY",4,45,2,4.0,12/17/2010,"I would go more often it were closer to me.  The food is great and the place is impeccable.  The prices are very reasonable, I guess a few reviewers have never dined downtown Manhattan."
Jenna A.,"Westchester, NY",2,59,,4.0,6/29/2010,"Almost received the full five - but we waited awhile for our pager thing to go off, then when it did, they put our party of 4 in another waiting section... I have to wait twice?? Forgot all about this though when it came to the great service we received and delicious food & dessert. DELICIOUS - have to go, even if just for the dessert, and they have plenty to choose from, so go already!"
Cliff R.,"Bridgewater Township, NJ",74,34,4,4.0,10/11/2011,"I know, I know - what are you going to get at the Cheesecake Factory.  Well: first the wait staff was amazing.  We changed orders, made substitutions, changed things last minute, got our drinks right away - so for wait staff...two thumbs up.  For food: I really enjoyed what I got.  Hey, it's not gourmet cuisine - it's the cheesecake factory.  However, I really thought what they gave me was tasty and yes, I had the cheesecake and it was excellent.  Overall, a good experience as long as you go in with the right expectations."
Darius K.,"Commack, NY",7,35,,3.0,5/6/2008,"Are you really checking Yelp for Cheesecake Factory reviews?  Well, since you're here, the thing to note about this specific Cheesecake Factory is that there is never a wait for a table for breakfast or their Sunday Brunch. Which means that this fat-ass can enjoy his Monte Cristo's in peace."
Johanna N.,"Yonkers, NY",0,10,,2.0,12/23/2013,"Came for my birthday drove 45 minutes. Busy Sunday, bathrooms were gross. No toilet paper or soap! Sat down for dinner ordered appetizers. Half way through eating them, a glass of soda just busted for no reason. Waitress rushed over to help clean up. She stated this sometimes happens from too much ice? We changed tables and they brought out our food. Dinner was great but after all that they had the nerve to charge me for the appetizers which were ripped off the table before we could eat them. I asked to speak to the manager. I at least wanted to get a discount. I didn't feel like it was fair. Well the waiter comes back and says the manager doesn't feel like coming down unless its really necessary. He handed me a revised bill and they removed two appetizers out of the 6 we ordered. I would have thought a manager could have and should have handled this more professional.  I was pretty disappointed. I don't think we will be going there again."
Chad M.,"Bronx, NY",6,21,1,3.0,3/22/2011,Great place to eat ... good service and flavorsome food. Also being the cheesecake Factory they have over 75 different types of cheesecake ... I have been here and to the one in White plains many times and must say altho it can be a little pricey its worth it ... Love the Shephards Pie ... MMMM YUMMY !!!
Joe G.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,9,1,3.0,4/29/2011,"The food was good, but I think I was let down after all the hype about this place. Desert was great, I had Godiva brownie sundae, but that credit goes more towards Godiva than the cheesecake factory. the service at this place though wasn't good at all, so that put a damper on things too. Not a place I'd go out of my way to get to, but if I'm in the area I'd go back."
Matthew H.,"Menlo Park, CA",77,442,84,4.0,9/20/2010,"This was my first time back to Cheesecake in 8+ years, it was a long wait and a happy return. We skipped appetizers and munched on the fresh bread & butter while we waited for our food. I had the Chicken Bellagio (sans basil) and my dining companion had the restaurant favorite Chicken Madeira (w/ mashed potatoes). Both dishes were large portions (enough for maybe 2 meals, in fact we had the remainders for lunch the next day). Naturally we were saving room for the cheesecake. We were too full to finish them but we ordered the Caramel pecan turtle & Wild blueberry cheesecake. Both delicious. Our waitress was fast (several water refills) and friendly (service with a smile). This restaurant represented the chain well."
Bobbie D.,"Clifton, NJ",1,6,,1.0,11/20/2013,This place is the dirtiest restaurant around. You can see the streaks of dirt on the wood walls.  It's like they used a dirty kitchen rag to clean the place down.   100's of flying bugs all over the kitchen area.  My waitress was embarrassed when she watched me drown fruits flies in my soup and squished them in my fries.  I tried to address this with management and he denied any bug problem and blew me off like I was disturbing him.  Management should be fired for having a dirty restaurant and for treating customers like trash.
