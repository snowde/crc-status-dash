Carole W.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,1,,1.0,8/31/2013,"TERRIBLE SERVICE.  I went there for a late lunch today.  It was quiet and the food was fine, but the service from start to finish was horrendous.  Despite the fact I was there with my elderly father (who has a cane) the young hostess walked us far back...and, when I asked if we could sit by a booth near the entrance, she asked us to return to the hostess station (walking my father again).  Lots of attitude.  Our server (who was very upbeat) missed at every point.  Our entrees arrived before the appetizer (20 minutes after our order--did I mention the restaurant was quiet).  We told them to cancel the appetizer.   When it was time for dessert and coffee--another long delay.  We would have cancelled it but we couldn't find our waiter.  While drinking our coffee, the waiter came by a few times--the final time to ask why we were still sitting at our table--he chuckled as he thought he forgot something again.  The icing on the cake was when I was leaving, there was a line in the ladies room because all of the stalls had run out of toilet paper and the hostess was in there refilling them. From start to finish...a terrible experience.  At least the food was good. I don't normally write reviews, but I am sharing this because I hope that management sees this as an opportunity to improve your customer service."
Mike G.,"Somers, NY",0,23,,1.0,2/21/2011,"Hadn't been to this locale in about a year, and was very disappointed. Always loved the large fresh tasting dinner salads, but ours came about 5 minutes after our wine was served.  They tasted like they were dumped from a big bucket,.wet and limp.  If we wanted fast food we could have gone to McDonalds.  Didn't try dessert, as we were just too annoyed.  Cheesecakes are usually terrific.  Also these chains noteworthy for their cleanliness but this one had some kind of slimy film all over the floor.  My sneakers kept sliding.  Too bad, I'll travel to the White Plains location next time until someone tells me otherwise."
Ralph B.,"New York, NY",6,12,1,2.0,2/21/2011,"Totally disappointed. Very expensive prices for such mediocre food. The pulled pork sandwich was awful and the baha chicken tacos were tasteless but at least the Buffalo wings were good. Atmosphere is nice, the waiters are pretty good but foodwise  its just not worth it."
Paul C.,"Bronx, NY",9,79,,2.0,11/3/2009,I am usually a big Cheesecake factory fan but I must say that this is the second time at this location that I have experienced a sub par meal. I had the Kobe Beef Burger which was surprisingly very ordinary. One of my pet peaves was the crappy bun that they used which fell apart as you work your way around the burger. The beef itself was not that tasty either. I have had much better Kobe beef than this. They used a fancy pungent mushroom on this burger which overpowered the taste of the meat and made me a bit nauseous as well. They also topped it with shredded iceberg lettuce...I could not figure that one out. The fries were also loaded with salt. I think this location is slipping and I will probably stick to the one in White Plains from now on.
Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",761,2185,1699,5.0,8/26/2009,"4.5 stars...This is my first experience with the Cheesecake Factory. I had always thought it was just a place to get Cheesecake, in fact it's a high end chain restaurant (the next step above chains like Applebees). My only two issues with this place is that the portions are way out of hand and that the menu is unrealistically large. I actually can't stand how many pages the menu is, it's nearly impossible for someone like me who likes almost everything on the menu and is bad at making decisions, it takes half the night just to read through it. Anyway everything I've tried from the menu is great and the atmosphere is beautiful. The prices are reasonable and the location is very convenient here at the Palisades Mall."
Stefan W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,,1.0,3/16/2012,"It was my mother's birthday, so me and my older brother decided to invite some of the family to dinner. We have had great  dining experiences at the cheesecake factory and  we. Thought it would be an appropriate venue.  We chose a central location from everyone which turned out to be the restaurant in west nyack at the palisades mall. The 1hr and 15 min wait was not so much an issue since it was indeed Friday and we were a relatively large group (12 altogether). After we finally got our seats we made our orders for drinks and appetizers, this went relatively smoothly.  Then came the entrees, everyone made their order with salmon being the majority of orders made. Within about 15 mins the waiter came back and said there was no more salmon.  The manager even came over to give an explanation for the shortage, which was understandable.  My concern is why isn't there some sort of compensatory policy in place when individuals are forced to eat something they did not desire.  Everyone told me instead of complaing we should have just left but I feel compelled to let the corporate individuals know that there is a need for some sort of appeasement to customers especially if they are giving such a considerable contribution to the business. Now I understand the manager doesn't really how we feel since they are always packed and make decent profits, but when customers are not completely satisfied they have failed as a food service provider.  We spent $458 and I know t isn't an exorbant amount f money it s still substantial and some appreciation should be shown. Ther are a number if locations offering similar quality food in that vicinity and experiences such as thing may shy away customers in the future."
Marilyn S.,"Bronx, NY",33,4,,1.0,3/24/2014,I am so upset at the service.I have received from this CHEESECAKE FACTORY I hardly ever take the time t write a review but I am going to do so this time. I went there yesterday with my family and had such a horrible time. First they were very understaffed for  Sunday brunch. We arrived there around 1:00 pm we sat down and met our waiter...he took our drinks order and didn't see him again for twenty minutes and mind you all we ordered were sprites. When he arrived with that he took our meal orders 45 minutes later our meals arrived cold and when asked to speak t the manager we didnt see him instead he came out with all the food piping hot STRAIGHT FROM THE MICROWAVE he never came to see what the problem was never came to ask us what happened just assumed we wanted microwaved food. Now the people behind us had the same issue but they actually got to speak to the manager and also got fresh not microwaved food when they stated they had a problem. I have come here numerous times and never have i been treated as i was this time and I WAS NOT HAPPY WITH MY EXPERIENCE the wait staff on manage on sunday were horrible and this particular cheesecake factory has lost a loya customer in ME NEVER WILL I GO BACK HERE EVER
diana m.,"Brooklyn, NY",135,807,,4.0,3/31/2009,"Don't tell Junior's but this just might be my favorite place to order cheesecake.  They have so many different cheesecakes that I don't think I've ever had the same one twice. As far as food my favorite thing to order off the menu are the burgers.  They are just huge, I think the biggest ones I've ever eaten.  Thank god they aren't any near where I live or I'd put on a ton of weight."
Vince D.,"New Windsor, NY",15,153,,4.0,3/15/2009,Great food and service.  Nice place to go.  One of the best places in the mall.  Terrific menu.
peter h.,"Middletown, NY",0,17,,2.0,12/4/2010,"After having Junior's cheesecake, well what can I say... This is good if you think a Whopper is a good burger, Pizza Hut makes great pizza, etc. It is edible. It will not make you sick. You'll never see me there."
Victor K.,"Nanuet, NY",32,39,,1.0,10/18/2006,I like the Cheesecake Factory restaurants. The one at the Palisades Center is disappointing. The food is just not up to par with the other restaurants in the chain. Order the Chicken pesto here and its just a green oily overcooked pasta with grilled chicken. Order it at the Cheesecake Factory in Paramus NJ and its much better. I've been to Cheesecake Factories all over. The one in Rockland sucks.
Ben H.,"Fishkill, NY",1,12,,4.0,7/20/2008,"Better than the reviews led me to believe. First time at a cheesecake factory and I thought it was wonderful. The parking sux, but the food and service were great!"
Johnny V.,"San Diego, CA",1,28,,1.0,1/4/2009,I'm giving it 1 star because the wait was the worst I've ever seen at a cheescake factory in my life for a regular friday night.
Ali H.,"Bronx, NY",6,91,,4.0,10/5/2005,"Only been here once, but can't wait to go back. I went with co-workers and it was lots of fun. It's a real feel good place with delicious food, and the cheescake....yum!"
