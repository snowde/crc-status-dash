D D.,"Weehawken, NJ",57,36,,2.0,9/12/2017,"An Trip to the mall with our two boys and a toddler, we figured why not TCF so we popped in on a Saturday for lunch. Wasn't crowded so tht was a bonus, we were greeted by friendly host and seated within 10min. Place is huge and very nice, waitress was friendly and attentive so service was  good- one knock, she did throw away our plate of quesadillas thinking I wanted it taken away.. she shld have asked first. when I chased her down She had already tossed them but did ask if we wanted another plate which we declined. No price reduction either. When u have a toddler you try to not waste too much time in public places. Food was soso not great.. ribeye steak was thin, kinda dry on the outside but the steak was pink on inside not sure why. Boys had salad and a spaghetti which we're ok. Wife had a salad though there was more to be desired...on top of that it's expensive. All said it cost us $100 for the mentioned plates. If Prices are high the food better be top notch. I know my wife still tipped her decent..We won't be popping in here anytime soon..so loss of stars wld be the prices, tossed plate of food and so so tasting food."

Dani S.,"Paramus, NJ",144,159,325,3.0,2/4/2016,"It's an option to come to if you are at Palisades but even then not the best one. The Cheesecake Factory is exactly that - a food factory. While they are known for their huge menu - nothing on that menu ever leaves a lasting impression. Don't get me wrong - the food is not bad and you can find something on the menu no matter what you are in the mode for BUT it's just nothing special. Last time I went was on a Saturday night pre going bowling at the mall with friends. We picked Cheesecake Factory mainly because we were all in the mood to eat different things that night. The service is SLOW!! They could make so much more money (especially on drinks haha) if they just stepped it up a little and checked back more regularly on the tables.  They start you off with a basket of bread - which actually is warm and fresh and yummy. We ordered two salads and a rice dish. No one had any complaints about their food but I can only speak for my own.  I ordered the Seared Tuna Salad - The tuna was deep red and fresh BUT a little ""veiny"" - so not the best cuts of fish. The dressing was good but nothing too special. Overall it leaves you wanting more. They just throw the Tuna on a plate with salad leaves and a side of dressing. Nothing else really. I would like to maybe see some other ""greens"" within the salad.  Go here if you can't decide what you want to eat and are with a group of people. It is solid but nothing that will leave you wanting more."
Raven G.,"Nanuet, NY",5,65,43,5.0,10/6/2016,Went to the Cheesecake Factory last night and this place never disappoints! Our server Eric was awesome always around and asking if we wanted anything. He was also knowledgeable about anything on the very large menu. I had the Louisiana chicken which is amazing and started with the Tex mex egg rolls so good!!!!! You have got to come here there is definitely something for everyone!!!!!
Mo M.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,10,,2.0,3/24/2017,"Dear Cheesecake Factory Social Media Representative, I am coming back for the first day in years to complete a favorite past time at the mall with dinner and a movie at the Palisades Center in West Nyack, NY. One of the last few times I was there I was sad to learn that my favorite Cheesecake had been discontinued. Chocolate Coconut Cream. In anticipation of my return this weekend, I scoped the menu and am again to find that another one my favorites items has been discontinued. The Luau Salad. Please stop taking away some of my favorite guilty pleasures. Please bring them back. Please."
Diana P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,20,4.0,7/3/2016,"Had dinner over the Independence Day weekend. The place was loaded, however, we were able to get seated around 15mins. Ordered tacos, meatloaf, a salad, and pasta. Food there was very nice. I would give the salad 5 stars, But the meatloaf is wayyyyyyy toooooo salty 2 stars.The pasta is just soso, 3 stars. Our waiter is very nice and friendly～"
Brianna G.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",3,2,,2.0,4/29/2017,"I had a really bad experience the service was terrible, and the waitress forgot the majority of the stuff we asked for. Food was okay but the majority of it was either dry or cold.Would not come back here again"
Beth J.,"Downtown, Atlanta, GA",0,12,,2.0,9/10/2016,"When meeting my best friend, this is our go to lunch spot. Love a great salad to go with a long conversation. This time the lettuce could have been fresher. My friend just picked the wilted dead stuff off & put it aside so that we could enjoy the visit. When we mentioned it to our very lovely server, she promptly sent the manager. She explained why she hadn't sent the meal back & asked if the bill could be slightly adjusted. He said he'd do it ""this time "" and advised us that next time might be different. Didn't care for that condescending tone. We tipped the waitress generously & hope she doesn't get further grief from him.  Well, ""next time"" my review might be different!"
Dori K.,"New York, NY",104,8,2,1.0,3/18/2017,"Just left.  Us being a party of five thought there might be a small wait.  After 3 parties of two and 3 and 2 parties of 4 were seated we started our 2 min rule.  Set timer and in 2 minutes we walk out.  The hostess did nothing to make us feel welcome.  This was at 1315 on 3/18.   Hope she gets fired.  Just left yardhouse and the food, drinks were impeccable!!"
Klim K.,"Fort Lee, NJ",717,241,2087,2.0,8/12/2015,Everything is salty! Don't let them seat you in the very back as there is nobody working there. We had to ask a waitress from a different section to help us.  She was great! But I felt bad that she ran back from her section and to us.  Didn't have a good experience at all.  The chicken wings were made of salt.  The fettuccini Alfredo was salty as can be.  Salt salt salt! Loanne was great!! She really did try!
Ilan F.,"New York, NY",0,261,134,5.0,4/12/2017,"This restaurant has a wide selection of appetizers, main dishes, and desserts.  I liked the chocolate fudge cake for dessert."
Steven N.,"Toms River, NJ",45,13,1,3.0,3/20/2017,Food was ok Service was horrible  My son ordered a burger and they couldn't get that he wanted onion and lettuce  They brought him scallions  Really Not impressed for an hour wait and 160 bill
Paulina M.,"Spring Valley, NY",0,8,,5.0,3/11/2017,Monica made a amazing strawberry martini! I had a spinach and cheese dip which was very good and cheesecake with Nutella my god out of this world ! Love you Monica and love you Cheesecake Factory !
Dan F.,"Ringwood, NJ",0,63,11,4.0,4/24/2016,"Way too many menu options. Though I will admit that almost everything I've had there, this time the Spicy Cashew Chicken, has been really, really good. I wish they would put the calorie counts next to all of the meal options, as opposed to just the ""skinnylicious"" menu, as I'm sure this wasn't the healthiest choice (I'm not sure choosing brown rice over white even really helped here). Friendly service. Complimentary bread that's warm and tastes good. The green tea, while a little overpriced, is delicious and free refills is always a plus. This is one of the few places where I'll order a non-water drink other than a beer. Meal servings are big enough to take home for another meal, which is nice. Overall a really enjoyable experience for me and the gf, and a place we'd definitely go again for a casual date night."
Jessica P.,"New York, NY",350,214,5,3.0,9/10/2015,"I didn't know that the quality/taste of various Cheesecake Factory restaurants could differ so much. We were seated right away, but service was SO SLOW. The restaurant had less than 10 tables full, yet it took about 20 minutes for someone to take our order. Paying took even more time...... Even worse, our waiter was everywhere except our area! He said the bare minimum, and often just left dishes on the table without saying a word.  The dishes were mediocre, to say the least. There were barely any chicken in the pasta, and if any, they were burnt and crumbly. (Everything chicken shouldn't be.) The avocado eggrolls were whatever- they fell apart easily and weren't even crispy. The popped rice noodles that lay underneath the egg rolls were obviously old and tough, instead of being crisp and light. Will not be returning to this location."
Druscilla O.,"West Nyack, NY",0,1,,5.0,2/19/2017,"We almost didn't come here because of the numerous negative reviews, but from start to finish, our Sunday brunch experience was delightful.  Our server, Alfredo, was warm, personable, and attentive.  The beef medallions in the Madeira sauce were cooked to perfection and the almond crusted kale salad was flavorful and delicious.   The restaurant is very clean.  All in all, a five star experience."
Jaak L.,"Nanuet, NY",27,22,31,1.0,12/18/2016,Terrible service for Sunday brunch.   Waitress took our order and then followed up minutes later saying our food should be right out.  Forty five minutes later a manager came and apologized and said our food was coming right out. Half of the order came right out and even that was wrong.  This place is staffed by inexperienced servers and the managers are made to out fires out with the customers.  After an hour everyone in our party got food(whether it was what you ordered or not).
Debra S.,"Congers, NY",0,2,1,5.0,2/1/2017,my goodness! i am the little  lady who can only look in at all the people enjoying your temptations. i am the the little lady that perhaps someday will be able to afford to dine with you  enjoy!
Ashly B.,"New York, NY",871,81,152,1.0,3/23/2015,"Only been here a handful of times and yesterday will be the last time. I understand that it was Sunday brunch, but to wait almost thirty minutes for a waiter after being seated who only showed up after my party asked management what was going on is ridiculous for any time of day. We only saw our waitress one other time while we were there, and that was when she came to drop off the check. Never asked how the food was.  Side note: this has nothing to do with the review, just saying, if you have children and you know they don't behave well in restaurants, please don't bring them until their behavior improves. The woman sitting at the next table had three children with her who would not sit still. I was kicked several times by her son because was climbing over his seat and laying down with his feet up as if he was at home. Her daughter kept switching seats and at one point her hair was almost on my plate (I was finished eating at this point, but still!) again, this is not the fault of the restaurant, just ranting."
Justin L.,"Worcester, MA",202,20,2,1.0,12/29/2016,"Perhaps the worst restaurant experience I have ever had coming from someone who rarely complains. We sat down for a quick lunch at 2:40 in the afternoon and off the bat waited 10 minutes before getting acknowledged. Our waitress Monica finally took our order at this point. The surrounding tables in the bar area where we were seated started too full up and we had noticed all of those tables getting drinks and food far before we did. All in all our experience ended with our appetizer arriving 30 minutes late, 20 minutes to get a refill, and after 50 minutes with no food asking for a manager for me to pay for our drinks and app. The manager took the entrees off our bill and after an hour gave us our food in to go boxes. One of meals in the to go boxs was not what we ordered. Awful"
