Xavier V.,"Bronx, NY",7,27,18,3.0,7/24/2016,"Overall good place to eat but the service is bad.... our waitress ignored us most of the time then brought out the food incorrectly. I feel bad for the GM because he/she is trying to run a business but the employees aren't doing a great job.... message to employees, businesses want to make more money while you make money. If you give your tables alot of attention people will buy more thus helping the business and increasing your tip. The burrito was great and the avocado club sandwhich was amazing  service has to pick up."
Andrea F.,"North Miami Beach, FL",78,31,3,1.0,12/3/2016,"I wish this cheesecake  was more consistent  with the service and quality of food. I come here often because I work at the mall but unfortunately  the palisades doesn't have many options, specially for late dinners. So my boyfriend  and I come here frequently  and I fell in love with the sweet corn tamales, and of course tonight I ordered them. The server or runner who brought them dropped all the sauces on my boyfriend's  shirt, and pants, and she didn't even bother to help cleaning. She offered to bring the sauce she dropped, but she never did. The bartender didn't even asked. It all was cool to them. I can't belive they would pay loyalty to the customers this way.i feel like I won't be able to enjoy the tamales but there's no other choice but to make them myself.  Thumbs down, to managers for not caring and just hanging out.  For the bartender for not giving a dime, and for the runner  who in other words, sucks."
David A.,"Ramsey, NJ",81,36,277,2.0,1/28/2016,"A busy Mall Sunday, Location had a great waitress, Oreo Cheesecake, salads and turkey burger but with a couple annoyances brings it down a couple of stars. We sat in the bar area, which in IMHO has better ambience, nicer, cleaner and brighter than the booths in the back of the house. The front end does not have a beeper or text alert system for when your table is ready which means the hostesses shout out your name. If you are not within earshot you lose out or it takes them 5 minutes to locate the party which is a waste of everyone's time. I liked my turkey burger but it arrived thirty minutes after my friend's dinner salad. Also in the past visits, the table top and menu were sticky and the seating was poor in the back. I was relieved that this time the menu was clean but it had a long hair inside. The star of the show was the Cheesecake."
Gigi C.,"East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY",37,79,227,3.0,3/28/2016,"I'm updating my review because the second time around the food was good, not great but good. Everything else is the same as far as slippery floors, long wait, service etc.... See previous review!"
MS D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,24,5,5.0,8/6/2016,"Had a server named Erik who was EXCELLENT! Kind, knowledgeable, classy, timely, excellent service all from Erik! He made dining at the chain feel like a 5-star restaurant meal! We will be back-Thank You"
Kathy G.,"Blauvelt, NY",10,6,,1.0,12/3/2016,"My husband and I went to this location   birthday dinner. Got there around 4:30 pm for an early dinner. Gave our name to the hostess and given an approx time of 15 min. Noticed that people who came after us were seated first with the same number in their party. Very, very disorganized. Previous time, after we were seated, 15-20 min went by and no one came to acknowledge us. We got up and left. Walked out 2x. Are all Cheesecake Factory restaurants run like this? Why the dark, low lighting? Do they not want you to see the food? I'll  pass."
Meera C.,"Baltimore, MD",4,1,,1.0,7/21/2016,"This is the worst cheese cake factory I have ever eaten at. I sat for more than 10 mins and I had to ask the hostess ""is there a waiter assigned to my table"" and finally the waitress shows up. She did not get any of my order right. Almost dropped the southwest egg rolls on me and said ""you would have liked me at all if I dropped those over"". No dip for my egg rolls, no lemon in water as asked. No whole wheat bread as asked. Horrible waitress, horrible service. I would not recommend this cheese cake factory to anyone."
Angie K.,"New York, NY",0,21,1,3.0,4/30/2017,We have been here many times and the food is a hit or miss unfortunately. One week the Cajun pasta is great and the next week you get a bowl of watery bland pasta. Recently I've been noticing the silverware is always dirty with watermarks and a fly buzzing around which is clearly unsanitary especially since the plates are all out on the table before you sit. I feel like the cleanliness has gone down at this location recently. Did I mention we found a hair in the Cuban rolls? Just beware...
Dan C.,"Irvington, NY",0,10,,5.0,5/22/2017,Great atmosphere in this restaurant. I had a lot of questions for our server Steven and he was very helpful and polite. Great experience thanks to him.. will be back for sure..
Jennifer G.,"Fort Lewis, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA",145,222,15,4.0,2/6/2016,I went here last weekend. Had the tomato basil flatbread. My daughter had the spaghetti. The portions are huge so we split that. Next time I think we can split the lunch portion. No room for dessert. The waiter/waitress was nice. They had switched out while we were there. I'm really impressed how they took our order without writing anything down and got it all right. There was 6 of us!
Angelo P.,"Monsey, NY",0,35,2,4.0,5/21/2017,"They got really good food on flavor, like fried mac and cheese and the chipotle chicken pasta, but my 4 stars are for the staff... Attentive and fast!"
Kristen B.,"Middletown, NY",0,27,,3.0,5/7/2017,"I enjoy this chain a great deal, I find the food to be consistently excellent. We arrived at 2pm on a Sunday, and we knew it would be a little busy. We were not expecting to be told 20-25 minutes wait, but hey, it happens. After about 25 minutes, our buzzer went off and we, along with two other parties, went up to hand our buzzers in. Instead of being met by a host or hostess to be seated, we were told to stand in a line barely 20 feet from where we'd already been waiting - and we waited another 10-15 minutes there. So that's a strange seating system they've got going there, and I got the impression they were either running behind or straight up unorganized. We were annoyed, but not swayed. We were finally seated and our waitress was very good. She was attentive, and our drinks and appetizer came out VERY quickly, which was great. We went with fried Mac and cheese balls as an app, and they were DELISH and a nice sized portion for two people. We ordered our meals pretty quickly and those took longer to come out. Probably bordering on too long, but the appetizer was at least a little filling and our waitress kept our drinks full, so I didn't complain. I ordered Parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans - absolutely delicious, but there was a large pool of grease at the bottom of my plate which was kind of gross. I otherwise enjoyed it, very tasty! My husband ordered the chicken bellagio and he raved about it; he said the chicken was cooked perfectly and was juicy. We took our leftovers and a slice of the vanilla bean cheesecake home with us. While the wait and seating system were an annoyance, the food redeemed it for us. My only true complaint is the weird vent in the ceiling over just the inside row of booths - why does that have to blow such COLD air? It isn't summer yet, and our food got cold VERY fast, and we were almost uncomfortably chilly. We aren't ones to complain about that kind of thing, but it admittedly detracts from the experience, especially when the food is the redeeming factor."
Jennifer L.,"Peekskill, NY",768,555,818,4.0,7/30/2013,"Great food. Huge portions. Friendly staff.  My favorites are: Appetizers - avocado egg rolls and tex mex egg rolls  Sandwich - chicken salad sandwich  Specialties - meatloaf, burrito, chicken madeira Pasta - pasta da Vinci Cheesecake - white chocolate raspberry truffle, prep, bananas foster, key lime  ... Okay I have officially made myself hungry!!!"
Charles G.,"New York, NY",199,189,135,4.0,2/9/2016,Many dont know about cheesecakes brunch special if you didn't know before now you know!!!! it's #amazing there Sunday brunch had many items to choose from and beats some of the local places. Great for groups.
Rob R.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",1,62,71,5.0,3/23/2016,I now see what all the hype is about.  After years of dismissing CF as a glorified Applebee's I decided to break down and try it and I am glad I did. I had the steak Diane and shrimp scampi combo.  It was slightly  over cooked but was still delightful.  I had the key lime for dessert  and it was epic.  Nothing about the meal reminded me of a chain restaurant.  I will definitely be coming back.  For what you get there is real value here.
Ron R.,"Beacon, NY",79,35,70,4.0,10/17/2015,"Of course you come here for the dessert, the cheesecakes!!!!  But also good on the menu with heaping servings are the Thai lettuce wraps, the tasty firecracker salmon rolls.  Let's not forget the honey oat wheat bread."
Yadi M.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",18,2,4,5.0,4/10/2016,Diet??? How how. With all these food!!! Good service friendly. Cant complaint best place in that mall
Paul L.,"Nanuet, NY",0,5,,1.0,8/23/2017,"Let me preface this review by saying if it was possible to give zero stars we would.  My wife and I brought our daughter to the Cheesecake factory for a birthday dinner.  The table next to us was full of older children who were not under adequate adult supervision. The children were throwing silverware and jumping all around the table pushing one another, creating an unsafe environment for our toddler daughter who was in a high chair in close proximity.  We requested numerous times for management (a rude man named Tony) to address the situation. We were told by our waiter that the manager was ""busy"".  Our daughter was then knocked into our table violently by the child at the next table who jumped off the booth into her high chair. This was the child we repeatedly requested the manager address and speak to his parents regarding his dangerous behavior.  We then began a verbal exchange with the table next to ours and we were told by management we needed to leave.  We requested medical attention for our daughter numerous times, but management insisted we leave the restaurant. Upon us summoning EMS and having paramedics evaluate our daughter, we were asked by management to leave the building and meet the paramedics outside to not cause a scene.  We agree with other poor reviews that service at this location is beyond poor.  This location is not safe for children. We strongly suggest if you value the safety of your children, to consider a different place to dine."
Sophy A.,"Bedford Park, Bronx, NY",71,17,51,4.0,2/27/2016,"Always on the money! Whether you are at the bar or at a table! Friendly service, amicable staff and great selection of good! The chicken chili is just right!!!"
Shank S.,"New York, NY",5,100,6,2.0,1/4/2016,"I went here on New years eve, although the restaurant didn't seem very busy the service was poor. We had a 10 minute wait, even tho we saw many empty seats. The staff was very slow. I got the Burrito Grande, which would have been really good if the rice wasn't under cooked. Everything was perfect for a great burrito except the rice, it was hard and crunchy. But the sauce it was covered in was great.  The waiter we had must have needed more training as well because when we asked if he can remove chicken from a dish (my friend is vegetarian) he looked at us with confusion. Then said he will find out, needless to say we didn't get that dish."
