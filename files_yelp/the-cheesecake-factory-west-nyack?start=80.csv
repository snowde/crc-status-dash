Brian S.,"Monroe, NY",60,25,1,1.0,2/18/2017,"I've eaten here several times in the past years and had average consistent food with pretty good service. Last time was a different story. Me and my girlfriend walked in and luckily there wasn't a wait time, so they brought us to a section of the restaurant I didn't know existed wayyyy in the back. They intended on seating us on the last two top table snugged next to the busboy/waiter station. Also the table next to that was two parents and two kids who had seemingly given up on controlling there kids. The hostess still didn't bat an eye and wanted us to sit there..so I obviously had to say ""really, there are booths open right there not crammed against a wall?"". So the hostess said "" I have to go ask if I can move your table"". At this point I knew we were in for something interesting. After awkwardly standing next to the screaming kids and crammed table waiting for the hostess for LITERALLY 10 minutes I decided to sit down in the open booth. (Mind you all the other booths only had two people as well). The hostess finally returned after we sat ourselves and said ""you guys can sit here."". I thought that was funny that she needed to say that and couldn't apologize for taking 10 minutes to ask a question. So our waitress comes a few minutes later, she was ok, clearly stressed because she had to work the worst part of the restaurant. So after putting drink orders in we got them about 15 minutes later which was somewhat at the fault of the design and how far away from the bar we were. We then decided to order our appetizers and entrees to avoid a long wait. So as 20 minutes went by I started to wonder where our nachos were (a simple appetizer). Soon after that I see food coming but it looked like our entrees... the abrupt food runner put or food in front of us and I told him that we didn't even receive our appetizer yet. He said oh well do you want me to bring it out and I'll bring the food out after your done with the nachos. I knew that meant we will put your food under the hot lamp until your done and the we will bring out the same , now not fresh food. So I told him I'd rather you take just forget the nachos and we'll just eat our meals. (This all happened while the waitress was next to the table listening). Our meals were average as usual but tasty nonetheless. When we finally received our bill by another waitress the nachos were still on there of course so I had to wait for it to be removed from the bill. Overall obviously not the best experience."
Ashley A.,"Westwood, NJ",117,192,440,4.0,8/15/2015,"Let's start with, the wait was forever! I know it gets busy, but we were told 30 min and it was more like 50 min to an hour. When we did finally sit down, service was pretty good. Our waiter was very pleasant, informative and attentive. I ordered the club sandwich, and I will never order it again. It was so bland and boring. No flavor. The nachos we ordered for an appetizer were really good. For dessert, which was impossible to choose since the list goes on forever, I chose the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. That was pretty darn good, and def the highlight of the evening. I've gone there a few times and IMO, the food is not so great, it really is all about the cheesecake!"
Utpal J.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,15,,4.0,5/7/2016,"4 star for food quality 5 star for price even though the quantity is very high and they should reduce the price and quantity  3 star for service, slow as it's mostly very busy I believe  4 star for value for money... Will certainly go back"
Alexis S.,"Sunnyside, NY",77,162,71,1.0,11/9/2015,"When I come to Cheesecake Factory I usually order Renee lunch special: soup salad and a sandwich or fettuccine with sun dried tomatoes. When I came this time I was in the mood for the fettuccine and was surprised that it was no longer on the menu. That honestly my fav dish and now it was gone.  After flipping the menu back and forth I ordered the carbonara pasta with chicken. I definitely was not impressed. I probably won't order that again. The pasta was way too greasy and the pasta only had like 3 pcs of chicken. Wth is that. I will most likely stick to the Renee special or stop coming, I haven't decided yet.  For dessert I ordered the pecan pumpkin cheesecake. The slice was literally a pecan pie with a thin layer of pumpkin cheesecake. I think the pumpkin cheesecake would be better since this was way too sweet."
Thomas A.,"Bogota, NJ",0,1,,2.0,3/1/2017,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory many times. This rating only applies to the Nyack location (not the Paramus one). The service was rather slow. It was a busy Saturday so this was not too surprising. The chicken dish was a little burnt, but still acceptable. One dessert ordered was the Strawberry shortcake. The strawberries tasted old and the shortcake looked like a muffin cut into four pieces that had a cookie like constancy. The bottom part was burnt black. It was as if they couldn't sell it so let's hide it in the the dessert. It was completely inedible. The waitress saw that it was almost completely left over and asked how it was. I told her it was horrible pointing to the stale tasting burnt parts. She said that she was sorry but never offered to take it off the bill or to give us another . This was the first time I ever complained to the staff about an item. In my mind this was terribly disappointing customer service. Penny wise but pound foolish. Tom"
Sherry C.,"Whitestone, Queens, NY",101,193,719,5.0,9/6/2015,"This is by far the best Cheesecake Factory in New York that I have been to. We didn't even wait. The host seated us and immediately we were served their wonderful bread! Our waiter was so nice! I forgot his name though but I'm glad he recommended the dishes. My boyfriend and friends just came back from a hiking trip and we were starving. We got a whole bunch of food and of course, a slice of cheesecake. Divine! Left a nice tip for the waiter and we headed back home. We even forgot to do some shopping.."
Honey B.,"Nyack, NY",0,53,,3.0,8/8/2016,"Had a great meal here with exceptional service.  Music was a bit loud which made conversation tougher...     It's nice to see that they are still drawing good crowds as I had not been there for a while, and we waited about 15 minutes for a table.  We enjoyed the warm bread and I had the ricotta-sausage flatbread from the Skinnylicous menu--really good!  My companion had the guacamole salad and the raspberry cheesecake.  Everything was well prepared and we'll certainly be back!"
Rahmani A.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",6,1,,1.0,10/24/2015,"This cheesecake factory was the worst one that I've been to. First we told them we had a party of six, they told us the wait was an hour. We said ok, and proceeded to deal with the wait. They finally buzzed us after an hour and a half. Then when we walk in they tell me and my family to wait one the side. We then waited an additional twenty minutes, until we noticed there were at least five families that went before us. We question about us being skipped and the hostesses starting argument with my mother and my wife. I then decided to take my family elsewhere I will  never take or recommend anyone with a family to go to that cheesecake factory until they get an overhaul of new hostess"
Arthur L.,"Norwood, NJ",2,153,9,3.0,9/17/2015,"Was at the Palisade Mall and quite frankly despite the number of places to eat few are worthwhile. Cheesecake is not anything spectacular but a reliable place for decent food at reasonable prices . Last night was no different , meatloaf and four cheese pasta were solid ."
Maryjane V.,"Bronx, NY",51,27,34,5.0,9/6/2015,"The food was delicious. For appetizer I had the avocado  egg rolls. It's one of my favorites. For dinner I ordered the skinny Salmon with vegetables and the salmon was cooked to perfection. Lastly, for dessert I had the salted Carmel cheesecake and it was divine. I ate like a little piggy and I hardly couldn't move lol. Overall experience: We only waited 10 mins or less to be seated. Our waiter was very attentive and the customer service was great. Cheesecake Factory in Palisades Mall never disappoints me."
Meagan C.,"Middletown, NY",19,33,260,4.0,7/14/2014,"It was my first time dining here and I'd have to say, I had a great experience! I got the Bistro Shrimp Pasta which was very tasty and pretty to look at with great color. All of the flavors really worked very well together and the fresh Arugula made this pasta and battered shrimp dish taste light and fresh. Also the portion size was big which outweighed the price of this delicious dish! My mother got the Pit Beef Dip which was a hot sandwich. The char roasted beef on this sandwich was very juicy and flavorful. All of the flavors really complimented each other & the horseradish sauce just made this dish taste excellent and pulled all of the wonderful flavors together. The presentation, however, was lacking a bit. I would absolutely recommend either of these dishes to anyone looking for some delicious food. The atmosphere & style of this restaurant is great & feels sophisticated (which I like). The reason I gave the Cheesecake Factory 4 stars instead of 5 is because the staff could have been friendlier & quicker to check on us. Also, the presentation on the sandwich could have been better. It looked like it belonged in a diner. Overall, I would definitely return for dinner & possibly some cheesecake!"
Jacky M.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,16,33,4.0,9/21/2015,Food was pretty good. Ordered the Mac and cheese burger.  Came out fast and wasn't that greasy. Bathroom was spacious with urinals and stalls.
Sonny J.,"Westwood, NJ",2,24,,3.0,11/22/2016,"Great cheesecake and food but I went there on a MONDAY  night at 8:30 we only ordered cheesecake and they took an hour to bring it. it's great for a Saturday night but if you are trying to get in and out, don't sit and eat."
Marc A.,"Silver Lake, Los Angeles, CA",20,148,276,4.0,8/2/2015,"Good restaurant in the middle of a large mall in upstate New York.  Compared to other locations, you can a shorter wait time."
Chocolatefever1010 ..,"Stonington, CT",0,8,,4.0,12/25/2016,"Friend mac and cheese balls and avocado rolls never disappoint! Their fettuccine alfredo is creamy and delicious, and the ambiance is family-friendly and lively. Maybe it could be better lit, but I will always be coming back to Cheesecake Factory!"
Esther J.,"New York, NY",195,263,299,3.0,4/17/2015,"Have been here quite a bit, would rate it 3-4 for service. Sometimes a bit slow, forgetful, but who doesn't like Cheesecake. Food is pretty similar every Cheesecake you go. Wide selection."
Annabelle L.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",441,477,661,4.0,5/10/2014,I order the breaded fried shrimp with fries and cole slaw.  Hubby ordered herb crusted salmon with shrimp scampi and mashed potato.  Kids had chicken quesadilla and cheese pizza.  Desserts were red velvet cheesecake and mango key lime cheesecake.  Everything is delicious and with generous portions.  I'm rating 4 stars because of the restaurant is dirty esp. their restroom.  We came for early lunch so I can't imagine how dirtier the place will be when more customers swarm into this place.
Jeff W.,"Hillsdale, NJ",92,434,33,4.0,1/11/2015,"I've been here a few times and it's difficult to pen a review on this place. I guess I need to break it up a few different ways. Probably start with the easiest part first, but like most of my reviews, they become tangent and disjointed! Doing a cheesecake order to go has never been a problem. I go in, pick a few pieces out, order's done, transaction finished...off to the next part of the day. I've never had a server at that counter that was bad.  Dining in however is another story. I recall one time when we were seated all the way in the back and that wasn't too bad. The food was good, no service delays, but you do kind of get forgotten about back there. Not necessarily a bad thing since it gives you time to digest and space everything out.  The portions are huge and I can't seem to not leave that place without a bag in tow. I can't say I've ever had a bad dish there. I do remember having the meatloaf one day and recalling a voice in my head going ""your eyes are bigger than your stomach""...it was right. After that day I changed things up and got some chicken dish with pasta and pesto.  I do remember one time I was there sitting next to ill behaved children and even more ill behaved caretakers of said child. That kind of ruined the experience but that's not the staff's fault. I mean who doesn't like getting toy cars thrown at them during dinner?"
Elizabeth R.,"Teaneck, NJ",13,116,41,4.0,2/2/2016,"The cheesecake factory at Palisades is pretty darn good. The best part is that they have brunch on Sundays from 10 am to 2 PM and aside from being really good, it was pretty inexpensive; Basically, it was really good food for diner prices. If you do decide to try their brunch, at this particular location it is best to go Sundays before 11. Once 11-11:30 hits, EVERYONE goes there. by noon, there is a wait. I went there at around 10:30 and it had great food, great service, in a nice atmosphere."
Blair Y.,"Flushing, NY",51,14,1,1.0,4/26/2016,"One star for the poor service. The waitress didn't introduce herself so we don't know her name, who let us wait for 30 mins for the bread and didn't even say any words. Plus we asked for wheat bread and she brought us ONLY white, before we say anything she left again. (We tried to ask a waiter who passed by our table to help because our waitress disappeared most of time. He heard us but pretended not, I guess it wasn't his table so he doesn't want extra work.) So we was starving, waiting and looking for our waitress the whole night with an empty table.  Moreover, she took my order wrong, I asked her if she can take out one ingredient from my pasta, she told me she isn't sure, it will be a surprise.(how can she not know?) When I got my pasta right after we got bread, I was really surprised that she took out All the ingredients. My pasta has only veggies and noodles left. I felt it's like a joke. At this point the waitress was gone taking her break, a nice waiter helped to fix it and have it cooked again, when it came back to my table, my pasta was limp.  I will never go back to this chain anymore, I went for their wheat bread and my favorite pasta but she ruined everything including our night."
