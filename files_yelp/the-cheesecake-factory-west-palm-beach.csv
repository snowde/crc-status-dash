Christine R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",184,64,103,4.0,10/2/2017,"We had a wonderful experience with our large party! They had our drinks out quickly and even brought out special bread plates for all of the kids with bread and sliced bananas. The kids love it!  I ordered the lunch portion of the Shepard's Pie. It was incredibly rich and savory. So delicious. The lunch portion was huge. I took over half of it home and will enjoy the leftovers!!! There were large chucks of ground beef, carrots, peas, mushrooms, zucchini and onion served with chunky red mashed potatoes on top. I'll order this again for sure!  For my beverage I ordered the unsweet tropical ice tea. It was a black tea with a fruity flavor. I loved that it wasn't bitter and that it had great flavor."
Katie C.,"Cambridge, MA",85,82,33,2.0,12/29/2017,"Someone else used the term ""chaos"" and I think that is the perfect term for the hostess stand. They were having all sorts of problems- couldn't work the computers, menus strewn all over the place, a line out the door, etc. We were a large party but had reservations. Yet we waited for 30 minutes and watched several other parties get seated before being seated ourselves, and only because I went back up to ask about the status. Apparently our table had been ready for a while and they had just forgotten about us.  Having worked as a hostess in the past, I understand how stressful of a job it can be. You have to coordinate the entire restaurant's seating arrangements while also balancing angry customers, servers, and management. But the least you can do is have a welcoming attitude. You're the first person a customer encounters. This hostess didn't smile once and she barely communicated with me. Her demeanor made me feel like I was a huge inconvenience, and that's the last thing a customer should feel when first arriving to a restaurant.  It's a shame the hostess stand was such a mess because it sets a horrible tone for the rest of the visit. Luckily, our actual dinner went smoothly. The quality of food was typical for the chain and the service was quick and friendly. But it would have been nice if someone had at least apologized for the wait. (I've been given free dessert for far less at our local Cambridge location without even complaining, and those types of unprompted gestures go a long way.) Management just doesn't seem to be on top of it here and I hope they can work out the kinks."
John S.,"Williamstown, KY",79,33,3,3.0,10/8/2017,"Amazing food lousy service. We were so excited to be near a Cheesecake factory!  Tonight my fiance and I both tried something new and we left stuffed. The parmesan crusted chicken was the BEST thing  I've ever eaten, the green beans were excellent as well.  The cheesecake has always been good, and tonight was no different. You can go wrong with the food in Cheesecake factory. You CAN go wrong when it comes to the service. We we're seated quickly (abnormal for my experiences as they are usually out the door) we were excited and hungry. Our server didn't arrive for 5 minutes. Trying to be understanding we proceeded to examine the menu top to bottom, even selecting our dessert options ahead of time. Our server finally showed up and apologized for the wait. We explained it wasn't a real problem and ordered our drinks and entrees. We waited for the food to be brought, but found it concerning when our drinks were empty and she passed our table at least 4 times without checking in. Our entrees came and, as we said, they were incredible. We were in good spirits and enjoying the incredible food. Our drinks were eventually refilled and our server disappeared again. She finally arrived for dessert ordering. I asked for a refill of my drink. Our desserts took longer than we expected to arrive and my server never brought my glass back. She came back to drop of the check, she then disappeared when we asked for to go boxes and another server had to bring the boxes to us.  We tried to be forgiving but after being ignored  (while the table next to us was doted upon) for most of the evening we were confused and annoyed. The restaurant is great...the food is incredible...our service was very poor."
Adrian D.,"Rochester, MI",21,97,144,2.0,12/22/2017,We arrived in West Palm Beach and decided to try something we know would be good. I was surprised to see the rating on Yelp but after dining at this particular Cheesecake factory I see why. The service is a problem and unlike other Cheesecake factories I've visited. To begin with the service was extremely slow. Usually you  get a basket of bread right away but we waited 15-20 min before the bread cake and the server showed up to take our order. It took so long for our meal to come out that it was cold once it arrived (cold fish is not very appetizing). The interesting thing was that waitstaff would gather in groups around the bar while customers were trying to flag someone down. It was chaos. I won't be visiting this location.
Caitlyn C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",94,3,,1.0,12/30/2017,"This was honestly one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. From the food quality to the service, everything was very poor. It took AT LEAST 20 minutes to receive our drinks and a basket of bread. (We had to keep reminding the waitress every time she walked by.)  We finally get our food after an hour and my food is cold. I was so hungry I ate it anyway for fear of waiting longer to reorder another dish. My friend's food order was completely wrong on the first try. The second try he found plastic in it! The manager came over to the table to apologize and then asked US what we'd like to do about it? There should be no asking what we would like. There was plastic in the food so comp the meal! It was like a poorly run circus in there. Moe's down the street would give you better service than this place."
Marc W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",20,125,21,4.0,11/25/2017,Show night at Kravis Center and decided to have dinner at Cheesecake Factory.  As usual it was very busy so we ate at the bar.  Never a great idea as people want to get drinks and push in while you eat.  The bartenders were very nice but they were extremely busy so service was slow.  The food is always solid but nothing exceptional.  Had the bang bang chicken and shrimp which was supposed to be Thai curry. It tasted much more like an Indian curry which I don't really like.  It was ok but nothing I loved.  My wife had a antioxidant salad which she liked but they were very stingy on the shrimp she added.  Overall an ok experience tonight.
Betsy S.,"Delray Beach, FL",814,248,1405,5.0,8/6/2017,"We had a gr8 experience sitting at the bar with our friends to have drinks and apps! Such friendly bartenders- smiling, helpful. Not too over intrusive and just right. Beautiful apps. Loved the ahi tuna tartare and the vietnamese springs rolls. The bartender made me the best blood orange margherita. I never had it and would order it again in a second. I loved it! We were going to the theatre and told them our time constraints! And all good! Will definitely return!"
Erica L.,"West Palm Beach, FL",6,25,21,5.0,12/27/2017,You can never go wrong with this choice. Huge menu! Service is usually always pretty good. Try the celebration cheesecake it's really good. I am not sure how long they will keep I.t on the menu.
Randy T.,"Miami, FL",27,7,1,5.0,12/8/2017,Amazing service outstanding the waitress Sam was so sweet attentive and got us (a group of 11) in and out real quick  5 star service to thee tremendo they even combined tables for our big group to fit.
Bonnie G. M.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",7,13,1,2.0,10/21/2017,"Waiter was pleasant enough. We got the summer roll starter and crab/artichoke dip. A lot to pay for 3 spring rolls (basically veggies); crab dip was greasy and over cooked. I had the eggplant parmesan (which the waiter recommended highly) which could have doubled as door stoppers - 3 square squares on a plate (1 was burnt) that measured about 4x4x2"" and had about 2TB of marinara sauce and some rubbery cheese. The pasta had been pre-cooked and was very al dente. Hubby got the Cajun jambalya pasta - same deal. Pasta was a lump of ??? and had drizzled sauce. We ate it - should have sent it back. Our bill was almost $90 for 2 cocktails; 2 starters; and 2 mains. NOT WORTH THE MONEY.  Will not rush back. This is exactly why we avoid chains."
Bill W.,"Kalamazoo, MI",61,35,6,3.0,12/5/2017,Food was good as always.  It was the hostesses and the service which was not as good.  The hostess failed to let us know that their paging system was not working.  Many people that were before us were seated first.  The restaurant wasn't that busy but it still took us 40 minutes to get seated.  Our server was nice but he didn't bring bread right away.
Sarah M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",3,73,5,1.0,11/5/2017,"A couple girlfriends and I had our dogs in city place.  It was a very rainy day and we had just come from the Green market. We were shopping around City Place and decided to have lunch at cheesecake factory because they had an outdoor patio. We have seen dogs on their patio many times and asked if it was OK to have our dogs also. They said yes and they tried to put us the sidewalk where it was raining and the tables were soaking wet. A manager came out and told us that we could not sit on the inside of the fence because we had dogs. Seemed as if she was discriminating against us because she didn't like dogs. She asked us to tie our dogs to the fence so we could sit on the inside of the fence. Our dogs would have been sitting in the rain had tied them on the fence. We felt completely unwelcome and as if we should never return. Very disappointed with this restaurant, we won't be returning.  Luckily, we went down to the way and ate at mellow Mushroom where they welcomed us with dog treats and water bowls."
MJ H.,"Delray Beach, FL",49,45,302,2.0,3/12/2017,"Stopped in for brunch today. We typically go to the Boca location and love it! Things headed south fairly quickly with a dirty bread plate and a water mug that had a sticker on the side (see photo). It said warning may cause cancer - not what I want to see on the container my sons water is in! The manger came over to discuss why our food hadn't come up yet and we pointed out the mug. He seemed more concerned about a not clean mug then the cancer component, but brought us water in glasses.  Had the fried cheese small plate - very tasty perfect for 2 people. Had the monte cristo for brunch - also pretty good (had no seasoning for some reason). My son had the kids pancakes.  When it was time to pay we out our debit card in the holder with the bill on the table (card sticking up). She took ours with 4-5 other folders. While we ate our cheesecake the waitress came back and said she had lost our debit card. We asked her to retrace her steps. Eventually she came back and said she couldn't find it, but made it sound like she had run it and lost it in the way back. We asked to to make sure she didn't give it to another table. Then she and the manager came back and said she hadn't run it and they would keep looking for it. The manager took our number and said he'd call if it turned up. He comped our brunch and gave us his card.  Unfortunately we then had to spend 20 min on the phone with PNC canceling our card. So our brunch was not as tasty as other cheesecakes AND took up an hour of time waiting to see if they could find our card and then canceling the card.  The take away: I'll never drink out of a plastic mug at any cheesecake again and I'll stick with Boca."
Jeremiah V.,"West Palm Beach, FL",57,31,444,5.0,8/30/2017,"First time I came here was abut 6 years ago and still coming to this day. Located in City Place in West Palm Beach, great place You will never go wrong here . As expected it is always busy in weekends. A lot of great memories here Highly recommend"
Tiffany R.,"Ypsilanti, MI",51,52,58,5.0,8/12/2017,This was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory and it exceeded my expectations. The food was awesome and the staff was great. We only waited about 15 minutes before we were seated and it was very busy on a Saturday night. I had the chicken pasta and it was delicious.
Amanda A.,"Delray Beach, FL",6,73,30,5.0,8/20/2017,"I dined here today with some friends and we were very pleased. Our server, Brandon, was great! He was helpful, nice and attentive. We had strawberry martinis (delish), fried zucchini (always great), Mac and cheese balls and Cuban rolls to start. All of it was really good, but they changed the sauce on the Cuban rolls so that sucked. The previous mustard sauce was much better. I had the herb crusted salmon for my entree and it was cooked perfectly. The mash potatoes are always so good and the buerre blanc sauce is to die for. Definitely recommend! Seriously regretting not getting a cheesecake to go."
Audrey G.,"Pompano Beach, FL",32,120,82,4.0,2/25/2017,"Fun lunch with a large group of friends today. They don't take reservations on the weekend so we made sure we got there early. By the time we left they were jammed! Nice lunch specials- lunch portions of salads, pastas, sandwich combos and more. I had the barbecue chicken salad- nice mix of lettuce, black beans, corn, tomatoes and diced chicken breast. Yum! We all enjoyed our lunches but one person thought her glass of sangria was a little high at $7.00.  Service was good but the reason I am giving 4 stars rather than 5 is that our meals came out spaced too far apart. The first meals were separated from the last ones by almost 5 minutes. Too long even for a group of 10 meals.  Large menu, a little pricey, but generally tasty food."
Clarence P.,"Hypoluxo, FL",41,32,32,4.0,7/23/2017,"My review is kind of mixed for Cheesecake Factory. Some things are good, others, not so much. We waited about 10 minutes for a table for 4 when the restaurant was very slow Not a big deal. Got to our booth and there were crumbs on both sides of the table, we wiped away without a word from the hostess. Server can't by promptly and asked about drinks, etc. Our server was attentive, nice and brought everything just as she said she would. Ordered firecracker salmon appetizer that was drenched in oil... Was OK, I guess. We were starving! All our orders were wonderful, tasted great and came out very, very hot. Was wonderful.  Service other than our server eat my issue, I guess. When a young man was cleaning the table next to ours another one came by and they exchanged in a loud conversation, laughing about something. It drowned out our conversation. Then going to the restroom and when leaving, other servers /wait staff would nearly run over you in the aisle. I understand if busy, but the place was not busy and.... Never once a ""sorry, excuse me"". Don't understand that.  But as you can see from the rating, loved the place and will be back. It's just... Clean up better  and be nice and polite. You know?"
David L.,"Lake Worth, FL",4,8,1,3.0,8/26/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is great at cheesecakes but horrible at math. I keep waiting for this to change but it hasn't. They bring you six pieces of bread and two individually wrapped pats of butter. We eat the first two pieces of bread with the two butters. Then I ask for more butter cuz there are four pieces left and the bring me... ready for it... two more butters. Finish my next two bread and now looking at two more breads and wondering if it's really worth asking for butter again. Nah, I'll just politely wait for me food, eat it and then get my cheesecake to go and to not return. I'm just glad I can grab cheesecake here without having to eat here in the future. Cheesecake Factory, after many many years of only two butters, I'm done. Please teach the servers math."
Ana L.,"West Palm Beach, FL",99,68,846,4.0,5/18/2017,"For a chain restaurant this is probably my favorite. Not my first choice of places to go but definitely a safe choice as every time I eat at any Cheesecake Factory, they're pretty consistent in quality. This particular location is one of my favorites as it is located right in the beautiful and scenic city place. Also there are outside seating in two sides of the restaurant. First plus their house baked warm bread served with side of butter. Nothing like fresh warm bread to make any tummy smile:) My favorite dish is the chicken Madeira (named after a sauce made from a liquor from the Madeira Islands that belong to Portugal. They're drinks are always well made and delicious. My Pre dinner go-to drink favorite is the passionfruit mojito. And of course their cheesecake selections are always on point. Being a chocoholic I usually get the tuxedo cheesecake (yummm!)... If you haven't tried or heard of The Cheesecake Factory you're probably living under a rock...and if that is the case, get out from under that rock and go give it a try! You won't regret it"
Adriana R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",103,49,291,4.0,4/28/2016,"While I have eaten at this Cheesecake Factory location numerous times, this review details my visit on Wednesday, April 27. I came here to eat a late lunch around 3:15 PM. Since the dinner rush had not hit yet, the building was largely empty - making for a quiet, peaceful environment. Rather than stick to what I know, as I usually do, I tried something different from the menu: a macaroni and cheese burger. I never understood why so many people make such a big deal about cheese - after this burger, I now understand. The fried macaroni and cheese ball on top of the patty was delicious, and so was the cheese sauce. I asked for sautéed white onion on the side, which paired well with the burger. The bun was toasted, and of course the portion size was large. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium well, but to me to tasted (and looked) well-done. Next time I'll ask for medium so that I get a juicer burger. In my experience, the great food at The Cheesecake Factory is always mirrored by great service. This time, however, the service wasn't so great. Our waiter almost seemed timid. He was very soft-spoken. He did not have a warm personality, however he was not cold either - he was more passive than anything. He didn't smile once. I was actually surprised that he was a waiter there, because I know The Cheesecake Factory can be pretty picky when it comes to their wait staff. Another small side note about our waiter: he was wearing very chunky jewelry: a large ring and a heavy silver men's bracelet. I never understood why companies always made a point to disallow employees from wearing jewelry on the job. After seeing our waiter approach the table and being immediately distracted by his jewelry, I now understand that rule. Seeing him in that kind of jewelry actually made him remind me of a Nigerian prince or something. Anyhow, I digress. While the service was not outstanding as it usually is when I visit The Cheesecake Factory, the new burger I tried was delicious - another item I can cross off of their very expansive menu."
Stuart B.,"New York, NY",1164,572,39,4.0,4/13/2017,"Very short wait times (for a CKF) always between 5 and 10 minutes max.  Typical decor and I never had any issues with service.  It's nice to see they are adding more to the ""non boatload"" amount of food options."
Billy N.,"CityPlace, West Palm Beach, FL",51,4,4,2.0,6/17/2017,Had dinner at this location last night and ordered the Ribeye steak.  If you ever come here DO NOT order the ribeye.  It tasted like this thing was soaking in the Dead Sea for 40 days and night.  It was so salty.  My wife ordered the mac and cheeseburger and it was good.  This is actually the second Cheesecake Factory that served their steak like this.  So I'm starting to think it's like this everywhere.  Avoid the steak.
Misty D.,"Jupiter, FL",0,3,,4.0,10/25/2017,"Had a rocky experience at first, but managers Alex & Eric went above and beyond and completely turned the night around. Thank you guys, one of my favorites. Can't beat the food!"
Susana R.,"Fort Myers, FL",110,3,,5.0,12/8/2017,"We had a long day of work and we needed drinks and food... Sam was able to fix a table for 11 of us, she did an amazing job!!!!! Kudos to Sam, thank you!!!!!"
John S.,"Cuba, MO",0,20,10,5.0,7/30/2017,"Always the best . I love to have my turkey burger just only at cheesecake , the combination with homemade fried. This got to be the best turkey in town. Its really hard to find find turkey burger where i live. The restaurant itself very busy , because they are located in a very busy location. Our server "" fernando R was very friendly ."
Chris W.,"Boynton Beach, FL",90,66,62,4.0,3/25/2017,"Located right in the heart of CityPlace in West Palm Beach, the Cheesecake Factory is one of the best restaurants around. I don't know how the head chef does it.  Their menu here is HUGE.  There are selections from burgers and steak to chicken and salads - even a skinnylicious part of the menu for those who watch calories.  Of course, who can pass up their massive selection of cheesecake all made on site?  There has to be 30-40 different kinds of cheesecake.  I haven't tried them all, but what I have tried was excellent! I usually end up getting the steak tacos or the cajun chicken littles.  I'll say it again - there are so many choices that its hard just to pick one!  They literally hand you a book for a menu. As you could imagine, being in the heart of CityPlace, expect to wait for a seat during normal lunch and dinner hours.  This place doesn't take reservations so it's on a first come first serve basis. It's great for take-out if you're on the run and the portions are large enough for two meals.  It's a little on the high side as far as pricing, but the food is worth it.  I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal there."
AL D.,"Old Bethpage, NY",0,7,,1.0,11/25/2017,"Wow. Can't believe all the negative reviews concerning the service are true. 2 adults and our dog so we had to sit on the sidewalk. I understand. 10 minutes until server arrives. We order a soda, a water and our lunch. I have a whole conversation with server about my dish. The dish is offered on two different menus with a price difference.  Server explains the difference. Another 20 minutes they bring me the wrong dish. Not even close to what I ordered. I tell the food runner. Servers appears and tells me another 10 minutes. Tell her forget it and please send a manager. Manager explains that the server is just covering the sidewalk tables.  After conversations with a totally clueless manager I then realized why the service is so bad. She was totally clueless and comped wife's lunch and offered us a piece of cheesecake. That's real funny considering I never ate lunch. Instead of arguing with this clueless manager we got up and left.  Never again."
Big T.,"Pleasanton, CA",63,128,,2.0,11/12/2017,"I always like the food at this place. Last night was a little odd. Went in about midnight - still very busy. But I still had to wait awhile for bar service for a considerable time. Even after I got the menu, still had to wait. They just seemed unorganized because I was asked by three different people, but no progress was made. Then I ordered eggs and potatoes, over-easy. A little later, the manager is proactive and tells me that the eggs were not done to the waitresses liking. At this time, it was about 1245am. I said, whatever condition they are, I will take them and be happy to pay for them. They had me - I was starving, coming in from the west coast. They were right - what the hell happened to these poor eggs? And the potatoes were at a crisp. Reminded me that, late at night, you have no idea of the condition of the person cooking your food. I would still go back because of my long, positive history with the chain."
Stephanie S.,"Boca Raton, FL",100,15,,1.0,10/3/2017,This is based solely on take out. This is the second time they forgot my avocado in the Sheila's chicken and avocado. It's not that hard to put pieces of avocado in a salad. Morons!!!
Stacey G.,"Lake Worth, FL",119,290,283,5.0,9/14/2016,Been here multiple times and the staff is always so friendly. The food is amazing and they always come to check if we are doing okay.
Briahna M.,"San Francisco, CA",95,4,,1.0,8/8/2017,This was the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. Even the one that's always packed in San Francisco has better service than this one. We were told it was a 15 minute wait but ended up waiting around 25 mins. Then we ordered our drinks & it took about 15 mins to bring them to us. Then it took around 35 mins to bring us our food that wasn't worth the prices. During our meal we asked for them to bring us all waters that they had forgotten & it took around 10 mins to bring that to us. Mind you they were not busy AT ALL. I would expect this service from a busy restaurant but it was around 9:30pm & not busy whatsoever. Waste of time & money.
Bader A.,"Anaheim, CA",1,13,,1.0,8/13/2017,Worst branch ever !!!! Kept us more than 40 minutes to wait so bad for Cheesecake Factory!!!!!!!! The worst service  I won't be here again!
Brenda J.,"West Palm Beach, FL",25,57,181,5.0,1/28/2017,"Burnett and I went to Clematis by Night. The evening was awesome, temperature was just right. Stopped into Pizza Girls and shared a Slice of Hawaiian Pizza . Enjoyed the group Eclipse. Pam was amazing. They played a variety of different hits. After the concert ended we had dinner at Cheesecake Factory. It's been a while since I've been there.. Burnette had Grilled Pork Chops served with mash potatoes and green beans and I had Jamaican Chicken and Chipotle Sauce. Bon Appetite I will never get tired of the Cheesecake Factory."
Roy C.,"Jupiter, FL",0,3,,2.0,7/29/2017,"We went for lunch on a weekday. Yes. Portions are large, but priced accordingly. However the wine is super expensive, $9.50 a glass for the lowest price chardonnay. That would be OK maybe, if the pour was generous. It wasn't. What a terrible pour and price. We will never do lunch there again or order wine. Lots of better options if you like a glass of wine with lunch."
Elizabeth P.,"Jupiter, FL",291,34,13,2.0,7/11/2017,"The shit is super mediocre. Not all of Cheesecake Factories, just the one in west palm. Like why did you stop selling ahi tuna? Why is your chicken Madeira never consistent? It's your best selling dish numb nuts. Don't waste your time. It would be one star but I gave you two because that brown bread though."
Sydnee T.,"Wellington, FL",0,1,1,1.0,7/31/2017,"Customer service was awful at the cheesecake takeout ,we ordered two slices of cheesecake and watched everyone who ordered after us get their's first . We waited for more than 15 minutes before we went up to the counter to ask the servers about our cheesecake. They informed us that the cheesecake was being made at the moment, we went back to the spot that we were standing at to wait another 15 minutes. Once that passed we went up to the counter to question them about it for a second time, and when they looked for the order they found it on the far side of the counter stacked with other cheesecake. When the server grabbed our cheesecake she sloppily placed it in a bag and I grabbed it and walked away, there was no apologies about their service. I am highly disappointed at the fact that our order was disregarded and other people's orders were placed above us."
Jérôme M.,"Grandview Heights, West Palm Beach, FL",5,4,2,4.0,8/3/2017,Nice place to eat as usual with the cheesecake factory. Good seafood and good burgers. The pizza for the kids is a perfect alternative.
Robert E.,"West Palm Beach, FL",1,35,2,1.0,10/1/2017,"Ordered Chicken and Avocado salad. Arrived without Avocado, cilantro, cashews, tortilla strips and very little chicken. Great Bartender Jill made it right. Ordered a piece of chocolate cake to go and they squeezed it into a box where all the chocolate was stuck to the container. Not what I was expecting when paying $8 for a slice of cake"
Lori S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,43,29,3.0,5/20/2017,"Average. The food is predictable - no matter the location. But, after all, that's ok for kids.  The service is unsettlingly fast and tables are cleared with crashing and clanking on either side of us. It's sorta like a high-end diner these days; big menu with so-so food and a ton of bussers running about. Oh well. It's dinner."
