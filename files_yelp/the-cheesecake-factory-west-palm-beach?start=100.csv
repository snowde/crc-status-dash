Jade C.,"Delray Beach, FL",183,263,684,3.0,10/13/2013,"I am always amazed by the bizarre and extensive menu at The Cheesecake Factory. Regardless, we ended up at this location at about 11:30pm Saturday night and it was a pleasant surprise that the full menu was available until 12:30am.  The server was a bit of a let down. Not personable, we only saw him to take the order, after the food came via someone else and for the bill at the end, which was a shame because I was wanting to order a glass of wine which never happened.  I ordered the Spicy Cashew Chicken. Firstly in my opinion it wasn't spicy, it had a zesty kick but only because of major overkill of onions and garlic. I think it should have been renamed ""Onion Chicken"", because the cashew was certainly not the star of the show, more like a element for crunchy texture. There was several times I bit into a full garlic clove which wasn't very pleasant. But overall the chicken made the dish edible and almost enjoyable.  We skipped the cheesecake because it was late, in retrospect that probably would have been the highlight of the night. Overall experience was a-ok."
Tammy P.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,14,3,5.0,1/8/2016,"Fun dinner after the play at the Kravis Center.  Appetizers and drinks were good, bread was excellent, but the star of the show was the shrimp and chicken gumbo which put New Orleans on our next vacay itinarary...and we loved our waitress who sold us a cheesecake for the road.  Who says chains aren't good?"
Kim B.,"Port St Lucie, FL",5,20,2,2.0,4/3/2016,"Not impressed! Order Long Island it was so bad I sent it back, tasted like pure sour mix. Then I had the chicken lettuce wraps, each containing 1/2 ounce of meat, needless to say they were very filling!"
Shine W.,"Renton, WA",730,30,431,4.0,5/23/2014,"The location is pretty good right in the heart of Palm Beach downtown. So you can catch a show, go to a bar, or do a little shopping with ease. The service was good our waiter was attentive and courteous. The food was decent and had large portions. The milkshakes were probably the best part, however, the mixed drinks were kind of weak. I was so full afterwards I forgot to leave room for dessert aka their Cheesecake."
Rich K.,"Lake Worth, FL",10,9,4,1.0,11/26/2015,Horrible experience.  Was told 25 min wait was 50 min. I would have went somewhere else had I known.  The ordered food.  Took almost 2 hours.  All told over 3 hours for bad food bad service. Go anywhere else in city place you'd be much better off. Messed up our night.......m
Yeimel F.,"West Palm Beach, FL",2,2,3,5.0,1/7/2015,"The food is delicious and the service outstanding. I felt in love with place, expecially my fiance.  This is a beautiful place to have dinner....  I really recommend this place !!!"
Brian R.,"Boca Raton, FL",898,1221,4079,3.0,1/27/2016,"Of the big chain eateries, Cheesecake Factories are distinguished by high quality food and chefs who are good culinary artists just shy of a standalone fine dining restaurant. They're big and raucous places, with menus that are broad so that there is something for everyone. I eat off their ""skinny"" menu where the calories are under 590. The problem is that really, most of their food should be no more than 800 calories. Much of what they serve is like a day-plus worth of food. In effect, they're like the upscale Burger King. You go to a place with the name ""Cheesecake"" in it, you expect a certain level of decadence, I suppose, but half the time the oversized menu even works against dessert lovers because you're too full to actually enjoy dessert, unless you came there just for that.  The skinny menu was a response to their gluttonous bill of fare, but the better response might be to join the movement of restaurants that are delivering high taste and even fairly rich foods, but in portions that are kinder to their patrons' waistlines and hearts.  They lose another star for their tip calculator, which suggests tips on the total, not the sub-total. Sales tax is neither a good nor a service, and the only thing it does is give a raise to the servers from the math-challenged. It is incredibly tacky, particularly for a big chain."
Jaime A.,"Leadville, CO",0,2,,2.0,12/27/2015,"VERY Disappointed! NOT worth the wait. Celebrating 4 birthdays  with a party of 10 (5 of which from out of state and county too) was a dud here. Fortunately the food and waitress were overall good. From not being told the pager did not work outside, writing my phone number down wrong causing it to go from a 2 hour wait to 3 hours. One meal was ""still being made"" when everyone else's came out. Brought out over 10 minutes later. Bartenders not being able to make a popular drink for my mom due to not having a recipe...and in the day of Google?! The manager was open to my honest yet constructive and respectful feedback, but the action was a simple 2 small pieces of cheesecake on the house. My sister in Texas who sent us $200 in birthday gift certs will not be  happy to hear that her special  night out included this negative experience with the Cheesecake Factory. Quote from my mom ""very disappointed."" Quote from Dad ""I'd give them a 2.5 out of 10."" I have no plans of returning to this restaurant and I doubt any of my family will either. NOT worth the wait of putting name on list at 5:30 and not getting meal until 9. - Jaime, Judy, and family."
Patrick L.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",0,13,2,4.0,10/24/2015,"Good food, pretty good service. I went there because I need to go to a place quick to eat and close to city place. But it is a normal run-of-the-mill Cheesecake Factory."
Lori J.,"Atlanta, GA",2,21,3,4.0,2/4/2015,"This is the best Cheesecake Factory I've been to in South Florida. My group and I were seated quickly, server was prompt/attentive, and the food was great (even on a busy Saturday night). Parking was a breeze; right across the street in the garage next to Macy's. I was able to get it validated after 2 hours."
Maggie L.,"Boynton Beach, FL",1,8,1,4.0,9/25/2015,"Tiramisu was awesome, best I've had yet . First Cheesecake Factory experience, & it was enjoyable"
Sherida H.,"Hollywood, FL",5,7,10,3.0,4/16/2015,"I'm always greeted with such friendly staff at each location I've visited. I took advantage of the cool night to dine outside; seems like everyone else had the same idea. That night I wanted to try something different, Salmon Genovese with basil almond couscous was speaking to me. The salmon was made perfectly however, I never had such an oily couscous. Luckily the center had less sauce. It was a lovely evening in the end as I sipped on my pineapple and cherry garnished Mai Tai. (I believe there was some tequila added in the mix?)"
Lisa T.,"West Palm Beach, FL",39,49,28,5.0,10/4/2014,Prices are very reasonable...but just make sure you get there before the hotel vans drop off. It gets CRAZY! My girlfriends and I love going here and bs'ing the night away.
Kevin D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",6,82,69,5.0,5/1/2015,"From the hostess to our server named Brittany the service was excellent, the food (Mac N cheese Burger ) was great!!!"
Charles K.,"Laval, Canada",0,2,,4.0,8/4/2015,"Good service, good food and great accessible location!  Had the fish tacos and they were great, maybe a little too big a portion I couldn't eat any cakr after!"
Ivette R.,"Miami, FL",268,1047,251,5.0,11/9/2014,This Cheesecake Factory in Downtown is awesome the S'mores Cheesecake is delicious and staff is friendly
Matthew K.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,1,,1.0,10/7/2016,"Now, I usually do not write reviews because I don't want to tarnish the rating of an establishment, but after many poor experiences, it had to happen. I have only dined in at this particular location on two separate occasions, and it was sub-par at best.  The service is polite, yet not very knowledgeable and extremely slow.  More frequently, i order my Cheesecake Factory as a carry out, and what an abysmal experience it is every time.  Now, tonight, Oct 7, was the final straw. I called to place a ToGo order and was greeted with the typical rude & rushed phone answer only to be ""transferred to the bakery."" I literally sat on hold for 8 minutes with no response or an answer, at which point i decided enough was enough and went somewhere else to eat. This has happened NUMEROUS times before, as i mentioned earlier, I frequently order to go.  In the past i have been told 15-20 min for my food (typically 1 entree), only to arrive and end up waiting at least 45 minutes total every time. If thats how long it is going to take, then tell the customer that on the phone. I am exceptionally disappointed by the way i was treated today, and in the past, and because of that, I will not be returning to this location.  When you finally do get the food, it is adequate, despite the typical overcooking of my chicken madiera. There are way better and more customer friendly options in the area, wouldn't recommend."
Master U.,"Washington, DC",0,2,,1.0,3/24/2016,Sucks!  Big bland food  hostess was worthless 7 people in a booth for 4! And we did not want to sit on top of each other. Slow slow slow. Last time ever!
Ryan C.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,7,,5.0,8/6/2014,"Just visited The Cheesecake Factory again. So good as always.  Great food and staff. Really knows how to execute. I've been there during the day, at night, and prime weekend times. Excellent job each time.  Our server April was superb both times she's waited on us. One thing about these people that review these places is they have no idea how hard it is to run a place like this.  Cheesecake factory executes wonderfully.  Most people on here have no clue and being as I am in the industry myself I can say what a great job this place does. Half the people reviewing are just bitter about their own lives. Im know bad experiences happen and people may not like every restaurant they visit but unless they are actually mistreating you or poisoning you stop complaining so much.  If you go out looking for issues your going to find them and its probably your fault. Good job Cheesecake Factory!"
Amanda W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",27,20,19,4.0,8/27/2014,"We almost always sit at the bar ( when we are child-free) ALWAYS order the raspberry martinis. THEY ARE SO GOOD! They remind me of a jelly doughnut.  Bartenders are always friendly and attentive. The avocado eggrolls are always great. We had the ahi carpaccio on our last visit. It was delicious! Highly recommended.  Bang-bang Chicken And Shrimp, very good. we've also had Evelyns Favorite Pasta and Miso Salmon on other occasions, also good. Huge sharing portions. Always good here for us."
