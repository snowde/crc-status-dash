Milo R.,"Lake Worth, FL",879,29,98,1.0,7/19/2015,"It started with a wait of approximately 30 mins for a table for 2. I took out my mother who was visiting me from NYC to a ""eating out pleasant experience"". Our appetizers arrived along with our entree... So we didn't get to enjoy our appetizers. Aliette the server was so incompetent ringing up our orders in a timely manner she even forgot about our soups and has the nerve to bring the soups as we are eating our entree and ask ""if we want them after our meal?""! On top of her bad service we were sat next to an open and close gate that employees use to head to the patio; here I realized the employees have no consideration for their patrons that are sat there (in this case mom and I) they slammed the gate door at least a good 50 times. And on top of that I asked for honey mustard with my sweet potato fries, I finished my burger first before Aliette even decided to check back on us. By this time my fries were cold and I had no honey mustard so I didn't even want them anymore. I finally asked to speak to her supervisor since her costumer service and the lack of respect the other employees had for us by slamming that gateway door had me over the roof. Kate (the manager) walks up to us and does not accommodate nor even offer anything for us to make us feel better about this horrible experience. To top it off Aliette charges us for our uneaten soups which she has control of when it comes to the time they arrive at our table since she's the one who has to prep and run them for her own tables but brought them after our entrees. Therefore this is why I am taking time out of my busy life to write this review because from the management to the staff this location needs a major Tabatha makeover when it comes to service and presentation. Never will I visit this location again."
Shan S.,"Palm Beach County, FL",5,49,4,1.0,4/4/2015,"I've been to this location plenty of times & up until this point I had no complaints. A few nights ago my wife & I went in for take out. As I stood there looking at cheesecakes, deciding if I was going to get a slice or not my wife says, ""wow! There's mosquitos on that cheesecake"". Completely disgusting. We told the guy behind the counter & he took it out. He walks over to the manager, goes back to the cake & takes the slices off that had the mosquitos on it then PUTS IT BACK ON DISPLAY. I couldnt believe that they would handle a situation like that infront of customers. Niether the manager or guy behing the bar apologized or even showed any concern. It was almost if this wasnt the first time. It really made me never want to eat out again let alone there. I will be writing a letter to the corporate & to the manager that oversees this location."
J-Whit W.,"Park Ridge, IL",0,25,2,2.0,3/31/2015,A really expansive menu. Be sure to ask for recommendations to get be best/freshest food. We visited during spring break late in evening. Not crowded but OMG is service slow.  Friendly but soo slow. Food was quite good and reasonable in the end.
Zandra R.,"Boynton Beach, FL",39,65,45,4.0,11/24/2013,"I met my friends here for a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon. It was pretty full but they still had no wait. That was quite a surprise. The waiter was very prompt and polite.  He refilled our drinks a lot. Our food was really yummy, as expected.  Overall a great experience.  If you've never dined at a Cheesecake Factory, they have a very extensive menu from salads, to sandwiches, to Asian and Mexican. Everything is really rich and the portions are huge. The prices are on the high side but the food is generally yummy. They have a skinny menu but the meals are in the 500 calorie range. This is not a place to watch your calories.  Then there is the cheesecake.  My favorites are the dulce de leche and red velvet. The cheesecake is big enough to share."
Patrick L.,"San Diego, CA",209,466,198,2.0,12/30/2010,"I can quickly summarize this place: - Food is ok - nothing great, most everything good/acceptable - Cheesecake is above average with lots of creative variations (red velvet cheesecake?) - Significantly overpriced, especially for beverages, soups, and appetizers - Advertising on menus (really, like for local dating websites - very chintzy - at these prices you think they can afford to print menus without ad support) - We had two servers, both couldn't care less about our experience or our food, trained to ask how's the meal and have a nice day but don't really care about your answer Food is about 3 stars but all in all the experience is 2 stars.  For the price, I'd rather have three meals elsewhere. Come here if you want dessert - share a piece of cake with your lovie .  Have dinner somewhere else."
Seth L.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,87,38,2.0,1/20/2015,"Typical Cheesecake Factory experience, however this location is not nearly as polished as others. Cuban Sandwich EXCELLENT. Ice Coffee is really bad (they poor hot coffee over ice). Fruit Cup served with some of the brunch dishes were old and not fresh, I can't believe they even served it. Could the fruit have been sitting under a heat lamp since it was hot? Service was really really slow with not a manager in sight."
Ada P.,"West Palm Beach, FL",15,1,,5.0,1/4/2015,I went with a party of two are waiter was great sadly I dont remember his name we had raspberry lemonades which where great for are appetizer we had the buffalo chicken strips and for my main course I had the Americana burger with a side of Mac and cheese and fried it was huge I took the Half of it home we had no more space for desert but I do recommend the Oreo cheesecake and the dule de leche one also I love commeing here we come at least once or twice a month great service and food!!
Autumn S.,"Decatur, GA",106,234,5,3.0,5/20/2013,"Huge almost overwhelming menu and very loud. They do have enough options though to suit the taste of even the most picky family members which is a big plus for me.  Can't say this would be my first, second, or even third choice of restaurant however I have always eaten my dishes received. It's not memorable dishes but I do remember I enjoy each time.  The drinks are a bit mix flavored but again when out with a big family this place works. I'm sure if someone loved cheesecake they would be able to up the star count but I'm not a fan of cheesecake so I'm sure that makes me a little biased.  Also with the location of this place it can at times take way to long to be seated."
Yang Z.,"Key West, FL",2,3,17,4.0,12/22/2013,nice store in nice place. First time to be here palm beach and just drive by. Never knew here is such a pretty town. Gotta visit here sometime.
Adam R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",4,38,,3.0,2/13/2015,"I've read the story of how the cheesecake factory came to be, great story, but seems like this cheesecake factory is not like the others. The staff is slow, slower than I've ever been to at any of the other cheesecake factory establishments, and they are not friendly. I ordered two appetizers and a slice of cheesecake for a small lunch with my girl, and they say 20 minutes. I went there, and they said, yes.. 20 minutes, after it had been 20 minutes. The staff was lallygagging and when I said to check on the entrees, they didn't check. Than, once I saw the bill for two appetizers and one slice of cheesecake, I realized, this cheesecake factory decided, based on the area, to charge 1.4 times the average cost- I smell corruption is all I have to say."
Cindy G.,"West Palm Beach, FL",2,85,17,3.0,12/18/2014,"Love the location and the ambiance but a little disappointed in the food.  Had the Sweet Corn Tamales in Orlando and they were thick, hearty and delicious.  Had them at City Place and they were thin, falling apart and cold!!!  They had a ton of sour cream stacked on them - could have been to hide how thin they were.   Very sad - was looking forward to a great meal.   I guess I'll have to go to Orlando.   Better watch your quality - you're getting quite a bit of competition around you.   Almost forgot - SUPER LOUD!   Avoid if you are looking for a quiet evening or if you wear a hearing aid !!"
Rachel M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",4,81,26,3.0,10/27/2014,Sat outside for Saturday brunch. Table was dirty!!! Food was ok but I'd rather eat dinner there. Usually crowded in evenings. Not the cleanest place...
Iryna S.,"Orlando, FL",45,145,9,5.0,5/28/2014,Can't go wrong with a Cheesecake Factory - no matter where you are. We were pleasantly surprised for such short wait (5 min) on Saturday evening. Our server was just fantastic! As far as food - as good as it it at any one of those restaurants.
Melissa l.,"Jupiter, FL",0,28,7,2.0,1/24/2015,"Came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon   Service was slow, they forgot to put in my order, put mayo on my friends burger when she asked for no mayo and they were slow on drinks    I might give it another try- but not sure.  Plenty of other restaurants to try"
Noinya B.,"New York, NY",11,105,116,3.0,9/7/2012,"Food is tasty!  Dessert is good! But everything on their menu is heavy on the calories! ""Even their light menu leaves you full"""
Arnaud B.,"Naples, FL",0,5,,4.0,12/19/2013,"We were 2, it was full but we had to wait less than 10 minutes. Very nice server and the meal was great. We got the dinner outside where I think was the best place because the interior was pretty loud. Menu is pretty big and you'll find everything you want."
Matt H.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",3,17,5,3.0,4/11/2014,"Four of us went for lunch on vacation. It was just an average experience, probably wouldn't go back. $100 lunch would be better spent somewhere else."
Becca T.,"Brickell, Miami, FL",15,50,6,2.0,12/31/2012,"Food is average at best... I could never understand the hype of this place...  The food always sucks to me.... Pros: Good service, waitress was really nice.., Cons: food is bland..try something else, come here as a last resort!"
Vanesa E.,"West Palm Beach, FL",78,53,23,4.0,1/26/2014,"It's Cheesecake Factory, portions are huge and although it's my 100th time here, it's always a mission to pick out something on the menu, I always share an entree bc the portions are just too much for one, easy as that, don't eat it all and don't complain ! Sheesh! Oh and order cheesecake too :)"
Alexis R.,"Greenacres, FL",1,2,2,2.0,11/21/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but tonight me and my family tried to come in with 8 people. And instead of accommodating a bigger table over a 2 person table they told us that either our party gets there in 5 minutes and it'll be 20 minutes. So we did that and they told us it would be 2 hours and 30 minutes. They do not know how to keep the bigger paying tables , and I am very disappointed in them."
