Chantel G.,"Lake Worth, FL",26,95,29,4.0,4/6/2012,"Always something that sounds good, the menu is huge, maybe a little too big even, but you get the hang of it eventually. Their prices are good and the portions are HUGE, I have never had less than two or three meals from each dish! Don't expect to get out of there without ordering your entire days worth of calories, but it is worth it!  I am a big fan of the Louisiana Pasta, and their ranch dressing is the best around. I sometimes even buy a jar of it to bring home..it is that good! I always get ranch to eat with their delicious bread...the pumpernickel is amazing! Sangria is really yummy too. I don't like cheesecake, I know, I am a freak...but their chocolate cake is really good."
Tony S.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,11,,2.0,10/14/2011,"Server was slow. All meals came out at different times with 2 meals coming 40 minutes after the first two came.  Food was average at best. I don't know if we had a new server, but it wasn't busy and we were there for 2 hours.  Fix it management!"
Andy T.,"Winter Park, Orlando, FL",0,19,,3.0,6/5/2015,I love their food it's always fresh and consistent. However I almost always have to wait 15-30 minutes to be seated even though when I look they always have lots of free tables.  They seem to be quite bad at managing there wait staff in/off time.
Aaron M.,"Marblehead, MA",38,38,4,3.0,6/3/2014,"Arrived later side on a Monday night. Seemed like they made cuts a bit too early. Server was pleasant but weeded. Fries with burger came when we were done eating. We received everything we ordered and food was fine, but pacing was off. Server brought check without offering us cheesecake, even though we wanted cheesecake to take home. Not the best but it's Cheesecake Factory, we know what to expect."
Lee S.,"Palm Beach, FL",31,225,13,4.0,10/4/2011,"My bartender Jill was great on my last visit Tuesday night. I had the Vietnamese Spring/Shrimp Rolls...tasty but not done correctly, It's quite obvious these were made ahead and kept chilled (as they were way colder than they should be) and the casings were soggy and nearly falling off.  I'm used to the real spring rolls made by the Vietnamese in LA & San Francisco therefore I don't think I will be having these at CF again but I will go to CF again."
Julie K.,"Middlesex County, MA",0,25,,5.0,3/2/2012,"My sister and I were in WPB, and we had lunch here recently. She had raved about how good the food is, so I said, ""Why not?"" The food is fabulous. I had a HUGE! chicken ranch salad, and I barely got through half the lunch-sized serving. The pink ranch dressing was yummy, and there was tons of chicken. Snagged some pumpernickel bread, and it was also delicious. Our waitress was attentive and friendly without being overly so, which is a plus. So glad they have CF up north!"
Brett S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,142,,4.0,1/28/2012,"We have been going to Cheese Cake for years. The food is usually good  With decent size portions. My favorite is either any of the salads or chicken dish's washed down with their passion fruit ice tea. The service is usually very good unless it gets over crowded. This men's going early and skipping Friday nights. This year they added a ""Skinnydelicious"" menu. This compromises of low calorie choices. I also like the dark pumpernickel bread which is served hot. The ambiance is exceptional and thy spend lot's of money in providing a visual presentation. I notice some feel this is expensive, but I on't hare that view. You get what you pay for and their popularity speaks for itself."
Laz J.,"Palm Springs, CA",138,19,1,1.0,1/18/2015,"I would recommend that if you want takeout go to another place.   I've had the Farro salad at other locations and love it so I especially ordered it for a specific diet I'm following.   Once I got back to my convention and opened the bag,  I almost cried.   Took a picture and returned to the restaurant to show the manager.   I explained I was on a special diet of one meal a day and how disappointed I was.   He first asked what I wanted so I asked him what he would do to fix the situation.  He offered me a slice of cheesecake!   Did you not listen?  Then he offered me another salad.   Ummmmm, the one meal had passed.  When I asked for my money back he said ""we don't do that at CF."" So I asked for a voucher.  ""We don't do that either.  I can only offer you food""  Bye bye CF.  Wish I could add a picture of the 2 tablespoons of Farro"
Bruce D.,"Palm Beach, FL",0,46,1,1.0,11/25/2013,Was at the Doctors. left and saw the Cheesecake Factory!  Thought gotta have a good Cheesecake.  Ordered at the bar and got the plain option with a little whipped cream.  WHAT !!!!  The worst Cheese Cake. Tasted more like CREAM Pie.  Very little flavor and not at all thick?  For God's sakes....live up to your name.
Linda M.,"Boynton Beach, FL",3,71,15,5.0,3/14/2014,"I wish I can give   favorite restaurant. Nice portions and quality food. And u need to try the cheesecake godiva if u love chocolate or the oreo. Actually all of them are perfect, combined with cappuccino coffee.  Relaxing place nice decor . reasonable prices, good service."
T N.,"West Palm Beach, FL",3,51,2,5.0,3/10/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory never fails. No matter which city I'm in... the quality of food and service at TCF is the same. Of course, my local Cheesecake Factory is my favorite. I try to stop in once and while for their Happy Hour. Vietnamese Tacos & Lettuce Wraps are Yummy! Did I mention Happy Hour???? This means the drinks are $5 each.  Most days, Happy hour is over by the time I get home from work. That doesn't stop me from joining in for Cheesecake  factory dinner. Teriyaki Chicken is my favorite dish at this place. This dish comes with rice, grilled pineapple and bananas.  You can't come to this place without ordering a slice of Cheesecake. Let me tell you... the slice is huge and there is plenty to share. There's so many flavors I can't pick a favorite. Fresh banana, strawberry, Godiva chocolate, upside-down pineapple, chocolate mousse, and original are just some of the flavors I always order.  I can't believe the some people have never heard of Cheesecake factory. My friends would fall in love after I bring them here for the first time."
Bryan G.,"West Palm Beach, FL",33,10,,3.0,3/15/2014,This is not one of the better cheesecake factory's around.  And I am not a fan of the 45 page menu. Service is ok. The gardens cheesecake has better food. Try brio across the street instead.
Patty W.,"Lake Worth, FL",280,1063,1750,4.0,1/26/2011,"What a great place to go and catch up with an old co-worker of mine.  It was quick to get seated and I must say that the orange chicken with rice I had was alright.  It was kinda dry, but I didn't send anything about it.  I think it was because I was talking more than I was eating and it tend to make my dinner a little less flavorful.  The white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheese was perfect.  Of course, it came with a bunch of whipped cream.  This cheesecake has everything that I love, love, LOVE.  It's always best to come here during the week since it can get slammed on the weekends.  It's located in Cityplace, so you can go shopping, bar hopping, or get your dance on if you feel like it before or after your experience here."
Michael K.,"East Walpole, MA",15,16,,2.0,4/26/2013,"Stopped by for lunch a week ago.  The place was packed and it was really loud.  Our waiter forgot our orders and came back a few times.  While the portions are large, the food wasn't appetizing.  So many better places in the area to eat."
Brooks A.,"Miami Beach, FL",16,100,,4.0,8/13/2013,"Food's great, the restraunt itself is a little loud. I recommend trying the pineapple upsidedown cheesecake. It's absolutely fantastic!"
Taylor C.,"West Palm Beach, FL",2,53,2,4.0,7/28/2013,"Huge portions, great selection, and pretty much any dessert you want. Their is always a wait in the evening but it is worth it. Good service for the most part. Just a little too busy and loud if you're looking to talk over dinner."
Trina S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",257,109,61,2.0,7/30/2014,"Our experience  started very good . Our waitress was nice & attentive . And then she brings the check with a circle around what we should tip. Poor service etiquette. Then explains that this has been a policy for six months . The highest suggested dollar amount for gratuity $2.53 the amount we were going to leave $5 because she did give good service for simple dessert & coffee. What she failed mention our state stopped adding 18% gratuity to parties 6 or more. So management told them it was fine to circle receipts for parties 6 or more. Since it was just my husband. & I she should not have done this. So since I am incapable of tipping a based on great service, I guess $2.53 is what she earned. FYI restaurant servers have been doing this to African American & Latin customers for a years assuming that we don't know how to tip.... It's insulting . I have worked in the food industry, and have been going to restaurants since I was a kid and have always known how to tip for good service even prior to receipt telling me how much to tip. So please make sure your social etiquette is on point it makes the difference in a great night & a poor night . Thank you to the manager for speaking w/us. It didn't restore our happiness, but at least he took consideration that the system is flawed. Now they just need to teach their servers how to own their mistakes. Had the waitress just simply apologize and not given excuse behind it I would've stuck to what I was going to give her. But giving a snippy response and then running to her colleagues to complain that killed it. She got the max that was suggested on the receipt nothing more"
M T.,"Port Saint Lucie, FL",34,421,144,4.0,5/19/2013,"We love eating here on occasion. For us we have never had a bad meal. Our only problem with this visit was the large party's our server was taking care of. A party of two, like us, gets lost in the mix against a party of fourteen. The cheese cake is awesome as usual. We will return in the future."
Naygie R.,"Boynton Beach, FL",3,70,21,4.0,3/15/2011,"Been to many locations & this one beats both Boca & sawgrass.  Loud, yes, but outside seating a plus (during winter & spring months only) FL summers too hot. Food better seasoned than other location.  Sawgrass over-salts their foods, Boca is hit or miss.  If you want peaceful conversation---Not the place.  Lettuce wraps very satisfying & easy on the waist with enough to bring home for next day."
Neil Z.,"Lake Worth, FL",54,210,,4.0,12/6/2010,Ive eaten here so many times I had just about everything on the menu. Everything but the steaks are awesome. The busyness of the restaurant is the only downside. Portions are huge and the prices reflect the size so it's a good deal. Indoor and outdoor seating.
