Glen H.,"West Palm Beach, FL",7,33,22,1.0,5/21/2012,"We have always wondered why we have never made it to The Cheesecake Factory. So a few weeks ago my daughter was due to be at the Kravitz for an awards ceremony, and it was her choice for dinner beforehand, so we found ourselves seated at what I can only describe as Chucky E Cheese(cake), minus the games! (Wait, we still had our server! ) And, the volume level was at 11! Next was the bench/ cafeteria table we were herded to that certainly warranted paying $100.00 for three people to dine......NOT! The service? Well, the low-lights were forgetting our drink orders, bringing out two entrees, and forgetting the third still had to be delivered, and her inability to retrieve a bottle of ketchup. The food? My wife's Burrito Grande was inedible, seasoned with something ""unusual"". My daughters pasta was way undercooked, I guess raw would be appropriate. My meatloaf sandwich was just plain embarrassing, both dry and tasteless, on burnt texas toast! There is a LOT of good food downtown.......But it isn't here!"
Petisha B.,"Palm Beach, FL",84,46,57,3.0,6/7/2012,"Perhaps I'm just not the biggest fan of mega-restaurants... because that is the only reason I'd give cheesecake 3 stars. On Friday's & Saturdays they don't take reservations (I understand because frankly they don't need to, they always have a line & an extensive wait) so theres that. Now the only other negative is their drinks for I don't believe I've ever felt a buzz from a cocktail here. Other than that.... It's all good. Great for groups, old, young, children and indecisive people because the menu is literally pages long, there is something for everyone, prices are fair, and mostly all the food tastes good. I wouldn't recommend this place for a date though- it gets loud on weekends."
Meghann H.,"West Palm Beach, FL",12,42,2,5.0,1/13/2013,"Love love love their cheesecake!!! Tier menu is a little daunting, because its so huge, but their portions are huge.. I usually always have good service here too.."
Jennifer D.,"West Palm Beach, FL",1,26,23,5.0,3/25/2013,Love it here! My siblings & I took my dad here for the first time for his birthday & he loved it! They brought a cake over. He loved the food & the staff.
J J.,"Bridgewater, NJ",21,638,81,1.0,1/4/2012,"Way over crowded, too many items on the menu to be considered fresh.  Wait staff overwhelmed...  We walked out before ordering."
Rudy R.,"Long Beach, CA",1,37,183,3.0,5/26/2014,"Overall most of the food at the Cheese Cake Factory's I have visited have normally been pretty good  - that is, no Yelp smack downs. This was only my second time to this location,   I came in with a group of 10 people and we were all seated in the outside dining area.  I ordered something new for the first time.....the chicken tacos, I know ""not a taco place"" what was I thinking, but since my other visits to other Cheesecake Factory's throughout the county have always been good, what did I have to lose.  Anyways, the taco plate made it to me with the rest of my parties food. Unfortunately the chicken in my tacos was basically cold. I sent it back.  By the time everyone at the table were finished at the table, my tacos were still missing in action in the kitchen....the manager finally offered me a free salad while I waited.  Finally my tacos arrived....it really wasn't worth the wait.  Also, the outside seating area was really noisy due to the traffic,,,,"
Diane D.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,3,,4.0,6/5/2013,My husband and I enjoy coming here. His favorite is the chicken costoletta and Their sangria. The prices are a little pricey but the portions are pretty large.
Joseph W.,"Delray Beach, FL",6,17,21,3.0,7/10/2010,"BLUF:  The Cheesecake Factory has solid food choices when you can't make up your mind what sort of cuisine to have that night.  But this location is 100% packed every friday and saturday, and that does indeed cause the service to suffer."
Miss E S.,"Palm Beach, FL",2,43,16,5.0,1/2/2012,"This rating is for the bar area only.  Jill is an outstanding bartender!  She remembers us every time we stop by, and has our drinks ready for us upon sitting down.  It's pretty amazing how she can remember what drinks we order.  The service in the bar area is good too.  We love their frozen lemonade, sangria and appletinis.  Their happy hour is great, too."
Michael F.,"Cranford, NJ",10,423,,4.0,11/7/2013,"We don't normally get to dine at The Cheesecake Factory because the wait up north is always too long.  I also know whatever you order you will have a mountain of food.  We ordered the Chicken with biscuits, the Chinese Chicken Salad, and the chopped factory salad.  We each had a mountain of food which we all did our best on.  It was all very tasty.  For dessert we had the apple pie crisp and the carrot cake.  Thank God we  had salads!  The pieces were huge and of course very tasty.  We took home the leftovers.     The service was very good and the bread beforehand was delicious.  The place was loud.  Even worse was sitting near the service station and hearing the loud banging of the plates going into the buckets.  It was time almost to call the manager over.  Overall, a very good dining experience."
Stephanie A.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,14,,5.0,7/13/2014,Awesome place I've gone here every year for my birthday for the past 5 years and they never fail to make my day the best
Ken C.,"Lake Worth, FL",29,54,2,1.0,3/10/2013,Wife and mother in law special night ruined due to rat seen in restaurant....wow
Steven T.,"Groveland, FL",51,46,11,2.0,8/14/2011,Too crowded and busy with terrible service. Pay attention to your bill. seating is too close for comfort. Dishes and forks were dirty. Too many loud and rude people in one spot. Turn the lights up in the place as well.
Maggie T.,"Arcadia, CA",15,97,,4.0,8/17/2009,"The first time, we came here tired and hot from the beach.  The waitress was really timid... as if we could make her cry if we wanted to... but she was nice and attentive. The lunch portions are awesome.  We got a cobb salad to share (they're really good with sharing portions, even plate it for you), I got a pasta carbonara (could not resist the second I saw it on the menu), and he got the combo chicken madeira and steak diane.  Every thing was very flavorful and very very very very heavy.  Good thing we got the salad. It was so good that on our last night at palm beach we decided to get takeout from here and kick back at the hotel with the wonderful food. The Shrimp Scampi pasta was PERFECT, except for the vast amount of butter coating it.  The sauce was just the right amount of lemony sour, the whole garlic cloves sweet, the diced tomatoes bright.  The shrimp didn't taste fresh, but were huge and deep fried. The Jamaican black pepper shrimp was packed full of spices, but nothing special. The 30th anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake had to be eaten the next day because we couldn't fit it in during dinner.  It'll probably shorten your lifespan by 1 day or 2.  We skipped the cheesecake part but inhaled the chocolate cake and the chocolate shavings on the side of the cake, along with the fresh whipped cream. I believe this restaurant anchors City Place."
Margaret W.,"Pawleys Island, SC",0,6,,4.0,10/28/2012,"Always enjoy this upscale chain.  Bad impending weather kept most people in, the night I went, so there was no crowd and no waiting, unusual for a Cheesecake factory, but I wan't complaining.  Enjoyed the spicy bang bang shrimp/chicken combo. Nice light curry, coconut milk flavor with a dusting of toasted coconut which just made the dish.  Had enough for a second meal ( another thing I like about this restaurant )  Their bread mixture is always tasty and I behaved and did not try a desert, althought I swear I could hear the calories calling me as I passed by the counter on the way out...It all looked good."
Lena H.,"San Francisco, CA",613,210,352,3.0,6/12/2011,"Portions are ridiculous. Don't they know there are children starving in Africa? Seriously, the amount of food they throw away here makes me sad. I will give them props on their coffee...always get it *to go* and it is delic!"
Cristina V.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",635,135,141,4.0,8/18/2008,"I like to come here when I can't make up my mind about what to eat. Their menu is very extensive. It's a book! Good for a casual dining experience, good to sit outside when the weather is good. They have a dish from just about every cuisine around the Globe. From Thai to Indian to Greek..or you can just order a burger and fries and it will still be good and fresh. I normally order the Ahi Tuna Salad w Avocado. Or a chopped salad w Chicken. I recommend going after the busy lunch hour..Probably around 3ish is good if you don't want to wait.  MUST ORDER THEIR SANGRIA! Any time of the day is good to have it. Must have atleast 2..One before your meal, one with it..They're that good! Most people overlook it, but its there and its deliciously refreshingly fruity and yummy!"
Royal Poinciana Place A.,"West Palm Beach, FL",11,3,22,5.0,7/8/2012,Last night we experienced The Cheese Cake Factory for the first time and were so pleased with the service that we received from Kristin J. The food was divine and the sweet mint green tea was so yummy. Kristin J was very attentive to our needs and even went so far as helping us with a deli ma. We wanted to get some cheese cake to take home with us but were going to the movies and knew the cheese cake would not hold. We asked Kristin J what we could do to be able to enjoy the cheese cake after our movie at home. Kristin J left to see what we could do and came back with the solution- they will hold the cheese cakes in the bakery for us to pick up after the movie. I can honestly tell you my mother and I were speechless at the customer service we were being offered. This was the best experience that we have ever had at a restaurant and will be repeat customers. Kristin J was phenomenal as a service and someone we hope we can get the next time we come!
Tanjila A.,"New York, NY",128,135,26,4.0,1/14/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is always a winner... but I'm not exactly a fan of this particular location. It's just always ridiculously packed, and the service suffers from it. But the food is always great."
Jennifer H.,"San Francisco, CA",296,525,4,4.0,6/26/2007,"Yes, I'm in Florida and I'm eating at C.F. people!  Remember the friend who was the reason for us bypassing any line at the S.F. location?  Well now she's in FL and since we love this place so much, we had to relive our olden days by eating here once again.  Yummy food as always...and nice location.  It's located in an outdoor shopping center, complete with movie theaters. Super clean, clean, and white! Love their sandwiches, their caesar salads, their guacamole, the tex mex egg rolls, and I'm not big on cheesecake but the make a good dulce de leche one.  Yum! P.S.  Forgo the cheesecake and order the lemon cake.  It seriously is RIDIC-ulously good!"
