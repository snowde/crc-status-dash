GM D.,"Atlantic City, NJ",46,93,4,3.0,1/1/2010,"It's a chain what can I say? It's good food, but nothing other than chain food.... Michael always gets the Asian Chicken salad,,,I always get a cup of soup and the chopped salad,,,It's good portions and there is outside seating which is cool for people watching.... get the passion fruit tea though... really good... and of course....Pumpkin Cheesecake with whipped creme around the holidays."
Kim C.,"Lake Worth, FL",1,6,,4.0,11/30/2010,"Had the Sangria and tasted the Long Island Ice Tea. Both were pretty good. I just don't like when restaurants force you to the bar to cash in on the drink specials. Anyways, ordered appetizers...the Samosas, Crab Wontons, and the Calamari. Liked it all except the Calamari, it was a good batter but the pieces are big and hard to deal with. Liked the Wonton sauce but some may find it a lil heavy with the vinegar. Overall, cannot beat the Chocolate Coconut Cheesecake...although, I usually get the White Chocolate Truffle which is amazing."
Men E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,,4.0,6/22/2011,Good food - typical consistent fresh cheesecake factory fair.
Jan T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",11,146,70,2.0,4/24/2011,Just left here. Dined with 6 other people and everyone's meal was Luke warm at best. Food was nothing special and overpriced I think. They do have tons of things to choose from so there's something for everyone. I didn't have dessert so no rating on that. The waitress was pleasant and apologetic for the cold food. I wouldn't recommend here. I will say I've been to the sawgrass location a few times before and it's with strong conviction I can say if I am responsible for picking the place to dine cheesecake factory will not be an option.
victoria r.,"Palm Beach, FL",390,636,25,2.0,8/31/2008,"I personally prefer the Cheesecake Factory in Boca Raton better. However, this location is much closer to my place and right in City Place Downtown West Palm Beach. Like any Cheesecake I've been to it is almost alway packed! Indoor, bar, and outdoor seating. Staff is friendly. Menu is the same variety of all Cheesecakes. (May I add they give to too much variety! ugh) Valet right across the street, street parking, or garages available."
Nino B.,"Palm Beach, FL",27,31,,5.0,8/8/2009,Very very good. I have been going here for years. Get there early unless you want to wait. Get full very quickly.
