Alycia K.,"Tannersville, PA",85,10,,1.0,9/22/2017,The food was terrible. Management was clueless. Waste of a night out with family from out of town.
Nick M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",57,2,,1.0,6/3/2017,"Unfortunately Yelp doesn't give the option to give zero stars.  This was one of the worst dining experiences I've had the misfortune of having.  It was my father in-laws birthday so we got a table for 6.  The dining experience started out great. We were told there was a 20-30 minute wait. Five minutes later we were sitting down. Our server was very friendly, but seemed overwhelmed.  He did his best to keep us happy.  I wouldn't suggest wasting your money on cocktails.  There are plenty of places in CityWalk to get a good drink.  Their manager Eric is very unprofessional.  If you have any issues arise during your dining experience - be sure to ask for Alicia. She was very courteous, understanding, and professional."
Glenda R.,"Kissimmee, FL",54,113,307,5.0,12/13/2014,"Absolutely awesome!! Amazing food, great vibes at great prices!!!  Would I go back?  Yes!!!"
Jason S.,"Boca Raton, FL",154,21,5,1.0,2/22/2017,We're not able to divide check and made it difficult for my table. What kind of place can't split a check?! LOL I won't be back at Cheesecake Factory West Palm for a while.
Ann H.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,69,1,1.0,1/22/2017,"Worst Cheesecake experience ever. 1pm Jan 22. Rude hostess. Useless server. Too many details to write, but I'll never go back. These girls need to be trained."
Melissa M.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",0,17,10,2.0,5/13/2017,"This is ridiculous, 20 minutes waiting for a piece of carrot cake. This restaurant needs some good engineering to improve their processes. There is a bottleneck of people at the entrance: some waiting to be seated, others coming out, others doing line to order from the bakery, others waiting for their order, waitresses coming to get their customers orders ... a chaos. The employees are doing too many things at the same time instead of having a production line. In addition, instead of preparing the desserts for the customers eating at the restaurant in a separate area, they do it in the same place and that delays the process even more. This restaurant has good food and variety but needs to work on that in all of their restaurants. Honestly, I done feel I am going to come back any time soon. It's always the same mess. Very uncomfortable experience."
Cat A.,"Lake Park, GA",1,31,5,3.0,3/17/2017,The menu is extensive and the service is fine. It's just a really noisy place making it hard to have a conversation during dinner.
Vishal S.,"Wellington, FL",10,1,3,1.0,3/28/2017,This is the last time I'm ever coming to this place for service sucks set down for the first 15 minutes with no water no bread nothing and then everything just went down from there
Tiffany C.,"New York, NY",112,94,119,5.0,7/28/2016,"Went here for lunch. Customer service was great. Our server was attentive and kind. W ordered the lunch special thai salmon...I was delicious !!!! For apps, we ordered fried mac and cheese balls. That was also delicious!!! everything came out great."
Susan B.,"Wellington, FL",19,111,,4.0,7/20/2016,"This place serves very good food and we are never disappointed at the serving size, taste or quality of the food served.  We took our three well behaved teenaged granddaughters there Monday about 3:00pm since we wanted no wait and hoped to have a quieter experience than we usually do when we dine there primetime.  Our server was very nice and knowledgeable but we had to flag staff for drink refills.  We ordered a lot of food and were handed the menus for dessert without the table being cleared.  We finally got another server to do that for us.  There were 4 servers there by 4pm and most were standing around talking to each other.  That is unusual for the CF since their service always matches their food - consistently excellent.  Perhaps management needs to be more visible at slower times.  Our server was lovely and helpful, just absent and unavailable too much of the time."
Jon N.,"Jupiter, FL",31,63,2,4.0,11/12/2016,"We have been coming to Cheesecake Factory for years.   The menu is great, they cover every taste.   Hard not to find something for your pallet.      They must tell the servers to go lightly on the bread.   Getting a 2nd order isn't as easy as one would think.    If you decide to eat out on the patio be very careful of the umbrella stands.   They are painted the same color as the floor and you would think the maitre d would warn you.   Not the case, I tripped over one and thank God I kept my balance or I would have ended up on a table with people eating.   At the end of the meal we ordered a piece of cheesecake to go.   My wife ordered lemon raspberry.  When we got home which was within the hour we opened the container.  I should of taken a picture of it.   First off, it was a small piece.   Not worthy of the $7.95 price.    To make it even worse, the bottom was soggy.   That tells me it's not one of their more popular flavors.   What's going on? Are the slices bigger if eaten there, smaller when taken home?   If I saw the waiter delivering that piece to a table I'd say no way am I ordering cake that is how small it was. UPDATE...........Shortly after I was contacted by the mgr.   You can definitely see customers are #1 with Cheesecake Factory"
Hardev M.,"Boca Raton, FL",198,25,5,4.0,6/11/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory never disappointments. Arrives and only had to wait 15 minutes on a Saturday evening. The location is downtown West Palm with numerous restaurants and lively atmosphere in the area. The menu is extensive and you will find a dish no matter what you are in the mood for - pasta, salad, fish, burgers etc. I ordered the Mac n Cheese topped veggie burger which was absolutely delicious and even came with a side of fries. Both meals were brought out at the same time and very hot. For dessert we ordered a Hershey's cake which was very rich in chocolate and filling. Overall it was a great dinning experience in a nice ambiance."
Yusimi L.,"Fountain, CO",32,11,12,5.0,8/22/2016,"Favorite chain restaurant of all time. Their menu has something for everyone. The only downside is the wait sometimes can be excessive. But some days it's not too bad. Every time we go we get the avocado egg roll appetizers, they are to die for. This day we went for brunch and were lucky to get seated right away. The food and service is amazing."
James A.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,1,,1.0,3/19/2017,Meals came out wrong Remade mine Did not remake my wife's and it came back cold. She sent it back again and did not even have her meal.  Manager did us a favor and took her meal off the bill but nothing else to resolve the problem. Including it taking over 1.5hours for an omelette.  Managers response to customer service was awful - after we said something else the manager allowed the server to comp our coffee -   We used to come here very often as we live 1 block away.  I guess we won't be back here until at least we forget about how poor of an experience it was.
Nicole R.,"Vestal, NY",1,17,,4.0,3/22/2017,Your basic CCF. In a very busy part of town. Menu is consistent. Wait time is usual. A very busy location.
Walfre V.,"Stuart, FL",0,2,,1.0,11/16/2016,If you are a person of color good luck with  mediocre service at best. We waited 1 1/2 Hour for our dinner that had no favor and just plain cold. We were not the only people with issues.
Carlos D.,"Miami, FL",1,33,41,4.0,11/13/2016,"The food was really good I had an avocado chicken club Sandwhich with a side salad, they forgot my dressing, when I first got her my waitress was a lil rude she didn't even introduced her self or say hello she basically came to the table and said what do you guys wanna drink, I felt rushed to order and I had to ask her for bread, finally Jesus took the wheel and our waitress left and we were taken over by a very polite and friendly waitress that was very attentive thank you Michelle for changing this experience around....."
Burj S.,"Boca Raton, FL",238,316,1420,4.0,1/5/2015,"OK OK OK I will have to change my view of TCF after this trip to the West Palm Beach one, oh so different from the one in Boca.  We were very pleasantly greeted at the door and even though it was busy our waitress was very friendly and helpful. The food was good and we had a party of 5 and we all enjoyed our meals which were tasty and the helpings were very generous.  The desserts were amazing as usual. Now the one point I would like to make is what is more important than anything is GOOD SERVICE and for the life of me I cannot understand why such a difference between the Boca one and the WPB one!  As a matter of fact I have stopped going to the Boca one and lucky for us the Grand Luxe Cafe is in the same area (thier upscale Restaurant) so we always go there! Management needs to take note!!"
Raymond K.,"Lake Worth, FL",86,36,33,5.0,1/13/2016,"Celebrated wifes birthday Friday.accepts reservations up to 6pm.party of 6 seated at exactly 6pm.drinks were very good bread comes out   appetizers, wanted to save room for dessert.everyones dinner was delicious.I had the skinny enchiladas, my son in law had the burrito grande,with steak,$5 more, but worth it.we shared 3 pieces of cheesecake, all were awesome , with a happy birthday drawn on my wife plate, and a chorus of happy birthday from the staff.our waitress was excellent.been here a few times, always perfect.a little loud from crowd noise, and always packed, because the food is always delicious.if you want to eat without a wait and without noise, then go enjoy your quiet evening eating crappy food."
Heather M.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,28,24,4.0,10/9/2016,"I must say, Cheesecake Factory has been a hit or miss for me, but during the past few times that I've been there, the food has been great and very consistent. Good service, and fast food runners as well. Really good if your going out with big parties as well. I usually get Parmesan herb crusted chicken, which is one of my personal favorites! Overall, cheesecake is definitely raising the bar with their food and I love the fact that they are always adding new dishes to their menu."
