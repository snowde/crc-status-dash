Lady X.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,28,28,2.0,10/8/2016,"So Cheesecake Factory has long been a go-to favorite of mine for about 10-15 years (particularly Fort Lauderdale/Las Olas). It has stayed with me in recent years because Of the  refreshingly new menu items that are occasionally rolled in. Further, it was where I had my first date while dating my husband (Fort Lauderdale Las Olas), and where I got engaged (romantic re-creation of our first date). The manager played such a large roll in making the engagement successful, and even did a nice cheesecake plating for our engagement photos later on. On occasion when we're in the mood for cheesecake, we'd run out to CF for a slice to share. So clearly, it is near to my heart.  We came to this location for the first time a few weeks ago to celebrate my sister's birthday. I was surprised by all the new items on the menu (hadn't eaten there in a while) so it took us longer than usual to make a selection. I was taken aback by the fact that our waitress kept rushing us and was visibly annoyed by our indecisiveness. She wasn't even informed enough on the offerings to help us reach a quick decision. Anyway, my sister ordered the new Southern dish which was amazing. I had the chicken Marsala which was very flat. The chicken as clearly boiled and had no flavor, and the marsala sauce was bland. I love having this dish at weddings and know that it has the potential to be really yummy. Anyway, before my food arrived I asked the waitress for some asparagus and it came over 15 minutes later when I was done eating. When we got the bill, I was charged $7 for the asparagus which was grill burned and I wasn't able to eat it (I thought it was free like some other places!) Rather than waiting for the waitress to return I stopped an employee who I later discovered was the manager and asked him to find my waitress and ask her to remove the asparagus. He introduced himself as the manager (short hispanic guy, cant remember the name) and said that this was the only portion of asparagus they serve and he can provide me with another one but he will not remove it from the bill. I was Shocked!! A manager? Asparagus?! So when the waitress returned she came with the new asparagus! I told her I had no use for the asparagus because it originally arrived at the end of my meal and was charred. She knew it was the truth and said she would go back and ask the manager if she could remove it. It took her 20 minutes to get this approval. She then took back the asparagus, which Im guessing may make an appearance on someone else's plate the following day after sitting on the table being talked over and possibly spitted on. I was just very shocked by this highly classified process over asparagus which I could buy a bag of at Publix for half the price!!!! If she mentioned that the asparagus was an entire side costing $7 and not a 'small portion' as I requested, we wouldn't have had the issue to begin with.  Overall: CF is CF. Always loved it and that wont change solely from this experience.  They have little control over the food because its chain, so if its bad here, its likely bad everywhere. I, however, will never return to this lousy location managed by a lousy manager. I'll hold our cheesecake cravings until we get to Fort Lauderdale, or head to Boca where Junior's Cheesecake has finally opened at Mizner Park. So move the hell over CF."
Anssi A.,"Espoo, Finland",10,7,1,2.0,5/20/2017,"The food was good, been there a couple of times but the overall experience was melted down cause of the waitress. I gave In my mind a good 13% tip cause we were just having lunch straight off the menu with nothing special and no ""let's change this and that"" crap. That f'in guy had the audacity to come back in and give me a good phu'huh-look and turning his head as a sign of discontent. F you too :)"
Liliana D.,"Wellington, FL",25,28,32,5.0,5/17/2016,"I love this restaurant, it's a chain so one doesn't expect much, but this chain is amazing! I've eaten it in California, Miami and now Palm Beach, menu is so extensive you can literally have anything you want! Pastas, hamburguers, seafood, asian-thai food, caribbean, light menu....anything.  And in every visit whith friends and family, never does a dish dissappoint.  Just keep in mind portions are super generous so depending on your appetite you might consider sharing!!!  There's a kids menu which has several options and a good size for kids up to 11! So get a table and enjoy! I do everytime!"
Emily T.,"Boynton Beach, FL",525,229,853,2.0,3/16/2015,"I will say I usually always have a great experience at this location and other locations. This last visit was extremely upsetting. Our fries for one of the meals had a hair in it. No big deal, it happens. We send it back and get another order back. What do you know? Another hair! How did I get two hairs back to back? We all stopped eating as we lost our appetite - waited for a manager to come over. That took a long time. The manager denied our request to comp our meals. Just the one meal where the hair was found. She did however give us free dessert. I guess dessert substituted our meals."
Juliene R.,"Margate, FL",144,81,42,2.0,6/14/2016,I'm currently sitting in here & my server is soooo rude (Lauren) it's a pity normally I'm a Cheesecake Factory lover in lots of locations she made this experience bad smh it's a pity I'm visiting from New York
Cindy E.,"Lake Worth, FL",51,44,21,1.0,6/6/2016,"This is probaly the worst experience , i have ever had at a resturant, i went to have dinner here for my birthday , i order the lemon chicken piccatta my pasta was over cooked and they brought out the dish to my table, i sent it back it took them 45 minutes to bring another order out , i spoke to the manager after the whole situation and she wasnt helpful at all. She said i wasnt aware and was like well what can i do for you . The waiter when i told her i was still waiting for my dish she laughed and said oh wow its not still not here . I will never return to this location . My nephew also ordered the terriyaki chicken and his rice came out burnt...  Ive been to this restaurant but in other locations such as pga and boca and have amazing experiences. But this location is complete garbage so dont bother going here.."
Patrice R.,"Lake Worth, FL",66,200,36,4.0,1/18/2016,My daughter chose The Cheesecake Factory to celebrate her birthday last night. It was extremely crowded because today is a holiday (MLK Day). We waited over 30 minutes for a table for our party of 7. Service was good but just a little slow due to the extreme busyness. Food good and all 7 entrees were served to us at the same time. (lately when we go out it seems at least 1 meal comes out later than the other meals)The birthday girl enjoyed her birthday serenade by the servers.
Sarah K.,"Lake Worth, FL",170,18,8,1.0,3/15/2017,"Our experience last night was so bad it ended up being comical. I've been to this location a few times before and it's never been great but this time it was really bad. I went with my husband and young son. We were seated quickly and everything started out fairly normal. We got out drinks and then placed our order with the waiter. When we placed the order, we asked what kind of fruit came in the fruit cup and the waiter replied ""apples, strawberries and blueberries."" I remember this specifically because those were my son's favorite fruits so it was perfect. About 10 minutes later our server came back and told us they were out of one of our two appetizers so we picked a different one. As we were waiting, we realized we hadn't received bread so as our waiter was heading to another table to drop some off, we asked to have some and he said, ""oh, this was meant for you...."" 20 minutes later - still no appetizers or food on the table, our waiter comes back and says they are out of our entree, so we picked another. It took a total of 45 minutes for us to get our appetizers and my son's food (we had requested to come with the appetizers.) We started eating and it was very apparent the food had been sitting in the kitchen for a while based on how hot the plate was and the film that had formed over the dipping sauces. We started focusing on feeding our son and noticed the fruit had nothing the waiter had mentioned, it had pineapples, a single grape and BLACK BEANS!!!!! There were black beans mixed into his fruit cup!!!! We called over a manager and explained what we'd experienced and showed him the beans and he said, ""the beans are right next to the fruit in the kitchen so that's probably what happened..""  We told the waiter to cancel our entrees because we'd been there so long and had already had such a bad experience- he cancelled the entrees and brought us our check. We paid full price for everything and they offered no solution to our time well wasted. We will never be going back to this location - needless to say."
Tarah W.,"Saugerties, NY",0,2,,5.0,10/9/2016,"Stayed at The Breakers on vacation and ventured out to City Place. Not only was the food a fraction of the cost, it  was phenomenal as always. Wonderful service and overall wonderful experience. Thank you!"
Bill W.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,8,,3.0,8/24/2016,"Food is good, it's getting to pricy to eat there. There are better places with better prices and the food is as good or better."
Austin M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,11,10,2.0,9/17/2016,"Good food, but plates, silverware and cups are always filthy and greasy. Menus and check were also dirty."
MN T.,"Chanhassen, MN",1,101,178,5.0,7/16/2016,"Great service sitting at the bar today while on a a business trip...it can be lonely always dining for 1, but Adam and the other female bartender made it an enjoyable experience.  Both were genuinely friendly, attentive, but not intrusive....overall 5 stars on total experience.  The soy glazed edamame is my favorite and it came out quickly and was waved piping hot - well done!"
Natalie L.,"Ventnor City, NJ",0,18,14,1.0,8/20/2016,"The service here sucks. My server didn't check on us once. We finished our appetizers and he still didn't come over to take our order. He didn't refill either of our drinks once. Then he had the nerve to walk over to the table 35 minutes later and ask if we wanted anything else. Well we did, but no not 35 minutes later. He wasn't too busy either. I watched him talking with coworkers more than once instead of taking our order. This was probably one of the worst services I've ever experienced at a restaurant and I wouldn't recommend coming here."
Karen R.,"Lake Worth, FL",1,1,,2.0,2/11/2017,Have never posted review before but must tell you don't waste your time or money When you pay $3 for small cup of cold weak coffee there are problems Service is so slow this was at lunchtime Ordered 1 app a salad 2 coffees 2 pieces of cheesecake Waited 20 mins then waited another 20 for $46 bill Really!
Neil O.,"Elizabeth, NJ",0,1,1,1.0,12/31/2015,"Typically service at Cheesecake is superb. Unfortunately,  not at this location. We sat down at 1:30 pm and lunch arrived just before 3pm. At about 2:00 we asked to cancel lettuce wraps, but the waitress said they were already made! Manager said they were very busy (half the restaurant was empty) and apologized. We decided to leave as we had no time to eat due to a movie.The waitress gave me a check for 3 coffees and two appetizers  (artichokes swimming in butter). .Some apology."
Meghan D.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,19,32,5.0,9/19/2015,I've always came here to celebrate anything including birthdays and now graduation. The staff is extremely friendly and make you have the best experience each time. The Cheesecake Factory is the seriously the best!
Larry W.,"Jacksonville, FL",211,280,621,4.0,7/6/2015,"While visiting W. Palm my cousin and her husband took us out for dinner... really nothing new here pretty much the same as the one back home in Detroit. This time we had the Macaroni and cheese balls, they were absolutely excellent !!! We shared a piece of chocolate cheesecake after devouring the Bang bang chicken and Shrimp."
Pekka J.,"Helsinki, Finland",55,115,311,3.0,10/7/2014,Sometimes service can be a bit slow if the restaurant is full but still decent. Food is your solid Cheesecake factory standard.  Great place for lunch or your favorite dessert.
Christina A.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,5,4,3.0,8/13/2016,I LOVE LOVE Cheesecake Factory. I LOVED the chicken and biscuits dish. Key word LOVED. They have changed the recipe twice and what use to be so good country style chicken and biscuits is now a great disappointment. The biscuits are super small and the gravy is no longer country style gravy. now it is like a wine gravy. I am so disappointed!!!!
Lina N.,"Russellville, AR",12,24,21,5.0,5/25/2015,Tried this place for the first time with a co worker of mine and fell in love.  I got the Pasta Da Vinci and couldn't be any more satisfied than I was. The service was great and I enjoyed every bite of my meal. Recommended!
