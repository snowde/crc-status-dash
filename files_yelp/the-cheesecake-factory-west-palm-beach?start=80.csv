Angelica B.,"Torrance, CA",173,31,189,5.0,4/12/2015,"Sat by the bar (again lol). Tropical smoothie was ok. G the lunch fettucini alfredo pasta. Took about 5-10mins max to get our food. But our server was nice to check on us and gave updates regarding our food. Portion was a good size. She said the regular one was double the size of the lunch size.  Its actually big enough to make me full! For dessert, we tried their Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. Loved it better than the original key lime pie that I've tried from the grocery. 1000x times better. Its sweet, my mom said. But i think its a little sour and a little sweet. I have very weird tastebuds. But i do suggest to have water next to you to wash it all out afterwards. 5 stars for good service & good food. Very well impressed"
Sandy G.,"Asheville, NC",75,6,,5.0,6/22/2016,"Excellent service. I'm a business traveler and usually in a hurry. Food was excellent as always and server, Janann provided the most prompt, friendly service I have experienced. Highly recommended for their customer service"
Jill C.,"Wellington, FL",44,66,,2.0,5/14/2016,"Went with a large party tonight (8 people - 6 adults 2 children) for a special birthday.   I tried calling ahead explaining that we ranged in age between 3 and 90 but they said the only thing we could do was to get someone to go ahead and put our name on the list.  We did that and they only place they could sit us, without an extremely long wait was on the patio.  This is South Florida and temps are  beginning to get hot, but we sat outside.  Turns out sitting outside was the right choice.  Its one thing for a restaurant to be loud, but this restaurant is way beyond loud.  If you want to have a conversation during your meal forget about it. I ordered off of the lighter menu and my chicken tacos were tasteless.  The veggie side had a piece of plastic in it.   Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals ok.  But it was more about family and being together than anything else.  Cheesecakes were good, but not as good as they used to be. I've eaten in the location a few times and I liked it much better the other times. One really good thing, our server was excellent."
Esther S.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,4,,3.0,1/9/2017,"Had dinner Sunday night at this Cheesecake Factory. Had to sit on the heated patio. Not so heated if you get the corner table by the exit. I was freezing. My waiter seemed to forget we were there. Our food took quite a while to arrive. Mine was cold and one other in the party was not cooked to order. That was eventually corrected somewhat; however, I ordered a pasta dish and noticed other tables being offered grated cheese. Not me... I took my food home for the dog."
Isabella C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",3,24,,4.0,7/31/2016,I'm a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory. Dinner portions are very large so expect to take home some leftovers. I've never actually had room for dessert unless I was just meeting someone for a drink. The wait can be long on Friday and Saturday nights so definitely go earlier in the week!
Rachael G.,"West Palm Beach, FL",15,54,78,5.0,8/30/2015,You can never go wrong with cheesecake factory they have a huge menu so everyone can find something. Iv been like 20 times and it's always been good
Gabriella C.,"Greenacres, FL",49,38,9,2.0,3/3/2016,"I used to love the Cheesecake Factory so much. But the last few times I've went, the food tasted mediocre. I went last night for my birthday like I do every year & I do believe it was my last time. The shrimp scampi that I always get because I love it, was not so good. I was really disappointed. I think that they changed their recipe because it was never that bad. I also had their mac & cheese side & it also wasn't as good as it used to be. I even had two drinks, their Mai Tai which was so gross & syrupy I had to send it back. The other drink was a vodka & cranberry but it was so gross as well. I'm really disappointed with this Cheesecake Factory because I've always loved it. It's going downhill."
Xavier S.,"Torrance, CA",0,4,,3.0,3/2/2016,"I could sit here and bash our waitress because she was struggling tonight. However, another waitress/runner we stopped to help us was very accommodating. Melissa came to the rescue and really went out of here way to help us. She basically took over the role of being our waitress. Our original waitress was no where to be found after she brought us our food. If it weren't for Melissa we would've had no service tonight. Melissa is the only reason for this review. My family and I wanted to praise her for the awesome job she did tonight. Thank you Melissa!"
Timothy R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",9,30,1,4.0,6/8/2016,"Went there for lunch today! wow the new menu items are amazing! i had the mac and cheese balls, corn dogs and the flying monkey shake! The Bread is SOOOOOO good! just wish the butter wasnt frozen."
Robert L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",44,298,933,3.0,2/27/2014,"It's about my 4 time n one of these places and always found them to be just OK. I would have given it a 3.5 star but 4 is to much even if the food was OK. For some reason always over crowded and over priced. Thx we were late last night and no waiting time.  I ordered the mahi-mahi fish and asked them to make it blacked to the point black and very spicy. Well I didn't get either but the fish was still not bad.  Would I go back here, not really but always end up there only with a group cause they want to go. The case for all 4 times going there!!"
Tani V.,"Boynton Beach, FL",24,9,11,5.0,10/29/2015,"Attentive but unobtrusive waiters. Food is fresh and delicious with big servings. We enjoyed the steak dishes and the gumbo we ordered. They have plenty of customers though.  So if you're looking for a quiet dinner, go someplace else."
Austin R.,"Jupiter, FL",0,2,,2.0,11/9/2016,"Our waiter Jeff, I understand you are a new employee of The Cheese Cake Factory. I am a waiter at a very nice restaurant on the water in Jupiter. I have been there for a couple years, and we are all very close. Every person that has worked in our industry has royally messed up at the least once. That includes myself, but there is a couple things that can always help a situation. The truth and your manager, they are there to help. You didn't use these two valuable assets. And, I hope you learned something tonight. Thank you to the manager we talked to on our way out!"
Alyssa S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",6,28,1,4.0,3/10/2016,"Visited this location on a Friday night between 7-8 pm. It was pretty busy but we never had to wait too long for anything. We sat in the ""outdoor inclosed"" area, I wish it was fully outside but no big deal! My only complaint was that we were sat at a 2 top so close to another couples 2 seater table it looked like our tables were meant to be pushed together to seat 4 and they just separated them about an inch. We were so close I could literally touch the lady beside me without even trying which made it quite awkward for all of us seeing as their was absolutely no privacy. Overall had a great experience though! Food was out quickly, we got 2 drinks, an appetizer, 2 entrees, and one dessert to go and our bill was only $50 (before tip of course). Everything was delicious and our server was great at checking in on us. We will be back :)"
Anna S.,"Palatine, IL",0,16,21,1.0,9/4/2016,"Went for lunch with a friend and her mom.  We went at noon today.  We where asked to wait 5 mins for seating. We were not sure why as there were plenty of open tables.  THAT should have been our first warning that this was not going to be a good experience! We were seated 10 mins later. The server came over to ask if we would like beverages. And we placed our order. 1 salad with chicken, 1 omelet and 1 chicken salad sandwich.  Nothing difficult or long cooking times.  We waited 20 mins for our meals. (Strike 2) THEN IT ALL WENT DOWN HILL FROM THERE.  The salad was missing the chicken.  We looked around for the server.  No sign of her. She finally made a pass by. We flagged her down and showed her the salad with the missing chicken. She said oh! Ok. Then went to take an order from another table. She came back 5 mins later with a bowl of cut up chicken.  She tossed the bowl on the table and walked away.  We asked the hostess for the manager.  That was another 5 minute wait.  Swatting at flies on our food kept us occupied until Kate arrived.  We explained about the long wait time and the missing chicken.  She offered my friends Mom a piece of cheesecake for her trouble. And asked what did we want from her? We asked to have the salad removed from the bill. Fine. Now we are ready to get the heck out of there. We waited for the server or the manager to come by to check in us. 10 mins later, no server and no manager. I went to the kitchen to ask for boxes for my sandwich. The server final come by. We ask for the check. She asked me to hand her the dirty dishes and then she will go get the check.  I was already irritated by the poor service and poor customer service from the manager. I told the server I didn't work there and I wasn't going to clear any dishes!  She went and got the check. She dropped the check on the table and said ""I'm not sure why but the manager took off the salad from the bill."" We left to do some shopping.  I came back to the restaurant (without my friends Mom) to let the manager know what an incredibly horrible experience we had on her watch.  I spoke to Kate and another manager but I didn't get her name.  Both thanked me for letting them know about all the problems we had.  I left still feeling as if the manager just didn't get the concept of good customer service! I won't ever go back to this location."
Devi S.,"Boynton Beach, FL",7,34,240,2.0,8/7/2016,"After my visit today, I have to give a 2 star.  We went there today to celebrate my twin girls 14th birthday, and I did let the hostess know about it when we inquire for a table.  She gave me a piece of paper so I can write their names, which I did.  So we waited for our table.  Now, here is where the fun part begins... we did mention that we have a baby in the stroller, how ever they gave us a booth at the end of a section  (tables with chairs would be better).  Our server Betsy arrives to greet us and took our water order (which took longer than it should), finally our drinks arrive, however she did not bring any of the complimentary bread & butter, she insist to take our order, even though we were not ready.  However we inqui5about the bread because our 13 months old baby was fussy, and wanted some snacks.  I remember the server usually brings a snack plate (slice bananas, bread, cheese) for the little ones, but we did not get one today. Our fried calamari arrived at the table and mind you it is before our bread basket.  Today's fried calamari was very disappointing, honestly the portion was a joke today (5 pieces of tentacles & 5 calamari ring pieces) now I did not bring this issue to the manager because I'm sure they have someone in the back who expedite the food before going out to the tables.  After half way eating our calamari finally our bread arrives, and it was cold and extremely hard. I brought the problem with the bread to our server and even showed her by hitting the hard bread on the table and it did not break at all.  I can't believe they served this to the customer, especially one with a 13 months old.  I order the ahí tartar and it was okay, the 4 pieces of fried wonton skin was disgusting. It was stale and old, which is probably from the day before that was refrigerated.  Ate one bite of the wonton and that was it.  Everything else was okay, not wonderful, just okay. One of our birthday girl ordered linguini Alfredo w/chicken ($3.50 extra) and only got 5 nugget size chicken on her pasta and it was crispy on one side, when she ate it it was chewy and hard. She did not finish her food. Now at the end we ordered 2 cheesecake and as we mention to the hostess before we sat that it was our twins girls birthday today, when the cheesecakes arrived there was no singing nor any special thing for our daughters. When I asked the server about it, she said no one mentioned anything about the girls birthday.  I'm disappointed, they came after the fact and from it being a surprise ended up being an embarrassing to the girls.  Very disappointed with our visit today, especially when we are there to celebrate our twin girls birthday. Food was disgusting, portion sucked, and the birthday song no where to be found.  As a regular customers I'm disappointed on how today."
Charles G.,"West Palm Beach, FL",138,66,29,4.0,11/4/2014,Typical cheesecake location.  Food is just as good as any other location and the service is great.  My drink never goes dry here because the staff is on top of it.   The only problem is the wait time to get a seat.  Since I live so close I only go on Mondays or Tuesdays unless I am going for lunch.
Rachel M.,"Boynton Beach, FL",727,683,293,3.0,8/11/2013,"Service was fairly quick for a party of two on a Saturday night in City Place. The drinks weren't great, especially at $9.00 a glass.  Ordered some appetizers and was underwhelmed by it. The calamari and chicken quesadillas were just not cutting it."
Kelly C.,"West Palm Beach, FL",10,68,87,4.0,11/19/2015,"Food was delicious as usual. I did notice that the waitress was lacking a bit with being attentive - she also seemed, towards the end our meal, to have an attitude with one of the guests at the table over the bill stating that $5 was owed for the side of corn that replaced the side of fries."
Sam G.,"Rockledge, FL",0,18,1,4.0,10/2/2016,Located in a busy outdoor shopping plaza. Traffic and parking a nightmare but there's a garage close by that is free for an hour before 10pm. It was great for the quick run for cheesecake. The dessert counter line was long when we arrived but it went by quickly. We were out of there with the cheesecake slices in about 10 minutes. Very surprised.
Ivette D.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,4,4,3.0,9/3/2016,"As always this franchise has a long waiting period . We were given a table for four in a very crowded cafeteria style area. We asked not to be seated there instead in a booth. We agreed on the wait for the booth which was 5-10 mins. Just to be brought to the same crowded area .  Finally we were given  a booth the waitress was not friendly . She seem very up in age which really should not matter if you love what your doing. I asked her for her name not able to hear it she said "" it does not matter we we're never going to be friends"" I just laugh for it all seem like a comedy club. The food was good just be careful portion are large so skip the appetizer . Also out of respect for the elderly I will not reveal the waitress name, but if she looks like grandma be prepared to wait extra time. This was on a Sunday afternoon a large party were having a birthday celebration and did not care how loud they laugh and yell ""Happy Birthday"" If you want a cozy low key place don't bother it's like the food court in the mall loud , loud"
