Amy P.,"Old Bethpage, NY",2,74,11,5.0,12/15/2017,"Stopped for lunch here yesterday. I love their French Country salad, and have to say this location served the best salad I have ever had. Just the right amount of balsamic dressing, lots of goat cheese, asparagus, beets, and nuts. Fresh greens. A generous portion. Wish I took a pic.  My tropical iced tea was delicious as usual.  Our server, Aliyah, was always around to fill our glasses and bring anything we needed.  Great service and great food.  Best Cheesecake Factory I've been to."
Stephanie L.,"North Babylon, NY",92,204,94,1.0,1/10/2018,"Wanted to go here for dinner, but having a 30 minute wait on a Tuesday night at 8pm when the entire downstairs is WIDE OPEN for dining, was the deal breaker... Staff everywhere looked miserable - I had to stand in front of the hostess for 5 minutes to even find out how long the miserable wait was - then she looked SHOCKED when I said I'm not waiting and told her to take my name off the list, she just looked confused, like people don't normally do that!!   Then since we really just wanted dessert - we headed over to the take-away counter, the girl there was a little bit more friendly, but still kinda miserable. Only redeeming factor was that she got us out of there quick!!  Overall, everyone looked over-worked and underpaid and extremely unhappy, not a place that I want to eat a meal in, so glad I got my dessert to go and ate in my own private paradise!"
William C.,"Queens, NY",2,2,,1.0,1/5/2018,"Appetizers came pretty fast but that was it. It took 30 mins to get a gin and tonic then another hour to get the main course which was a burger and another appetizer.  Very disappointed. When the waitress came with the gin and tonic she was saying I know, I know it took a while and left. Then she notice my boyfriend had the car keys on the table and stopped by the tables to say she was waiting for fries it would be right out . Exactly 59 mins from when we placed the order the food comes out and to our shock the fries were dead cold.  Keep in mind the restaurant was not crowded since it's 11pm at night and there was only two other tables in the waitress section.  Table next to us ended up cancelling their orders and just paying for two drinks and a appetizer since they also took 45 mins to bring out the food to only find out that they had put in the order for the wrong food.  Would never come here again!"
Sheena O.,"Queens, NY",123,59,112,5.0,1/4/2018,"This location is ALWAYS crowded and I haven't been here in years but I took s chance and came here on New Years Day in the early afternoon. Though there were many people out, we were promptly seated and everything we ordered came out on time. From the fried macaroni and cheese and firecracker salmon wraps, to the Jamaican peppered shrimp and fish and chips, everything was as expected and yummy. Even got a slice of the salted caramel cheesecake to go. In retrospect, the food is pretty standard and there's something for everyone so that's never usually the problem. It's usually the wait but we got lucky this time."
Bonnie T.,"Manhattan, NY",516,339,355,1.0,12/10/2017,"I come to this location all the time but somehow there's always a long wait even though there were lots of tables available. The host never acknowledge us nor give good customer service every time we approach the desk. Aside from a terrible first impression from the host station, the cheesecake stations are terrible. Staff does not use gloves when they move cakes around and isn't mindful that there are cakes in the fridge when they are cleaning with sanitizer! It took over 20 minutes to box up 5 slices of cake without anyone else ordering plus there were a lot of staff behind there. Servers are sometimes nice to us but most time, they seem to like rushing us. Not sure why. I think we eat here very often to say we're regulars. If I could give no stars, I would.  Not recommended!"
Diane Y.,"Elmont, NY",25,68,174,4.0,11/10/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a great go-to for those indecisive people as there's a little bit of everything on the menu. I got dinner last night with two friends and they shared the avocado egg rolls as an app, and almost bickered as to who should get the last one.  They ordered the Santa-Fe salad, and the Chinese Chicken salad...I'd never seen anyone order a salad here so when they arrived at the table I was wonder-struck at how huge they are! That wasn't just dinner, it was next day's lunch.   I went for the Americana burger sans pickles, and it had potato sticks on it so I felt like a real 90's kids eating my burger with no shame across from both my friends having salad (sorry, not sorry).  Fries were honestly not as crispy as they usually are, but that didn't stop me from finishing them either.  We shared a slice of tiramisu for dessert, almost a sin at CHEESECAKE factory but majority just wasn't into it last night. In the past, I've had the celebration cheesecake and can say it really hits the sport so I definitely recommend as it's only available for a limited time."
Shana H.,"Brooklyn, NY",201,225,211,4.0,1/1/2018,"The Cheesecake Factory offers everything and has something for everyone. While some of the food is very hearty and rich, there are also plenty of healthy items to choose from. I've experienced both and was throughly impressed each time. I especially like the numerous amonts of flavored cheescakes they offer. Although the place is crowded most of the time, the restaurant is large enough to provide great customer service and seat patrons quickly. Another great thing about TCF is that is located right near one of the best malls in NY!"
Daniel C.,"Saint James, NY",83,107,531,2.0,10/12/2017,"I've been coming to this location since my high school days and from what I remembered the service has always been good and quick here. I came to this location for a family members birthday, we were a party of seven. We arrived right around six o'clock on a Saturday evening, the wait was about 45 minutes to get a seat.  When we got our table the waitress took a little while to come over, we ordered our drinks and put in our appetizers. We ordered the Tex-mex egg rolls, crispy crab bites and the warm crab and artichoke dip. Heres where the night turned a little sour, our drinks and bread took a about 10minutes to arrive along with another 30 to 40 minutes for our appetizers to come to the table. But the kids pizza, chicken tenders and fries came out pretty quick. The tex-mex egg roll was pretty good, nice crunch and the filling tasted good along with the avocado sauce on the side. The crispy crab bites were okay and the warm crab artichoke drip I would have liked better if they served it with chips instead of grilled bread. The grilled bread was a little to oily and hard for my liking.   For the Entree I ordered the Grilled Ribeye Steak, my wife ordered the fish tacos, and our cousins ordered the pork chop and crispy chicken and shrimp pineapple. The entrees took about another 20 to 25 minutes to come out after we received our apps. The steak was okay, the mash potatoes needed a little more milk because they were drying out. My wife enjoyed her fish tacos and our cousins said their dish tasted good also.  Our waitress came to check up on us about two to three times, we had to flag her down to order our dessert. The only reason we ordered dessert is because we had three kids, you can't leave without having dessert as a kid. We ordered two slices of cheese cakes, one vanilla bean and the other oreo. By the time we received our cheese cake we already been at the place for about 2 hours after we sat down. The whole night from start to finish took about three hours, our waitress took forever to come to our table to give us the bill, once the bill was paid the night was finally done!  Will not be returning to this location again. We haven't been having good luck in Cheese Cakes factories!"
Mia K.,"New York, NY",541,374,1725,4.0,10/29/2017,"While everyone's experience is different I had no complaints about this Cheesecake Factory. My family's early dinner was delicious from our crab and artichoke dip, rounds of warm bread and butter, my Jamaican black pepper shrimp as well as our decadent cheesecake slices. My server Amy was cute, pleasant and was kind enough to offer us items from the lunch menu that we were closely approaching it's end. Our bill was accurate and nothing needed to be disputed. A enjoyable visit for dinner."
Grace C.,"Queens, NY",76,17,,3.0,1/6/2018,"the food is like any other cheesecake factory, but the service is not very great. I had a waitress not pay attention to the specifications i had asked for on my food and the food came out incorrect. (I got the vegan cobb salad with no almonds and the dressing on the side but got no almonds, grains, chickpeas, etc..) I did not bother to mention it because the food was still good."
Cat D.,"New York, NY",123,275,1518,5.0,7/18/2017,":::Update::: 7/15/17 Came here for dinner with my sister just to catch up. It wasn't too bad of a wait for a Weekend (don't remember if it was Saturday or Sunday) evening. We even got a booth!  I'm adding a star to this rating because of the impeccable service that evening.  For the app: - stuffed mushrooms - fontina and parmesan cheese, garlic and herbs in a wine sauce Drinks: 2 glasses of Sauvingnon Blanc from New Zealand Entrees: - Grilled Turkey Burger - Combined with fresh mushrooms, garlic and spices. Served with grilled onions, lettuce and tomato on a wheat brioche bun - Chicken Marsala and mushrooms - chicken breast sauteed with fresh mushrooms in a rich marsala wine sauce. S Dessert: - 2 Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake - a cjocolate hazelnut cheesecake topped wth hazelnut crunch and nutella The food was great, no complaints there. The service was ON POINT, though!  Our server was Anthony. He was polite, attentive, pleasant, and quick. I guess at some point he took a short break and a woman took his place. I didn't catch her name but she, too, was awesome. Hopefully, Cheesecake will continue to give great service like this. The food paired with great service made my experience that night an awesome one. Awesome enough to upgrade my previous 4 star into a 5. They should commend the 2 servers. Keep up the good work!!"
Josh G.,"New Hyde Park, NY",240,455,4133,4.0,5/7/2017,"I know, The Cheesecake Factory is a chain. But it's not a horrible chain. It doesn't run rampant through towns and cities and states popping up on every corner, trying to ""be cool"" like some other chain restaurants *cough* Applebees *cough*. The Cheesecake Factory does enough to warrant the occasional four stars and my last trip here was pretty close to that celestial amount (maybe 3.5).  Even on a Tuesday night, with TCF connected to a mall that now resembles something from Dawn of the Dead, you'll still run into crowds. I know you can't sit customers at a table without a server, but once we were seated, I noticed several empty tables around us. This is starting to become a thing I truly despise. Having said that, the party of three I was amongst sat in about twenty minutes, so wait time was acceptable. Call me crazy but I do love the decor in Cheesecake. I don't entirely get it because it feels like some classical, contemporary, European style, but it sets a mood better than a lot of other chain spots. I've also had respectable service here almost every time I've been. That night our waitress was close to on point. Or she was standing next to the point, or in front of it. I digress... Maybe some of the reason there's often a wait at TCF is because you're given a novella to read. Literally. The menu is a book of choices that you can't begin to comprehend. Often I'm stuck between at least two or three dishes. Calorie count might knock a choice off just because the amount in some of these dishes is shocking, but there are healthy-ish choices mixed in and available (""Skinnylicious"").  The winner for me that night was the Cajun jambalaya pasta. Shrimp and chicken sautéed with tomato, onion, and peppers all in a spicy Cajun sauce over linguini. The dish was large with the chicken and shrimp holding nice tenderness and a great accompaniment to the veggies and pasta all brought together with a good kick of heat. I pushed through the last few bites just because I was diggin' the meal too much to take a doggie bag home. My stomach made room, somehow. We received a breadbasket at the start of the meal so a piece soaked up some spices from the pasta. My chum also wanted an appetizer, so prior to Cajun land, I shared some fried macaroni and cheese balls with him. Gooey and oh so fattening but enjoyable. And of course, there was some cheesecake eating. I was stuffed but the rest of my party dined on a piece each. Selections for style is also vast. I mean we are in a factory for cheesecake right? By the end of the meal (throw a Sam Adams in there too) the price wasn't entirely cheap, but basically worth the dollars I doled out of my wallet. Overall, The Cheesecake Factory isn't perfect. It does wear the scarlet letter (or word) of a chain restaurant. But if you're not sure what kind of food you're lookin' to devour, you have some picky eaters in your party, or you're just nearby, The Cheesecake Factory will fit your needs, and fit them better than your standard chain spot."
Cassie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",284,145,331,2.0,4/6/2017,"I'm definitely a fan of their cheesecakes especially the Dulce De Leche and Key Lime flavors but unfortunately that was the only things that we ordered that was good. My entire party of 7 was underwhelmed with their meals. I had to send back my order of Fettuccine Alfredo with Shrimp because the pasta was completely over done and quite bland... It was promptly replaced by the manager for a slightly less overcooked version. Even the drinks were subpar and didn't even taste like there was a drop of liquor in them. On the bright side, we were seated in 20 minutes for a table of 7 on a Sunday. The service was amazing. Our server was attentive and helpful in removing the awfully crafted Mai Tai from our bill. The manager was readily available. All that positive did not make up for the bad food and drink preparation. I have had amazing meals at various Cheesecake Factory locations even at this particular location. The kitchen may have been having a bad day but can't risk having another bad food experience at their regular menu price. I will have to go back to just ordering cheesecake to go at this location."
Michelle Z.,"Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, NY",17,26,36,2.0,11/11/2017,"This has been my to-go spot since middle school with my mom after a long day of shopping. I've never had a problem here before until Thursday.  I can't complain about the food because it's always the same. It's not the best, but not the worst either.  Definitely not a problem to find parking spots. Wait should not be too long either depending on which day and what time you go.  Now on with the service. I don't ask for much when it comes to service, because I know what it's like to be a server. My mom, who does speak and read English fluently, always have a hard time picking what she wants to eat. So I go on cheese cake factory's webpage and show her photos of their pasta. Our server, Leny (can't remember if that's how you spell his name), made our dining experience horrendous. Not only did i feel disrespected, but my mom as well. I should've said something on the spot, but i didn't want to cause a scene.  I asked him a couple of questions about the menu, and the third time, he was frustrated. I understand that maybe it was because I asking questions, but it is his job to answer them patiently and guide me through my options. He was not that busy, because it was 3PM in he afternoon. The restaurant was half empty. I was showing him photos on their website and asked if it was offered for lunch special. He reiterated the entire pasta menu as if i couldn't read English.  Then, I was ready to order and my mom wanted the Evelyn's pasta. I wanted to make sure that it was only vegetable, because she does not like to eat meat. He flips the page onto the pasta menu and says, here is everything. He was super impatient when it came to ordering, that he took our order down and left.  I was done with my water half way through the meal. He passed me twice, staring right at my cup, and did not come to refill my water or my mom's water once. I was literally sipping on my empty cup and making a sound to deliberately see if he would do anything. Nothing. My mom and I finished our meal quickly and could not enjoy our dining experience.  When we took the check, he asks us ""would you like dessert? A cheesecake? You can look at more photos online haha I'm just kidding."" My mom, who does not even understand English fully, heard the condescending tone in his voice.  I just hope the manager of this restaurant takes notice of this matter. Biggest factor of dining out is service. Even if the food isn't superb, a great service makes up for it."
Andie E.,"Manhattan, NY",54,144,861,4.0,8/19/2017,"I've been coming to The Cheesecake Factory in Westbury ever since they opened, many years ago.  When they first opened, the long lines to get a table were ridiculous.  Years later, the lines are still long, but I've learned to come very early to avoid long waits.  This restaurant is located in the Source Mall....on a side note, what the heck is up with this ""mall""?  There's practically nothing there.  If anyone is looking for retail space, this mall has plenty of space available!  lol So I haven't been here in a while, and noticed that they now have a ""skinnylicious menu""!  What a great idea since most of their menu items have huge portions and have high calories!  So they cut down on some of the fatty ingredients and the portion size to make the calorie count much much less than their ""regular"" menu items....but WHY don't they cut the price?!?!   One of us ordered the steak medallions from the skinnylicious menu and the portion size was half the size of my chicken dish from their regular menu;  and they were both the same price.  Now I know you can't really compare steak vs chicken but it just seems that all the prices on the skinny menu were the same as the regular menu....just sayin'!  Kudos for having a skinnylicious menu but the pricing needs a little work since the portion sizes are much smaller. I've had many different food items through the years, and I have to say that I have always liked whatever I ordered. The complimentary honey oat bread and sour dough bread are made fresh and served warm...perfect for melting the butter!  Sooo good!  Their food is also delicious!  Yes, the food can be fattening.  Yes, the portion sizes are huge.  But if you're really watching your weight, coming to The Cheesecake Factory is probably not such a great ideal....unless you've fallen off the wagon!  lol  I don't come here often but when I do, I don't think about any of this stuff.....I just enjoy it all!  And believe me, there's ALOT to enjoy!   And don't forget to save room for their cheesecake!  If everyone can agree on which type of cheesecake to get, it's best to just share one or take it to go.  There's just so much one can eat....isn't there?!?!  Hahaha"
Petrina R.,"Brooklyn, NY",74,81,275,4.0,4/3/2017,"I've visited this cheesecake factory 5 times and this is my first review. I decided to take my 5 year old and his sister to The Cheesecake Factory for their birthdays. I looked up their menus ahead of time and was happy to see a kids menu with great choices.  They smiled and laughed from the beginning to the end of lunch. The server was extra friendly, the waitress was a doll and very sweet. She was so nice the kids gave her husgs on their way out of the resturant.  The food, service, appetizers, drinks and ambience are FANTASTIC. The kids felt comfortable and were enjoying the food way more than I thought they would. We plan on visiting again after we go to Dave and Busters right next door.  Please go and enjoy the 6 page menu."
Melissa H.,"Boston, MA",248,108,387,4.0,3/1/2017,"This was my first time coming to a Cheesecake Factory, and as someone who isn't a fan of big chains this wouldn't have been my first choice but I was pleasantly surprised. I went for a friends birthday.  First off, it's huge. On this particular night the bottom floor was closed for something that looked like training, but the top floor was huge as well. There was no wait (at 630 on a Tuesday) and the server greeted us and took our drink orders right away.  The menu was severely overwhelming but I could see the appeal that a large menu has. They had everything from salads, sandwiches, pizza, pasta, Chinese, steak. Definitely something to please anyone and everyone.  I settled for southwestern egg rolls, while my friend had the four cheese pasta and we split both.  The food came out extremely fast and it was delicious! Also plenty for leftovers... the portions are huge.  We ended the night with Oreo cheesecake which, like everything else, was large."
Cara B.,"New York, NY",199,327,757,5.0,2/27/2017,Went on a Saturday night around 6:15 pm for a party of 2. Took about 15 minutes but it was packed so we didn't kind. We were seated upstairs and our server came over quickly. We ordered the four cheese pasta and the chicken tostada salad and they were both delicious. The food came out quickly and the server was very nice.  I would definitely go back again and order the chicken tostada salad. It was HUGE!!! I shared it with someone and we only ate half.
Aba H.,"East Meadow, NY",5,63,35,4.0,11/9/2017,"Plenty of parking, two floors with an elevator, but only top floor on weekdays. Very crowded place and there was a wait of about 15 minutes on Tuesday at 7:30 P.M. - some seating available during the wait, but we didn't get any.  There were three of us and all of us left happy. I ordered the combo entree of ""steak Diane and shrimp scampi.""  There were a half dozen steak nuggets au jus on the left, mashed potatoes in the middle, and maybe 4 medium-sized shrimps in a creamy garlic sauce - just delicious!  The portion was enough, considering we started with a nice bread basket and had tiramisu for dessert.  P.S. the tiramisu was also superb.  My entree was about $20 and the others were both cheaper, so it seemed like a real bargain as well.  Wait staff was courteous and friendly.  We'll be back, but not on weekends."
Betsy J.,"Hicksville, NY",36,62,90,4.0,11/4/2017,"Cheesecake factory has something for everyone.  Very varied menu with a ""skinnylicious "" section.  I ordered the shrimp tacos off the skinnylicious menu. You get three shrimp tacos but they were not flavorful.   I  have had the grilled salmon previously and that was very good.    However, my husband ordered the shepards pie and it was delicious.  My daughter also loved the buffalo blasts."
Chris L.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,15,,3.0,1/10/2018,"I've been going to this restaurant for over 10 years and this place has changed quite a bit. Back in 2009 and 2010, this place was always packed, you couldn't even get in a Saturday night without a 2 and  a half hour wait. The food was pretty damn good and the service always went accordingly. Well fast forward to my last visit in late December of 2017, and this visit paints a different tale. I went with a couple of friends mine. Once again it was a Saturday night, pretty packed and the wait was only just 45 minutes. Just like a pretty packed place the ambiance was rather loud. We could hardly hear our selves as we conversing along about the past events of the day. We started off with a few appetizers, Buffalo wings and spinach dip. Although the wings were cooked, it didn't have the spice and the kick that it once had, and the blue cheese dressing for the wings tasted watered down and less like blue cheese. The spinach dip was okay, it just wasn't good, the recipe called for a different cheese that mellowed out the taste, not very pleasant. However on a few high notes my bacon-bacon cheese burger with sweet potato fries was cooked perfectly. My coffee and cream chocolate cheesecake also ended the night on a good one. It's tart and bitterness of the coffee complimented the rich sweet creamy mascarpone mouse. It was savory, sweet and delightful. As far as the service was concerned, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't good. Our waitress was really concerned with our dinning experience. Our drink took around 20 minutes to get. All in all as some of the food was only okay, but the rest was worth the wait."
Cecilia T.,"Long Island, NY",488,335,1410,3.0,1/9/2017,"This place is the only chain restaurant I would consider going to even though I dislike chains and since we had a gift card to here, why not? We came on a Saturday night for dinner and surprisingly, there was no wait and plenty of seating available due to the snowstorm because usually this location is super busy packed. There's also a large well-lit parking lot, which is shared with The Mall at The Source.  The service was good and food was decent so what more can you ask for? Not to mention, the huge portions (and the calories). We got the chicken pot stickers app to share and I got the luau salad, which is 1250 cal while my husband got the California cheesesteak, all which equals to a 3250 cal meal for 2. It's ashamed we didn't have room for dessert because their strawberry cheesecake is delish!"
Buddy B.,"Shreve, OH",0,31,33,3.0,11/10/2017,"Not a bad place to eat, I came here for the cheesecake. I had the catfish, it was good. Always expect to spend some cash here. I should have ate my cheesecake first before my meal."
Rashid M.,"New York, NY",1097,931,572,3.0,2/8/2017,"So I've been back here now probably a dozen time, so I guess it's time that I update my review... Now that I've tried a few entrees from their menu, I feel like the food is better than when I first started coming here. I've tried the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and think it's a very good dish. I also tried the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and liked it a lot. I'm still sticking to my usual cheesecake here, which is the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake. One of my favorite cheesecakes ever! Some things still haven't changed though. The wait to get a table here is ridiculous. Last time, we waited over 1.5 hours on a weekday. For some crazy reason, the restaurant closed the huge seating area on the 1st floor. It doesn't make sense at all! Be ready to wait a LONG time if you want to eat here."
Ryan R.,"Queens, NY",112,1,,5.0,12/26/2017,"Best experience tonight!! Our waiter, John, was amazing! He did everything for us extremely politely and with a genuine smile the entire time. All orders were correct and made very well. Never a long wait, too! I think this was my best experience here yet, hence my writing this review!"
Karen C.,"New York, NY",7,16,9,1.0,12/11/2017,"Just awful. What more can I say. Nothing vegan on a menu so large, poor service and food prepared all wrong after a very long wait. Grand luxe cafe so much better although they removed the vegan options as well.  I have to rethink coming here again."
Jack K.,"New York, NY",49,311,277,4.0,9/29/2017,"What's not to like when you eat at The Cheesecake Factory? Endless selections of sweet and savory, salty and greasy, healthy and light... there is something for everyone... all day, everyday! I can come back here over, and over, and over... and still can't get enough of their Fried Calamari... fried light and crisp, served with garlic dip and cocktail sauce... it has to be the best and crispiest calamari on east coast. Hibachi Steak served with Shiitake Mushrooms, Onions, Bean Sprouts and Tempura Asparagus is good, but need more Wasabi because it can get too sweet without it. Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp is packed with serious heat and balanced well with plantains and marinated pineapple. There are so many things to try here, it'll take forever to go through everything on the menu... which is why, it never gets old to eat The Cheesecake Factory."
Daijonee V.,"Wyandanch, NY",58,25,175,2.0,8/1/2017,"We went for dinner during their half off cheesecake day on Monday, it was crowded which was to be expected. Put food took forever and so did out to go cheesecakes and to top it off we ate the cheesecake tonight when we got home and  there a gold Godiva wrapper crumpled up inside the to go cheesecake container WTH!!!!  I know it was busy but that's insane!!!"
Jay Infamous L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",150,493,35,2.0,10/29/2017,"Went here last week with the family and was very disappointed with a lot here.  First and foremost the accuracy to how long me and my family were waited to be seated was way off. We were first told that we would be seated upstairs in 5 minutes. 5 minutes turned into 10, 10 minutes turned into 25. Very poorly estimated time of seating.  Secondly, the lighting or lack there of in this restaurant is horrendous. Way too dim and once it got more into the evening around 7:30pm the lights dimmed even more which made it more difficult to read off the menu and not comfortable for family dining. Thirdly...the food for the most part was not good at all. I ordered a burger and fries. The burger was less than subpar. Dry, lacked seasoning, bun was very bland. Fries lacked flavor as well. I stopped eating halfway through. Only thing remotely good was the buffalo wings that we had for appetizers.  Added to that, we received the bread at our table wayyyy after we initially sat down. As a matter of fact we didn't get our bread till after the appetizers. I don't know of any other restaurant that does this because most if not all sit in restaurants that I go to give you bread a minute or two after seating.  The only thing deserving of appreciation is the cheesecake which I am almost surprised they did not get wrong here, although the waiter had to ask my mother more than twice which cheesecake she ordered. Very poor listening. To go on though I had the birthday celebration cheesecake which was very good....well the ONLY thing really good about my experience here. They only get 2 stars for that which really should be a star and a half.  Sorry but not sorry, never returning to this Cheesecake Factory location. Please do better"
Meri L.,"Plainview, NY",443,264,1257,3.0,11/16/2016,"Went on a Wednesday night around 515pm. There was no wait and my party of 2 was seated right away. Our waiter took quite a while to come to our table and introduce himself, and ask us what we wanted to drink. It took a while to get the famous bread basket also. Boo!  We finally put in our drink orders and our food orders. Drinks and food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  I ordered the lettuce wraps appetizer as my entree and my friend ordered the chicken slider appetizer as his entree. Sorry, no pictures for either entree because we were both very hungry! No complaints on either dish. Both were very delicious and very satisfying. I highly recommend the lettuce wraps to everyone! Nomnomnom We both ordered cheesecake for dessert. It's The Cheesecake Factory! You must get Cheesecake! With so many varieties to choose from, there is something for everyone. I ordered the low carb Cheesecake with strawberries, and my friend ordered the salted caramel cheesecake. Both were absolutely delicious!  Someone other than our waiter brought out our food, and someone other than our waiter brought out or dessert. Another sever brought us a box for our leftover cheesecake. Our waiter never came by even once to make sure everything was okay. Our waiter only brought out our alcoholic beverages. By the end of the night 4 different people waited on/served us. When it was time for us to pay, our waiter was no where to be found to get the bill.  Service tonight was not good at all. It wasn't overly busy. There's no excuse for poor service."
Jessica F.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",1,44,68,1.0,11/29/2017,"Poor service. Very slow. They have us waiting for over half an hour when there were tables available. The service is not good. I would go to another location. We also order cheesecake before getting seated. It took them over 15 minutes just getting the cheesecake in the box. We didn't get it until we asked for it. Very disappointed. Drove over 40 minutes for this kind of service. The wait time for the food is not worth it. Price wise, is average. I would rather eat somewhere else with better service."
Eleni K.,"Manhasset, NY",19,118,384,5.0,12/10/2017,The food is always really good here! I love the burgers. They are perfectly cooked and really tasty. I also love a bunch of their appetizers such as the crab dip or the Tex mex spring rolls. I also really enjoy their lemonades. They only one I was not crazy about was the raspberry. The only down side to this restaurant is that all the dishes they serve are about 900 or more calories.
kristine m.,"Manhasset, NY",130,49,373,3.0,10/2/2017,"If I could I would actually rate the cheesecake factory at 3.75. I really do love this place and I come here often, the menu has such amazing variety but it's actually a little too overwhelming. I usually stick to my regular dishes which are the wings, dry with sauce on the side, the wings are really amazing here. The quinoa and kale salad is light and always fresh sometimes they are a little heavy with the dressing so I like to order the dressing on the side. I've tried the eggroll sampler and it's definitely an indulgent appetizer, a bit too greasy for me but very tasty. The main dishes that I always order are the white chicken chili with brown rice. It is very tasty and one of the dishes with a lower calorie count, and for those of you who have a carb phobia it is basically just a heaping tablespoon of rice surrounded by delicious chili. The factory burrito grande is insane and truly grande if you love Mexican food as well as their factory heuvos rancheros! I also enjoy the crusted chicken romano, The chicken is nice and thin, lightly fried and delicious. The chicken and biscuits and the famous factory meatloaf are delicious was generous portions, you can actually buy one dish and bring it home to feed three kids! I have to also mention the Louisiana chicken pasta. It has a nice southern kick and the bowtie pasta is yummy. In terms of desserts, I highly recommend the carrot cake. I don't even like carrot cake but the Cheesecake Factory Carrot cake made a believer because it is truly insane and I always order it over any cheesecake. If you are in a chocolate cake mood Linda's fudge cake is the best! My top picks of cheesecakes are tiramisu, snickers bar chunks and cheesecake, Adams peanut butter cup fudge ripple cake cheesecake and Reese's pieces peanut butter cup cake cheesecake. I have tried the low-carb cheesecake as a healthy alternative and it yummy with a side of whip cream and fresh strawberry. The restaurant is quite large, crowded, noisy, bright, people come here to celebrate occasions like graduation, hint hint - do not go during graduation time because there will be a long wait!"
Jaclyn G.,"New York, NY",0,134,112,3.0,10/22/2017,Reviewing this spot because of he horrible staff/ environment. The way employees spoke to each other while I was there was disturbing . Aside from that the food is amazing can't go wrong.
Sherene M.,"Queens, NY",131,105,175,5.0,5/5/2017,"I don't really love chain restaurants but I will make an exception here. The design is awesome. High ceilings lots of booth seating, it feels kind of royal. Nothing like a red lobster or outback.  There's almost always a wait. I don't believe they take reservations but if you call when you're about 15 away you can add your name to the list.  Service is pretty good and they seem to care about your experience. If you don't like anything they always send the manager over to get feedback and offer a solution. I've been eating the same dish here for over ten years and one night the sauce tasted odd and when I brought it to the attention of the manager he agreed and stopped serving it for the evening.  Prices are about average and portions are pretty large.  I love the brown bread they serve.  Drinks I love-frozen iced mango, passionfruit mojito, Georgia peach. They aren't very strong so don't expect to get tipsy.  Appetizers- buffalo blast is amazing. Like a shredded Buffalo wing deep fried and served with homemade blue cheese dressing.  Avocado rolls--think avocado egg roll with tamarind dipping sauce  Popcorn shrimp--love the dipping sauce  Entree- my go to dish is Jamaican black pepper shrimp. With mashed potatoes. Served with plantains are always fried to perfection and mango salsa  Meatloaf, BBQ chicken salad  Dessert- this one is hard. Everything is great.  Vanilla bean cheesecake, Godiva, red velvet, caramel turtle, carrot, I love them all.  I came once for brunch and don't recall what I had but it was amazing and I need to go again to refresh my memory.  This place can do no wrong in my book."
Taheefa S.,"Canarsie, Brooklyn, NY",61,121,171,5.0,4/7/2017,"Definitely somewhere, I would go to frequently if I lived in the area. Its surrounded by a mall so the parking is a PLUS! It is always crowded especially on the weekends so be ready! They have a brunch menu as well, many people aren't aware of that.  Now to the real meat & potatoes, THIS PLACE IS INCREDIBLE! The food, the service, the ambiance and atmosphere is all so upscale, not that you need to be dressed up to dine her but the feel of the restaurant makes you feel special. It can get busy but the servers are usually always attentive to you and your needs, out of the multiple times I've been to this location I've never experienced any problems. Their go to dish is the Chicken Madiera and after you have it you will know why it's their most recommended dish. I am not a fan of too much the right amount over the chicken is Perfect!"
Kristy T.,"Queens, NY",36,124,35,1.0,12/6/2017,"So disappointing! We've come to cheesecake numerous times and were always happy with the food and service. However, today's service was absolutely terrible. It took 1/2 and hour for our food to come out and when it did, half of what we ordered came out cold and greasy. Our waitress, CoryAnn, said that she would get us the manager when we decided to return the truffle & bacon cheese sticks, but the manager never came around. I'm pretty sure she didn't even tel him. What a waste of a cheat meal! So annoying!"
Alexandra D.,"Long Beach, NY",172,240,1474,5.0,9/11/2016,"I always come during lunch and I always sit at the bar upstairs. No wait, no crowd, no complaint. The bartender is always happy to see you. My go to is the fried chicken sandwich. It's HUGE and godly. The tuxedo cheesecake is my favorite but any cake is a good cake. Try the Mac and cheese balls! The drinks are really good. For a chain restaurant you'd expect them to be lame.  For the dining room I've noticed the wait can get insane and there's so many servers I don't know how you could be a regular here.  Tip your bartender!"
Kirandeep K.,"Flushing, NY",2,41,105,3.0,9/24/2017,"This was my first time at cheesecake factory. Its understandable that there is a long wait time on the weekends as its one of the few places open late on long island. The staff is very nice and accomadating. The complimentary bread wasnt as warm as i wpuld have liked it to be. The food was overall good. The portions are filling so keep that in mind if you arent too hungry. The skinnylicious salad was flavorful and a good crunch in the mouth, but i give the food a 3 because its not something out of this world. The dessert was oreo cheesecake and that was out of this world. If you are just looking for a good bite to eat this would be a nice stop."
Ana S.,"Queens, NY",64,96,300,5.0,9/11/2016,"I'm a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory! Their menus are huge and there's a great selection of entrees and cheesecakes (duh!), so it's a great place to bring the big family. The wait for dinner, especially during the weekends are about 30-45 minutes but it's like that in just like any other good restaurants.  I absolutely love their complimentary pumpernickel bread. It's always warm, soft, and delicious. I usually order the Thai Lettuce Wraps and it's absolutely delicious! Even though it is technically listed as an appetizer, the serving is more than enough (just like any other entree in the Cheesecake Factory) and it's very filling. It comes with chicken with peanut sauce and an assortment of vegetables and other ""toppings', like carrots, bean sprouts, asian noodles, and cilantro. You pretty much make your own wrap with the baby lettuce and just add as much vegetables as you want. It's always very fresh, a great price, and it never disappoints!  The restaurant is almost always busy, but I've never had a problem with the staff as they were always friendly and helpful. Overall, it's a big restaurant with a huge food variety for the whole family, and it's delicious! If you're coming for dinner, just be prepared for a long wait.
