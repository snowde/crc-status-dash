Amy M.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",89,201,363,4.0,4/6/2016,"I am not a fan of chain restaurants but Cheesecake have something for everyone.  The menu is like a book so if you can focus and figure out what you want, its all good.  My favorite dishes are THAI LETTUCE WRAPS (which I eat as a meal) and the SEARED TUNA TATAKI SALAD.  The lettuce wrap comes with 5 pieces of grill chicken tenders and a variety of toppings and 2 sauces.  Eating the wraps can be a bit messy but totally worth it.  The Tataki salad comes with seared tuna on top of mixed greens and few slices of beef steak tomatoes with a pesto sauce on top. I always ask for the dressing on the side.  The tomatoe slices are always sweet and flavorful which is a surprise at a chain restaurant."
S K.,"New York, NY",3,22,17,4.0,3/16/2016,Came here yesterday for lunch! Lunch time is much more mellow and the waitress was really attentive & food was good. We ordered few appetizers and the jambalaya pasta; which was yummie. Definitely grabbed a cheesecake to go...will come back sooner than laters!
Arely P.,"Amityville, NY",51,27,9,2.0,8/18/2016,"Womp. Womp. Womp. Food was horrible, place was overpacked, giving new meaning to ""Factory"" and the waitress was a disaster! Didn't bring water out or bread, rushed our drinks and food order and def. rolled her eyes a couple of times. I will NOT be returning. Also, how many birthdays can we all be celebrating? You can't even have a conversation without ""Happy Birthday to You"" blaring in the background. This place isn't even a step above a local diner."
Win C.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",302,597,2556,2.0,3/8/2014,"I used to love going to the Cheesecake Factory a couple of years ago, but unfortunately I felt like the quality of the dishes have significantly gone down. We also waited about 1.5 hours for seating too (but yet again, there was 11 of us). Too bad they don't take reservations. This place also seems to be a popular place to hold birthday gatherings because we heard the staff singing ""Happy Birthday"" at least 15 times during our entire dinner (including ours..hahah).  Although I really enjoyed the avocado egg rolls, my Chicken Marsala over angel hair pasta was such a disappointment. The chicken breast was rock solid hard and dry. I didn't get to try the burritos, but that things was a beast of its own. The portion sizes here are definitely huge. We ordered 2 cheesecakes to share for the table and that was probably the highlight of the night. Come for the cheesecake and not so much for their food!"
M R.,"Staten Island, NY",3,49,,1.0,10/7/2017,"I've been to many locations from this franchise. The franchise is great and the food is always great at every location that I've been. This however, was the worst location I have ever visited. The hostesses were rude. The wait staff was not accommodating and unless flagged down, never stopped by. We were seated in an area that was freezing. Every table around us had people huddled for warmth due to the AC being pumped. My five year old daughter was crying from being so cold and after 3 times asking for them to address is the issue we tried to enjoy our food.  Since the blower over our head made all.of our food cold instantly there was no enjoying it. We gave in and asked for out entrees which were still in the back to go. The fun part came when we were home and noticed half of our food missing from the to go bag. Will never go back here. They are disorganized, have terrible service, and are flat out the worst CCF location I have ever been to."
Brett W.,"Westbury, NY",52,2,,5.0,12/31/2016,"An excellent experience indeed. Lovely atmosphere. Enthusiastic servers and wonderful selection of menu items. My family was super pleased with our visit. Taina, the manager was also very attentive to the needs of our large group, which was handled excellently. I would recommend this establishment highly. It was an awesome time."
Amanda K R.,"Lindenhurst, NY",51,96,446,5.0,3/29/2015,"What I love about this place is it's eclectic menu. Although being a server here would have my head in a tailspin (menu as thick as an encyclopedia) Most items on the menu thousand calories, but being a smart eater, the small plate or appetizer menu will always suffice. I highly recommend the beet and goat cheese salad and the tuna tartare is divine, all washed down with a Lemon drop martini. Yum."
Steven S.,"Long Island City, NY",24,3,,2.0,6/19/2016,"Well we sent back the silverware because it was dirty, the second set was as well. After that I changed my Oder so did my spouse.  My original Oder was the Diane steak so I opted for a rigatoni with shrimp and sausage which was safer then a steak as far as to make. I can't stand crap steak the guy next me ordered the Diane steak and he wasn't happy cause he didn't finish it. So our Oder was the following  1 warm crab with artichoke dip  7/10  Which was pleasant but,  (The bread was soaked in oil and burned )    2. Ratatouille toast  4/10 Sounds good on paper but, ( It was a mess the zucchini was cold ) 3. Shrimp and sausage pasta 8/10 Decent and eatable  4. Louisiana chicken pasta 9/10  Pasta was bit under but good flavors And a tad spicy but still the chicken was Cooked nicely, Juicy and crispy.  Our waitress was 9/10  I was busy that's why I held my tongue about these things because of her she was very polite and composed  We took the cheesecake to go we got the  Dulce de leche  cheesecake  10/10 These pastry chef's never disappoint me!"
Joseph B.,"Oceanside, NY",0,12,,1.0,6/18/2017,"Went for dinner yesterday told that a table was ready only to be told that we have to wait 5 minutes they are setting one up ... they call our name again and we told the same thing again .... finally sit down there is a shift change so the day waitress took our drink order and dinner order told us the night waitress would take care of us , Jackie, well having to get her attention was no easy task shy of sending up signal flares in the air... she never made eye contact with us and seemed very rushed .... not a good experience here"
Tina W.,"New York, NY",176,520,3586,3.0,3/9/2014,"Order a meal for one and you'll get a meal for four. Portions are gigantic here and definitely worth it for the price. You'll probably need a good 10 minutes to look over the menu because they offer quite a variety of food, from burgers and steak to pasta, seafood and meatloaf. I think if I came here 5 years ago, I would've fell in love with this place. But not so much now, only because I know there are so many more restaurants that offer much better quality food. Huge portions doesn't always mean the quality of food is good. I've ordered pasta and meatloaf here and both dishes have a weird sauce that I wasn't too fond of. Maybe I ordered the wrong item, since there are 73947262829 more dishes to choose from, I'm sure one of them will taste better than what I ordered. I'm also not a huge fan of cheesecake so I ended up ordering the chocolate truffle tower cake. I'm glad I did because that was my favorite part of my dinner. I loved the chocolate mousse and the cake."
Dynas P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,1,1.0,12/12/2016,"I went here for my birthday ordered drinks and buffalo blast as the appetizer (that didn't arrive till I was ready to leave) then our waiter was changed; the entree came a hour and a half later. They charged my husband for Cheesecake that they promised was placed in our order to go bag, it wasn't received. Worst bday and dinner ever for me. I could've went to Applebee's if I wanted mediocre food and drinks. The cups and silverware were also unclean. I do not recommend this place; run while u can."
Michael K.,"Richmond Hill, NY",7,59,45,5.0,5/7/2015,"My favorite restaurant ever! Their menu is plentiful and you can go many times and try something new. The cheesecake selection is amazing and overall, the prices aren't that expensive. They close pretty late on the weekends so I suggest going closer to closing time so you don't have to wait that long."
Tina M.,"Franklin Square, NY",1,5,,5.0,6/8/2016,"The cheese cake Factory, where do I begin I love everything about this place the food and the desserts are so delicious my boyfriend and I come here On our anniversaries we never had a bad experience. You have to try their cheesecakes ! My favorite is the cookie dough cheesecake soo good! They do tend to get a bit buisy sometimes especially weekends but I never minded the wait it's always worth it !"
Dennis H.,"Little Neck, NY",0,3,1,1.0,11/12/2016,"If I could give my experience 0 stars I would.  I couldn't tell you if the soda was flat or not because I never got it. I couldn't even tell you if the food was good or not because we never got it. The only thing I could tell you is that the water was okay and the bread/butter kept us from starving. In the end, we left after waiting over 40 minutes. Think about it, 40 minutes and the only thing on the table was water and bread.  When we had to ask about the soda, the waiter, Rick(?), was like, 'You ordered a soda? When did you order a soda? Okay, I can get one for you right now.'  He had to come back and confirm one of our orders and blamed it on the ordering system. We thought he just plain forgot to put in the entire order. I would post a photo of our food, but we didn't wait around. At that point, we didn't want to eat dinner at 10pm after getting to the restaurant at 8:45pm."
Taalib M.,"JAMAICA, NY",0,83,,5.0,4/21/2016,"If you have never dined at the Cheesecake Factory...do yourself a favor. The food is always delicious, the portions huge and all the baked goods (they have much more than just cheesecakes) are stellar. The menu is enormous, with something for just about any palate.  This location is indicative of most of the C.F. restaurants I have visited. They service is excellent and the prices are reasonable for this type of fare. It can get REALLY crowded, and at peek times, you may have to wait up to an hour to get in, I recommend going for lunch or during the week for dinner to avoid the crowds. This is a great eating experience. I highly recommend this restaurant."
Laura R.,"JAMAICA, NY",33,136,221,5.0,6/7/2015,"I love this place. I always order the same thing. The Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. This dish is phenomenal. Comes with black beans, your choice of white or brown rice, sweet plantains and a delicious mango salsa. The mango salsa adds a cooling element to the dish because it is spicy.  My only complaint is that my visit here on June 4th...my shrimp was a little over cooked. Never before though. I also had their Chocolate cake to go which was amazing!!!!  Very chocolaty. I was also surprised how big the piece was. If you don't mind sharing its big enough for two."
Kelly S.,"Nyack, NY",0,19,1,4.0,10/12/2016,Waited20 minutes for table at lunch. Huge place. Very loud. Very busy. Large selection of food. Everything we had was quite good. Waitress was friendly and attentive.
Al G.,"Merrick, NY",0,65,,4.0,11/17/2016,Went on a  Sunday night. Got there before it got crowded (about 5:30) and was seated right away. This was my first time there and we went because wife got a gift card about a year ago and we just never used it. I had the chicken and biscuits which was quite good and wife had some chicken over rice dish. Portions were very nice sized and we each took some home. Waiter was pretty good so no real complaints except if you're going to serve warm bread why would you ever serve those little butters that just came out of the refrigerator so they're unspreadable. In any event they may not be there much longer as the mall that they're in is slated to be demolished and replaced with housing.
Joey A.,"Brooklyn, NY",455,134,590,4.0,9/3/2013,"Great menu. I really like that they have a wide selection of food, they even have a separate diet menu. Burgers, sandwiches, pasta, salads, soups, and there special entrees. I've never got a bad plate here, food is always hot and fresh. Think they have over thirty different flavors of cheesecake, so you will definitely find one you like. The strawberry cheesecake is my favorite, simple and delicious.  Customer service is always good, although they are always busy. There's normally a wait, but I've never waited more than 35-45 minutes, during the week there might not be any wait at all.  Restaurant is 2 floors, so is pretty big.  Lots of parking, its located in a shopping complex."
Lizzaurie K.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,7,,2.0,5/18/2017,"Update,  heard back from them with a gift card to return back and give them a second chance.  Wish they had acted while we were still there,  but at least they made the effort"
