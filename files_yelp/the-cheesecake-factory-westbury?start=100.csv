Joey F.,"KEW GARDEN HL, NY",10,12,,1.0,7/8/2017,This place should be call the salt shaker factory. Every bite of their food taste like a bunch of salt. Make sure you have water on you.
Alana M.,"Levittown, NY",26,22,,3.0,6/20/2017,"I love The Cheesecake Factory! It's more of an occasion place for me though. I find that this place is better when they're busy. Now I'm not sure if this is all their locations, but I'm the closest to the one to the Garden City location. I came here last night with my family. It was a Monday night around 7pm so we were seated almost immediately. However, our waitor & waitress were both awful. Our waitor spoke in the most monotoned voice. He gave off the impression that he didn't want to be there and he was uninterested in making our dinner nice. Anytime we had asked for more of anything or the bread they had forgotten, we almost felt like we were bothering him. I'll admit, myself or my family has never done a food service job before. We figured he was probably tired due to the gloomy weather, but when you're at work your supposed to take whatever you're feeling and put it aside. In the middle of our dinner he had to take a break and a waitress would step in for him. We figured he probably needed his break and it was fine with us. We were hoping he'd come back more cheerful.  When the waitress was helping us she had asked of we wanted dessert and gave us the menus. My sister knew what she wanted and I just needed the name of the cake I wanted, so we were basically ready. Before we could even tell her what we wanted she gave us the menus and took off. Again it was a Monday night, they weren't busy and it's not like she asked if we needed a minute. Finally when our dessert was being served, three staff members came up and sang Happy Birthday to me. Let me tell you, it was three women and it was the most quiet and pitiful Happy Birthday ever. I do kids birthday parties, I wasn't expecting anything crazy but the only people that knew it as my birthday were the table next to us. It was sad. It's a birthday not a funeral. Then she mixed up the birthday writing. She put the happy birthday on my sister's cake plate instead of mine. Not to mention my Dad's mashed potatoes were cold. The girl took my order and still got it wrong. As soon as the staff stopped singing our waitress disappeared. Didn't ask if we wanted more to drink, coffee, the bill, nothing. She just wanted to be in and out. I will say though, she was at least in a cheerful mood unlike our waitor. Our waitor came back and asked how the waitress did with us and none of us said anything. I just said, ""Well it was something."". He caught my drift and didn't say anything else.  I did have a great time. My family and I aren't the type of people to let something like this ruin our night, but that Garden City staff (at least the ones that waited on us) need some further training in dealing with customers and being attentive to your guests. I know everyone has a bad day, I understand that people make mistakes, but this was just a little much for a quiet Monday night. I never get to see my family often so I didn't said anything to a manager for their sake, but I certainly felt like it."
Ray-Ray M.,"Queens, NY",72,82,53,2.0,8/1/2017,"Disappointed. Went for National Cheesecake Day. They anticipated that more people would be dining in to get half off their cheesecake but  they decided to shut down the lower level which created long waiting times. Not only that, a waitress was seen putting cheese cake in the container with her bare hands. What happened to gloves.. #disgusted"
Mike L.,"Brooklyn, NY",44,28,5,4.0,7/26/2017,Ive been here over 20x so obviously they are doing something right!!! This is the best location in the tri-state !!!
Sarah B.,"Newtonville, Newton, MA",0,5,,5.0,11/12/2017,"cheesecake factory is amazing! food is great and the selection is awesome, there really is something for everyone. It is definatly more on the pricey side but well worth it and the perfect place to go to treat yourself. The free bread is amazing, and the servers there always treat you incredibly nicely like a fancy restaurant. There is usually a wait, but I recommend going in a group of two/smaller group because its less of a wait. But the wait is always worth it. so so so good."
Lisa D.,"Glen Cove, NY",62,274,,3.0,7/9/2016,"I've only done take out here, which is fine.  The entrance is annoying because you have to walk up a spiral staircase which is unaccountably frequently occupied by groups of unsteady toddlers or elderly people with canes (is there no elevator in this place?), and it's a bit zany at the cash register.   The staff is really nice, though, and very eager to help.  They are even polite to the rather more annoyed Long Islanders who are tired of waiting to pay for things with their toddlers or elderly relatives who need to sit down."
Cicily N.,"Bayside, NY",433,2,2,3.0,8/1/2017,"I came to this location for national cheesecake day (50% off cheesecake only if you dine in). I got here around 8:55 PM and was told there was a 40 minute wait for  4 people. The wait for this place was ridiculous. Only the upstairs was open and people were pushing me because there were too many people. Once we got seated, our waitress was attentive but told us that we should order our cheesecake beforehand because it was the bakery was backed up. We ordered buffalo wings, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta  and the Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. I was not a fan of either pastas. The Farfalle had a weird aftertaste that I could not get used to.  The portions are very generous.  Once we asked our waitress for our cheesecake, we were told that it wasn't ready (even tho we ordered before hand...like 45 minutes prior). She placed the check on the table and brought our cheesecakes in togo boxes even though we were going to be eating at the restaurant (may have been because they were so backed up?)"
Kona K.,"Huntington Station, NY",11,281,2,2.0,11/24/2016,My other review got YANKED. I did not say anything BAD. The food is good here and so is the staff-- HOWEVER This area of Long Island is very hectic and congested and caustic. It's impossible to find a time when it's not crowded here--OK- maybe Tuesday afternoon at 2:45 pm (but who eats dinner then?) Visit the HUNTINGTON LOCATION for a more calming dinner experience.  Yank THIS !
Erica L.,"Brooklyn, NY",98,201,241,4.0,7/2/2016,"Big and fancy place! I came here for dinner with friends during our summer trip. We shared the avocado egg roll appetizer, I ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta. Both dishes were delicious! For dessert, we got the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake. Dessert was amazing!"
Amethyst J.,"Freeport, NY",132,53,165,3.0,6/5/2016,"I came to this restaurant with a party of 8 for my best friend's graduation. Our waitress was extremely friendly and knowledgeable took all of our orders and answered our questions very efficiently & effectively. The bread basket was very fresh and tasty, we enjoyed devoured that. Myself and one other person at the table ordeed steak Diane and herb crusted salon with a side of fries.  Our food arrived at the table and my steak was burnt and over salted. Then I took a bite of my salmon and it had no flavor at all; it didn't look like it had ever saw an oven.. I sent it back and just decided to get dessert instead.  At the table, one person ordered a burger and everyone else ordered pasta dishes , which they were satisfied with. I also enjoyed the chocolate cake as well, which leads me to that this restaurant has skilled pastry chefs , but seams to be using some frozen foods and/or they have mediocre cooks in the kitchen in the back.  I won't be returning to this restaurant if I have any say in the matter. The only reason that I gave them three stars was because of the amazing service that we received from our waitress, Heather; she rocks and should be given a promotion and/or raise!!!"
Joseph M.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",0,8,,5.0,11/5/2017,"Yes, depending on what you get it can be a little heavy...I never have room for cheesecake so I gotta take it to go. But both the food and cheesecakes are delicious and for some reason every time I've been there I've been paired with a funny waiter/waitress."
Letty C.,"Brooklyn, NY",320,150,545,3.0,7/26/2015,"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, seriously get the best bang for my buck from little mom and pop operations, however my best friend forever suggested that I had not lived until I dined at the infamous Cheesecake Factory. Jackie you were wrong! We were seated  quickly and our waiter was friendly and magnanimous, however the food was mediocre. I ordered fish tacos and there was nothing special about my fish tacos, in fact they were bland, but the cilantro rice and black beans were a hit.  The drinks were strong, aesthetically sexy, and pricey. That's it. I got nothing."
Carolyn Z.,"Flushing, NY",311,187,376,3.0,6/18/2017,Well. Aside from the regular graduation and 16th birthday crowd this place is decent enough depending on the day and time you go. The service is pretty lax once it gets to serving a table of 25 and then you right after. They have lunch pasta specials for $14-17 and the portions are pretty desirable knowing how gluttonous cheesecake factory is. I've only ordered a cheesecake a couple of times coming here because im either too full from my meal to think about dessert or it's finally not busy for me to flag down my waitress to place an order. The table next to me at my latest visit looked as if they were done eating when i was seated next to them and ordered a cheesecake while i was still looking at the menu and they didn't receive it even after i paid the bill and was ready to leave. The waitress only checked in with them once and it was to let them know theyre backed up in the bakery right now and it was going to come out shortly. I could see the annoyance on their faces waiting 40 mins for a slice of cheesecake by the time i was done eating my pasta da vinci and definitely felt bad about it. I would suggest avoiding this place at all costs on weekends and probably dinner time too. Its just really gimmicky to be here
Renee J T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",212,674,2615,1.0,5/9/2016,"Holy Cheesecakes what the heck happened. it was Mothers day ok Cheesecake so you were crowded nothing new ...you folks should know how to handle a crowd we planned our later outing just because we knew there would be a mothers day crowd and there was  we arrived around 9pm they are open till 11  we were seated in a short time  should have known there would be trouble a friendly waitress introduces herself and says our regular server is on break. she takes our drink order iced green tea and water .

Dodie W.,"Baldwin, NY",0,7,6,5.0,3/8/2017,"I love going here . Been going for years 10 plus years . It never disappoints!! Scrimp Scampi, Avocados Egg Rolls , Fried Macaroni Balls !!! My favorites"
Cynthia R.,"ARVERNE, NY",10,52,7,4.0,7/2/2017,"I've been coming many years and Icant say I have any compliants. My favorites include miso salmon, shrimp scampi, bang bang chicken and shrimp, Bristo shrimp pasta, chicken piccatta and I guess I have alot of favorites. As for cheesecakes...I will spare you my list and simply say I havent had a bad one yet. The waits are crazy on a weekend or friday...that has to be the only bad thing about this place.   But its popular, the portion afe huge and great cheesecake."
Jiahui W.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,32,52,1.0,6/18/2017,"Wait wasn't too long, but the food was cold we ordered fried calamari and it was cold. I get it if they needed to drip the oil off. But it was completely cold!. The plate was hot but the food was cold. Idk what the concepts was behind it. I also ordered miso salmon. My salmon was burnt! And rice wasn't cook I wasn't too happy about that. Normally during your meal waitress would come over and ask"" is everything alright.?"" But no one came and asked.. we had to ask for water several times.. not very pleased with everything."
Karissa T.,"Queens, NY",48,81,10,2.0,10/26/2016,"This is not traditional American food... it's more like fusion. I have not tried the cheesecake so I can't comment on that but this place is overrated. I've always wondered why lines are out the door. The food is not good. I've been here twice and both times left disappointed. I had teriyaki chicken and it was served with pineapple and cherries on top of the sauce. It was disgusting and strange. This was 3 years ago. Not sure if it's changed by now, but the last impression made me never want to return. The menu is too big. You will spend 30 minutes trying to figure out what you want and you won't be ready when the server is ready. I guess you can't expect much from chain restaurants."
Lisa M.,"Queens Village, Queens Village, NY",0,2,,1.0,7/30/2017,"Ok so today 7/30/17 was national cheesecake day. The special was half price off cheesecake. I already went out to eat with my family so we decided to stop at the Cheesecake Factory in Westbury. Parking lot was crowded as usual. The wait was 20 which was surprising great. At was 9:30 pm on a Sunday. We all needed to use the restroom. I can only speak of the ladies room. ""DISGUSTING""!!! There was paper all over the floor and one stall had poop spatter and there was a bathroom attendant. Wtf??? I didn't use the bathroom at all and left. I told my husband once outside and he told the manager downstairs which then took care of the bathroom. I still refused to use it. Nevertheless our Buzzer went of in less than the 20 minutes. We got a nice booth   Nice window view.  We ordered our cheesecakes, sodas and hot cocoa for the kids. We were then told by our waiter ""ERIC B"" that the desserts would take between 30-45 minutes to come out due to the special. REALLY THOUGH???? Yup it took about 40 minutes. My son didn't like his Hersey chocolate cheesecake. We exchanged it for a different one and was told by our waiter ""ERIC B"" that it would be another 30 minutes for his banana cheesecake to come. We said ok and asked at that point to take it to go. Once again we waited extremely long for this one cheesecake to go. I look over to the dessert area and notice it's empty. So why is my order taking so long. My waiter ""Eric B "" is at the dessert counter just running his mouth while we are sitting at our table waiting. I ask another nearby waitress to check on my order and she went right up to ""ERIC B"" and took the bag from his talking ass and gave it to me.  Our visit was not pleasant at all from start to finish. It was very unprofessional and disappointing visit. We will not be returning. It was 2 hours there just to have dessert and horrible service. I felt like we were being punished for just ordering desserts but we ate dinner somewhere else. Never again."
Edward C.,"New York, NY",72,23,5,1.0,9/21/2016,"I ordered takeout--a Strawberry cheesecake for my wife's bday just 2 days ago. Weirdly enough, the 2F baker didn't give me the cake displayed outside, but went inside to fetch another one. Yesterday we saw the cake. Strawberries looked plump & fresh, but the cake felt like it was made out of mousse. When I ""cut"" it, the knife sliced through the cake without any fight. If I wanted to spend $25 on whipcream that looked like a cake, could have whipped it up myself."
