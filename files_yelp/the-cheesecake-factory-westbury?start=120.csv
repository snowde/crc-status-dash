Aisha K.,"Plainview, NY",0,5,,5.0,7/6/2017,"Delicious food, comfy environment and a friendly service. Drinks and deserts are excellent!! It's always fun to go there. No matter which area or which location. Always best !!!"
Marissa M.,"JAMAICA, NY",519,436,1147,5.0,3/26/2015,"I don't like chain restaurants. This location is exceptional. Upscale Caesars Palace design, a sky painted on the ceiling, Large dining space, Bar and grand winding staircase.  Been coming here for about 10 years. Service is professional, food is delicious, cocktails are slamming.  What more could u ask for ? I visited another location at the Palisades Mall in West Nyack and resented it. Just terrible. My favorite menu items are the Shepherd's Pie, Chicken Madeira, Tex Mex Eggrolls, The Flying Gorilla spiked milkshake and Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake(coconut cheesecake, super moist chocolate cake, fudge and walnuts) Advice- Portions are big. If ordering dinner: Do not eat the bread basket. Do not order alcohol. Do not have an appetizer.  Do not drink alot of water. Do all of this and leave room for amazing cheesecake."
Lisa E.,"Westbury, NY",428,406,1242,5.0,2/12/2016,"Five stars for a chain restaurant. Our kids always pick this place for celebrations and it makes us happy to know that everyone will enjoy their choices. No matter what city I am in, I always get their Thai Lettuce Wraps. I simply adore them. No noodles, double cucumbers... Love the dipping sauces, especially the green one. Tonight , the normally great service was spectacular. We had a great waitress named Massy who was helpful and friendly. The person doing the salads tonight was on top of her game as every item was pristine. We are fortunate to live down the road and pop in here whenever we are looking for a reliable meal where you know exactly what you are going to get."
Valerie B.,"New Hyde Park, NY",105,314,458,5.0,4/18/2016,"Even after all the years this place has been open, I still love it. The food here is amazing and they're so nice and accommodating for health concerns or just general likes and dislikes. The portions are huge so it's impossible to leave hungry. Impossible!  It's always been a beautiful restaurant and they keep this place looking clean and nice. Yes the floor is always slippery, but just walk slowly and you'll be ok. I don't think I've ever seen someone really slip. Though now that I've typed it, I'm gonna fall on the way out, just wait and see. The tables are generally well spaced so you don't feel like you're on top of other people. It's loud when the place is packed but that's to be expected and you can still hear the people you're with so its fine. Love the stuffed chicken tortillas. They're amazing!! Love the Chinese chicken salad. The dressing is delicious!! They have fantastic white chicken chilli. And who doesn't love the bread?! Staff is great. They have a wonderful manager named Rich. He's cool and friendly. A server we really like is Krissy K. She sweet.  My family eats here all the time. At one point we basically lived here. And I don't regret a moment of it. I still look forward to coming here!"
Willis L.,"Manhasset, NY",269,23,37,5.0,10/14/2016,"Excellent dining experience!! Came here with one of my friends for lunch and it was great! Kristen K was an AMAZING server and very attentive to both my friend and me, and she received a good tip because of that. Huge and delicious portions for the price. My Chicken Bellagio was awesome, and my friend said his steak tacos were great as well. This place never disappoints! Definitely coming back."
Orla M.,"Long Island, NY",539,256,2791,4.0,4/20/2015,"Oh The Cheesecake Factory like most chain restaurants they come with the high calorie count unless you pick off the Skinnylicious menu.  Off to the Skinnylicious menu for me: The following are some things I've tried. Skinnylicious Hamburger Beets with Goat Cheese Chicken Pot Stickers Roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread- stay away from this one (gross) Yummy and not on the Skinnylicious menu and come with all the calories you love to hate: Hot spinach and cheese dip Tex mex egg rolls Buffalo blasts Factory nachos Santa Fe Salad Old Fashioned burger Kobe burger Famous Factory Meatloaf  All of the above are yummy to the tummy with enough for a doggy bag. The service is always fast when you go at an off lunch time, not to much of a wait time. This location in Westbury located on Old Country Road has two floors. The only thing I hate is the long wait for dessert always takes 15mins to be brought to the table, appetizers come faster than that."
Christopher D.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,83,59,4.0,6/10/2017,Been here a few times and is pretty solid place.  Has some variety and has a pretty nice atmosphere.
Dan K.,"Albertson, NY",5,105,293,4.0,4/10/2016,"Came to CF today after a long hiatus. It was always a family favorite and it was time to come back! CF is popular and everyone knows how good it is. They had a few newer items but we stuck to the classics. Reminder, you're not coming here for diet-friendly fare. Glad to report that everything is still awesome! Service was very good. Still a wait (pretty brief though). The mango lime cheese cake was divine and devoured in minutes. It's always easy to find something for everyone here. It's not gourmet but very reliably delicious!"
Raul A.,"Woodhaven, NY",85,75,164,5.0,10/30/2016,It was my second visit at this location and this time it was for my birthday the food was fantastic and the staff is friendly. Definitely we'll go back there.
Jackie S.,"New York, NY",789,639,2663,4.0,4/27/2015,"Here goes my shortest review ever... It's The Cheesecake Factory.  Lots of food, lots of fatness, lots of cake, lots of yums.  Service is standard, as are the prices.  But seriously, who reads reviews for chains like these? I was just getting frustrated that after one check-in here, Yelp kept asking me to review.  You happy now?!"
Nika L.,"Hempstead, NY",31,109,189,3.0,4/2/2016,"I feel like there are way to many options on the menu (that's just my personal opinion) The food  has always been ok here, but just ok. I love some of their cheesecakes that's about all at this point."
Kenny J.,"Flushing, NY",0,16,43,5.0,12/11/2016,My one of favorite restaurants  I strongly recommend 5stars  App is very nice and easy working
Simply L.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",0,18,24,5.0,6/10/2017,Food is always delicious. The menu is so large that I try to order something new every time I go. So far I haven't had anything that I didn't like. My favorite cheesecake is the Banana cheesecake. My husband loves the red velvet cheesecake. If you don't want to wait I would suggest a week day/night. Weekends are always packed. So either make reservations or put your name on the list before you are hungry.
Khorena B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,10,4.0,6/7/2016,"I went with my sister and her husband and we had a wait time of ten minutes. Luckily, it turned out to only be five and we were seated. The one downfall of this is how close the tables are to one another. Like literally, if you have some junk in the trunk you will probably knock someone's drink over. Prices are generally around 10+ most entrees are probably around 13-15+ We had a wonderful waiter. He was very prompt and spoke French to us and was friendly and helped without question. For the appetizer, we ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip which her husband and I enjoyed, but my sister says she preferred the one from Applebee's. When out entrees came, I was absolutely blown away by the portion size. I got the Guacamole Salad with an add on of their grilled salmon and I was already nearly full from the appetizer. I was not going to finish this! I ate about a quarter of it and I was stuffed. Everything was well seasoned and the greens were crispy and how a salad should be. My sister on the other hand got something with potato mash, broccoli, and herb crusted chicken and she was not enjoying it. She complained that the broccoli was bland and the chicken was overly salted. From a quick taste, I realized that she was absolutely right! Being full as well, she only ate part of her food. Her husband ordered the normal cheeseburger and fries. He asked for it medium-well and it came out char black and dry. He was really disappointed with the cooking on it but said that apart from the lack of juice, it was good when paired with the spicy mayo. Overall everything was delicious. We took the leftover food to go and the next morning the saltiness of my sisters food went away (we are still confused as to how!), my salmon was still delicious and our cheesecake was amazing.  4/5 solely for lack of space, hockey puck burger, and salty food. But I would definitely return here."
Eduardo F.,"East Elmhurst, NY",5,33,,5.0,3/6/2017,"First the ugly. This placed is almost always packed. When that's the case; waiting can be a pain in the ass. The waiting space is tiny, your best choice is to take the beeper they give you and go wait outside or wait inside the mall. Fair enough. The bad customer service really depends on the customers themselves. I've seen customers act like complete asses; which lends itself to how the servers do their job. Speaking of the servers; they are very nice. The level of humility to work there is really high. The only downs came when my Factory Burrito was prepare with peppers; despite the fact that I requested it without peppers. This happened a few times. It's fine; since it didn't ruin my dinner. Then; there was one time when the server tried to pull a fast one on me and gave me the incorrect amount of change. The entrees that are also on point are the Factory Burrito, the gumbo, the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp, and the Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken & Shrimp. Oh; the fried mac n' cheese balls are their best appetizer. If you don't want cheesecake for dessert, order the Oreo milkshake. You won't regret it. This Factory is better than the one here in Queens; hands down. Come here."
Lara A.,"Uniondale, NY",0,2,,1.0,10/4/2017,"I received a call from a manager who apologized for our horrible experience, thank you for that. However they offered a gift card that I never actually received. It's almost been a month. Appreciate the gesture but this only makes the interaction with your company even worse."
Dava P.,"Brooklyn, NY",86,133,74,2.0,1/2/2016,"Came here for date night one night. The food is okay, as good as it gets for a chain restaurant. I had the jambalaya pasta and it was pretty good. The drinks were great too. What sucked was the waiter we had. I wish I could remember his name. He messed our drinks and refused to take them back, citing that was what we order when it wasn't. The manager had to come over to take care of us. After that he gave us our food and NEVER returned. He would walk pass our table and go to other diners. Not once did anyone come to refill our drinks or asked us if everything is good. For this, we gave a short tip. I understand waiters make their money on tips, but if you don't do your job I'm not wasting my money on you. He saw his tip and actually spoke to us! ""This is my tip?! *laughs* hope you get home really safely"" in the most sarcastic voice.  Never going back here ever."
Karla A.,"Brooklyn, NY",74,241,294,5.0,9/12/2016,"I really like this place. I've been visiting for years and you get pretty consistent delicious food. Their menu is so extensive but still very tasty and detailed. I love the diane steak and shrimp or the chicken madeira and shrimp, chicken bellagio, avocado rolls the list goes on and on. I always turn to the white chocolate raspberry truffle I want to try all the other cheesecakes but never get around to do it cause I love this one so much. The bread we get to start is so delish :) It's a little busy on weekend nights as you would expect any place to be."
John S.,"Town of Hempstead, Long Island, NY",9,24,39,4.0,10/24/2016,"Great food, good atmosphere and it didn't take long for a party of four to get seated. Only issue is the lack of a bathroom on the upper level."
Yvonne V.,"Uniondale, NY",14,16,3,1.0,3/5/2017,The service is awful! This is the second time I've had to wait over an hour. The apologizes from the waitress were non stop. The manager came over to apologize as well. I even had time to sit and write this review as I waited for my check and my dessert order. Will not be patronizing this Cheesecake Factory again.
