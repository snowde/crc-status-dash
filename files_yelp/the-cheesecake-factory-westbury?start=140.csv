James D.,"Bayside, NY",0,48,,1.0,7/21/2017,"This 1 star rating is not for the food or service, We go out of my way to eat here, the food is always great especially the cuban sandwich, I probably ordered almost one third of the menu and was never disappointed. On my last visit on July 20th. I noticed a very disturbing decal on the door, it was a gun with a red circle and line through it. Oh great, an invitation for every criminal on Long island to ply their trade here. It seems they think a criminal will read this sign and walk away. Another establishment that I will no longer frequent. Businesses should keep their Political views to themselves. The Grand lux cafe will be my go to restaurant from now on, or until they do the same thing."
Jei C.,"Brooklyn, NY",93,123,7,2.0,10/2/2016,"I ordered the Mac n cheese balls $11.50 (they were salty), the firecracker salmon $12.95 (was NOTHING like advertised. The ""sauce"" wasn't anything close to what was advertised. Picture attached), California guacamole salad $10.95(possible one small spoon of guacamole), and the Evelyn's favorite pasta $15.95(probably the only decent thing in the entire order! Worst part is, I live all the way in brooklyn, and only saw the nonsense they served me when I arrived home. For $55.78(including tax), you all should give your customers what they paid for. The salmon even tasted like it came from a can! Smh Next time I'm out there, I know to eat elsewhere!"
Matthew L.,"Queens, NY",78,6,11,4.0,12/10/2016,So heavenly food yet it is loaded with Calories. Great staff and great service. You have to respect how clean it is. It really caters to everyone.
Cher Y.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",84,175,1103,4.0,7/8/2016,"If you want to gain calories, flavors and good service, this is the place. Even salads hit 1200 cal per dish.  Very generous on portion n calories for sure."
Riza S.,"Bayside, NY",4,118,3,5.0,9/2/2016,Love this place. Can't complain about anything except the long lines because it's an amazing place to eat. I get a salad every time and it's well over what I can eat and I'm a big person.. Desert is obviously to die for.. If you go with many people try many different types of cake.. They are all very very good!!
Brittany S.,"Franklin Square, NY",86,77,13,5.0,8/19/2017,"I came here on a Friday night with one of my friends at about 6:30-6:45. We walked in to the main area, and realized the hostess stand was on the second floor, which was fine. I don't know why the first floor wasn't being utilized since it's equally as nice as the upstairs, but whatever, not the point. Since it was a busy Friday night we expected to wait. The hostess took our name and said it'd be about a 10-15 minute wait. After our wait, we got seated. Our waitress, whose name I want to say is Amanda, came over. She took our drink orders and let us look over the menu for a little bit. Since I haven't been to the cheesecake years, and it was my friends first time, we took a while to look over the menu. For our appetizer we order the loaded baked potato tots. It came with a side of sour cream, and the other sauce I believe was a chipotle ranch sauce. It was warm and super yummy. For our entrees, I ordered a BBQ burger, cooked medium, my friend ordered pasta carbonara with chicken. Both were cooked excellently. For dessert, I ordered a cherry cheesecake, my friend ordered a strawberry cheesecake. Both were wonderful. Will come back again, sometime in the near future."
La H.,"Great Neck, NY",273,628,96,3.0,8/1/2016,Worst parking lot.  Longest line to get in at every hour.  It's chaos in here and on top of that the food and desserts are only meh in this location.
Daniela J.,"Levittown, NY",53,4,,4.0,6/1/2017,"One of my favorite restaurants! It's beautiful, and the food is super yummy! Good service. And amazing cheesecake, of course!"
Max B.,"FLUSHING, NY",0,6,,4.0,9/20/2017,My wife and daughter love this place portions are big and the food is very good. We came here for lunch and we had a nice waiter. We shared some peanut butter chocolate cake very filling. I've also been to the one in boca it's very good also.
V W.,"Keller, TX",0,4,4,1.0,5/30/2017,Horrible service and horrible food. Attempted to corporate office it's been a month now and never was contacted. Our food was served cooked on outside and totally raw on the inside.
Bianca B.,"West Hempstead, NY",94,7,10,1.0,7/15/2017,"I am currently here at cheesecake with my family and I'm a bit upset at the fact that my table has not been tended to for the past 45 min. We had noticed that the group that was seated about 20 min after us had received their drinks ,their appetizers and even their entrees in a timely manner. Our waitress was kind but not attentive. After a while I decided to ask the waitress if our food would be much longer to which she replied, "" I'm just waiting on the fries"".... 45 min waiting on just fries !!!! Fast forward we now receive our meal and mine comes about 7 min after every one...which is fine I don't mind as long as my family received their meals but I'm then told that my fries will be out shortly... really?.... 20 min later and now at this point no fries but she is here to pick up our plates. I then asked her to please remove my meal from the bill and she said she would get a manager.... another 20 min passed and no manager but she comes back and said ""So my manager would like to apologize and has removed your meal from the bill"" . I thanked her put my card in the little folder and waited for her to come back. 10 min pass and NO WAITRESS!!! You have got to be kidding me  at this point Cheesecake Factory is not so busy ..so where is she ? No clue ....so I got up told my husband to get the kids in the car  and I gave my bill to a different waitress that I could find at one of the computers. I am very upset with the service that we received.  The only reason I didn't leave earlier was because my family was hungry and they were already waiting for so long. On top of that my 2 girls had their burgers burnt mind you they ordered them medium well. I would of ask them to remove their meals as well but honestly that probably would have taken an hr from the looks of it .I would honestly not recommend coming to Cheesecake Factory with a large group seeing as that they can't handle more than one large group at a time."
Priscilla R.,"Jackson Heights, NY",1,6,,5.0,5/17/2017,Excellent fried fish tacos.  Chicken Marsala is amazing.  Great service.  And fabulous strawberry cheesecake!!
Tiffany L.,"West New York, NJ",9,59,26,3.0,7/16/2017,"Food was as expected. The all American chain restaurant! I must say, their portions are outrageous- if you're super hungry, definitely eat here. Very affordable prices as well. The service is where it lost its stars. Our server did a good job, but the hostesses and management already put a sour taste in our mouths when we sat down. They gave us pagers for the wait and when we were buzzed, they were so disoriented as 10 other tables got the buzz at the same time. They had no microphone. It's two floors and chaos. Management just leaned over counters confused. After waiting another 10mins when we were supposed to be sat. They sat us down at a table that looked like a food fight went on. I think the hostess noticed my expression and mentioned that someone would clean up the mess shortly. Needless to say, no one cleaned it before our drink order, our appetizer order or before we left. There were 2 managers that saw the mess walking by and continued to frolic around joking about whatever while the servers, expeditors and hostesses all ran around with their heads chopped off. It all starts from the top. If management doesn't believe cleanliness or the restaurant aesthetics are important, the staff won't. Evidently, the staff could have used their support and help as well. So I would have enjoyed my meal more not having to sit and step in a food war zone beneath me and witness how the staff was left to fend themselves."
Aranious F.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,21,9,4.0,7/16/2016,"Just getting around to writing the review, actually came here with a friend on July 4th to satisfy my craving. I hadnt been to cheescake factory in a long time. When we got here we was told a 15-20 min wait, and that was accurate. Although there was only 2 of us, i didnt like the cramped table we got, thats why only 4 stars. The service was good, we had a great waitress, took our order with ease, food came in a timely fashion, and boy was it good. I loved everything on the plate and the portions were a nice size. My friend felt the same about his. Of course for dessert we got cheesecake! Mine a mango concoction, good. His just original cheesecake and he enjoyed it. I even ordered take out for my daughter and she loved it. I hope to get back in shorter time from the gap of time it took me to come on July 4th. Service good, food good, if they had better tables, 5 stars for sure!"
Mary-Kate S.,"Lynbrook, NY",187,15,160,5.0,3/12/2016,"An all time favorite. Nothing ever disappoints me here. All time favorites: buffalo blasts, Vietnamese spring rolls, lettuce wraps, Mac and cheese bits"
Claumery C.,"Woodhaven, NY",19,9,1,1.0,6/19/2016,"Where Shall I begin? First and foremost, the staff here at the Cheesecake a factory are very sweet and pleasant  however, DO NOT let that fool you. The reason on why they are so polite is to fool you into enjoying the mess that they are about to dish out to you.  Here's how my night went: 1. There was a 20 minute wait for a party of 2. Which was reasonable. Once our table was ready, we were seated upstairs.  2. Once we sat down, I noticed that all of the silverware that was on the table was dirty with stains! I advised the waitress about it and she only removed 1 plate setting when clearly both sets were dirty. So I called the waitress back and told her that the other set was also stained and she responded by saying "" I didn't know his was dirty either"" 3. For drinks I ordered a mixed drink the Georgia peach. Apparently I must have been under age because the this drink was more suitable for a 5 year old. There was no alcohol in it. My boyfriend just ordered water.  4. We ordered some appetizers. We got the crab dip and the ratatouille.  - the crab dip appetizer was good HOWEVER the crostinis   That came with it were jaw breakers. It literally looked that they were submerged in oil and deep fried. I just had 1 piece and my jaw hurt and the roof of my mouth was sour which didn't make the rest of my enjoyable.  - the ratatouille was surprisingly good. The flavor a were there. Well balanced. The only downside to this dish was that the vegetables were not warm they were old.  5. For the main course, we decided to have pasta dishes. I mean after the appetizers fiasco we thought that pasta would be a no brainier dummy proof.  - Louisiana chicken Pasta: the chicken was encrusted with Parmesan cheese and deep fried, the chicken was good, it was a piece of breast and it was not dry. It held up pretty well. But the pasta? Come on! It was under cooked and chewy! Not to mention the heat level on the dish + the burns on the roof my mouth did not call for a good combination. The dish contained too many peppers. I didn't even bother to try the other pasta dish.  6. The waitress kept coming back and checking up with the status on how we were doing. We asked for a refill of the water but she somehow forgot and didn't bring another glass until we reminded her again 15 minutes after the fact.  7. Lastly, go with cash so you can just get up and leave one you are finished. Because check out takes forever!! After we had our meal, it was another 15 minute wait to have our waitress take out bill and 10 minutes to come back with everything.  This was my first, and last time coming to this place.  Note to the Cheesecake Factory: raise your standards, if you want your customers to continue coming back, then the service as well as the food has to be exceptional. When customers are dining they are in for the experience not just the food and having dirty silverware should not be acceptable. It's not just me who is saying it, read the previous reviews and fix it."
Jewelle O.,"Brooklyn, NY",35,20,,5.0,3/15/2017,"The food was great, the service was great, the prices are reasonable.  We got there at 7:40pm on a Friday and seated by 8pm.  Once we made our order it took about 15 minutes to get our food.  This was my first time at this location and I will be returning."
Hope B.,"East Garden City, NY",0,5,,5.0,9/9/2017,"Best brown whole wheat bread in town good portions really good food and great cheese cake I would recommend this place a 1,000,000 times great service"
Anna K.,"New York, NY",606,174,854,5.0,10/26/2014,This is one of my favorite restaurants. Consistency is key. My food and drinks are always yum. The service is great because they normally have the managers trolling about.  The Jamaican shrimp is awesome. It comes with plantain and mango chutney.  I always order cheesecake to go because I'm normally stuffed after my meal.  It can last up to two days and still be fresh.  My waiter tonight was actually super nice. Eric M ( as there are multiple Erics)  I normally go here after shopping because it's way better than mall food.  The wait can be anywhere from fifteen minutes to half an hour depending on the day.
Lori M.,"Garden City, NY",0,1,,1.0,8/27/2017,"I do not come to The Cheesecake Factory often, but after tonight, it's off my list for good. The service was awful and the food was worse. The waitress took my order quickly, the food didn't arrive for almost 45 minutes and when it did, it was not the food we had ordered (there were only 2 of us dining). The waitress didn't return to check on us for another 15 minutes. She was not in the least bit apologetic about the error instead she remarked, oh this isn't your order is it? She returned within 10 minutes with meal I had actually ordered. It was awful, but still better than the first plate she originally sat in front of me. It honestly looked like something leftover from someone else's dinner. I didn't eat more than 2 bites of it and still left her a 15% tip.  My tip to you: don't waste your time going to this location. If you want Cheesecake Factory type food in the area, you're better off with Grand Lux!"
