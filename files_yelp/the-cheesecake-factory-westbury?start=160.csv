Evelyn F.,"New York, NY",1,3,,1.0,4/9/2017,If I can give no stars I would! I went today to have lunch it was a disaster ! They gave me my order the wrong way I waited 30 mins when they brought put my order it was wrong again I waited another 40mins my boyfriend ate and didn't even get a refill. I sat there watching him. They only said sorry and couldn't give us a discount or anything I asked them to bag up my food I no longer want to sit here they took another 20mins for that. We were ready to go and they came with the bill so fast. I won't ever go back.

Mike S.,"Long Island, NY",633,515,1987,3.0,8/25/2015,"I like how the Yelp page on a browser asks ""What keeps you coming back?"" when you check-in to a place more than once. Its a good question - why do I keep coming back to the Cheesecake Factory? I would have to say for me it is mostly about convenience or going with the flow. When you sit you are literally given a book sized menu - the pages are numbered and I think in area of 20! Add the ""Skinnylicious"" addendum for another couple of pages and if you didn't know what you wanted before you will be down right confused! On the plus side they will probably have the type of meal you are looking to eat. On the negative it will probably be fairly mediocre. On this occasion we split the avocado egg rolls - which were tasty. Deep fried egg rolls filled with avocado with other stuff means you can't go too wrong there. For our mains we went with the Tuna Tataki salad and the fish tacos, which I ordered grilled instead of tempura style. The tacos came 4 to an order which had a bland, grilled, inch and half piece of fish floating on top of the other ingredients like an afterthought. The rice served with this was dried out a bit and the beans oddly sweet. The tuna tataki salad was a decent salad, but not so sure it was the best cuts of tuna to be serving rare. The service was good, and the bill seemed a bit on the high side for the quality of the food being served. When we were leaving there were people waiting for a table, which seems the norm, but I really don't understand the draw of this place. Perhaps everyone else is just looking for a convenient place to go as well?"
Chidie-Ebere O.,"St. Albans, NY",9,8,23,5.0,4/2/2017,"Went here yesterday with my husband to celebrate my birthday and the food was amazing and very affordable, the decor was beautiful and warm, all staff from the check-in person downstairs, upstairs and the servers were all respectful and professional. We brought our 6 month old baby, and requested a booth even though we were two adults, and they were accommodating. We had our booth, sat comfortably and enjoyed the food. Only slight downside was that they were ultra packed, but I guess if you're that good, word gets out fast. I had the Jamaican Shrimp and Chicken combo (it was good but really spicy and has really bold flavors, so beware if you can't handle the heat). My husband had the Bang Bang Shrimp, and he loved loved it. I ate off of his plate (yeah, I'm one of those, can't help it) and wish that I had gotten the Bang Bang Shrimp instead, it was amaizing!!!! Didn't get any cheesecake because my hubby got me Ice Cream Cake at home and it's just too much carbs for one weekend, but will be back for the Cheesecake and Bang Bang Shrimp soon. Thanks to all the staff, you guys made my birthday special!!!!"
Ron B.,"Bethpage, NY",0,1,,1.0,8/22/2017,"Have repeatedly attempted to resolve and credit my account for being charged for 4 dinners when our party of 3 had 3! Waitress brought the incorrect meal. Finally fixed it. No one came over to apologize. In a rush I paid the bill quickly and even left a 20% tip. When I reviewed my receipt a week later saw that I was also billed for the incorrect dinner in addition to the 3 we ate. ( waitress removed the extra dinner - did not give it to us to take home etc, so why should I be billed!) Have called 3 times to ask for a refund for the meal, tax and the 20% tip I gave on that meal.  Was told certainly, they would get back to me, in addition I would get a gift card for my trouble.  Waited a few days, no call, no card, no revision on my credit card. Called again. Very sorry, etc etc.   Waited another week - nothing. Called again. Was told that a gift card was sent to me to cover my troubles.  Not a credit. Just a gift card. How this changed from what I was told by the others is beyond me! Told them i had not received it and want my card credited. They Finally agreed to do it. Oddly then got in the mail a gift card for $20  for my getting the wrong meal - no mention of them also  billing me for it! The Meal was $18.95, tax is 8.625% and my tip was 20% so my expense was a total of $24.37....not $20.  I am not being anal but why should I be out the extra $4.37? And today I see where my cc was credited for the meal plus the tax. But Not for the tip. So they assume I should still pay the tip on what I never received! Meaning that $20 gift card is now worth about $16.50. Check your receipt and if waiter / waitress doesn't write down your order - ask them to! Check things twice - bill it right!"
Sherry C.,"Whitestone, Queens, NY",101,193,719,4.0,9/6/2015,"Not bad.. But I've been to better cheesecake factories. This is a beautiful restaurant like the others but I was pretty upset they didn't give us the bread right away.. Come on. Their wheat bread is delicious but they didn't bring it. I was pretty disappointed since it was my friend's first time there. Moving on... I ordered the meatloaf (they didn't give me the lunch meatloaf) and my friend ordered the four cheese pasta with meatballs. Our waitress comes back and apologizes for not having meatballs so we changed it for chicken. I don't have a problem with that. We also ordered the avocado egg rolls and got a slice of banana cream cheesecake. These are the issues I had with this place: My friend and I couldn't finish so the waitress offered to pack it up for us. She gave us our food in the individual bags saying this one is mine and this one was hers... I came home only to find out my delicious meatloaf isn't in the appropriate bag!... I guess the waitress tried so it's okay.. Next time (there will not be a next time by the way), I'll pack my own food. The cheesecake slice we ordered was pretty sad looking. The staff compensated by smothering it with a lot of whipped cream and banana slices. The palisades mall location did it much better. Overall, I give them 4 stars. Please don't forget my delicious wheat break next time and don't give me foreign food...."
Ian C.,"Flushing, NY",36,2,2,5.0,8/20/2017,"Came here with my wife and kids for the second time. The first visit was for my daughter's birthday which took a while and on the second visit was for me and my wife's anniversary which takes only 5 minutes for a seat. There is a wide selection dishes on the menu, from Italian to Caribbean food to good old American dishes. Once you take a seat at your booth/table you feel like the mood is set for a romantic dinner, as the lighting dynamic changes as the daytime goes to night, it almost feels like the restaurant is truly lifelike. While you wait shortly for your friendly and well-patient waiter/waitress, you can listen to the wide range of music from today's to the classics. The waitress that we received was very attentive to what we wanted, she didn't even have to write down our orders, almost like she had a photographic memory! She checked on us every once in a while, seeing if everything was OK with a smile. The dish that I had was a Jamaican influenced...it tasted really good, but I am just going to give you a warning for people who do not like to have spicy food to be cautious at the succulent pepper that this dish brings to the table, unless you can drink several cups of water. And now for the star of the show (in my eyes)...DESSERT!! Actually, cheesecake in fact (although there are other types of desserts to choose from like cake, ice cream etc.).My daughter had the Raspberry cheesecake and she said it was very good, it was not too rich. My wife had the Tiramisu Cheesecake a la mode and I had the Strawberry Shortcake a la mode with ice cream. It was an enjoyable experience and I will definitely be looking forward to coming back there again!"
Samuel C.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",0,28,,4.0,3/2/2017,"Been to this Cheesecake Factory a few times over the years, its a good great food. Honestly you cant really go wrong here, one of the best chain restaurants around.They have a huge menu, seriously its quite a feat, with lots of variety. Not a fan of the pastas and pizza though. The appetizers are all excellent, intact last time we went there my brother ordered 2 appetizers, the buffalo blasts and nachos. I'm partial to the burgers and meatloaf, they really seem to do meat based dishes really well. The cheesecakes have the same verity as the rest of the menu, from plain cakes, a variety of decadent chocolate, fruity cakes, and even a peanut butter cheesecake, for those of us who like salty with our sweet.  Only downside is the wait times. I've only been here for lunch, we had to wait a while, and I'd imagine dinner time is more crowded. The wait times once the orders were taken are kinda long but not completely unreasonable considering how many people are usually there. On the plus side never once had an order screwed up."
L L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,50,40,1.0,12/10/2016,Credit machine down this sucks after waiting 15 mins then they told us.  I had to go back out in the rain to Grand Luxe...not happy
Gigi Y.,"Long Beach, NY",14,4,2,1.0,7/25/2015,"I found a cockroach in my shepherd's pie. Enough said. And im being for real. I dont have time to plant insects in my food for a refund, i can tell you that. The manager said he was going to give me a full refund. But with that aside, i dont know if i wanna go here ever again. Shit is nasty."
Danielle A.,"Atlanta, GA",390,119,452,5.0,8/10/2015,Love this restaurant. Ive been coming here for many years and the food does not disappoint. My favorite is the  Teriyaki chicken with brown. It is so good. And it comes with plantains and pineapple on the side. The sauce is what makes it so good obviously but the chicken is so moist. And for starters i get the Buffalo blast. My favorite. And the blue cheese is good too.
Amanda A.,"HOWARD BEACH, NY",2,10,16,5.0,3/17/2017,"So good service these days are hard to find but luckily Carl was there to save the day !!!!! So my mother and I waited like 30 mins,then got sat and by that time we already knew what we wanted . We then waited and waited for someone to come to our table ,finally Carl was passing and noticed we haven't been greeted yet ,he nicely stopped and asked us if someone came over to us and I said nope ,he then immediately took our order! He said he's the server supervisor and that our waiter was at the next table ( which he had just at that moment went Over to that table ,who was waiting much longer then we were) I thanked Carl   and asked him if he can just be our waiter . He asked the manager and he continued to serve us . He is a great  very attentive and professional and made sure our order was right and he pushed the food asap too !!! I hope that the management knows how awesome he is ,and how lucky they are to have him part of their team !!! Thanks again Carl for providing us with outstanding service !!!! Whoever goes there during the week for lunch ..Ask for CARL !!!!"
Maggie May C.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,16,,2.0,3/12/2017,"I love the food. The cheesecakes are awesome. Went on Saturday night. Mobbed! You would have thought they were giving away free cheesecake! We were told the wait would be 40 minutes.. but they told everyone that..it was almost an hour and a half wait. The only saving grace of this experience was our server Beatrice! Our Ninja server! She got our orders in immediately. She is pleasant, funny and personable. I suggest not going hungry because you will be absolutely famished by the time you actually get a table there or go if you've got time to kill...that whole waiting ordeal made this an unenjoyable experience..I would rather skip and go somewhere else for dinner."
Michelle J.,"College Point, Queens, NY",10,113,73,4.0,6/28/2016,Always here this place is hit or miss. Well mine was a hit I had a Mac and cheese burger was cooked perfectly and the creamy cheese sauce was really good. Waitress super attentive and friendly

Chad L.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,19,27,3.0,1/26/2017,"I went to this location for my birthday, and I enjoyed the food the service was wonderful .Really wouldn't choose this place as a first choice but it is good just the same."
Paula S.,"Great Neck, NY",111,7,10,5.0,8/5/2016,This place is my life!! You might need to sit for a hour cause its so hard to chose what to eat. My friends and i always just order a couple things and split it. Its a little pricey sometimes but so worth it. I'v gone with small parties (less than 4 people) so the longest i waited was about 10-15 minutes  But if you have a large party the wait could be about 30 minutes to a hour. But again So worth it.
Anne L.,"Washington, DC",2,19,,3.0,1/15/2017,"I went to lunch at 11:30am and the upstairs was about two thirds full. There were open tables available but my party of two was asked to wait. We were brought to a small table with two parties on either side of us even though there were several other open tables including one at the end of the row. When we asked to be moved, the host had to ask permission and so we were standing and waiting longer.  Our waitress was polite but took forever to com throughout the afternoon. We did not have complicated orders and the restaurant was not very busy. No complaints about the food. In short, the food is great but the service is lacking."
Jeffrey L.,"BAYSIDE, NY",0,8,,2.0,3/12/2017,"A restaurant that doesn't take reservations or care about customer service. 1-We called earlier in the week and were told, since there are 15 of us, to get there for 4pm, and by 6pm your table will be ready. Our friend was there at 4pm and they told us 7pm. At 7pm, we were told another 30 minutes.  2-There was a butter packet on floor and I slipped on it. I told a hostess and all she replied with was ""Ok"" and gave me a napkin to clean it up myself.  3-Ordered kids food first since we waited so long, and a quesadilla took forever to come out. All other kids were eating and she did not have her meal until we asked the waiter to follow up.  4-All the adult food came out with exception of an omelette (coincidentally) for our friend who'd arrived at 4pm. They didn't bring it out until after everyone was done eating. He had to take it to go since he had work.  5-Waiter dropped off receipt, we told him we had a gift card and he rolled his eyes to go and make another receipt. He made no apologies and took nothing off the bill except for his chance at a tip.  6-They charge tax on alcholic drinks? A glass of wine was $9.36? 7-Food and drinks were good but the management/staff need a complete makeover for us to ever step foot in there again. The place is way overcrowded with no organization or customer service. Even the manager on duty was argumentative and said ""it is what it is""."
Joshua M.,"Boise, ID",35,4,,1.0,2/16/2017,"Got the guacamole and chicken enchiladas. The guacamole was ok, but had no salt to it and the enchiladas were actually SUGARY, to the point I could not eat them. Our meal was over 60$ dollars, for food I didn't truly enjoy (Two people) the server and cooks said ""wow that really is sugary."" Yet no action was taken. Server was even joking about dipping the cheesecake in their enchilada sauce, or putting it on the cheesecake. So disappointed. Service was awesome though I can't complain about the waitress or hostess !! Sad when you pay 20$ a meal and yet places like IHOP are a better option. Please do not blow your money here I'm serious, I hope this helps. We walked out at 70$ for 2 people"
