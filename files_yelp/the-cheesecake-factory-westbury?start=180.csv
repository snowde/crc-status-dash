Anderson J.,"East New York, NY",83,15,25,5.0,7/12/2016,"Best Chain Restaurant HANDS DOWN....That Menu alone takes forever to look at because they offer so much....I've had a Few things there and never ever disappointed ....To fully experience  that menu, You have to go often a 1years time and select different items and not choose a favorite so quickly. i did that mistake a few yrs ago in 2007 and chose Chicken & Biscuits as my Fav not knowing they have like 5 or 6 other dishes worthy of that spot....Point is...I LOVE THIS SPOT"
Mike C.,"Long Island, NY",59,354,44,3.0,9/8/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory offers a little bit of everything... its almost like an upgraded diner. The menu is very extensive but they don't really have a signature meal (just dessert). They have a good array of apps- my favorite is the tex mex egg rolls but there is still a ton in which I haven't tried.  For meals, I've sampled the pastas, tacos, Chicken Madeira and a Grilled Chicken & Avocado Club- all are good but none are unforgettable. The desserts are a staple and you have to get it, but truthfully even the cheesecakes don't blow me away.  Overall its a good meal with above average service and a nice atmosphere."
Irene H.,"Oakland Chinatown, Oakland, CA",2,13,6,3.0,6/13/2016,"The service is still good but food is so so. My family always come here for family dinner or birthday party.maybe they like it..they enjoy the atmosphere.but for us,every order is big.we don't need to order too much and we can feel full."
Kristin B.,"Roslyn Heights, NY",0,1,,1.0,7/24/2017,"Got all the way through dinner and while having dessert a roach crawled across the table. Disgusted and outraged we spoke to the manager, he decided a roach was only worth comping our dessert. When there is one roach there are hundreds. Makes me sick to think that I ate an entire meal from their kitchen. Will not return."
Alice L.,"Forest Hills, NY",319,799,285,4.0,4/27/2015,"Huh, Who knew... the Food's actually really good! The last time I was here was probably around 2003... whoa - THAT long ago? I've been going to the Grand Lux Cafe instead. But my husband had a craving for Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake so we decided - why not? Sat Night, 6:30pm - 1 Hr wait for 2. We waited 55 min. Damn! Was hoping it was more like 20. The crazy thing is, there were SO many open tables when we were seated - yet there were sooo many people just waiting still. I hate it when restaurant's do that.  We were dying to get Apps but knew the portions were huge so we skipped in hopes we'd have room for cheesecake at the end of our meals. He ordered the Chicken and Biscuits. Ho in the world it was 2500+ calories... we soon  found out. The gravy was oozing butter. The biscuits, drowned in butter. The chicken and the biscuits together- heavenly! Listen, you just can't possibly go wrong with THAT much butter. I'm guessing 1-2 sticks? It was heavy, it was delicious. As a crazy calorie counter, I found myself going back for just one more bite.... several times haha. It was worth it. I ordered the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad. The salad's weren't as tall as I remembered but it was damn big. I started making a well in the middle eating my way outward. I thought I did really well in making a dent but nope. Stuffed to my throat, I waved the white flag and took the salad home. I added a head of Romaine heart the next day and made both my husband and I a big lunch the next day. This salad was INSANELY delicious BTW. The grilled chicken was perfect. Who doesn't love fresh corn. Fried Onions! YES! Avocado, Black beans, Tomatoes. It all just came together in a beautiful symphony.  ... We didn't have room for cheesecake- Bummer... But that didn't stop us from getting it to go! Oreo Cheesecake - Sooo awesome! 2 types of cheesecake up top with a 2 decadent layers of chocolate cake type fudge layers at the bottom. Red Velvet Cheesecake - Martha's Country Bakery does it better. This was on the sweet side in a not good way. Not bad of course but not as good as the Oreo. Overall, I really enjoyed our dinner. I just wish the wait wasn't an hour."
Courtney M.,"Queen Creek, AZ",205,177,349,3.0,2/17/2016,"I think I'm just not a Cheesecake Factory girl. I just feel like I have really shit luck with picking off the menu because I ordered the factory  burrito and I hated it. It was super bland and dry and I hate when burritos are smothered, I feel like that automatically makes it an enchilada and that's not what I wanted. My fiancé ordered buffalo wings, which I liked, but only because I really don't like buffalo flavor and these wings barely had any so she was a little displeased. I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a while but I'm pretty sure I didn't enjoy my meal the last time I was here. I did order an Oreo dream extreme cheesecake for my birthday and I got through most of it, it was just really rich. But the location is great, I went for brunch with a few friends and my fiancé on Valentine's Day, I came a little late but I felt like my group hadn't been waiting too long. I definitely regret not ordering brunch food. Also, I ordered the Caribbean cooler and it was just meh. Our server was really friendly and attentive though and our food came out fairly quickly so no complaints about that. I've just never really been impressed by anything I've ordered, I'm over it."
Dona F.,"Staten Island, NY",22,173,431,4.0,8/2/2015,"I think most people have eaten in a Cheesecake Factory at least once in their life since there are so many locations. Really good huge martinis if you feel like starting off with a drink.  If you are going for the first time, the menu can be overwhelming. You basically want everything. The southwest egg rolls are amazing if you want something a bit spicy. Every salad is huge and delicious and can be shared. Basically you can't make a mistake with anything. It's almost as if anything you can think of is on the menu  Then of course there's the cheesecake which you will probably have no room for. You'll have to loosen your belt or open a button. Even if you taste one of the many varieties and share- it's a must. Great whipped cream as well."
Katherine U.,"Valley Stream, NY",12,18,30,2.0,6/5/2016,"First time I am dissappointed in t One of these restaurants. We order pasta and chicken, really dry, so we ask for more sauce. The waiter brings a completely different sauce, sure no problem.We ask for water, never get it. Then he disappears and a a different waitress comes in with the check.....to find out she charges completely wrong and more $$ than what it was supposed to be. When I ask, she was all nervous and confused. When the manager comes in, we ask for the voided really receipt and he us like, it should come up in your account soon?!?!?!?! I told them to close up the check and give me a receipt of the ""voided charge"" and gave an attitude about it. Then made us wait another 20 minutes for that. No ""I apologize for the inconvenience"" or anything. It's really rude to make a mistake and not say anything about it. Never going back."
May C.,"Manhattan, NY",45,16,,1.0,11/12/2016,"Came here with my family on a Saturday night.  Hostess  yawned while checking us in and advised us it would be a three hour wait.  Sorry, the cheesecake isn't that good!  We turned right back around and went to Houlihan's - a half hour wait."
Horace M.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,5,4,4.0,12/12/2016,"Date night with my wife and aside from feasting on her beauty, the food was really good too! Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp was amazing!  Sitting on the first floor was drafty every time someone opened the door, there was a arctic blast. Nevertheless, we will be back!!"
Ashley J.,"Queens, NY",0,11,,5.0,6/29/2017,"I love The Cheesecake Factory! To begin with, every time that I go, Victoriya happens to be my waitress. As everyone knows, who you have as a waiter or waitress highly affects your dining experience wherever you go. She has such an amazing personality, very sweet, helpful, and great sense of humor. I've been to many restaurants where the waiters or waitresses were rude and not attentive, but that is definitely not the case here. I love Victoriya and I feel like The Cheesecake Factory made a great decision when they hired her. Thank you, Victoriya!"
Maria W.,"Freeport, NY",0,1,,1.0,10/14/2017,"This is my daughter's favorite place to celebrate her birthday.  We had a large party and another small group.  Waited over two and a half hours but understandable on a Saturday night.  The manager who took our seating time was quite cooperative, we had instructions for the young people in the large group.  That manager assured us the instructions wouldn't be a problem, she was accommodating and all at front desk were apologetic for the wait.  We order, our list was adhered to with the exception of two additional items that we approved.  Our bill came back to us with double and triple orders and the waitress lied, told the new shift manger that my daughter said to forget about the list and bring more of everything.  There may have been miscommunication and we were willing to acknowledge that but we heard my daughter order the two items only and that was only after she asked for our approval, we were seated close by.   Mistakes are what they are, the tall, heavy set, male manager working late Saturday night approached with an accusatory tone and with implications that were offensive.  It's unfortunate but great customer service goes a long way and the untruth, long wait, error and blatant tone just redirected mine and at least five families from future experiences at this restaurant we all once enjoyed."
N W.,"Glen Cove, NY",19,31,1,3.0,3/6/2017,"3 and a half stars. Good, upscale chain. Everything I've had here was good. The burger seems to be better than it used to be. Pastas and sandwiches are also good. Service is decent, not overly great. Setup/ambiance is cool. The only complaint would be that the menu is just too wide and overwhelming; I don't want to read a book when deciding what to order."
Leah W.,"Westbury, NY",0,4,,5.0,6/25/2017,Always satisfied. By now my order is pretty consistent. Pasta and chocolate mousse cheesecake. Great place for family
Wendy G.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",64,4,,4.0,7/24/2017,Make sure to get here early there is always a wait. Plenty to choose from from low calorie (skinnylicious) to vegetarian (veggie burger=yum) great assortment of drinks & desserts...forget it. Make sure to bring your parka as it's frigid inside in even on cool days. Asked if the temps could be adjusted as I saw everyone put on a jacket or sweater or complain but nothing happened.
Jeanine Z.,"Levittown, NY",0,17,1,2.0,6/25/2017,"This is my favorite restaurant. My ""go to"" place for celebrations. Unfortunately we had a bad experience the other night. food was just ""eh"". My son ordered shrimp scampi and it was horrible. Cold and way too much lemon. We told waiter and he apologized but didn't offer to replace it or get us anything else. I gave my son my dinner and just filled up on cheesecake (which of course was the best). I just think when you have $20 meal that is not eaten, someone should address it. Was charged full price for an uneaten meal (not even comped a soda). I think from now on this will just be my ""go to"" dessert place."
Isis M.,"Lindenhurst, NY",0,6,,3.0,12/22/2016,"This place is okay because you can make your own food/desserts, but extremely over priced. If you haven't gone, go for the experience but it's really not worth the money. It's a nice atmosphere, drinks are good, and dessert is good. But the food kind of sucks."
Cyn F.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",48,176,149,5.0,7/10/2014,"I love this place! The food is really good, and the red sangria is probably the best I've ever had! I really like the tex mex eggrolls as an appetizer. The chicken di pana is delicious. It is 2 breaded chicken cutlets, and it comes with a side of amazing mashed potatoes, and broccoli. My boyfriend got the mac and cheese balls. I liked them a lot, he thought they were too cheesy; (I love cheese!) I LOVE their banana cheesecake!! I love anything banana flavored, so if you are a banana lover also, get this cheesecake! It tastes even better everytime I go. The cream they use always tastes really fresh. Chocolate macadamia cheesecake is pretty good too (but the banana is better- I guess I'm biased?) Overall, great place. Somewhat of a friendly staff (some nice, some not). Good prices! You can dress up or dress down. Dave and buster's right next door, so you can go play some games and burn off all the calories you consumed :-) Oh, they don't take reservations over the phone so you have to go there and wait. I've waited anywhere from 25 minutes to a little over an hour. I overheard a wait time once for a table of 2 at 11:00pm on a Saturday night was 2 hours. Try to get there at least an hour before you plan on eating. Bring a snack to eat while you wait :)"
Bl L.,"Hicksville, NY",0,54,,1.0,6/7/2016,"They need to use less oil.  If you have ordered from this place, you know what I mean.  When you put their pasta in the microwave and it comes back with grease all over. that tells you they are masking their food with oil. They are nice about a bread basket but whatever... the food tastes very artifical to me at Cheesecake Factory.  Perhaps I should have ordered the Chinese chicken salad."
Sandra P.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,4,5,5.0,6/4/2016,The appetizers (fried macaroni & cheese and crab bites) were great starters.  To help them down we had some tropical margaritas that were sooo good.  Yum!! We enjoyed our entrees and the service was on point.  Great evening was had by all.
