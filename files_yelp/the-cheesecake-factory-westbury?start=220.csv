Yaffa G.,"Rego Park, NY",237,26,4,5.0,9/24/2016,Had dinner here tonight with a few friends and it was honestly the best experience ever. I've ate here before and the service was never as great as it was tonight. Our server was Matt and he is such a great waiter. He took his time going over the menu with us answered all our questions and even made some great suggestions. I will definitely be coming back here again.
Saroj S.,"East Meadow, NY",0,6,,4.0,5/15/2016,"On Mother's Day, I ate 3 pieces of cheesecake.  My family and I ordered one piece of vanilla bean. This was tasty and good.  It was like eating vanilla cake. Then, we had a piece of banana cheesecake with real bananas.  This was  too sweet for me. Finally, we had a piece of apple cinnamon.  This was crunchy.  Very sweet, too, and possibly artificially flavored.  Overall, everything was yummy."
Yesenia R.,"Valley Stream, NY",17,1,,5.0,5/15/2017,First time we went to the restaurant.  There are very nice and neat everything. The foods and service are fabulous  :. One of my favorite Santeria was so good!!!
Barr H.,"Levittown, NY",178,354,217,4.0,1/6/2015,Hard to find anything negative to say about the Factory. The plentiful great choices make it perfect for everyone who is in the mood for anything.
Long K.,"Bellevue, WA",95,365,862,3.0,3/7/2014,"Ain't nobody got time for the economic recession, when you can be dropping money at The C.C. Factory. 4-5 stars for good portioned food/cheesecakes. This particular location gets 3 overall since service was severely lacking. This is the type of place where you'd want more if you're only experiencing it for the first time. I was one of those guys years ago, until I move away from suburbia central and realized there's more out there. This location is attached to The Source Mall (seriously why does it still exist?). Came in early for a weekend lunch, but the upper and lower levels sure gets packed by 12/1pm. Service fell off completely once the rush came in. Past time Favorites: Miso Salmon, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Smokehouse BBQ burger, Tiramisu cheesecake. Oh don't forget the free table bread. I've made the analogy of people who bring their families out to feast at this chain regularly (you can drop a hefty sum for a party of 4 here), but refuse to drop a dime on their own personal health services. Now I'm just opening up a whole new can of issues..."
Tamar O.,"Queens, NY",414,177,119,3.0,10/25/2015,"Ah, yes, The Cheesecake Factory. Always a pleasure to stop by for a meal and a slice of cheesecake with the exception of this past visit.  It all started out just wonderful. We were told there was a 30 minute wait which was no problem because we usually end up waiting much longer than that. So this was a pleasant little surprise. We were seated a little bit after our buzzer went off.  We always order an app, an entrée, and a cheesecake to split. If we ordered our own entrees we definitely wouldn't have room left for the cheesecake. And let's be honest, who goes to cheesecake factory without the intention of having some cheesecake? We ordered the crab wontons which were the best things we ate there. We ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp entrée which was pretty good but not exactly what I remember it tasting like last time I ordered it. The portion was a little smaller I believe and a little spicier, and it also had less of a peanut taste. The sauce for this dish is a creamy like peanut Thai sauce. Good, but inconsistent. The cheesecake we opted for was the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake. It was my least favorite cheesecake I've tried with them. It tasted like straight up pumpkin mix from the Libby's can mixed with cinnamon and cream cheese. Not impressed. In the word of Ron Burgundy ""Pumpkin cheesecake was a bad choice."" Wait or was it ""Milk was a bad choice""? Close enough! I also ordered a California Whiskey Sour which was delicious! It was a whiskey sour with a white wine mix to it. If you like whiskey and wine, you'll love this. I ordered two of them and both of them came out only 3/4 filled. Kind of disappointing, but still enjoyable.  Service was decent for a busy Saturday night as well. We'll be back.... eventually."
Sheryl G.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",114,68,8,2.0,7/24/2016,Ate here in Marina Del Rey. I wasn't impressed. I ate here again in DC and well they have a good miso salmon. But nothing too outstanding that makes me want to drag myself back into this place. I've always opted to drag myself away from it and into the PF Chang's instead.
John G.,"Wantagh, NY",28,9,,1.0,3/12/2017,"We were seated at 135-140 and once greeted by our ""server,"" if you can ever call her that, we immediately knew what we wanted and placed our order. My boyfriend got eggs benedict and I ordered a southwest chicken sandwich. Nothing complex or that would take long to prepare. We waited over an hour for our meals.  2 couples seated next to us on either side seated at least 15 minutes after us who ordered full on meals (chicken marsala, a steak, skinny chicken pasta and some other dish with rice and beans) received theirs before us. We asked to speak to the manager who NEVER came over and we're given the option to get a ""free"" piece of cheesecake to bring home. This was such a horrible experience and no effort was made (aside from a pathetic piece of cheesecake as a consolation for such a terrible ordeal that was my meal) to rectify the situation or even to apologize. Disgusting customer service, lazy employees and inattentive management is a good indication  that my friends and I won't be returning unless something is done."
Airotciv L.,"Concord, NC",1193,163,604,4.0,2/13/2015,"Their food is amazing!  The entrees are huge and usually exactly as described and what you expect.  The desserts are divine.  I have gone here many, many times and it never disappoints.   I sometimes get an entire cheesecake to celebrate birthdays in our family, cause we like their cheesecakes that much.  The Snickers Cheesecake, or seasonal Pumpkin Cheesecakes are unforgettable.  On the downside:  Sometimes the wait for a table is a bit longer than I'd like, and if you get a dessert to take home, it will cost the same, but it will not have the garnish you'd get if you'd had it there.  For instance no whipped cream or berry garnish unless you request it."
Danielle J.,"Forest Hills, NY",1,17,75,5.0,9/24/2016,I came here on a double date. Food was amazing. The staff was so attentive and everything came out so quick. This was my first time here and ill def be a regular. I love the fact that the menu has so many options as well.  Ask for MATT! BEST WAITER EVER!
Nick M.,"Bayville, NY",0,20,17,5.0,5/1/2017,Cheesecake Factory has always been a favorite go to. Either eating at the bar or at a table. Always a great experience. Defiantly bring your appetite. And please bring back the factory Sampler!  That was the best!
Joel J.,"New Hyde Park, NY",158,9,8,5.0,3/20/2017,"I have been going here for years and have never had a bad meal. Wait times can be long, especially on the weekends.  But hey, you get what you pay for.  Portions are pretty generous, drinks are delicious, and apparently they also have cheesecake."
Jay S.,"Bushwick, NY",4,16,10,5.0,10/12/2015,"I have always liked The Cheesecake Factory, but this location has been consistently my favorite. The food is good, the drinks are good, the desserts are good and the prices are decent. I've eaten here at least a dozen times over the years. If you go on a holiday, go early, or be prepared to wait."
Sharon L.,"Bay Shore, NY",59,23,24,3.0,10/1/2016,"Food is pretty good but come early on a weekday for lunch. Staff is knowledgeable and professional, cheesecakes are divine but none of it is worth the 45+ min wait that there always is on Sunday afternoons or Fri & Saturday nights. Also kind of noisy during peak time so not a great date place. Perfect for weekday lunch or brunch with girlfriends, though! PS: I'm weak for the avocado egg rolls -- yum!"
Laurene G.,"ROCKAWAY PARK, NY",72,5,,1.0,7/5/2016,"Horrible experience  My grandson's dinner was served first so he was finished before we were served our entrees.  We saw our waitress twice.  When we finally received our entree, they were cold (mashed potatoes do not taste good cold) - we asked for a manager who came over and flippantly said ""sorry""  we could put them back - then our steaks would have been overdone.  She walked away and we never saw her again.  We traveled a bit to get to this restaurant but we will not be doing it again.  Very disappointing."
Joan H.,"Brooklyn, NY",56,40,140,4.0,10/9/2015,"Food was excellent, wait time was less then 15 min (obviously it was the weeknight), portions are huge definitely not for the calorie conscious lol, drinks were amazing.....only con felt rushed..."
Sau Lai H.,"New Hyde Park, NY",0,66,4,2.0,3/12/2016,We got there on a Saturday afternoon at 415. They checked us in and said that there were tables upstairs available. We went upstairs and waited online...guess what?  No tables available. Not 3 minutes later the buzzer goes off and we see the hostess...she takes the buzzer and tells us to go downstairs as there is a table ready. We go back downstairs and wait another 10 minutes because there isn't a hostess to seat you.  Finally got seated ..... Server was great but kitchen very slow and people were waiting a log time for food to come out. My son ordered the pizza and I didn't even like it...was like eating paper with wet flour in it.....thankfully they took it back It's hit or miss at this location ... Either 5 star or 1 star
Vijay T.,"Valley Stream, NY",24,1,,5.0,4/16/2017,Excellent service..Chris was very helpful and made sure we were well taken care of..will definitely return!
M. T.,"Queens, NY",5,7,10,4.0,2/22/2016,"The food is pretty good, for a chain restaurant.  Although I do feel like certain items on the menu are a little over priced, I haven't had many complaints about the food. My only criticism... the cheesecake is a little too sweet and the drinks could be stronger.  Other than that, the food quality is consistent.  The place gets busy and crowded on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays but the wait staff moves fast.  The wait time can easily be 30 to 40 minutes during prime time so they'll give you a pager device to let you know when your table is ready.  Random side note : The Old Country Road location has slippery floors....I've seen people slip and plates end up on the floor."
Cristina S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,36,68,4.0,10/17/2015,"Not my first time at CF. LOVE IT!! Try the strawberry lemonade, sweet and sour at the same damn time!!! Btw this location gets super crowded on the weekend. Try to catch an early dinner before 5pm if you can."
