Ettennae V.,"Freeport, NY",405,42,228,5.0,5/29/2016,"The biggest menú I have ever seen.  Love their tamale appetizer.  All tbe right flavors in one plate. Avocado toast were good but nut much flavor.  Cherry Cheesecake is to die for.   It's my all time favorite and I can never find it anywhere buu they have it.  Mexican coffee is great and strong.  Always a great experience, and last tomes I been there tbe waiting is minimal."
Joseph A.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,15,1,4.0,9/3/2016,"I wasnt happy with the smoothie i purchased & they gave me a refund for that, which was nice. The food was fairly good. Although, idk why both times i went i wasnt able to be on the first floor."
Rah D.,"Hempstead, NY",58,72,798,3.0,1/19/2016,"Why did the chicken and biscuits menu change? It is horrible. Used to be flakey biscuits, now more like cornbread. The sauce was a white creamy sauce, now....salty and brown"
Emily M.,"Queens, NY",0,40,4,5.0,10/8/2016,"My boyfriend and I love to come to The Cheesecake Factory. The servers are very nice and friendly. The buffalo blasts are great, I also love the oreo cheesecake."
Mal L.,"Elmont, NY",0,32,14,5.0,4/5/2016,"Great food, great atmosphere. Came on a sunday afternoon and was seated within 10 minutes. The bread was warm and delicious. I had the chicken di pana as my meal and it was very good. For dessert i ordered the reeses peanutbutter cup cheesecake with vanilla ice cream. So delicious. I would come just to pick up a piece of cheese cake."
Lucinda O.,"Elmont, NY",4,57,106,3.0,2/25/2017,"Came in for cheesecake and the crowd was unbelievable.   The bakery didn't have a line but the staff was busy yapping.  They kept saying it's coming but they kept chatting.   The manager came by to talk too.  Who was allowed to close out cash register , who was staying and who was helping who.  They could actually go faster if they multi-task"
Lynette C.,"Port Jefferson, NY",8,66,3,5.0,7/24/2016,"Came here for my birthday this year, we had an early lunch. The place was quiet. Me and my best friend shared the chicken Caesar salad, it was quiet large and I couldn't even finish my half! She finished it for me. Then we ordered two cheesecake slices. The red velvet cheesecake and the macadamia nut cheesecake. My friend ended up loving the macadamia one and I ended up loving the red velvet it was a win win. This cheesecake factory is two stories. We sat upstairs, and the atmosphere was delightful, very eye appealing."
Hannah Tiger P.,"WHITESTONE, NY",192,32,19,2.0,8/28/2014,"The food was lovely. They gave huge portions. The food took over an hour to prepare, but because the server apologized, I wouldn't fuss over it. The other tables looked very upset & impatient, though. I ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. It was tiny Penne pastas in sweet Chipotle sauce, a bit too sweet for my taste. The Lemonade was VERY sour but not so much that I couldnt drink it at all. I understand that busier restaurants have certain sections assigned to certain servers, because I work in a buffet myself. BUT. The waitress with long, black, braided hair & blue tie was INCREDIBLY RUDE to me. Im assuming the table next to mines was her section & I wasnt. Not knowing that, I asked her for a refill of water after she took the request of the neighboring table.. And her response was DISGUSTING. Absolutely disgusting. She first looked at me like I was a lost child in a foreign country. Then she slowly said, in exact words, ""Uhhhh.. (pause)... sure???""  Like she was confused & didnt know what water was. Then she smirked and walked away. 30 minutes later, I asked my server for water & she comes up behind me & says in a demanding tone, ""Oh right. Give her more water."" And trots away. Miss, im sure you recieve your own seperate tips for your own table & dont want to serve for a table thats not paying you, but whats to say I'll become a regular customer &be seated in your section one day? I know the restaurant is busy & im just one customer but my first experience here has a bad impression now. Ill probably return & give the place another shot, because your horrible attitude shouldn't affect the whole restaurant's evalution.. but if ever I was seated in your section, your tip will be given as low as your attitude & service. That is all."
Thu H.,"JACKSON HEIGHTS, NY",177,7,,1.0,8/19/2015,"Once in awhile my friends and I consider making the hour drive for a huge selection of cheesecake and huge portioned food for matching prices. Aside from the expected wait time at these type of chains and difficulty flagging down your assigned waiter, we generally have a good time in the very spacious restaurant. It's just this one experience might've ended the long tradition of visiting the cheese cake factory.  We spent more than two hours at Cheesecake Factory and not by choice. I don't know how many complaints it would've taken for Westbury's managers to get the idea that our service was the worst. Our conversation with two different managers led us to believe their only solution to food service gone wrong is a slice of cheesecake and to reprimand their servers. Long wait time, wrong orders, cold food, apparently lost food, stale bread, wrong bread, dirty straws, dirty utensils, odd segregated seating, and condescending managers with their cheesecake.  Thanks to our apologetic and kind waitress, she managed to grab us the manager in regards to our out of the ordinary experience. The first manager came over to apologize about our long wait only and to make sure we realized they tracked how long we sat at the table so we're not allowed to exaggerate- THANKS FOR THE TIP. We said we waited an hour for food but we were sitting here for a total of an hour and a half and counting- sorry, is that acceptable? He offered us complimentary cheesecake for the wait. We declined not wanting to spend another minute there.  THEN the bill came- we were hoping to pay and get the heck out to celebrate elsewhere but they made errors on the bill and we had to talk to the manager once more and this time they sent someone else. (The waits for the managers are another taunting 5-10 minutes) We listed our complaints formally to the second manager who nodded along and kept asking ""and?"" -I'm sorry... Are six + complaints a low amount? Is the bench mark for courteous treatment at 20? ""It's on me, split it amongst the four of you"" His response to our friend's spoiled belated birthday experience appalled me. We've stressed that we're not here cause you problems and we normally like your service and are loyal customers. We were patient and quite understanding for all the blunders but at the very end it ended up being A LOT. This experience goes to show that you're apparently supposed to still pay for their mistakes.  Your servers were gracious to assist us in finding you. Now who do we go to to assist us in finding a solution for you?"
F L.,"Bayside, NY",0,2,,5.0,3/26/2017,"By far the most amazing experience. I myself work in the food service industry and when I tell you that everything was top notch, from the service to the food to the warm greetings upon entering and feeling of satisfaction upon leaving, I truly mean it. Our server Eric was a true and absolute gentlemen and an amazing server, Constantly around and checking on us and ensuring we were enjoying ourselves as well as the meal. We had a tiny very minuscule inconvenience which was quickly resolved by a manager as quickly as possible. This is my wife's favorite place to eat and it's honestly easy to see why. If you guys come in to dine please make sure you have Eric serve you, you won't be disappointed at all."
Shirley T.,"Brooklyn, NY",163,327,1234,4.0,2/26/2013,"Love this place. Service is always consistently good. The wait time is always very long but the food is so worth it and I always go to the stores in the mall to kill time.  Every dish I've had here has been delicious but very high in calories. They do have the Skinnylicious menu, but I haven't tried it yet. My fave dishes are the Chicken Bellagio and the Jumbalaya, of course. The strawberry lemonade is always so fresh. The Peach Bellini is very good too. Best chain restaurant."
Sonia R.,"Nassau, NY",55,54,202,4.0,10/29/2014,"Ok after my previous review we have come back few times. I had update my review. This time I had the Cesar chicken salad and it was amazing. Very flavorful and fresh. And CHRISTINA OUR WAITRESS was the SWEETEST person ever. She was very attentive, sweet and did everything with a smile even though she was extremely busy.  So Cheesecake Factory I only updated my review because of Christina. I hope you guys hire more people like her."
Felix S.,"Flushing, NY",220,203,981,4.0,11/26/2014,"Cheesecake Factory- it's always the 1st place that comes to mind when looking for a place to celebrate birthdays and special family occasions. All Cheesecake Factories can be sum up with one word- BIG.   Dining Area is BIG-  I've been to around 10 different Cheesecake Factories in the past and I have never seen a small one and this particular location is no exception, I would estimate this place can probably seat up to 200+ guests? Food Selection is BIG- When they give you a book as a menu, you know you are going to spent the next 15 minutes studying it! The menu actually covers a wide range of cuisine from American, French, Italian to Asian and even Caribbean so there's something for everyone. Some of our favorite items here are: App: Portabella Mushroom, Avocado and Zucchini Fries (recent discovery, SO GOOD!)  Ahi Tartare Louisiana Chicken Pasta Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta Crispy Chicken Costoletta Luau Salad (this one is the wife's favorite!) Portions are BIG- No actually they are HUGE, you will go home with the next day's lunch 99% of the time. (that 1% of the time is when you have salad and you can't take it home cause it'll taste all weird the next day).  Btw Even their lunch portion is big  TIP: I love their pasta's here, if you are looking at the Garlic Noodle but don't want the grill chicken (they sometimes taste rubbery I feel you), sub it with crispy chicken (the ones on the Louisiana Chicken Pasta), it'll save you some calories and still taste great!! Desserts are BIG- Not only are the entrees big, their desserts are big as well. I always find it funny that the place is call Cheesecake Factory with an emphasis on cheesecake but majority of the time I'm way too full after entree. Maybe they should follow this order instead:  Drinks - Bread - Appetizer - Dessert - Entree Price BIG- Just kidding, I think prices here are quite reasonable.  Food here taste great and if you think about it, you are actually paying for two meals (lunch + dinner or dinner + next day's lunch) Overall Cheesecake Factory is great for both big and small groups, their service is good, food delicious! Just make sure you come early during the weekends cause the crowd can get BIG and try to restrain yourself from eating too much or else your tummy might get BIG as well."
Damian W.,"Henderson, NV",4,65,31,5.0,1/6/2016,"Great ambience, food and service were great. I usually order my favorite Chicken Marsala dish each time I visit a Cheesecake Factory location, and tonight my Marsala was amazing. I would have to say this was the best dining experience of all my prior Cheesecake Factory visits. I will definitely be going back to this location. Waiter was very friendly, we were promptly greeted and seated in a timely fashion as well. This experience was absolutely worthy of five stars."
Cindy F.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,19,15,2.0,7/31/2016,"After submitting my previous review to the company, I was contacted by a manager from the store. We had a constructive conversation about what went wrong during the visit and I left the conversation more comfortable with giving them another chance. They offered compensation even after I stated that it wasn't necessary. I'm glad they went out of there way to have a conversation about what happened and acted in a way to at least attempt to alleviate the situation. I most likely won't visit anytime soon, but I know I'll end up there before the year ends."
Jasmine A.,"New York, NY",3,101,83,5.0,6/26/2016,"Idk why this place received a lot of bad reviews. My experience here was good. The service was amazing and food was really good. My party managed to get seats very quickly and by the Windows upstairs.  Appetizers: The southern fried chicken samplers. 5/5 very good and flavorful to me Entrees: Chicken and Biscuits 5/5. This was my sisters dish and it was way better than mine, I loved it. My dish was the Lemon herb roasted chicken. 3/5 it was dry and I wish it had sauce or something along with it. I wouldn't recommend this dish.  Dessert: Strawberry cheesecake 5/5. I loved this cake, and I would say it's better than Martha's Country cheesecake.  I would recommend this place to a smaller group considering that bigger parties take longer to get seats. The food was good and I would come back again."
Fran B.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,3,,5.0,8/18/2017,my family enjoys going there for all special occasions.  can be a little pricey but the food is always prepared perfectly the servings are ample.  we love it
Thomas W.,"Long Island, NY",210,62,5,3.0,9/28/2015,I have never really been a Cheesecake Factory fan.  The food is okay and the prices are probably a bit high.    I rarely go anymore.   Whenever I go with my fiancé if she gets anything other than a salad she always gets sick.  Always busy and sometimes multiple hour long waits
Farhana S.,"Los Angeles, CA",295,436,2031,2.0,10/27/2014,"I Love The Cheesecake Factory! After moving to NY, I was surprised to see that they don't have very many locations out here, since in Cali they're pretty much located everywhere!  Nevertheless, I was still excited that I found one not too far from Queens. I had my husband bring me here on day after work as we rushed to make it in time for their happy hour specials that I love. Sadly, upon arriving the hostess informed us that this location doesn't serve happy hour. WTF? Aren't all the chains operated the same way? What a shame!  So we decided to just have dinner. We had my favorite, their fried calamari for appetizer. Though this item is always a winner for me, the portions here are a lot smaller than any other Cheesecake Factory I've been to. For entree my husband had their Chicken Jambalaya Pasta and I had my favorite Chicken Piccata with side of rice instead of pasta. This is absolutely my favorite place for Chicken Piccata. Though, I don't think I will ever order this item from here again!!!  After coming to this location several times. One night I had gotten food poisoning from the Chicken Piccata! OMG, the worst case experience. I was up all night vomiting and had really bad diarrhea  for several days. Not sure what went wrong with their food that night!  I did call and mention this issue to the manager, who took down the information and said he would call me back. No one ever called back!!! Horrible customer service and not expected from such a big chain. So, I called them again and spoke with another manager who took down my information and said he would also call back. Though I had given up, the manager did return my call and apologize for the experience, took down my address as well and said that he will have the food from that night looked over. He claimed, ""several people had the same entree and they didn't hear any complains."" But isn't it always possible that I was the lucky one to get contaminated?  Anyway, I let the issue go and several weeks later received a gift card from the location and an apology letter. The manager also took time to contact me and make sure I received it. I appreciated their effort, though due to this bad experience, not sure if it's a location I'd return to."
Steve L.,"Great Neck, NY",93,127,1,3.0,7/31/2015,"The last time I was at this Cheesecake Factory was when the Source Mall was still the Source Mall. I didn't even realize it had become a ""dead mall"" until today when I walked through the mostly empty mall that once had been full of life.  The good news is that the Factory itself still seems to be booming. We came on a Friday night and the wait for two people was about 15 minutes. The place was jam-packed full of people on both the first and second floors.  Our server tonight was excellent--friendly, patient and very capable. The one fly in the ointment was the amount of the wait. Along with waiting to be seated, it seemed like we waited an eternity to order, waited an eternity to get our entrees, waited an eternity to get a soda refill, and then when the meal was over I waited an eternity for the check. Our server would simply disappear for long stretches at a time.   I don't blame her in the least (and gave her a full tip), I just got the feeling she was being stretched to try to take care of too many tables at once.  As for the food itself, the cheesecake (which I've learned to always order ""to go"") was phenomenal as always. The entree itself, as always, was substantial in size but mediocre in taste. It's the kind of meal you see on a menu and your brain tells you ""yes, yes, yes"", but after eating about half of it your stomach says ""no mas"".  Something else that bothered me, although it wasn't the restaurant's fault, was that my very, very pregnant wife was standing there waiting for 20 minutes, and there were a bunch of young people sitting on the benches. Not one offered to give up their seat for her. Just for fun, I took my wife's shoulders and slowly moved her to the point where her belly was about a foot away from the nose of the 20-something woman and nothing. Come on Long Island, this is basic stuff.  In any case, still an excellent place to hang out with friends, generous soda refills (when you can get them), food that's better than eating the leftover scraps in your refrigerator, a phenomenal guacamole appetizer, and awesome cheesecake gets this place an ""A-OK"" from me."
