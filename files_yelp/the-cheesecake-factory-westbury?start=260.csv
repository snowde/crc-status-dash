Nicole G.,"Oyster Bay, NY",29,1,1,4.0,2/2/2017,Food isn't bad.. service was good.. just  wish I wouldn't feel like slipping and sliding in the floors
Trish P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,,1.0,2/23/2017,"Worst service ever, charged for drinks we never received and brought over wrong wine twice.  Manager came over to give us attitude.  Completely appalled by this experience.  Mediocre food with terrible service.  No thanks!!!  NEVER AG"
Jean-Paul L.,"New York, NY",16,57,127,2.0,12/3/2014,"Pricey based on the food quality. I've heard of it for ages, first time there last weekend(Thanksgiving weekend). All American, comfy and cozy ambiance, large portion, great waiting service...but for the food itself, frankly, I've experienced better."
Megan P.,"Garden City, NY",2,10,2,3.0,7/5/2016,"Your typical Cheesecake Factory. There's a very long wait, but the food has always been consistent. Had to take off a star because there is a hostess who is extremely short and rude every time I go."
Stephanie W.,"Brooklyn, NY",342,156,41,2.0,10/13/2015,"Took us 10-15 minutes to get a bartender's attention, even though we were 2 of 5 people at the bar. I get the same meal every time I dine at a Cheesecake Factory. The chicken in my pasta da Vinci was dry and overcooked. The sauce was tangier than normal - and the pasta was undercooked. Our waitress took forever to bring us the check and didn't even offer us water... Not a fan of this location."
Meka S.,"Rosedale, NY",69,166,373,4.0,10/26/2015,I probably gain about 2lbs every time I come here but it's sooooo worth it b/c the food is so good . We started off with some fried mac & cheese balls . Now that was heaven sooooo good . Then for my entree I had chicken Alfredo and that was equally as amazing . Lastly for dessert I had an cookies n cream milkshake and it was amazing soo delicious . Everything was just soooo delicious  that's why i didn't mind the calories. Can't wait to come back here again ! The wait to get seated wasn't too long and our waiter was great !
Javier E.,"East Meadow, NY",4,12,1,2.0,6/27/2015,"Sorry Cheescake but you've done this to yourself. The quality of food and service has gone down. I could once deal with the horrific wait times. But after I am seated at a table it takes way too long to have a waiter ask for drink orders. At this point we (family of four with 2 kids) order out entire meal at one shot. That helped a little bit not anymore. Last time we waited and waited and waited. The people to the left and right were served before us. Then I was served the wrong dish. All I can say is they got very lucky I am not allergic to shell fish!!! Please Cheescake, you were once the best quality meal. Get back to what you were or you've lost a family that's been with you since we moved out to Long Island."
Michael L.,"New York, NY",83,119,616,3.0,9/20/2014,"Food is what you would expect -- chain restaurantee type. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, so there are a few loaded photos here hehe."
Marcus C.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",758,552,1176,4.0,5/30/2013,"I have been a fan of this place since 2006 and owe it a good review. Food: if you like large portions for a reasonable price, this is the place for you. The Pasta Jamabalaya (sp?) is a favorite. I also love the pasta with shrimp in a white sauce (forgot the special name). The whole wheat dinner rolls are always warm and delicious. Cheesecake desserts are on par with many of the famous places, though it doesn't beat Veneiro's, Eileen's Special Cheesecake, or Junior's. Service: totally hit or miss. Most of the time, it's great! When it gets too busy, however, it may prove difficult to get your server's attention. Decor: this place is so large that sound reverberates throughout the place, making it relatively loud. This made it lose one star. Wait times can be insane! Be sure to come at about 6 p.m. for dinner! Any later, and you may be stuck with an hour wait time!"
Lindsay D.,"Glen Head, NY",1,5,7,4.0,8/17/2016,"This place is great for all ages. Huge menu to choose from. Everything is delicious !!! Got try the salads and sandwiches. I come here all the time, also great drinks"
Ta B.,"Manhattan, NY",3,60,185,4.0,11/10/2015,Really good food and service! Always packed but well worth the wait. Never been disappointed. The cheesecake here is so delicious!
J. D.,"Astoria, NY",7,149,18,4.0,10/6/2015,"The food selection is abundant! This location is always busy and crowded, but the food is well worth it. I am a huge fan of the sliders and the corn tamale...The only downside is when you read the calories next to the items. It is ALMOST a deterrent.... We really enjoy coming here after a day of shopping and are always prepared to wait. There is no way to make a reservation. The food is so good, that we are usually too stuffed to order any cheesecake dessert...lol"
Ilya A.,"Queens, NY",0,7,1,5.0,2/27/2017,This place is fantastic. The food is very delicious and always fresh when I go there with my family. Sometimes it gets a little crowded but I assure you its worth the wait.
Joe R.,"Long Island City, NY",173,11,18,5.0,7/26/2015,"Came here with a group of 8 tonight and had a wonderful time. Had to wait 30 minutes for a table, but it was worth it. I ordered the Kobe Burger with fries and it was spot on. As for dessert, the Godiva cheesecake is so delicious! Our waiter named Joe was also great and very attentive. He took great care of the group! Not once did we have to look around for him! Great place to go when you want a nice, sit-down dinner but don't want to break the bank.  My only tip is be prepared to wait for a table, especially on weekends. This place gets very busy!"
Amanda C.,"Lynbrook, NY",116,22,23,4.0,8/12/2016,"What a restaurant! Its absolutely beautiful inside and the menu never ends. Such a huge selection, there's pages and pages of delicious choices on the menu. The nachos are amazing, and the buffalo blasts are sooo good. Everything I ever tried here was good, never had any complaints about the food. And the cheesecake is to die for. The only downfall of this place is that it's always packed and there is always a wait no matter what day or time, which can be understandable in a way because of what they have to offer. Overall, mostly I've experienced the service to be good, but there were times where it was slow. Parking lot is also terrible. But it's all worth it to me with the food, the great drinks, and the cheesecake."
Irene H.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",92,483,468,3.0,6/19/2014,"I have been here a number of times, mostly for dessert or take out.  The coffee is good and the cheesecake is good too.  I tend to get stuck on their Kahlua cheesecake, although I've tried the Tiramisu, Red Velvet and numerous other flavors.  I have had lunch here, but found the food too greasy for my liking. Service is not bad at the table, but disastrous for take-out.  For the amount of money they charge for a slice of cheesecake, I could make my own.  It is good, but I wouldn't go out of my way for, especially considering the calories!!"
John M.,"Hicksville, NY",3,11,1,5.0,7/19/2016,Never fails to be super busy and still the food is always great. The service is always on point and the whole ambiance is great. No matter what I order it's always as tasty as I can hope for. Love the chicken Romano. Which has like Parmesan cheese cooked into the crust of the chicken cutlet. And the portions are almost family style!!
Jason L.,"Brooklyn, NY",98,218,642,3.0,6/29/2014,Came here for dinner last night. There were a lot of people standing outside the restaurant and inside waiting to be seated. We expected the wait to be long but turned out we only waited for about 3 minutes for a table for 2. Guess those people were waiting for big tables. The menu to this place is very extensive. Always takes me forever to decide on what to eat. We decided to ordered the firecracker salmon for appetizer.  This was amazingly good.  You could taste like the chunks of salmon and when dipped in the chili sauce it was delicious. Fiance had the pear and endive salad which wasn't so good. The lettuce and other vegetables that was in it didn't appear fresh and didn't taste fresh. I had the louisiana chciken pasta. Tasted really good on the initial few bites and then it was a little salty.  The sauce was a little spicy but tasted good when you rub some of that sauce on the parmesan chicken. Decided to try the wild blueberry white chocolate cheesecake. They always have the most amazing cheesecakes. Service at this place was kind of slow.  Took our waitress forever to bring out our cheesecake but of course the check came so quickly
Rey W.,"White Plains, NY",2,121,,4.0,8/7/2016,Been goin here for a long time now & I must say I will always keep coming back..the waiters & waitresses are always good..the food is great & I love that vanilla bean cheesecake
Andrew B.,"QUEENS VILLAGE, NY",58,79,141,3.0,9/11/2015,Once again i hate to wait for my food and once again i have to wait i love eating good food but i hate to wait the menu here is so big and full of so much good stuff
