Tee M.,"New York, NY",6,21,6,4.0,12/4/2015,Drinks were amazing and the food wasn't bad either: the waiter was kinda annoying and the floors are so slippery. Almost fell like a billion times. The price isn't bad either. Myself and 3 others were about $200
Missdenton T.,"Hempstead, NY",89,7,,4.0,6/7/2016,Weekends and holidays there is always a long wait. The seating is tight and very on top of each which is okay for groups however when it's just two people intimate conversations are hard to have. The food portions are huge and the presentation is beautiful. I'm not a cheesecake fan so I can't comment on that.
Tom I.,"Bayside, NY",1,3,,1.0,7/24/2016,"Went here on a Sunday morning. Had a waiter and a waitress skip over our table multiple times and greet 4 other tables next to me. After going to the person in the front we were able to get a waitress. Now going on a half an hour and we're told we are waiting on pancakes but our omelette is ready. Four tables that were seated around us has their orders taken and food was already on the tables before my pancakes made it out. The only thing i can call this is pathetic. A manager came to our table and said the kitchen was backed up which was why my pancakes were behind schedule. Seriously, my pancakes were the toughest thing to cook in the kitchen? Just want to eat and get the he'll out of here so I never have to come back."
Alexis R.,"Floral Park, NY",335,630,170,1.0,3/26/2015,The service has definitely changed. Never coming back here again. The food quality is not the same and the service is so terrible. It's like the quality of the restaurant changed dramatically. They need new employees.
Tee W.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,3,4,4.0,12/14/2015,The food is great! I had the steak and salmon!  It taste wonderful.  The wait was a bit long but well worth it.
Ashanta W.,"Brooklyn, NY",66,22,,5.0,6/5/2015,Ok I've been to this Cheesecake Factory tons of time and I've never been disappoint. Let me preface this post by saying I hate 90 percent of chain restaurants but the cheesecake factory will always have a place in my heart. What prompt me to write this review was my family's mother's day dinner. First our service was speedy and our waitress was  so attentive. Our food was so delicious. The kale salad was the best kale salad I've ever had . Our appetizer was Buffalo Blasts which is so good! For desert I finally tried a cheesecake(yes I know I'm late) and it was so delicious!  I had the strawberry cheesecake which wasn't too sweet; just perfect. A co-worker of mine who's also a big fan of the Cheesecake factory told me that their cheesecake is better than a certain famous cheesecake located in Brooklyn(hint it rhymes with lunars). The Cheesecake Factory will alway be a favorite of mine.
Iknow F.,"Garden City, NY",10,137,4,4.0,9/20/2015,What Sets This Place Apart From Every Other Chain Restaurant Is The CHEESE CAKE ! Also This Cheese Cake Factory Is Most Likely The Best One There Is Of All The Others  Really Big Menu ! Entrees:  Is Ok ( So Is All The Other Chain Places ) Apps:  About The Same  Dessert:  If You Like Cheese Cake You Will Be In HEAVEN (Carrot Cheese Cake Is Crazy Good) Drinks: Lots Of Types Of Fun Drinks Like Every Other Place ( Georgia Peach Drink Is Good ) ALL IN ALL - Good Place To Eat And Enjoy Dessert The Only Thing Is The Coffee Sucks
Amy K.,"South Ozone Park, NY",24,36,4,4.0,3/12/2016,"Very nice looking place, came for my husband and son Jonathan birthday. The food was good, service friendly, prices were reasonable with good portions. I didn't get the cheesecake I had in mind but I would go back to this place again."
Theresa S.,"Levittown, NY",0,7,2,5.0,7/17/2016,I have been to The Cheesecake Factory quite a few times. Depending on the time of day you may have a wait although we have never had to wait more than 10 minutes. Has an extensive menu. Have been very happy with the service. Food is delicious and portions are plenty big. And of course you must get the cheesecake for dessert - if you have room for it. If not I would recommend you bring a slice home with you. Its out of this world.
David B.,"Roslyn, NY",19,136,86,3.0,6/7/2016,It little above average it's really a glorified Diner however they have great cheesecake desserts goes without saying food is average usually a wait to get a table
Matt C.,"Levittown, NY",58,2,,3.0,1/11/2017,"Food was great like always!! Just disappointed when I got home to find out my dessert I got wrapped up wasn't in bag, they forgot to give it to us! Other than that I still will go."
Cyrus P.,"New York, NY",809,834,461,2.0,4/5/2015,I really don't like the food at The Cheesecake Factory. I'm not really sure how people eat here. Never have been a fan.  Service was polite and efficient.
Marlena R.,"Queens, NY",178,119,72,4.0,2/15/2016,"Came here on Valentine's Day... Don't do it!! It's a complete zoo!! 45 minute wait for a party of 2, just be advised and this was at 245. Needless to say most of the staff was nice besides the hostesses, the one downstairs looked like she hated her job, and was annoyed at the fact that we were thinking if we were going to stay or not. Then once our buzzer went off we went upstairs, only to find a hostess that says, ""yeah if it went off, you're name will be over there"". I totally understand when your busy you have a lot going on but your guests who've been waiting come first. So, a little advice for Valentine's Day you need to set up locations for people to go and for people to put their names in and not crowd both areas. All and all the food was great, and this location is wonderful, waitress was very sweet and we tried to eat fast so we could help the wait out."
Mike G.,"Scarsdale, NY",2,12,,1.0,5/16/2015,"I've had it with Cheesecake Factory.  They act so cheap with their customers while charging exorbitant prices and are and anti-customer service.  I ordered a kids chicken quesadilla and they gave me a cheese quesadilla.  I asked if they could bring me some chicken on the side instead of having to make a new quesadilla which obviously the thought never even crossed their mind.  I was told that they would need to charge me for a full side of chicken.  I asked if they could remove the cheese quesadilla and charge me for a chicken quesadilla, no dice!  The waitress actually said I ordered a cheese quesadilla and was willing to fight with me over what I said rather than attempt to accommodate me. #CheapskateFactory #HorribleCustomerSerive"
Cinthia S.,"Rosedale, NY",0,14,39,5.0,10/12/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. My boyfriend took my here a lot. I love their drinks. Environment is nice, welcoming, and not loud. Took my bf here for his birthday once in August & he liked it. Occasionally come here with friends to eat for girls night. However I wouldn't recommend coming here on holidays of any sort! Packed is not even the word to describe this place during that time. In addition to, the wait is horrific.."
Kristina M.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",388,471,264,4.0,4/18/2015,"I rarely visit chain restaurants, so the only reason I was even at The Cheesecake Factory was because my mother had given me a gift card for Easter. There was a 30-minute wait to get seated for 8pm on a Friday night, so my boyfriend and I chose to sit at the bar on the second floor instead. Don't order the hibiscus martini, it tastes good but barely had any alcohol in it for the $12 price tag. And although we ignored most of their menu for being incredibly unhealthy, we found three small plates to share: The Ahi Tartare, Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip, and Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls. I hate to admit it, but they were all delicious! Good flavor and portion sizes. I may just consider coming back another night. ;)"
Nicole C.,"Flushing, NY",6,61,15,3.0,5/6/2015,"Second time here. Haven't been here in over 5 years. Came today for lunch. The service is great. The restaurant is clean and beautiful.  The food is mediocre at best. We ordered the Old Fashion Cheeseburger, which was good, but the onion rings were so greasey we couldn't finish them. We also ordered the Fish and Chips. That was good but also a little greasier then I like. Definitely disappointed."
Michael S.,"Old Westbury, NY",0,11,6,3.0,7/1/2016,"I used to love going to the Chesecake Factory, but I really don't go as much lately. I think lately it seems the food quality went down just a little bit and the portion got smaller too. Waiting for a table is not as bad as it was in the past, it used to be 90 mins - 2hrs for a table.  Now I could get a table in less than 30 mins. The staff and waiters are very friendly and polite In the past I would give it 4 stars, but now I'm only giving it 3 stars."
Justin M.,"Albertson, NY",190,360,671,3.0,6/9/2015,"To be honest, I haven't been here in years but maybe that is because I am not a fan of chain restaurants, besides seasons 52 mostly. The cheesecake here is obviously the thing to get. My personnel favorite is the raspberry white chocolate! We have eaten here before but no dish ever stood out to me. They give decent portion sizes for how expensive it is and if you are going on a weekend I suggest making a reservations."
Yang L.,"New York, NY",0,11,,3.0,11/20/2016,Come here often and always had a great experience until today. Went during dinner rush so I expected a wait which was fine put my name down was told 30-40min. 45 min later went to check & hostess tells me sorry she took my name off .. with no explanation given besides asking if I left the mall (I only went downstairs to sit & wait). And said we would get the next table. I asked her how long she just said next table with an attitude. Waitress we got was super sweet but that hostess makes me debate coming back here.
