Syla V.,"Islip Terrace, NY",72,28,,5.0,12/27/2016,Extremely busy restaurant but you can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory since they always have something for everyone on their mile long menu.
Rosagna M.,"Hicksville, NY",1,1,3,4.0,12/13/2014,The food was delicious and presentation was on point  Drinks were phenomenal as well.  Service was great.
Tiff Y.,"KEW GARDEN HL, NY",47,117,149,4.0,4/15/2015,Whats not to love about the Cheesecake Factory. Great selections and great desserts..what more can you ask for? This cheesecake factory is always busy though..always!
Stephanie E.,"Bronx, NY",59,56,45,5.0,2/6/2016,"Great food, waiter and service. Went on a busy Saturday night , wait time about 10-15mins"
Christina G.,"Franklin Square, NY",222,129,24,4.0,6/1/2015,"I'm definitely a fan of this place.  First off, the wait was not as ridiculous as I thought it would be - 30 mins tops?! for 6 of us! That's great! I ordered a passion fruit mojito and it was delicious. For dinner I ordered the Tuscan chicken which came with brussel-sprouts, and other vegetables. That was surprisingly good. I say surprisingly because I honestly didn't expect much from this place. I thought I was going to have Applebee's style food, but it turned out great! The inside decor was very high class looking. Staff was friendly and nice.  I can't give it 5 stars because I went only once and I want to go back again and compare both experiences. I'm sure then they'll get 5 stars from me :D"
Samantha W.,"New York, NY",260,223,97,3.0,5/16/2015,"Average food, decent service. Depends on the location I guess...I've had better in the Boston one. Took forever just to bring back our check and dessert to go. Won't be visiting again anytime soon."
Tasha C.,"Brooklyn, NY",430,126,330,5.0,4/26/2015,"I have been coming here forever ! It's a long wait to get in here but it's defiantly worth the wait .  The sfoods great I have tried everything from the burger to the lemon chicken & other pasta dishes all amazing .   The best part is desert , it's a mind blowing selection of all types and flavors of cheesecake ! You won't be able to choose .  Unlike other places you get a nice  thick slice of cake , My fav cheesecake is the Hersey bar cheesecake   and the vanilla bean  omg so good !  If your every just in the mood for a drink and desert you will love it here just for that perfect slice of cheese cake"
Biru S.,"Mamaroneck, NY",304,632,92,4.0,5/7/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! I tend to go to this location the most mainly because it has the really cool staircase that leads you up to the main dining room. They also have access in to the mall, a huge plus.  Their menu is massive. If you're indecisive, you'll have a very hard time here. They have all types of cuisines here so it will be very difficult for you to get something you don't like.  The portions are massive here so plan accordingly.  If you come here and don't have dessert, you're doing a great injustice! My favorites are the red velvet cheesecake(not to be mistaken with the regular cake that they also serve), Oreo and tiramisu. Every November they have a special pumpkin cheesecake which always leaves me wishing it was November year round.  In summary, come here hungry. If you're not hungry, go straight to dessert."
Anthony O.,"Long Island, NY",793,86,761,1.0,1/1/2015,I hate to say this cheesecake factory has forgotten how to treat there customers. Plus they NEVER unlock there doors on time! At least the food came out hot and was good. Might have to give this place a rest for now.
Rosemary S.,"Westbury, NY",103,211,36,4.0,5/6/2015,I love this place. The food is awesome.  I especially love how they have a slim menu or its called something similar. I love food but also watching my weight! I had the grilled turkey burger. It was fantastic. Service is awesome. I come here with my entire family and the waiters are super sweet with the kids. This is a great spot and location is awesome.  You can't miss it!
Gary L.,"Woodside, NY",1077,1124,4992,4.0,12/7/2011,"I don't come to Cheesecake Factory often but when I do, I really enjoy pigging out on their ridiculous 1,000 plus calorie meals. Food - Although a lot of the items on their menu are really unhealthy, it's hard to resist. Caught the itis instantaneously during the drive back home. For appetizers, we had their fried calamari. It was pretty excellent. It was nice and crispy and the sauces were pretty bangin too. For my entree, I had to try out the Macaroni and Cheeseburger w/ sweet potato fries simply because of all the articles I've read about it being one of the most unhealthiest burgers you can possibly have. The Macaroni and Cheeseburger tasted really good. It didn't taste too unhealthy. My friend ordered the Blue Cheese B.L.T. and his burger was leaking grease non-stop. My other friend had Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. It was terrible. I wouldn't recommended it. It's literally drenched in oil. She took a few bites and called it quits. I decided to bag it up and have it later. When I got home, the entire bag was filled with oil and grease. As for dessert, we had their Tiramisu Cheesecake. It was pretty great. Service - We went on a Sunday afternoon for Lunch. It was kinda busy. The service was okay. Our waitress took a little long with our beverages but other than that, everything was A-OK. Verdict - If you're in the area or hungry after shopping at Roosevelt Field Mall and in a mood to pig out, Cheesecake Factory would be one of my choices. There is one thing I really disliked about this particular Cheesecake Factory which is their restroom. This Cheesecake Factory has two floors and most of the dining tables are on the 2nd level and they only have one restroom which is in the back of the 1st level. It's not very convenient. As for The Cheesecake Factory, It's not the healthiest choice but it's a type of place I would go to once in a blue moon."
Matthew M.,"Merrick, NY",28,18,5,5.0,7/26/2015,"I come here a few times a year and I have never once had a bad dish. I try to get something different every time I come but usually get the same thing because it's delicious. Their menu is plentiful with many different dishes to choose from. Their portions are always generous which is why they have such a high calorie content. You will be taking half of your main course home if you order an appetizer. I just had the crispy wontons yesterday as my appetizer and I still can't stop thinking about how delightful they were.    Only bad thing is what several reviews pointed out already is it can get very crowded after 6 pm, especially on weekends which means about a 45 min wait for a table of 2. I try to arrive at 5 pm; I know that's kind of early but you will beat the crowd.    Make sure you get your cheesecake too. Never been a fan of cheesecake until I came here. Very rich in flavor and enough for 2 or 3 people."
Stanley H.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",99,25,,4.0,5/3/2016,"Great place! Ambient lighting. We had 5 people and the seats are roomy. I give it a 4 star because the wait is always long. However, the big portion and the prices makes u wait. Usually, I never get to the point where I need to order a cheesecake. After your main course, you'll be extremely full.  Great place for family and friends. Free Parking and nearby Dave and busters!"
Barbara D.,"Holtsville, NY",30,16,,2.0,12/7/2016,just like fast food nd service is horrible for such a long wait
Lucey M.,"Deer Park, NY",0,43,,5.0,12/24/2016,"I like it, so does my whole family. The Caesar salad is huge, add blackened chicken or shrimp and you have a great meal. Their Chicken Bellagio and Louisiana Chicken Pasta are excellent. You can't go wrong here!"
alicia t.,"Freeport, NY",0,1,,1.0,11/12/2016,This place is horrible!!! The service sucks!! The workers are racists!!! Waited 1 1/2 hrs for service. The manager Gina is a rude nasty heffer. She almost got slapped in her face!!!! I will report her to the corporate office!!! She needs to loose her job!!!! If you are a person of color DO NOT go to Cheesecake Factory in Carle Place
Maybelline S.,"New York, NY",38,1,6,4.0,7/18/2015,It is gets busy on the weekends. About 20-30 min wait. Great service from staff always making sure my guest and I are ok. About 30 min wait for our food. Appropriate meal portions per person. Family friendly place.
Ray S.,"Edison, NJ",165,6,,5.0,12/3/2016,"Absolutely amazing experience , packed house but had the staff to accommodate every table in an orderly fashion . Mac and cheese bites highly recommended as well as the Kobe burger and the crab bites were delicious .. Don't offer many reviews but I would vouch for this place 100 times over"
Wai K.,"Queens, NY",79,83,113,4.0,6/1/2015,"You can never go wrong here!  Wide menu selection - something for everyone. And a whole lot to pick from when it comes to desserts. Their cheesecake slices are huge so if you're aiming for dessert, you may want to go light on your entree. Love their Skinnylicious menu. Everything under 590 calories."
Pete B.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,10,14,4.0,10/20/2015,The BEST BEST cheesecake I ever had in my life & the food & staff is perfect good spot the drinks r a bit pricey but other than that is a awesome place.
