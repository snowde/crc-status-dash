Chivana R.,"Elmont, NY",49,57,73,4.0,5/11/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. The staff is always prompt,friendly, and courteous. The only problem is the wait time. I love their Cajun pasta with chicken and shrimp. It's so delicious! The bread is always warm and tasty. They have such a large selection of cheesecakes (it makes you want everything !!) they always taste very fresh! Def recommend!! :)"
Ken T.,"Rego Park, NY",386,123,62,4.0,1/23/2015,"Came here with my friends last week and had an awesome dinner. Our waitress, Sara D., was more than accommodating during our meal. Because we were in a time-crunch, she made sure we had our food on the table as soon as possible.  One thing to note though, is that the portions here are huge! An appetizer+entree is more than enough to fill up two people, especially if you want to have room for cheesecake.  Tip: Expect long lines, especially during weekend nights. It took us an hour and a half to get seated. USE THIS TIME TO LOOK AT THE MENU, so you can order as soon as you get seated!"
Lula L.,"Town of Oyster Bay, Long Island, NY",31,36,8,4.0,3/17/2015,"Went here with a friend for dinner. For appetizers we got the Texan eggrolls, which were delicious! And we also got the fried mac and cheese. In my opinion the fried mac and cheese could have been a lot better, the macaroni was way too soft. For dinner my friend got the mac and cheese burger and I got the grilled chicken Caesar salad. She said the burger was delicious and I tried the sweet potato fries she got with the burger and they were a little soggy. Have to say though that I'm very disappointed at the cheesecake considering it's called the Cheesecake Factory, you would think that the cheesecake would be out of this world. I chose the Oreo cheesecake and it tasted like it was thawed and just put on a plate. Do they actually make their own cheesecake or get it from a warehouse?"
April G.,"New York, NY",15,100,8,4.0,5/14/2015,"This is a really great chain restaurant!  FOOD: The food is of way better quality than most chains *cough* Applebees *cough*. I had the Steak Diane, my food arrived warm and my steak was a little pinker than it should have been but nonetheless, tasted great. My husband had the mushroom burger which he wasn't a fan of, he complained of it being ""too greasy"". The portion sizes are rather large so be sure to skip appetizers if you plan on having dessert! DO NOT LEAVE THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY WITHOUT ORDERING SOME CHEESECAKE FOR DESSERT (Even if it's to go)!!! AMBIANCE: Let me start off by saying that this place was packed on a Wednesday evening! However, we did get seated promptly (2-5 min wait time). It's a two story building with lots of marble style textures and woods; very pretty! The downstairs was closed so we had to take the stairs up (in heels, not fun!) BUT, they do have an elevator which I only noticed as we were leaving ( I wouldn't have taken it anyway, seems kinda lazy lol). They also do have lots of booth style seating which I love (why don't more restaurants do this?!). All in all, it's a really nice ""feel good"" environment with lots of families enjoying lovely meals.  SERVICE: Our waitress was a gem! She literally did everything with a smile on her face! She checked up on my husband and I many times to make sure we were ok etc, TY Aisha!"
Yaderra V.,"Bellerose, Queens, NY",6,19,20,5.0,3/15/2014,Been to this place for the 1st time on Mon and came back 2 more times this week...Love everything about the CheeseCake Factory Service is great! Food Omg good! The vibe is really mello You can't get into this place on the weekends so try it thru out the week..
Derek C.,"Middle Village, NY",4,10,7,1.0,10/3/2016,"There is something really wrong with this place. Walked into the downstairs area to see it's not being used so we go upstairs and there is a wait time. Why not use the downstairs area and not have a wait time? Got seated and placed my order with gf and best friend. Normally around this time the waiter would bring that bread basket that they usually do. But wait! This place is arse backwards and behold! They don't have any of the bread ready. They somehow ran out. So we had to wait for it. We put in our appetizer order and continue to look through our menus looking at the entrees. Some time passes and the waiter comes back and we place our entree orders. I ordered meatloaf since I couldn't really decide and it's a basic item that's not too complicated to make. Still no bread basket. We wait some more and the waiter comes by saying ""The bread will be here soon"". Another few minutes and we get our appetizers. We're eating them when this woman (Kathy I believe her name was) comes by asking who ordered the meatloaf. I tell her it was me to which she replies ""We've run out. Would you like to order something else?"". How does a chain restaurant run out of something basic like meatloaf? Am I missing something? Did every other person in this restaurant order meatloaf at the same time as me? It really boggles the mind. Kathy didn't even bother to offer me compensation for not having what I originally ordered. Finally, I know you're a waiter and have to make sure your tables are happy, but our guy is a little too attentive to us. He only passed by like 20 secs ago asking us how our food was and he just came by again. Ugh... will not be coming back here anytime soon. Everyone has gotten dessert but me. What's seriously wrong with this place? It sucks."
L P.,"Elmont, NY",0,17,11,2.0,7/17/2015,"Walked in to a half filled restaurant and no one on line. Requested a booth. Waited 15 for the bus boy to put down silverware and 2 plates. As we waited there were 2 hostesses an older women who stood there twirled her hair(which needed a brushing) and ate candy. The other a younger who apologized, but couldn't lift a plate herself. When I asked her if she could get the plates she made some lame excuse then put her back to us to obviously complain to hair twirler. During our wait 2 waiters came to the front desk one if which threw an item at the other. Funny all the people I witnessed kept rubbing their nose. Hmm I wonder why.  Finally seated, bread was not warm but at least this time is wasn't stale. I ordered a chicken parm sandwich I couldn't eat the bread because it was literally dripping oil. I kept having to ask waitress to refill my drink although she did walk by our table a bunch of times and touch our table...."
Gail C.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",217,361,70,4.0,2/23/2014,"Does my review mean anything now, lol? I am 257 fan.  The food was definitely good. The bread was freshly baked and warm; it was pumpernickel and white bread. My family ordered different dishes and had no complaints. For appetizers, we had spicy chicken wings, chicken dumplings and crab cakes. No complaints; we were all waiting for or entrees to come. I ordered from the Skinnylicious menu and had a turkey and avocado sandwich that came with a spinach and arugula salad decorated with vinaigrette-type dressing; I wasn't sure about the flavor. For dessert, we were all stuffed but still ordered anyway. Most of us ordered the low carb cheesecake. I was tempted but after looking at the calories for all the desserts, it was a day worth of calories. I said, ""No thanks, I like my size."" Last but not least; the drinks were awesome and since I was one of the bday peeps, I got try all of them (my family is the bomb, lol) So, if you are like martinis, I ordered the Tropical martini; it was good enough to get a buzz.. My oldest sister ordered Mai Tai, it was great. My other sister ordered a mojito, it was good too. My brother in law ordered the Ultimate margarita. He enjoyed it. My other brother in law got the Pomegranate mojito, it tasted healthy, lol. He didn't like it too much but I was on my second drink that time. I ordered a typhoon punch, it reminded me of the Jamaican rum punch. When I got home, I was knocked out on the couch, lol.  The service was good. We left the waitress an $80 tip. She took care of us. The wait: not so good. That's why I had to take way one star. They don't allow reservations so its better to go early. But honestly, they just need to create another location; maybe in Manhattan (hint, hint)"
Graziella O.,"Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, NY",42,56,77,4.0,12/29/2014,"For my first time at the Cheesecake Factory It was overall very good.  Wait time was 30 minutes for a busy Sunday night.  The place had very pretty decor and a very nice bakery display. The waitress we had was caring and memorized our order with no complications.  The food was over all good, most of the guest with me had hamburgers and steak and they were all cooked perfectly.  The cheesecake we took home since so full.  It was enough for 3 to 4 people(depending on which you have, we had the Reese's Peanut Butter)  only downside was they had us wait 30 mins downstairs then we got called and went upstairs for another 15 minute wait. But overall it was a great time Esp for a large crowd"
Stephanie F.,"Hicksville, NY",327,158,130,1.0,12/17/2014,"Disgusting.  Why would anyone want to come to this establishment?  They do not take reservations and the entire two floor massacre is mobbed.  The food is less than mediocre.   I thought I was safe with a Salmon salad from the Skinny menu but the salmon was not cooked enough and was battered in pesto. The waiter forgot my fries, clearly and then told me he was just waiting to get fresh ones.  Come on...  To make matters worse, they sat our table before the table was set for our party amount.  This place is a disaster."
Amy T.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",128,144,396,2.0,2/15/2015,"Came here on valentine's day evening...probably a really bad idea because they were so busy, the wait was like one to two hours. But I really wanted to try this place so we decided to wait! First of all, man this place was huge !!! Like two floors and they have seating all the way to the back of the building. I was so amazed at how big this cheesecake factory was.  Anyways, I didn't really like the fact that we were rushed when we waited for like an hour and 45 mins to get seated. When we order our food, we didn't get our bread... How do I know we were suppose to get bread??? because other tables had bread... sooo I am like where is my bread man??? The food came really fast which was great because we were hungry, however it didn't taste like it was prepare well... super disappointed because I feel like if customers waited this long to dine at your restaurant, be nice, take your time and prepare my food well. Here's the break down of the evening. 1. Cocktail: Georgia Peach was so good, you can't really taste the alcohol but it was yummy. For sure I was recommend that drink  2. Thai Chicken Wrap: Like I said, the food wasn't prepare well...The chicken was okay, taste like it's been sitting in the kitchen and all they did was put some sauce on top of it....  3. Salmon and Shrimp Scampi combo: NEVER get the combo.... three pieces of shrimp and a small piece of salmon... don't believe me, look at my pics!!  4. Chicken Madeira: probably the only dish that was good throughout the night. portion was big and chicken was cooked.  Bottom line, would I come back again? Probably not, maybe I will come back and try brunch... Maybe.  I hope this review will help other yelpers!"
Dinasia W.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",9,67,111,3.0,3/28/2015,I'm not an extreme fan of the Cheesecake Factory. It's an overpriced TGIF. My food wasn't bad but nothing to rave about. The service was so/so. The cheesecake was good. Just a pretty ok experience all around .
Jonh L.,"Westbury, NY",28,11,8,5.0,5/12/2016,"I work at Cheesecake Bayshore.  But I live in Westbury.  Sometimes I vist and dont tell them, still I get great service. Very friendly staff. My favorite meal is the meatloaf."
Nicholas L.,"Glen Oaks, NY",125,15,1,3.0,12/12/2014,"3 Stars = A-OK. I wholeheartedly agree. At the Cheesecake Factory, I've had both good and bad experiences. I've dealt with both terrible waiters and amazing waiters (Victoria, to be explicit, was one of the friendliest waiters I've ever had). The food is average, nothing special, but what should be expected of a chain restaurant? I come here when I can't think of anywhere else to eat, and I'm usually never disappointed but also never impressed. I very much dislike how close the tables are together. You can hear everyone and they can hear you; there isn't much privacy. It's also usually cold in there (I once saw a woman ask for extra napkins to wear them to keep her warm ROFL) and the tables are always .. Slippery? I'm not sure if that's the right word, but utensils are constantly sliding around and falling on the floor. Thank goodness they provide two forks. The only great things on their menu are, obviously, their cheesecakes. Overall, The Cheesecake Factory is an average restaurant, good for going out casually with friends or family."
Linda B.,"Ocean City, MD",25,31,153,4.0,5/5/2015,"Well Mr thought his steak was salty, but I thought it was good. My Jamaican dish was delicious and full of flavor. The vanilla cheesecake was very delightful. My strawberry short cake was good but too much for me. Omg. We had a good meal."
Heather D.,"Williston Park, NY",1,17,,5.0,12/3/2015,"I love seeing the regular faces in the staff, it makes it feel much smaller than it is. Food is always delicious & arriving in a reasonably matter of time. I love the skinnylicious menu & skinny cocktails - you must try the lemonade (I love the raspberry). Keep up the good work & service!!!"
Michelle W.,"New York, NY",514,1108,46,2.0,12/20/2013,"What's the point of having a waitress if she's not going to put the plate down on the table and then tells me ""well there's a napkin there"" so I can grab the ""hot"" plate. Best part of all this, is while she was strutting around with her attitude, she handed this ""hot"" plate to someone at my table and then told me it was too ""hot"" for me to grab. Wait, what? Do my hands look nicer than my table mates, cause if so, then thanks.  Not so much. Our main waitress was friendly and attentive until she took our order and handed us the bill, but still very friendly and at the end of the day, no real complaints. However, the girl who brought our food, was so nasty, grumpy and rude. She just walked up to the table and instead of saying hi or anything, screamed out Pasta DaVinci. Then she rudely handed her plate to someone and then got nasty with me. Seriously, tone it down, we're at the Cheesecake Factory.  Our pasta had no flavor, cheese was never offered and my water cup was filled only once...because we had to ask....This is my first time at this location, but not at Cheesecake Factory. This location gets pretty busy and if they plan to stay busy, they better take a look into having better service and better food."
Robert B.,"Levittown, NY",0,4,,5.0,4/17/2016,Ill keep it short and sweet. The food was awesome the dessert was amazing! Had the red velvet cheesecake and ever since then every time i pass the place i have to fight the urge of jumping from the moving vehicle to go get some cheesecake! Service there was great too had a lovely waitress with a great sense of humor.
Nicole H.,"Mineola, NY",0,7,1,5.0,1/20/2016,"Cheesecake is out of this world good. My favorite is the cookie dough one. The actual food is also good, just nothing compared to their cheesecake. Better as a dessert place than an entire resturarny."
Sophie P.,"New York, NY",147,99,142,4.0,1/6/2016,"I love cheesecake factory because you really get your money's worth here. Yes, the food is a little overpriced in my opinion BUT they give you soo much food! I don't think i've ever finished everything fully here. Service here is exceptional. Waiters/waitresses are super friendly and polite. I love it.  I really like their pasta because they have a wide variety of selection and they give you shit ton of cheese. Today i chose shrimp angel hair pasta and it was by far my least favorite. I'm not that great at cooking but I can definitely whip up something like this at home.  My friend got davinci pasta and this one took me by surprise. Pasta was cooked just right, really chewy, and sauce with parmesan cheese tasted beyond good. I highly recommend this one!  Honestly I've never had cheesecake from cheesecake factory because I get too full off of bread and entree. So just get the entree and order dessert when you still have some room"
