Joe M.,"Long Island, NY",2,184,412,5.0,12/27/2014,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory. It's at the Source Mall which is a dying mall. The Cheesecake Factory is still very busy and if you come on a Friday or Saturday night you might be waiting for a long time. The menu is enormous as is the portions. My favorite is the Chicken Madeira. The menu is at least 15 pages long. If you don't come prepared it will take a while for you to order. They have a smaller menu called skinny dishes which has smaller portions. The kids menu is perfect for kids. My son can eat well when we go here. Of course, they have massive amounts of cheesecakes. Great food. If you haven't tried it you should."
Jimmy T.,"Flushing, NY",470,27,63,1.0,11/28/2015,"My beautiful girlfriend asked me to take her to The Cheese Cake Factory.  I regretfully obliged.  We arrived at 4pm and were seated with out a wait.  We ordered fried Mac & Cheese balls to start.  The balls were over cooked in the fryer, and tasted as if they were reheated in a microwave oven.  I then ordered the California Cheese Steak sandwich with fries.  The menu described it as sliced steak, but really it looked and tasted like gyro meat.  My fries tasted old and were as hard as a rock.  My girlfriend ordered the salad and pizza lunch.  The pizza was wet and soggy, and resembled and tasted like a pizza you might find in a bowling alley.  Her salad was fine.  We also ordered the a slice of cheesecake and that was good.  Our waiter was nice and very helpful.  The manager was shocked when I spoke to her and voice my displeasures.  She told me everything is made fresh including the pizza, which was obviously a bold faced lie.  I felt ripped off, and sick afterward.  You may be able to go to your local super markets frozen food aisle and create the same experience and quality as this restaurant for a quarter of the price.  The manager did take off the pizza from the bill... BIG WHOOP.  Too bad she can't take the stomach ache I have now from eating her cooks SHIT food... Never will return. Ever!"
Julie G.,"Forest Hills, NY",14,20,,4.0,1/3/2015,This place has a very large menu and everything that my family and I have had was fresh and delish.  Very large portions and if you have a problem be sure to let your waiter/waitress know and they will correct it. Only down side can be the wait.
Elizabeth H.,"Flushing, NY",0,4,10,5.0,6/5/2015,"Just went today for the first time and I have to say that I had a great experience!! Since it was a Friday I thought there would be a long wait but we were sat down in 10 min. Our waiters Adrian and Bree/briana were great! Super fast service , and very attentive to our table making sure everything was on point! Food tastes delicious , you have to try their white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake . This location is a MUST!! Very satisfied"
Chel A.,"New York, NY",112,15,23,5.0,8/10/2015,"This place is AHHH-MAZING!!!! The food is to die for, the cheesecake is THE BEST. Oh my god. Way better than I ever expected. I got the Mac and cheese burger. SO GOOD. The nachos are HOME MADE as in the chips are fresh and made there. The cookie dough cheesecake UGHH so good. 5 stars!!!!!"
Daniel F.,"Flushing, NY",634,575,922,3.0,1/30/2014,"Huge appetizer portions.  The steak was chewy and something you'd expect coming from a chain restaurant. Pasta is something I get almost 90% of the time when I come because its the most consistent in quality and flavor.   Every visit ive had the same experience , the waiters are good at their job, attentive and incredibly nice. No complaints there. And the appetizers and entrees are mediocre.  The dessert is what their known for. Cheesecake and tons of variation of the cheesecake.  I recently tried the tiramisu cheesecake and it was great but the strawberry is by far still the best cheesecake from their menu.    Id skip the food and just go straight to dessert if I could, but mama taught me better than that."
Ari C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,22,3,5.0,10/24/2016,I can't say enough good things about this Cheesecake Factory! I have been to at least 15 Cheesecake locations around the country. We were in town for a wedding this past weekend and we were staying very close to Cheesecake and thought we'd stop in for dinner the evening before. It is always one of my favorite restaurants and this location did not disappoint. I got a 'happy' vibe and the service was fantastic! Our waitress was named Rachel and she went above and beyond. My husband is on a low sodium diet and she advised us on the menu. My favorite part of the meal is always the avocado eggrolls and I finished with the vanilla bean cheesecake with chocolate dipping sauce. I love that Cheesecake Factory has such a huge menu and there is always something for a picky eater. This is the perfect place to indulge. Expect to enjoy yourself and not to stick to your diet!
Joyce Y.,"Syosset, NY",4,4,9,4.0,4/25/2016,"I always come here at least once every two month. Had dinner here for 7 + 1 Toddler. Appetizers to entree to dessert was fantastic! Must gets: avocado rolls, calamari, da vinci, bellagio, miso salmon, Sante fe, fresh strawberry cheesecake and the oreo one. Everything was on point last night, the time of food wait, temperature of food, and quality. Except, the waitress did a mix up on our drinks while running for our refills. She held all 4 of our coke's at the same time. We were wondering how we would identify the cups when she gets back."
Jessica A.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,16,54,4.0,4/20/2015,I have ate at this location a few times with my family and not once have we ever had a complaint about their customer service. The food is usually good but at times bland. Margaritas are a must to try!!!!
Raphael B.,"New York, NY",0,52,57,4.0,9/28/2016,"This place is very popular and can sometimes can be packed, located in a very busy location, they have good food and desserts, better then Martha's bakery lol."
Kim C.,"Syosset, NY",0,9,2,5.0,3/8/2016,Cheese cake factory serves a wonderful breakfast. People are unaware that they serve breakfast. If you can't get into Thomas's ham and egg go to Cheese Cake factory in Garden City. Never crowded in the mornings.
Chris C.,"Westbury, NY",30,33,,3.0,2/23/2016,Pretty standard chain restaurant food.  Came here during lunch and the waitress seem nice but jut kept complaining about nothing. I don't want a negative person serving me. She reminded me or a disgruntled cleaning lady who had no experience as a server.
Sydney G.,"New York, NY",78,43,22,3.0,11/23/2014,"Okay.. so i normally love cheesecake factory when I go to the Huntington location.  I just had Cheesecake factory for dinner from the westbury (source mall) location and I wasn't impressed.  As far as service, I did curbside pick up so it was fine I was put on hold for maybe 2 minutes not bad at all, they took my order and said it would be ready in 20 mins.  I went to pick it up 20 mins later, parked right in the curbside spots and grabbed the food so service was fine everyone seemed friendly.  The food wasn't great though. My boyfriend got the buffalo blasts which are usually amazing and crunch but these were soggy and seemed like they've been sitting for a while. I got zucchini sticks which was served with blue cheese (weird, everywhere else serves with sauce which tastes great) I didn't like them i had maybe one or two. I also got the teriyaki chicken which is a favorite dish of mine and I have had from the Huntington location before and I remember it being great! It wasn't good tonight. the chicken was dry and there was too much sauce. yuck."
Tammy H.,"Brooklyn, NY",80,56,4,4.0,2/20/2016,Stopped in for dessert after dinner elsewhere. The place was packed for it to be late night. The lemoncelli cake and carrot cake were on point as usual. Never a disappointment.
Jason N.,"Whitestone, Queens, NY",2,34,,5.0,10/14/2015,"Great, hot, fresh bread initiates your meal. Everything on the menu is heavy on the calories, including the salads, but they never advertised as being light or healthy. It's also due to the huge portions! If you're hungry, you've come to the right place. Waiters are nice and service is pretty good. The menu might take a bit if time as it's as extensive as a short novella. It can get packed, so come early or during a weekday. The Brunch menu is also interesting and enjoyable."
Melissa B.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",114,52,142,4.0,6/8/2013,"Love the Cheesecake Factory! Huge portions which are overwhelming at times, but they fit the price. Best cheesecake I've ever had! Banana Cream is my favorite.  This place gets crowded often but it also depends on when you go. Weekends? FORGET IT! You will be waiting more than 30 min easy....however, during the week almost no wait time. This restaurant is 2 floors but they have an elevator and a beautiful circular stair case right in the middle. Downstairs dining seems more casual while upstairs seems much more upscale. All waiters I've experienced have been extremely nice and helpful. Service is always impeccable and food delicious. The only complaint I would say is the Menu is HUGE. SO many things to choose from! But all the reason to come back over and over. You can also take cheesecake to go which is nice! Parking gets filled because they are in a mall, but park far, you'll need the walk after all that food! lol"
Sonia B.,"St. Albans, NY",1,20,8,3.0,3/17/2016,"This is my go to any time I am craving the best cheesecake around! The Godiva one is my absolute fave, the right amount of chocolate and cheesecake. They have the best macaroni and cheese balls I've ever tasted and the sauce that comes with it is so goood! Great place for a random outing or a special occasion and the service is great."
Trinity S.,"Plainview, NY",2,8,,1.0,11/19/2015,"I usually really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory. However, during this particular dining session my feelings were the complete opposite.  My fiancé and I usually go late night after he's done with work & it's usually busy. Which is fine ! We were say promptly but no server was in that section. We seemed to be the only table ! So after 15 mins of nobody coming over I decided to go up to the host station and explain. The hostess rolled her eyes and headed back to the table and said ""you don't want to sit here?"" I said we do, but we WANT a server. It's been 15 mins. She then again rolled her eyes, and snatched our menus off the table and walked away. After a few steps she turns and says ""well if you want a server you have to move"". I almost lost it. She was the one who sat us in the first place! Yet she's giving us attitude ? We brought it to the attention of 1 manager who apologized and said he would handle it. After our entree a different manager came over and asked what happened because both the hostess and initial manager left. It was such a circus I just wanted to get out of there. So much so, I refused the free dessert. They need to hire more personable staff members and make sure they management is aware of all problems as they happen! Their communication was clearly lacking. Haven't been back since."
Alfredo D.,"Newark, NJ",12,164,16,5.0,11/21/2014,Love the cheesecakes and love the different foods that they serve.  This one in particular is always always packed so be prepared to wait for a long time to be seated. Other then that the food is fantastic and i am never disappointed
Lilian Y.,"Sunnyside, NY",158,180,34,5.0,12/30/2014,"Ummm who can spell delicious without Cheesecake Factory? uh well... never mind what I mean to say is there aren't many food chains that are good let alone mixed in with some of the big boy options here in NYC the Cheesecake Factory proves to be king of the chains and then some.  I came here with the familia to celebrate my birthday, it seemed like the natural choice for my kid friendly/good for large group needs which by the way Yelp wtf?! All your search options for these needs show small space not so very kid friendly places!  I can deal without the terrible wait but alas what is a girl to do? I can forgive thee as long as they keep their consistency of amazing food, drinks and slammin' desserts.  5 stars for this joint, it's Woohoo! As good as it gets!"
