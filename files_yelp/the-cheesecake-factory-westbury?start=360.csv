Bernie C.,"Mississauga, Canada",166,1077,989,2.0,7/24/2013,"Meh. They give you large portions here (especially the salad - which is big enough for two people) but it's not tasty and quite bland.   The salad is mostly lettuce with just cheese and a few other things.  Not bad, but nothing special. Angelhair pasta is also a very big portion but there isn't much taste to it.   The only good thing about this place is the cheesecake but food is barely passable."
Nate S.,"New York, NY",367,300,211,4.0,7/11/2013,"The menu is OVERWHELMING but.. I love this spot. Minus the wait-time every time, I always have a great experience here. I've had almost all the pasta dishes, really like the Spicy Chicken & pasta and the Pasta Jumbalaya. My friend always orders this Miso-Salmon dish since he loves fish and the sauce on it makes it taste unbelievably good. AND THE PORTION SIZES ARE NO JOKE. The servers? impressive. They know the extensive menu inside & out. They are always great in recommending what's good depending on what you're in the mood for. Always friendly, courteous, and attentive. The drinks? Selection always outstanding, drinks itself are always made pretty strong. The decor? Seems very extravagant, spot is HUGE, very spacious.  I recommend coming on weekdays where there is no wait time. 4.5 stars, def my fave chain spot."
Sue B.,"Farmingdale, NY",0,10,,1.0,9/25/2016,"Four of us arrived at the Cheesecake Factory a little after 4:00 this Sunday afternoon. We have not been to this location I years, but we have been to Huntington.  Poor Drew, he clearly meant well, but he was in so far over his head he stood no chance at success. Why would the restaurant set-up their staff in such a situation they cannot succeed. The poor guy could not get drinks, take orders, figure out what his other tables need and provide service to us.  Drew promised bread - love the bread- looked forward to bread- Manager arrived and saved us from a carb disaster and got us bread immediately! Food was fine and met expectations. We then decided to take our cake to go. How long should one wait for cake to go? I think 25 minutes is too many minutes. I informed Drew that I was going to change my mind about dessert, he explained the bakery was backed up- what does that mean in a restaurant whose name is all about cake?!! On our way out I informed the manager about our disappointment- she apologized. Can't imagine how awful things must be during peak times.  Thumbs down from me."
Lawrence R.,"Garden City, NY",4,60,1,3.0,3/3/2016,"The wait here, especially during peak hours, is actually crazy sometimes. The food here is standard Cheesecake Factory quality. The service I've received has been mixed, some good, some bad."
L B.,"Queens Village, NY",0,48,,1.0,1/17/2016,Came here for my birthday and we were seated right away ...our server came over ...this waiter guy omg he had a lot of attitude...my mom and I was asking about the peach Bellini and he rolled his eyes at us and even when we asked about a food item also ...what the hell ...really we came to Cheesecake Factory for attitude and to over pay for heated food..cut it short they food was terrible and my daughter order was wrong ...cheesecake factory you need to retrain your staff ...and provide better service for your over charged cold food . Thanks but I would rather go to ruby Tuesday where the service is good and the food is the same or Olive Garden which is way better in service.dont waste your time and go here it's garbage
Grace C.,"East Meadow, NY",150,26,,5.0,1/26/2016,"Your experience really depends on the waiter you get. We had an amazing waiter, sadly I can't remember his name. But throughout the entire dinner he came by to check on my boyfriend and I. Immediately he came as soon as I finished my drink and gave me a refill without me even having  to call him over. The food was really great, I got the 4 cheese pasta and my boyfriend got the chicken Alfredo both dishes were perfect. Of course the Oreo cheese cake was great. I highly recommend this place."
wendy p.,"New York, NY",30,58,45,3.0,1/25/2016,"Cheesecake is great here of course, The servers are friendly. they're usually massively crowded and noisy however service is fast. The drinks are weak some of the things on the menu were outstanding and some are pretty lame. Generally we do dessert here. More often than not to go because it's always so noisy."
Chris H.,"Woodside, NY",3,9,,3.0,4/4/2016,"If you love cheesecake. Here's the place to be. The selection is endless. I wish I could try them all. Overall the dessert is want made me give it 4 stars. The place is always pack especially if you go on a Friday or weekend evening outing. The wait is usually around 15 to 30 minutes if you're lucky. Which doesn't make sense since they have an entire 1st floor that's always closed. They seem to never open it up and just direct everyone to the 2nd floor.  The food is okay and similar to Applebee's or TGIF. I mainly came here for the dessert to be honest. You can easily spend between $30 to $60 dollars here. An entree, a drink and a cheesecake will easily set you back $40 dollars. My Grade Scale (1-5) Decor - 3  Staff 4 (friendly) Food 3 (okay-la) Price 2 (bit high for a chain) Overall 3 (Here for the cheesecake)"
Denise D.,"Port Washington, NY",0,9,2,4.0,2/19/2016,"Always love Cheesecake Factory :) The salmon crackers it's so delicious with the sweet soy, Tuna tartare also very good with guacamole, my husband always love the steak Diane and I always get the fish tacos which is very good side and last the dessert love white chocolate macadamia mm which is so amazing. Over all it's our favorite place."
Veronica B.,"Jamaica, NY",0,18,2,5.0,8/19/2016,"I'm a regular here and I must say the menu is soo stacked. There is something for everyone on this menu so many pages. The steak diane and hibachi steak are my favorites .  My fiancé loves the California salad and cajun jambalaya pasta. All those are must haves. They start u off with bread which if your not careful will full you up, but tastes so good. And lastly if you have room, (did I mention the serving sizes are huge) their cheesecake selection is anazing."
Christopher C.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",255,124,75,4.0,2/10/2013,"I really like this place.  The have a very extensive menu, I would say the menu is tooo big.  They are so many choices you can spend an hour going through it.  I've been here many times and have never been disapointed.  They do have a skinnylicious menu that I try to order from when I come here. This makes it a little easier because I dont have to go through all the other choices on the regular emnu. The only thing I really dont like about this place is the WAIT!! There seems to always be a wait no matter what time you come and they do not take reservations.  I suppose that can we a good thing because you know the place has real good food if thats the case. When I go, Itry to go in the off-peak hours for dinner (between 330 & 430) to minimize the wait. I will be back!!"
Vanessa S.,"Coral Springs, FL",179,167,84,5.0,7/19/2014,"Every visit here is a great one.  The menu is so plentiful, you don't know where to begin.  We went w the stuffed mushrooms for starters.  Although there on the small plate appetizer page, you get 6.  My friend and I shared, and it was perfect. For my entree I had chicken & biscuits. It's grilled chicken breast, mashed potato, and the flakiest, most delicious biscuits you've ever had, all smothered together in thick gravy. Need I say more! Comfort food at its best!! Drinks are always great here. I usually go w the mojitos, which come in a variety of flavors. Cheesecake Factory will always be on my top 5 list!"
Hungry K.,"Boca Raton, FL",3057,796,6348,2.0,9/13/2014,Go on off hours to avoid long wait time Vibe - mall cool Greeting- yeah right Price- expensive Service- usually very good Bathroom- pass Parking- free lot Food Pretzel crusted chicken finger are an over fried tasteless mess Sausage and ricotta flatbread  barely has any sausage and ricotta Giant burrito is almost all rice with a few chicken pieces another miss Desserts- of course cheesecake WIGB? Probably not Overall this used to be a great place. With rising prices salads at $15! The CCF has priced itself out of the value market. Portion size is shrinking and so is the protein in the items. Too bad.
Versace J.,"Greenpoint, NY",8,75,156,5.0,1/2/2015,The dishes here are prepared per order . Everything here is serve fresh . The lemonade is a must here and the buffalo blast . The only franchise I repeatedly come to over and over .
Ava A.,"New York, NY",0,31,4,3.0,4/14/2015,"Excellent garlic bread and flatbread appetizer! The food was not that great, chicken in the chicken sandwich was really dry and bland But they have great bread and great cheesecakes!  Huge restaurant with a lot of seating but because of the popularity of the restaurant there may be a long wait! Very extensive menu!"
Monte P.,"Nice, France",7,2,,1.0,8/23/2015,I can't even give this 1 star. This place is THE absolute worst! It took an hour and a half for them to come tell us they forgot our order. The restroom was horrendous. Go somewhere else. There's plenty of other Resturants nearby. Save your Cheescake Factory experience for another city.
Mochi F.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",36,43,9,5.0,1/20/2015,"Instead of doing a usual review, I'm going to give you the meat of the review by telling you which dish to get. Appetizer: Avocado egg rolls, Crab wontons, Tuna tartare, Calamari. Entrees: Bang Bang Chicken, Hibachi Steak, Salads are huge and tasty (especially the Asian one), Creamy Chicken Pasta. Cheesecake: GODIVA wooooooo, Banana Cream, Oreo, Apple crumb, vanilla bean. One last thing, don't come with more than 2 people. You will be disappointed :-)"
Elina A.,"Manhattan, NY",23,114,22,5.0,12/23/2014,"I love the cheesecake factory!  My favorite dishes are the : avocado spring rolls, fried mac & cheese, luau salad, asian salad, the salmon is delicious and so are most of the pastas! Try the small appetizers also.  **Beware** They serve huge portions and the food is so delicious I rarely make it to desert! :( but when I do the cheesecakes are worth the calories! there may be a wait during peak hours"
Frelyni F.,"Freeport, NY",15,1,,1.0,8/21/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory where do I begin. This is the second time coming to this location. The first time I had a bad experience, but the food was tolerable. Now this second time around we went for a Birthday, it had to be the MOST Horrific experience I have ever been faced with, at this restaurant!!! Upon entry the restaurant smelled disgusting!! After the 20 mins wait time we were told a hostess would come and seat us. We then began to wait 10 more mins. After the host approach us, she then proceed to walk us to the table. Once we arrived to the table, the other host gave are table to another customer. That was just the start! The host apologized as we walk back to the waiting area. She then sat about 10 different people before we had to go up to her and say ""did you forget about us!"" We then waited about 10 more mins as she than took us to a table after she said the next booth would be ours. While walking to our table I display to her there was a much better booth were we would like to sit. She then said I have to check and see if that could be arranged. She then came back and said no! That was the last strike we told her have a great day we are leaving. Instead of saying let me see what we could do she said bye. This is something that never should be done at a establishment!! I will never go back to this overrated cheap establishment that has no hospitality!! As well no organization skills and very tacky!"
Liliana B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,34,,3.0,8/19/2016,"Came here for lunch with coworkers,  service was quick, food was good, you weren't rushed out.  Restaurant gets busy.   Everything was good, but nothing about this environment made me feel like I would return anytime soon."
