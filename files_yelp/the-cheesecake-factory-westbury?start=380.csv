Tiff C.,"Queens, NY",92,642,796,2.0,1/15/2013,"Came here two times, and both times, the food was very EHHH. Don't get me wrong, the servers are friendly enough, both times, and the desserts are always delicious to the point I want to order a slice of everything and then stuff my face at home in privacy  where no judgment shall be bestowed upon me.  But their entrees and that of my friend, well, we weren't satisfied at all.  The burger my friend got seemed to be all salt.  Another time, he got a Jambalaya pasta dish, but it was too saucy and nothing else.  My Shrimp scampi was spicy and not what I was expecting at all.  Avocado rolls were bland, and not enough balance of avocado with other ingredients.  Wouldnt make the trip out here for the food, only desserts."
Chica O.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",122,364,14,5.0,1/6/2013,"I've been coming here for quite sometime and never realized I never left a review.  I have to honestly say I have never eaten anything from here that I didn't like. They have good food and good service. The waitress and waiters have always been nice during my visits.  I have never eaten cheesecake until I started coming here. The first cheesecake I ever ate was the Carrot Cheesecake and I fell in love with it. I have tried a few others like the Reese's Peanut Butter cheesecake and the Godiva Cheesecake and both were great. Decently priced, good portion sizes, and the good taste great."
Joseph T.,"Merrick, NY",114,1304,36,3.0,1/3/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is a very reliable American chain restaurant. The chain's menu is very extensive and offers large dishes based on various cuisines and fusions of cuisines. The food at this location is consistent with all of its other locations. The service is also quite good. The wait staff makes frequent rounds by tables, so it is very easy to gain the attention of a waiter or waitress to remedy anything you like. Moreover, according to Lawerence Eisenstein, Commissioner of Health of the Health Department of Nassau County, the Cheesecake Factory is one of the cleanliest restaurants in Nassau County as of June 14th, 2012. I would rate it three and a half stars."
Victoria S.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,241,773,4.0,8/17/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is always consistent with quality food. Its a plus when your wait staff is pleasant, attentive and on point as in this last visit. Arrived right before the late lunch/early dinner crowds on the weekend and avoided the typical one hour table wait. Food dishes arrived at appropriate temperature and bread replenished as requested. Desserts are always offered and this time I managed to say no to the always tempting indulgence.....until my next visit."
Kapil P.,"Hempstead, NY",0,6,3,5.0,1/18/2016,"One of my favorite restaurants, first went to the one is Maryland then became a fan of their bang bang chicken and shrimp and their chicken and shrimp gumbo. This location is 5 minutes from me and always a good time."
Nissa H.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",3,25,31,5.0,3/11/2015,Came here for graduation 2014 and my birthday 2015. I've only been here twice and I came say without a doubt it is my favorite restaurant. I solely dislike cheesecake but I will only eat it and enjoy it at this establishment. The service is fast and friendly and the food is amazing; also it is relatively cheap. All patrons are diverse and that is a plus for me. I highly recommend the Cheesecake Factory.
Meryam B.,"Kew Gardens, NY",270,288,7,3.0,7/28/2014,"I had both cheesecake and a full dinner at this location of the Cheesecake Factory and was pleasantly surprised by how decent the food was. This location is HUGE, I live in NYC and am not used to suburban sized mega eateries and this place took me by surprise. I was there with a group of 7 others and we had to wait for about 30 mins (one of my co-diners mentioned that this place typically doesn't require a wait) before finally being seated downstairs. I shared a tiramisu cheesecake (which was delicious) with a friend and for dinner, I ordered the Kale and Quinoa salad (surprisingly good! but massive, I had to share it with the table) and the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp (actually spicy). The final bill was on the pricier end of eating at a mega chain but I enjoyed my meal so I think it was worth it."
Kay. K.,"Brooklyn, NY",742,227,2198,4.0,10/7/2014,Loooooove this place but sadly we had to cut it short cause I wasn't feeling to well so will definitely be back my cheesecake factory; )
Mr F G And Ms M S.,"Flushing, NY",662,1038,3988,4.0,12/22/2012,"We are a fan of cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory. One night, we were just craving for a dessert, we decided to stop by & got ourselves the red velvet cheesecake & the black out cake.  The red velvet cheesecake was just simply amazing! It was just perfect! Absolutely flawless! As for the black out cake, unfortunately it is not as good as the cheesecake. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great. The cake was a bit dry. We'll definitely go back for the cheesecake!"
Anisa C.,"Floral Park, NY",0,7,,1.0,2/1/2017,"So my friends and I used to always come here for late night cravings over the summer. Ya know like cheesecake after the gym. Stuff like that. The customer service is usually pretty good. However last time(about a week ago), we came on a Sunday night around 9pm. It was a half hour wait which we were fine with. (Side note-While we were waiting we saw the manager trying to speak to a customer that was clearly very upset about the customer service.- we should've taken that as a sign) Once we finally got seated our waiter greeted us. He seemed very nice. Little did we know, we would be waiting longer for our food than the initial wait to be seated. When we did finally get our food, my friends did not enjoy their meal whatsoever. I happened to enjoy my mac n cheese burger so I wasn't complaining. I'm guessing their must've been a new chef. They both ordered pasta(one with chicken and one with shrimp) and it was not seasoned well at all. I tried a bit from both of their plates to see if they were just being dramatic and they were not. It tasted like air.... like nothing. NO FLAVOR. So that alone was a disappointment. We were clearly not the only ones with the issue. The family next to us didn't enjoy their meal so the manager came over and told them she would take it off the bill and asked if they'd like to order anything else. I guess they were frustrated at that point and just wanted to leave so they asked for the check instead. After the manager finished speaking to them, I called her over and told her that my friend did not enjoy her meal which was pretty much untouched(the other friend still scarfed down his pasta because he was starving). The manager kindly offered to give her a complimentary cheesecake. The waiter then came over and took my friends orders for two cheesecakes to go. Just when it couldn't get any worse, we waited AT LEAST 20 minutes for the cheesecake. He gave us the check and still didn't bring it. After about 25 minutes we asked him again for the cheesecake which he had completely forgotten about and turns out it was sitting in a bag behind the counter the entire time. He just forgot to bring it to us. Disappointing meal, bad customer service. Overall not the best trip to the Cheesecake Factory. I probably won't be coming back for a while."
Alex B.,"Carle Place, NY",3,109,,4.0,6/26/2016,"Been here many many times. Have ordered various items on the menu. Enjoy it every time and enjoyed the buffalo chicken sandwich, southwest chicken salad and the lettuce wraps. Recommend"
Giselle A.,"Garden City, NY",0,6,,4.0,7/14/2014,"Love the food, love the ambiance, love the neatness and love the service.  If you are a chocolate person then try Linda's fudge cake or Chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake.  My husband ordered avocado rolls which i never wanted to order..but when i tasted them i started loving those.  Only downfall is..Its always so crowded.  It will be convenient if they can start taking reservations on the phone.  Whenever we go there on weekends we always have to wait for 45-90 minutes to get the table."
Alexis I.,"New York, NY",0,40,3,4.0,6/24/2016,avocado eggrolls?!! yes!!! great appetizers and awesome desserts. good to come here with large parties and you definitely won't leave here hungry!
Fareed M.,"Jamaica, NY",2,1,,1.0,7/30/2016,"Never again. Went tonight to celebrate my birthday with my gf and it took the waitress over 30mins to bring the cheesecake and then when I was more than fed up I told her I'll just take it to go. Then, it showed up 4 mins later. F-Cheesecake Factory. Now I missed my movie so I drove from queens to garden city for no damn reason."
Anthony C.,"Sayville, NY",43,45,19,3.0,7/13/2015,I don't get why this place is so great. I grew up in bklyn this is the menu in every diner on every corner. Less the one hour wait
Tiffany B.,"Port Washington, NY",248,32,16,4.0,5/28/2015,"We started off waiting to get our drink orders for about 15-20 minutes. But besides that, everything was perfect. Our waitress Brie was great! And the filet mignon was delicious!"
Judy K.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",407,213,762,3.0,8/12/2014,"I ordered from the skinny menu and got the grilled steak medallions.  It was still filling and I was full, but my steak was overcooked.  I asked for medium rare and they gave me medium well done.  Luckily, the red wine sauce was really good and it helped counteract some of the dryness of the meat.  My sister got the cajun jambalaya pasta and it was a little bit bland.  There was cajun seasoning involved, but it needed more salt.  Usually, I'm never really disappointed with The Cheesecake Factory.  They are usually consistent with their food, but this restaurant wasn't the best. Not only that, but when we wanted cheesecake for dessert, they told us it was going to be an additional 30 minute wait.  If we had known that earlier, we would have ordered the dessert with our entrees.  So I didn't get to try their cheesecake."
Kericee F.,"Flatlands, NY",89,29,148,4.0,10/19/2014,The original cheesecake was so delicious no toppings. I had the 4 cheese pasta with white sauce added spicyJamaican shrimp to it. The pasta flavor was good but not enough sauce I thought it was dry. The Jamaican shrimps were not spicy but the flavor was smoky and tasted great. The atmosphere was warm. My waitress was polite and efficient. Overall a great experience.
Tammy R.,"Bayside, NY",0,38,,5.0,1/19/2016,I go the the Cheesecake factory a few times a year and it is absolutly great. The food is unbelievable and the cheesecakes are to die for. I love the decore and atmosphere. The wait staff is always fast and friendly. I highly recommend.
Stephanie M.,"Manhasset, NY",0,19,,4.0,1/18/2016,Got the tropical martini which was absolutely delicious while my friend got the blueberry mojito (I'm usually not a fan of) but i tried it and it was really good as well! Appetizers are great but not crazy about the main course. Our waiter Mike was so sweet and very attentive
