Candy C.,"FLUSHING, NY",0,4,8,4.0,10/7/2017,"This is one of my fav dining restaurants.  Prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge!  My kids love their whole wheat bread (tip- you can always ask for more). The Pasta De Vinci is a must try. Some places make the chicken very dry but not Cheesecake Factory, their chicken is surprisingly tender and juicy. We come here for birthday celebrations many times. I give it 1 star less because of the wait time. Even you come in at 4pm for dinner, the place is still packed!!! They do not take reservations!"
Nicole M.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",16,104,324,5.0,2/19/2017,We ordered shepherds pie and meatloaf from the lunch special. We ate only half and had the rest to go! They sure have a healthy serving. Their lunch special is until 5pm. So have that and you'll be fine! They're very fast with the food. They have two floors and was very fast in food delivery. Great tasting too! Try to avoid the weekends it'll be very hard to find a seat.
Jessica A.,"Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, NY",8,66,33,4.0,11/11/2017,"It was pretty packed here on a Sunday night but we were seated within 30 minutes so not too bad. Deliciousness ordered: sweet corn tamale cakes, fried calamari, bistro shrimp pasta, bang bang chicken and shrimp and we finished with lemoncello lemon torte. I must say, everything we ordered was amazing, we cleaned off every plate. I actually wanted to give three stars because of how poor the service was but the food is what matters most. Our waiter didn't check on us at all and we had to hunt him down everytime we needed something. We never got actual plates for our entrees, so we used the small plates we used for our bread. When we finished eating and were waiting for dessert, he didn't completely clear our table so we put everything aside. When our cheesecake came, it had fallen on its side and he didn't give us utensils. It seemed like he neglected us on purpose because he treated the table next to us a lot better. Regardless, the food was awesome, just don't expect awesome service."
Dmitry D.,"Long Island, NY",56,426,550,1.0,8/5/2016,Horrible experience not coming here again. First the first floor is booked up they say there is no wait upstairs. We go upstairs and there is await upstairs not long but was. Don't say anything if you don't know what's going on. Then we sit down order the burger and the buffalo blasts. I ask if they can cut the burger in half waiter says no we don't do that. Dude take a knife and ask them to cut it. But he didn't even want to ask at first. Then they brought the baffullo blast which looked like they already exploded and blasted of .
Tasha M.,"Lido Beach, NY",52,58,165,3.0,9/1/2016,"I've been to this location several times, as well as many others. You can't go wrong with TCF, something for everyone. I'm a strict vegetarian and never get bored with the menu. I guess that is why I've been here so many time. It's pretty much the only place that can accommodate a bunch of picky eaters. My husband loves the Steak Diane and the fish tacos. I've tried the veggie burger(old version much better), loved the falafel salad (minus falafel),my falafel taste like I was chewing on sand and tin foil. I'm tempted to try the salad again, hoping it was just a bad batch of falafel. My favorite apps are the Fried Mac&Cheese,Avocado Eggrolls and the Parm-Garlic Cheese Bread. The wait staff is nice and when I had an issue with my salad management was understanding and accommodating. On the other hand, this was my 1st time dining at the bar. My only con was the Take Out counter, where they put the dessert which is also part of the waiting area. While sitting there we witness a kid coughing on the cakes that were for the seated patrons. As well as a woman who was leaning against counter playing in her hair over the desserts. All I could think of was all the desserts I ordered while seated. I love this place so much but that was a big turn off. So for food and staff I give them 5 Stars, but until the Dessert Station is changed i have give less."
Jc B.,"West Babylon, NY",244,71,126,1.0,1/28/2017,"Absolutely one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had!  We went here during a weeknight. Put my name down and was told 30 mins was handed the pager and literally a minute later it's going off. I was waiting for the gf to show up and it was busy so 30 mins seemed not to bad. I turned right around and asked for the table to be held and was allowed to do so.  Upon sitting at a two top right by the stairs elevators and wait staff section we were greeted by what the receipt says Cheri Anne g. Idk never got the waitress' name when she came to the table. So off to ordering from the most unhealthy restaurant there is with 97 pages. Decided to do the Buffalo blasts as an app. I got chicken and biscuits and gf got four cheese pasta with chicken.  Our drinks a Coke and a wine took 15 to finally get to the table. I asked for extra butter for bread as the waitress rolled her eyes and huffed and walked away.   Apps came. The Buffalo blasts are always great it's a creamy Buffalo chicken mixture inside wonton wrappers and a nice blue cheese on the side.  Dinner came. My chicken and biscuits which I was excited for until it came. There were peas everywhere. ALL OVER THE PLATE. the chicken was dry and everything was salty I mean kick you in the jaw salty. The pasta was so over salted as well  it was semi inedible. But I held my tongue. I asked for mine to be wrapped as I didn't wanna overstuff myself for dessert. As mine came back the waitress took the pasta dish off the table turned to the busboy and said I guess wrapping this because she waited till we came back. We looked at each other in disbelief at what we just heard.  We ordered dessert. We've been here about an hour at that point. And were making conversation with the table next to us. About 20 mins passed by when our waitress was standing behind us and was yelling up to another waitress on the steps above our head that she needed two cheesecakes because she forgot (ours). Literally screaming behind us over our head and walked away without saying a word to us. Two premade cheesecakes that waited 20 mins to find out they were forgot.  So another 10 mins passed by at this point I'm very angry. And what pushed me over the edge was the congregation of wait staff behind us with our waitress in the middle texting and laughing. Then the straw that broke the back. They start posing for selfies. This was the absolute worst service, worst food and worst experience I've ever had anywhere.  I spoke to a manager who tried to apologize but this from beginning to start was doomed as our server kept digging a deeper hole.  I will never...EVER be going to the Cheesecake Factory again and I urge all of you to stay away as well. Not only because of the service but the absolute unhealthyness of this place. I would give no stars if I could. Again my fellow Yelpers, STAY AWAY!"
Chris W.,"Merrick, NY",65,38,40,5.0,12/4/2017,Dinner was great. I had a burrito I took half of it home it was huge. The carb free cheesecake tasted like a regular cheesecake. The highlight of the evening was our server Jonathan G. He is five stars on his own - Cheesecake Factory is very lucky to have him!
Elliott K.,"Queens, NY",408,193,379,3.0,1/16/2017,"Food is pretty good. I'd say you're paying average of 15-17$ for an entree, portions are average to large.  Seriously though, the wait is horrendous. Sunday night: We spent more time waiting for our table, than actually eating. We got there 6pm (no reservations), took down our party of 7, and waited about 1.5 hours. Finally when our device buzzed, they took us upstairs where we probably waited another ten minutes to be seated. Pro tip: send one person to come an hour earlier to take a buzzer. They go run errands in the mean time and all of you show up 15 minutes prior to time. Then you spend less time waiting.  Don't come here if you're in a hurry to eat. Especially for dinner, this will take a while. By the time you get a table, Jesus will have already come back.  It's packed. Just imagine: a lobby area packed shoulder to shoulder of probably 30-40 people, all of us holding a buzzer, waiting in expectancy that theirs will be the next one to ring. Seriously, a pregnant lady next to me had her water break, went into labor, and gave birth before her buzzer rang. An 11 year old boy hit puberty and grew 5 inches up to my height before his buzzer rang. A guy next to me went to the DMV twice and came back before he was called. Here's my conspiracy theory revelation as I waited there contemplating life: they make you wait so you'll get hungrier and want to order more stuff. By the time the bread comes out you devour it. Then the actual entree comes which is modest in portion, but by then, you're so full you thought you got a good deal. They get more $$ from items ordered, and you leave full and satisfied. Selah."
kallie s.,"Patchogue, NY",592,43,33,3.0,7/27/2017,It is what it is the food is OK but it's like any other chain restaurant. The cheesecake is good though. Menu is giant and the place tends to get  super crowded and the service definitely lacks due to that factor. I hate sitting in a restaurant with an empty glass while I'm eating. The ambience is very nice and the bar is well stocked. It's better to go in there for a game or lunch... I just feel like this place doesn't pack the punch it should when it comes to dinner. I have gotten cakes out of there a few times to go and some of their flavor combinations are very delicious.
Ami H.,"Castro Valley, CA",12,52,119,1.0,8/24/2017,"I frequently go to Cheesecake Factory; however, this visit was my worse visits. I come to a Cheesecake Factory enough to have a menu item that I order often, enough to know that they continuously add salt to their pasta water throughout the day to the point that dinner items will always be saltier than lunch items, and enough to know that their wheat bread actually has cocoa in it.  Here's what happened: I ordered a water with lemon, but the waitress cut me off and didn't even hear the lemon part. I was okay with this because it wasn't that big of an issue. I got the shrimp bistro because that's what I normally order. It came, I tasted it, and then realized it was chicken. I probably could've eaten it but the waitress just took my order back to the kitchen at fast pace. I got another dish, and this time, it had shrimp in it... I was picking at it and kept thinking there was something wrong with it... The sauce was incorrectly made and was just sheer butter and oil instead of the cream sauce that comes with the bistro shrimp. My guess is that the kitchen staff got the sauces and the meat mixed up between the dishes. When I told the waitress that the dish was incorrectly made and showed her the sauce, she said it's supposed to be that oily. Look at the pictures and see if that's the amount of oil a creamy pasta dish should have. I tried to correct her, but she just rushed to get her manager instead. He saw the sauce and explained that he wants to put the order into the kitchen so I can get my meal quicker. I told him that he should also check the salt level for the pasta water as well because it's overly salty. He didn't return to apologize or anything. I got my bistro shrimp, and it came the way it's supposed to be made: with shrimp, arugula, and a cream sauce. Normally at other Cheesecake Factories, I either get at least an apology, a discount on my meal, or a complimentary dessert/drink. Nothing was offered. Worse of all, I could feel the attitude from the waitress for the trouble I caused her cause the kitchen messed up. Her attitude was so real that she didn't even offer me shredded parm when my correct order did come out.  On the plus side, this Cheesecake Factory is HUGE. I can't imagine a long wait even when it gets busy. When it's not filled up, only the top is open. However, the bathroom is located on the bottom level behind the bar, and the women's bathroom has only three stalls and two faucets that are located right in front of the door. There's absolutely no wiggle room, and I felt bad for a mother an child who were washing their hands because the mom kept apologizing to me because there was no space for her to move to while assisting her child and allowing me access to the unused faucet. On top of that, the door opened and someone tried to enter; again, no wiggle room, and the mom apologized to that person as well...This has the largest dining hall I've seen with the smallest bathroom I've ever seen at a Cheesecake Factory location."
Gabby D.,"Long Beach, NY",1,2,1,5.0,12/29/2017,I love the spicy chicken chipotle pasta from here !! It's sooooo delicious! There's always a long wait but it's worth it! Staff is very nice too!
Cristal P.,"Plainview, NY",22,9,,2.0,11/12/2017,Not great service. My friend's hash browns were brunt and waitress was not attentive to us. My salad was delicious. Celebration cheesecake was the best part of the meal
Evan C.,"Shirley, NY",1552,477,3459,5.0,6/8/2017,"I've been to ""The Factor"" many times, this is the first time I am Yelping it, mainly because I wasn't Yelping at that time long ago. We came as a group after a friend graduated college at the Barclay Center. It was nice, but it was also time to eat. We all threw out names but in the background some said the name that sent us all into drool mood ""The Cheesecake Factory."" Now if you know me you know I love cheese (Did I ever mention that?). So why no got to a place where cheese is in the name. So we geared up and headed back to Long Island. The drive was crazy but finally we saw ""The Factory."" Parking wasn't a problem, there is plenty. After we made are way in and we're quickly seated, which I'm surprised about because other people had the same idea and we were a ""Party of Five,"" get it! I made a reference to the hit series from the 90's, stop it. Anyway, the place is beautiful, it's always clean. I love the floors and the atmosphere in the place. You know it's always busy in here so the only thing is your around a lot of people. Also your listening to a lot of conversations as well. Our waitresses name was Melissa. Melissa was amazing. She was at our table and always polite and funny. I was impressed with her knowledge of the menu, that and her quick responses time to our drinks and such. When the food came out it was time to eat and that's what we did. I truly enjoyed the salmon, it was perfect. Everyone enjoyed there meals as well. I also sampled small pieces of all the cheesecakes and I must say they were worth the trip alone. I had quite the experience. When it came time to pay I had so much fun, I didn't mind picking up the bill. I will definitely come back again, I want a slice of cheesecake for myself. It's no wonder they have cheese in there name, with cake like that they earned the right to use it."
Kalena N.,"Lindenhurst, NY",2,65,24,4.0,11/22/2017,Love the atmosphere and the food. So many choices and all so good. The fried Mac n cheese balls are delicious.
Kristin Z.,"Freeport, NY",25,115,11,3.0,2/4/2017,"This place makes a fortune because we're all goofy enough to eat here despite inconsistent service and mediocre food.  Mother in law treated us to dinner so we ended up here at 5:00 on a Saturday. I don't recommend doing this if you value your sanity, or personal space.  Six thousand people in the lobby. 45 minute wait. We opted to stay but were smart enough to go upstairs and out the back door to sit on the couches in the now defunct and slightly creepy mall. We finally win the buzzer lottery and head to the upstairs desk, only to be told they're cleaning our table and we now have to wait in the horde of waiting patrons mixed with service staff trying to do their jobs. Not ideal for a family of five.  Now seated we meet Joe our server who was admittedly proficient and friendly.  We got menus and drinks quickly. Bread basket came a good ten minutes after we sat down.  But, it was warm!  Food was standard Cheesecake Factory- everything was good, nothing great.  The kid's chicken fingers portion is dismal. My burger was supposed to be medium and was basically only seared.  I don't mind bloody cow so I don't mind but, not what I asked for.  The real fun came when we ordered dessert. We got four cheesecake slices to go. It took TWENTY MINUTES to get them, after we paid!! We know it was twenty minutes because J went to bring the car around for MIL and came back in to search for us because he thought we got lost.  We open the cheesecake in the car and slices have shrunk since the last time we've eaten here, two years ago.  They're half the size. Def not worth the price, no matter how good they might taste.  Kinda mad we paid for it first.  To overuse this word....Meh."
Francesca C.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,133,81,2.0,1/28/2017,"Waitress/bartender (black female) was absolutely amazing. On the other hand,  the food will not make me return. For an appetizer I ordered the goat cheese and beet salad which was very good. And for my entrée off the skinnylicious menu I ordered the steak medallions which were very unevenly cooked. I ordered a medium steak and I got all three cooking temperatures and none of the steaks were exactly the same size therefore that's why I think that they weren't cooked well enough. It also came with a side of asparagus with some type of sauce that came with it was way too sweet."
Sara C.,"Glen Cove, NY",14,53,89,5.0,1/27/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is so good but so filling! The appetizers could be considered a meal. And the meals, are so filling. But make sure you save room for the best part, desserts(aka the page and a half of cheesecakes on the menu). This is the only place I can think of where the menu pages are numbered. It is so hard to decide on a cheesecake, they really should have a sampler option. The Banana Cream is a great option if you don't really like the taste of Traditional Cheesecake."
Trinidad R.,"Glen Cove, NY",1,30,36,4.0,7/8/2017,"Great easy to do for a girls dinner. 3 of my friends are picky eaters so this menu has something for everyone. We had corn tamales, fried Mac and cheese, chicken honey and biscuits, steak medallions off the skinny menu and the chicken Madeira. Everything was yummy our waiter was a newbie but he was friendly and attentive. The Malbec could have been a little better and they don't let you sample/taste it and we ordered a bottle."
Liz S.,"Queens, NY",4,191,103,2.0,7/30/2017,"The cheesecake is great but I never understood the wait for this place. I've attempted to eat here several times and I've only been able to bear the two hour wait once. The food isn't anything to go crazy over. The cheesecake, obviously, is phenomenal, but I'd never wait around that long for this food. Honestly, go to Grand Lux a few minutes down the road. They're owned by the same company and have a similar feel, and their food is great. I haven't had to wait around as long, either."
Elena S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,11,,4.0,11/13/2017,Has a huge variety of dishes and cocktails. Tasty food and drinks. Prices are affordable as well.
