Susan S.,"Flushing, NY",0,5,1,1.0,12/9/2015,Called for a take away order and was put on hold for 10 minutes. The chicken Cobb salad had a long strand of hair mixed into the salad. This place has been going down the tubes the past few years. Food and service is horrible now. Won't be going back to use my gift card. I'll be regifting it this holiday season.
Zaneta O.,"Westbury, NY",837,691,2805,4.0,4/15/2014,The food is decent but the desserts are to die for.
Valencio S.,"Westbury, NY",8,4,,4.0,2/14/2015,"Valentine's day was a blast, the food was great as well. Was a wait to get a table lol thats always the case smh.everyone was out and heading for Cheesecake FACTORY lol great service  (Micheal ) trust me the wait was worth it."
pamela j.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,30,17,5.0,5/20/2014,This is where to go when you want really good food and fantastic drinks. I didn't take photos because i ate and drank everything put before me. Shout to Eneique the bartender. His drinks are phenomenal.   Great for families or date night.  The carrot cake cheeses is a must have.  The Bellini heaven in a glass.  I'm a fan..
Fatema N.,"New York, NY",5,41,30,5.0,8/10/2015,"For me and my boyfriend, The Cheesecake Factory is a must-have date night spot. After our first time here, we never had to look at the menu again. I always get the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and for him the Crispy Chicken Costaletta. Both dishes are always fantastic, and the pasta even has a lunch option. As appetizers, please try the Buffalo Chicken Blasts if you love wings (they're not wings but honestly they're better and less messy.) We're usually too stuffed for cheesecake, but I do recommend the mango coconut cheesecake! The staff is always friendly and the wait is usually short. The only negative is when coming to two people, we usually end up sitting at a table in between others which can feel a little crowded."
Alexa D.,"Northport, NY",0,15,,1.0,12/31/2015,Do not get takeout or cheesecake here. Very disorganized and you will be waiting. 30-45 minutes
Joey T.,"Little Neck, NY",1,12,2,1.0,12/30/2015,"I can't even give a star. I took my employees out for dinner tonight to the Cheesecake Factory. The floor in the whole place was so slippery. They sat us at a table that was sticky and dirty. So we had to have someone come clean it. One of us ordered a hamburger that came with two different types of bacon and he was given the burger minus one of the bacon and it never came out. They deducted his meal off the bill. Last stop was the bathroom. I should have taken pictures..... I have never seen a bathroom so disgusting. No toilet paper in two of the stalls, garbage and unsanitary garbage overflowing in each stall and by the sink. My seven year old refused to use the bathroom.  I don't think I will ever come here again."
Maria M.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",65,57,54,4.0,8/4/2014,"Came for lunch- everything we ordered was delicious. Unfortunately we ate so much we couldnt think about ordering dessert!!! Its a shame cause who comes here and doesnt order a slice of cheesecake, right!? Overall everything was amazing!"
Brian H.,"Ozone Park, NY",0,7,,4.0,12/25/2015,"I love to come here with the family. Great place, great atmosphere, great food.. and cheesecake to die for."
Anthony S.,"Nassau County, NY",261,504,497,3.0,11/20/2012,"For a chain restaurant, I think this place is definitely one of the better ones.  I've been here quite a few times, and always try a different dish.  On this visit I had the ""bang-bang chicken and shrimp"" which was tasty and had a nice kick to it.  The portions are huge, and if you have room for dessert (or even if you don't, order a slice of cheesecake to go), you can't go wrong with any cake on the menu.  I would suggest ONLY going during the week, because if you try going on the weekend, be prepared to wait for an hour plus just to be seated."
Randi G.,"Walnut Creek, CA",42,46,29,4.0,10/1/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory. We usually go with my niece and nephew.  The kids menu is good.  The food is consistent wch is great.  My only complaint is the wait.  At times the wait can Bo 30-45 minutes which can be annoying with children.  Other than that, I'd say everything on the menu - especially the Cheesecake is awesome. I love this place."
Scott K.,"Wantagh, NY",6,75,,5.0,9/2/2015,"Always great food, Frank, the manager, is excellent and always friendly and always smiling and making sure all are satisfied with the experience."
Olive G.,"Mineola, NY",0,29,8,4.0,8/23/2015,"Why do I love the Cheesecake Factory so much? I don't know but I do. The food is just really good. This particular Cheesecake Factory is better than most. Oddly though, the cheesecake isn't great. Sometimes we will get a piece and it will still be frozen in the middle."
Sadri B.,"White Plains, NY",5000,1934,449,4.0,7/15/2016,"in my book you can't go wrong with the factory, but this ccf in long island is always crowded but i will wait. this westbury spot on old country rd is really popular so you will wait but it's a giant place so the wait is minimal .it's part of an outdoor mall with other stores including another fave of mine pf chang, plenty of free parking , two levels inside with the first level having a patio type feel with plenty of tables and a bar two the rear right and also has the restrooms, level two which you can visit via long round stairs or take the escalators . the host table in the middle and desserts section to the left, plenty of booths and tables all around and another section in the rear, i recommend a booth which is more comfy and i feel better for privacy . the menu is a phone book but i have notice it's not as thick as in the past but still the variety of diverse apps , entrees , etc is still impressive . the service has always been on point and this visit is no difference our servers was great and active. i always have trouble when it comes to ordering an appetizer because of the choices but for entree it's a coin flip between meatloaf platter or chicken enchiladas and my coin flip states chicken enc. the bread that is giving is so addictive that an app is not needed today (more bread please). i did grab one of my brothers tex mex rolls which was tasty . all cheese cake factory spots have the same decor with the sky blue wall design that extends to the ceiling with its roman / moorish look. i am not a cheese cake lover and boy they do have some variety but try the other desserts like chocolate mud pie or carrot cake, etc. if you are able to have an app, plenty of bread and entree and still have room for dessert then i can only say go for it and enjoy. if you stop by during lunch you can pick one of the many special combos for 12 bucks or less and weekend has a bunch of brunch deals . i am glad i have a factory in white plains cause you can't go wrong coming here . 4.5 stars for food, service , prices . enjoy."
Della W.,"Forest Hills, NY",0,4,,2.0,11/28/2015,"I am cheesecake fan. I am probably at this location once a month. Cheesecake is great. Wait times are generally long if you go on the weekends are during the dinner period. ( as to be expected). However, the food at this location has taken a serious dive over the last 3 months. In September and October it was just tasteless. Which is sad. They have an extensive menu, maybe that is the problem? Went on November 12th got serious sick. Will not have lunch/dinner there again. Will just stick to cheesecake and drinks :)"
Ethel M.,"Levittown, NY",1,32,,5.0,8/7/2015,"This applies ONLY to the one in Bay Shore at the South Shore Mall. The one at Walt Whitman is awful. I've only been to the Bay Shore one twice, but both times the food was great. The service has been great, too. The food at Walt Whitman is bad...just tasteless. The service at both is good...once at Walt Whitman I had a horrible waiter but every other time they were good."
Carlos C.,"Brooklyn, NY",184,557,36,3.0,4/19/2015,"I did it all for the cheesecake.  Oh Cheesecake Factory, why do I tolerate you so much.  The two hour wait time had me on edge, and a lotta of impatience . But man, this place sucks for large parties. I feel bad for families and those who do double dates and could only make it during the weekend.  The food is good, I had a Carolina bbq pork sandwich. It came adorned with cole slaw,crispy applewood bacon,bbq sauce of course, sweet onions, and topped off with spicy mustard. The sweet potato fries were crunchy,a tad bit on the salty side,but water helped alot. The cheesecake I had was amazing (chocolate mousse,btw), I had the ill foodgasm. Overall, I love the Cheesecake Factory and large parties should be adviced to come through on a weekday Monday ~Thursday.  The place is a mad house during the weekends. Service was good,and efficient."
Natalie Y.,"Jericho, NY",0,8,,5.0,6/15/2016,Delicious salads.     Great for easy casual dining.     Nice decor and fun ambiance.     Friendly and courteous service.    Meals are well priced.   Great for a fun Friday night
Geremy K.,"Jamaica, NY",0,5,,5.0,11/13/2014,"Came here for a date night last night...what a surprise. I buy their cakes at the supermarket and never even knew they had a restuarant! Their menu can be very intimidating and complicated at first. It looks like a book, and you will need patience and reading glasses to get through it We got the buffalo blasts, hibachi steak, and Ligurian Pesto. All hits, and portions were huge! And im a big guy! (6'7"" 240 lbs) Our waiter is what really gave the cake its icing. He was attentive, patient, and offered good advice.  Definitelty worth a trip if you are visiting the mall nearby."
Lilibeth A.,"East Harlem, Manhattan, NY",135,24,9,4.0,6/20/2015,"Huge location! Great service, helpful employees and always a tasteful and gratifying bite and sip."
