Samantha A.,"Ridgewood, NY",118,135,493,3.0,5/31/2015,"This restaurant is really nice and, of course, the cheese cakes and deserts are to die for! The food on the other hand is not the best. Everything had a really strong asian flare (because it is an asian restaurant) but I was expecting a more American style of food. Some of the foods came with these crunchy little things that I'm still not sure if one is supposed to eat or not. Either way, nothing was appetizing and it is pretty high priced. But again, the location is great and the establishment was beautiful."
Shoma M.,"FAR ROCKAWAY, NY",0,1,2,5.0,9/1/2013,"So much to choose from but all great choices... Okay, so I went here tonight to celebrate my mom's birthday and it was awesome. Our waitress Casey was the best. Not only was she extremely attentive, she made sure the birthday cheesecake surprise went off without a hitch.  Now the food... Can we say DELICIOUS!!! Yes capital letters were necessary, that's how great everything was. We ordered the crab cake bites, tempura shrimp, avocado egg rolls and the tossed salad, tropical iced teas and a frozen strawberry smoothie for a start; then for our entrees, we had the Jamaican shrimp, fish tacos and a chicken and potatoes dish. Everyone enjoyed each and every morsel of their food.  Let's not forget the desert, which btw is amazing; that should be expected when dining in a restaurant called Cheesecake Factory. The tiramisu cheesecake is the bomb, I got the Hersey's s'mores cheesecake to go as well as the strawberry, and two slices of raspberry lemon slices to go, I know...overboard but worth it. All and all the evening was great. My mom, the birthday girl enjoyed herself and so did everyone else.  Thanks Cheesecake Factory."
Mike P.,"Franklin Square, NY",0,6,,5.0,10/22/2014,"It's a 5 star place!! The best cheescake that I've ever had!! We come here every week and we tried all the cheescake so far.. There is not a best one for me.. There are all good!!Stuff is very friendly and treat you very well!! It's a good place for family and friend. Very classy and stylish place! Ciao, Mike."
John M.,"JACKSON HEIGHTS, NY",4255,71,334,4.0,4/3/2014,Great service better than we expected even though it was sat yards night. Great staff also. Their food is on the middle side but few dishes are very unique that are difficult to find else where.
Will C.,"Queens, NY",2269,594,473,3.0,12/12/2013,Stopped here after a long day of shopping at Tanger outlets. My friends went to get a table while I browsed more clothing in the attached and semi-deserted mall.  Service was quick. They make a good ribeye and fries. The other choice was P.F. Changs.
Alexandra S.,"Westbury, NY",0,24,,2.0,1/21/2016,"Been here many times, every time thinking that would be better, but always the same. Overcrowded, understaffed, impolite same old scene. I don't understand why there are so many people at that place every weekend. It's nothing special. Every single time I went my order was wrong, and I mean every time. The cheesecake, OK, I see people going nuts over...but it's just a slice of cheesecake, in which maybe thrown into there are cookies or peanut butter cups, or something stupid, some flavors. I don't think that those people who go crazy over their overly sweet cheesecake have ever tried a good piece of cake. Plus, have you seen the calories on one slice, around 2000 calories! This all, toped off with disgusting, impolite staff who think they are models or something... Would rather take my money somewhere else."
Eileen C.,"Queens, NY",59,147,79,4.0,4/19/2014,"Overall great food with huge portions for an okay price. It isn't cheap but I guess considering its portions, it's fair. This is my favorite chain restaurant. Plus that free dark bread (is it pumpernickel??) is soooo good.  My always-go to dishes when I come here are the spicy ahi tempura rolls for the appetizer, the BBQ Ranch chicken salad (my favorite salad!) and the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. Yummy in my tummy! Always leave extremely full with leftovers for another meal the next day! The wait for a table is usually really long and the service quality is either really great or mediocre. Whatever, as long as they don't spit in my delicious food or bring me it cold, I'll still always come back for great taste."
Danielle S.,"New York, NY",10,22,,5.0,6/18/2015,Not a huge cheesecake fan so I was pessimistic walking in but was very satisfied walking out. I love it here! There is way more to it than just cheesecake and they have a HUGE menu with loads of choices for meals as well as dessert of course. Looking forward to returning!!
Christina C.,"New York, NY",199,48,38,3.0,1/28/2015,"speaking to the girls who get full off of one meal (let's say like a chicken cesar salad).. beware, i recommend sharing dishes! their portions are HUGEEEEE!.  other than that, the dining area is super huge. their food selection is huge. lol, everything about this place is huuuge (word of the day?). i guess it's hard to select what you want to eat, especially if you're NOT picky, because the menu option is so vast. other than that, service is up-to-par and they are attentive.  this place is great for group settings / parties / etc.  however, if you're trekking from queens or the city or somewhere along that distance... ehh.. i don't think it's worth it to drive all the way out to westbury to try their cheesecake/food."
Ann C.,"Whitestone, NY",44,288,304,5.0,10/9/2013,"Ten years ago, the Cheesecake Factory was the only reason I'd ever go to Long Island. It was the only thing Long Island had to offer before I discovered Ikea. We'd only make the special trip all the way from Queens for really special occasions. It was a big deal. So it was a huge surprise to me when I learned that true Long Islanders don't find Cheesecake Factory to be a big deal..or any deal.  Their laminated and bound menu takes 15 minutes to get through, even if you skip the ads. Their portions are huge and pre-meal bread is soft and delicious. There's always a wait on weekends and the amount of whipped cream they add to one slice of cheesecake is ridiculous. I don't care that it's a chain and you can get the same sort of food for better prices elsewhere. I don't care that a slice of cheesecake can contain enough calories to hold you over for weeks. I still think of the Cheesecake Factory at the [now diminishing] Source Mall whenever I think of Long Island food. It is and forever will be my go-to."
Daphnée H.,"East Meadow, NY",2,39,57,3.0,5/30/2015,I think it is okay. I only eat there when friends are having dinner parties. The food is okay. The cheesecake has too much cream for me.
Steve Y.,"Great Neck, NY",8,24,1,2.0,9/3/2013,"I'm just gonna put out there what every Long Islander thinks, but no one has the guts to say... The Cheesecake Factory is horrendous and the Cheesecake Factory's cult-like following represents a local societal problem that we must address.  Clearly, Long Island's cheesecake-loving fiends have no concept of time and taste.  No efficient, Blackberry-carrying yuppie would ever waste two hours waiting to be seated for entrees served from industrial-sized microwaves. Speaking of business, have you ever wondered how profitable the Cheesecake Factory must be?  It must be nice not to spend money on actual cooking when you have extra-large microwaves for extra-large portions of frozen food.  And do you know any other restaurant with ads in their menu?  Any reputable restaurants?  (You can put your hand down now, Dallas BBQ.)   Nassau County, try to relax.  You don't have to spend two hours on frozen food and cheesecake you're not gonna eat.  You are not Detroit and you don't have to depend on cheesecake revitalizing your economy east of Roosevelt Field."
Tasha P.,"Kew Gardens, Queens, NY",9,34,8,5.0,4/16/2014,"First time I actually sat and ate a meal here! And I have to say it was a fabulous experience from beginning to end:) The service was great, and the food is absolutely delicious! Don't forgot all the cheesecakes they have to offer, from Oreo to red velvet.. You can never go wrong!"
Alexander P.,"Black Rock, CT",29,67,423,5.0,1/9/2012,"I'm big on desserts.  Hence this place is a sure shot when it comes to variants of non classic cheesecakes.  If you want a classic cheesecake, go to Juniors.   I can't vouch for the food they serve, but the cheesecakes are on point.  You will not be disappointed. Staff is friendly and insightful.  The decor is reminiscent of the Luxor Hotel. Cheesecake from $6.95 to $7.95 A La Mode $1.50 extra Hot Fudge $1.50 extra"
Juliana O.,"New York, NY",2,151,24,3.0,4/29/2014,First of all this place always packed during the dinner hour and forget about going on the weekends if you don't want to wait for 1hour.  The food was okay. Typical franchise restaurant. Try different type of food. Sometimes good and bad.  The salmon was really bad! Big time! It taste like coming from the fridge and defrosted.  Fish and chips is okay.  The burger is okay too. I've tried the gumbo and I love it!  Always get the red velvet cheese cake to go. It's must!  Just wish you'll get a good food. I wish they have good food in the whole menu.  That salmon should NOT in the menu. It's just horrible!!!
Yolanda D.,"Oakdale, NY",7,142,3,4.0,2/14/2014,Great food entrees not just desserts. Great lunch specials and you can also request a half portion of an entree which is great. They give you a very generous portion. Friendly service always crowded though. The numerous cheesecakes I've tried have been very interesting flavor sand tasty. This is not just a dessert spot it's got great food as well. I actually  prefer the food  from here I wouldn't just come for dessert. The coffee is very good and you get a
Staci R.,"Hartford, CT",776,558,239,4.0,2/22/2014,"I haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in quite a few years, but after my experience at this one I won't stay away for so long.  Came for lunch on a Saturday and thank goodness we beat the crowd. Our wait was promised to be 10 mins and ended up being a little shorter than that. Our waiter was funny, witty and attentive which is always nice.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad, my dad the Seared Salmon Salad and my step-mom the Luau Salad. Everyone enjoyed their meals. I had a good amount of ahi tuna, seasoned and cooked well,  the shallot vinaigrette that it was tossed with was good and the sliced tomatoes with pesto they were served on the side were fresh. I tried the luau salad and thought it was awesome. There was a lot going on between the massive wantons, the nuts and the peanut flavored dressing but I enjoyed every bite and will definitely be ordering that salad the next time I come.  I deducted one star b/c our food took longer than expected to come out but other that that it was a good experience."
Aj V.,"Flushing, NY",25,10,20,5.0,6/3/2015,"Ahh. The classic American upper class restaurant with a world famous dessert bar. The Cheesecake Factory is an elegant dining facility that lives up to its expectations. From the moment I arrived, I enjoyed my experience. The Cheesecake Factory has 2 floors, the lower for parties and busy weekends, the top for dining. The attire is casual-semi casual although it's recommended that one dresses up. The waiting time during a prime time weekday was excellent. I was impressed at the speed of the waiters because there was a massive amount of customers. The Upper Level has a bar that displays their classic cheesecakes. The drinks are great. The food is delicious. The menu is big enough to cover all your cravings whether it's seafood or Hand foods or Italian foods. There are a lot of alcoholic beverages that are very well for the adults. The only flaw is that the bathroom is on the lower level but the best part is the dessert. The dessert is fancy and prepared to excellence. I highly recommend this place for a date or fancy dinner because  their classy approach to the customer is exquisite."
Dr Z.,"Stewart Manor, NY",10,204,82,4.0,7/24/2013,"I go back and forth about The Cheesecake Factory. I mean, its extensive menu boasts some of the nation's most fat-, sodium and calorie-laden foods, dressed up with clever names and a hefty price-tag justified by the heaping portions. And that's before you get to the cheesecake. I am always excited by the prospect of going there, but get easily overwhelmed by the menu. After I cross off all the things I can't justify for health reasons - like not wanting to eat 5,000 calories, 80g of fat and 3,000mg sodium in one sitting - the selection is surprisingly narrow. The Skinnylicious menu has made an improvement here and I now find myself ordering from there or the selection of ""small plates"" that now supplements the appetizers. I actually prefer getting a couple of small plates to one big entree, so I'm happy with that.  The quality of the food is consistently good. The staff are hit or miss (either friendly and prompt, or dim and slow, with no in between). The combination of the ridiculously long menu and a potentially high turnover in staff means that your server will probably not know the menu well enough to advise on ingredients. And be prepared for a wait to get seated and in between courses, because it's always crowded.  I usually end up going for a few staples like the mahi mahi or chicken tacos, white chicken chili, or a flatbread with a small arugula salad. From past experiences, I would have always given this place a solid 3-stars. But on my last visit I made the wise decision of choosing something new to try, the Vietnamese Tacos. I was skeptical since a Vietnamese Taco sounds about as good as a Chinese bolognese, but the description had all the stuff I like. It was by far the best thing I've ever eaten at the Cheesecake Factory, cheesecake included. It was basically pulled pork with an asian slaw on a soft white bun. It was surprisingly fresh and light, but flavorful and filling. I'm sold on this fusion ""taco"" (minus the chiles). I paired it with the Beets and Goat cheese salad (with arugula, green apples and pecans) and they actually went really well together.  I have been put off in the past by the cost of food here, but you can skip the overcharged and grossly fattening entrees and also save some money by getting a couple of the cheaper small plates instead. The two I got came in around $10 and was more than enough food. To be clear, ""small plates"" is a bit of a misnomer. They are not, as the name might suggest, tiny or diminutive. They are merely the appropriate portion size that humans should be served."
Scott T.,"Garden City, NY",40,4,,5.0,6/29/2015,Service is great. The atmosphere inside is like you are in another country. Food is pretty good but you go there for cheesecake lol. Cheesecakes are amazing!!!
