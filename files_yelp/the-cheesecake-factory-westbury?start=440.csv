monica m.,"Wantagh, NY",0,33,,4.0,8/12/2015,"Went there yesterday, kid din't like her pizza much but my grilled salmon was great, kids spaghetti and meatballs consisted of just one medium meatball no meatballs.  The banana cream cheesecake was delish, key lime pie cheesecake a little too tart. Service was very good.  Over priced at nearly $8 per slice of cake."
Chloe D.,"Manhattan, NY",15,15,,4.0,6/21/2015,"Great gathering place for family and friends. We come often, because of the warm and friendly atmosphere. We also love the appetizers and the salads. The entre is too big for one. The only downside is the menu doesn't have any photos."
Mo M.,"Glen Head, NY",4,19,22,2.0,12/29/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is well known and always crowded. And they don't take reservations. The bread is good and the food is pretty good too however is sometimes very greasy. The service is usually up to par as well and the waiters are friendly. However, you are probably wondering why I gave it a two star, this is because last time I went I was eating the fries which are pretty good and at the bottom was this little popcorn sized fried circle I though it was probably a cluster of crumbs but after looking closely it was a fried OCTOPUS yes they accidentally mixed in a baby fried octopus! I was so disgusted since it was purple and gross and I hate seafood that I immediately felt sick. That moment has made me not want to go there again."
Serena L.,"Forest Hills, NY",74,215,15,4.0,2/12/2014,"We were a party of 6 (including two toddlers) and came last Sunday...we met at around 11:15am and I was surprised to see that the first floor was empty. They were directing all guests to the second floor. Of course the second floor was at about 70% capacity.... but still, the trick is to get there nice and early to avoid the 1hr+ wait!!! I've come at night and had to wait over an hour and at that pt, im just tempted to bite my finger off! Service was great, our waitress was quirky yet sarcastic...but overall we had a great experience with her . Cheesecake Factory always gives generous portions and this time was no exception. The girls brought home leftovers and the guys finished the meals and left with the ill itis! LoL. Also, in terms of selection, if more choices is your thing, then you've come to the right place! There's a skinnylicious menu, brunch menu and regular menu...hot dangity...it must have taken us over 1/2 hour to decide what we wanted. everything looked so good and they offer everything from french toast to full steak entrees! Of course we couldn't leave w/o having cheesecake too and that's always heavenly. If you're a calorie counter, then spare yourself the agony and don't come :)"
Jake J.,"Elmont, NY",8,173,80,3.0,2/2/2016,It's a very nice looking place I hear a lot about it and I've been dying to come for yrs but never got around to doing it. But I finally went today with my brother and friend and I was so excited. First off the waiter wasn't too interested in is she would disappear for extended periods of time and when we would see her she would walk right past us without checking on us. Although the rare moments when she did check on us she was polite and kind. Anywho the food wasn't too special our chicken was undercooked and we had to return them the drinks weren't made too well either. Everything just seemed to lack kick. But the buffalo blasts was great I wish I knew how to make those. And the cheesecake was just perfection. I had the Reese's one and ohhhhh laaawwwddyyy was it good. I would kitts rally come back here just for cheesecake it's that good all in all the expeirience was alright I guess was my first time I may try it again sometime in the future...
G L R.,"Durham, NC",15,129,2,4.0,12/13/2013,"I have been here more times than I can count. Its probably my favorite chain restaurant along with Grand Lux.  Pros:  food quality is consistently good large menu variety reasonable prices Cons:  often a long wait floor is slippery due to the open kitchen usually the top floor is only open and the bathrooms are on the bottom floor, where it feels dark and sort of far to walk when you just want to wash your hands.  The pros out weigh the cons. I really do enjoy the Cheesecake Factory and find their food to be very good, especially for being a chain."
Emmi G.,"Queens Village, NY",0,10,,3.0,5/16/2015,Love this place! Only one negative comment I have is they took my favorite dish off their menu. I always order the avocado roles from their appetizer menu- their tamarind sauce is delicious!!
Gina Marie B.,"Plainview, NY",167,485,21,4.0,10/13/2013,"I think the food is slightly overprices, but what chains like these are not? I really need to give this place some props though. It is huge and the food comes out so quickly and fresh. Not like it has been sitting around for a while. The cheesecake is always spectacular. You can not beat all the interesting flavors available. And there are more desserts then just cheesecake.  The menu is huge! Which is almost slightly annoying because it takes so long to look through it. But ya know what? Everything is usually really good. So I can not complain!  I like coming here. I do not come here unless I have a gift certificate because it just gets too packed."
Eileen K.,"Nassau County, NY",217,151,115,4.0,5/11/2015,I love this place though the wait is forever especially on the weekends . The food is so yummy . The cheesecake is delicious.
Donna N.,"Roslyn, NY",0,3,,2.0,4/18/2016,The waitress changed our drink ordered to a more expensive drink without our knowing the price.  $15.00 for a margarita that was filled with ice was a rip-off. We could not beleve the prices for a drink!!!
Tina C.,"ASTORIA, NY",90,122,44,5.0,6/5/2014,"We all know the food is outstanding from all angles, my rating is for the service first, then drinks and food.  Visited yesterday with my son and his dad, had the salmon salad, shrimp app, mini burgers, chicken salad. All excellent. White sangria refreshing with fresh plentiful fruit inside. Thank you for that :)  Joey was incredible. Informed us of the specials, and exuded a personality; not corporate robotic demeanor, yet still very professional. I look at the weirdest things and one of those, are the hands. Represent good hygiene. Being a server myself, I feel good service must be recognized and expressed. So thank you Joey for your help.  Don't forget the sun screen next time you go to Coney Island :)"
Taurian D.,"Apex, NC",4,147,241,3.0,3/6/2015,The only thing I like here is their salmon firecracker and the sweet wheat roll and butter. Everything else seem to taste all the same. Well what do you expect from a chain restaurant.
Nicole K.,"FAR ROCKAWAY, NY",6,34,5,4.0,3/3/2014,"I love this place. I usually come here after shopping or a movie night. There so many different things in that area. At times it can be a bit crowded, but it doesn't affect me They give you bread in the beginning, which taste good as hell with the butter. You really dont need an appetizer after having that bread.There's also a lot of things to choose from on the menu. Me personally, i always get the chicken w/ the mushrooms, asparagus, and mashpotatoes (i forgot the exact name). Their portion size is big, I always end up taking half home. Their desserts are really good and a big portion size as well.  I say go, just make sure your pockets are right. Im a college student by the way lol"
Massimo V.,"New York, NY",6,9,13,5.0,5/17/2015,"Everything was  absolutely great, service, food, and the cheesecake especially! Everybody was very friendly and polite and the ambience was amazing! Great place!"
Ashley S.,"Hollis, NY",23,87,23,3.0,1/8/2015,Cajun pasta was delicious! Not spicy but great flavors and taste. Everything is made to order so it is fresh. The bread that they serve you complimentary is tasty with the butter. (My fav part of dinner always) Didn't try a cheesecake for dessert but I will next time.
Shayla M.,"Bronx, NY",25,6,7,4.0,8/25/2014,The Buffalo chicken wings are the best I've ever had. Soooooo freaking good. My 13 month old son was sucking them down the last time I was there. Lol
Kristy T.,"MIDDLE VILLAGE, NY",0,60,2,4.0,2/28/2016,"Me and my hubby love this place . Best fried Mac and cheese u will ever have, hands down. Unfortunately on Friday night they ran out which was disappointing considering we chose this place to eat for that reason . Waiter also bought me out the wrong food . But I'm a patient person. There's a huge menu, so everyone is bound to like something !"
Tara B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,24,,1.0,10/18/2015,This place is overrated and overpriced for the quality of the food that is served!!! The service is great however the food is bland!!! I ordered the jambalaya pasta. The dish was so oily and the chicken and shrimp had no seasoning at all!! This dish is supposedly spicy yet there was no spice other than what was on the plate for presentation. Last time dining at this establishment.
Siena H.,"Westbury, NY",0,8,,3.0,5/29/2015,"One of my favorite restaurants in this area! There appetizer menu is so vast and delicious. A few of my favorites are the fried Mac and cheese and the pretzel crusted chicken fingers. I wasn't a fan of the guacamole here, which I usually like everywhere. It came out very warm and bland, which may have just been a fluke. My favorite meal dish here is the pasta carbonara, although it is quite pricy. It almost goes without saying that the cheesecake is amazing, especially the Oreo and Godiva ones. Love this place, although it is impossible to get a table at night without a long wait. Best time to go is between 2 and 5."
Yadi C.,"Corona, NY",7,79,51,5.0,12/19/2014,Table wait was only 5mins. Very friendly waiters. overalll great service awesome food. Food was cooked good. I had the red velvet cheesecake and the dulce de leche chessecake ...mmmmm yum.
