Ashley S.,"New York, NY",133,14,5,4.0,4/11/2015,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for a friends birthday last night. It was my first time there so I was amazed. The ambiance in the factory was very nice. After a long day at work, it was quit soothing. Our waiter Dan was great, very enthusiastic and on point with seeing how we were and if we needed anything. The food was delicious, I am a pasta girl and I got the Farefalle. The piña colada that I got was great as well, unfortunately I was driving so I could not drink all of it. For having a table of 6 we were accommodated very quickly. I would definitely be back for my anniversary."
Marina S.,"Sacramento, CA",138,153,4,4.0,2/6/2013,"I know that most people think the Cheesecake Factory is a little overrated and overpriced, but I am a big fan.  I love their skinnylicious menu and the regular menu is huge!  If you can't find something to eat at this place, you are too high maintenance for life. They recently took off the Thai Pasta off the menu which was my favorite dish.  That being said, the skinnylicious veggie burger is great, the arugula salad is wonderful, and the shrimp scampi is a classic!   The desserts are absolutely amazing!  My favorites include the chocolate raspberry cheesecake,  white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, godiva cheesecake, and black out cake!  All are insanely good, but watch out for an astronomical calorie count!  So worth it though! The reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because some of the dishes are a bit overpriced and I have never been impressed with any of the wait staff.  They act like they are doing you a huge favor for any request or question.  Overall, a great place to grab dinner and a drink with a friend!"
Sherice L.,"Brooklyn, NY",88,91,64,3.0,12/30/2010,"The food is not ALL that great. Of course edible. I had cajun jambalaya pasta which was supposed to be ""spicy"". Definitely was not. They need to Kick it up a notch. The drink which lasted my whole entire 115,000 calorie meal was awesome. (Mango Strawberry Raspberry) I think it was.  The appetizers were hefty portions, 4 people can share just one Nachos with chicken platter. Now for the grand finale..... I had taken home 3 slices of cheese cake which by the way were 6 dollars and some change a pop (Godiva-7 dollars) It was THEE BEST cheesecake and most creative I've had. I took home vanilla bean--pretty basic, the Godiva chocolate cheesecake---to DIE for and the brownie cheesecake which was my favorite.  Its cool for lunch out with the homes when we get tired of walking and wanna gain at least 3,092782p,0 pounds eating multiple slices of cheesecake."
Alexandra C.,"New York, NY",672,1862,61,4.0,9/22/2011,"First off, I don't go to chain restaurants.  Don't like them.  Plus when you live in NYC there are so many different small restaurants to try. But for Cheesecake Factory - I'll go anytime.  They simply are the best chain restaurant around.   Every dish I have ever had here has been delicious.  Although I found their salads have slipped in quality since back 9 years ago when I went here.  They used to have the biggest and best fresh salads around.    Still love their soft bread, the hot spinach artichoke dip, chicken dishes, cajun chicken fettucini, jambalaya.  How do they get their chicken that incredibly tender? And the best of course is their cheesecake.  The oreo, the peanut butter.. Yum.  Although last time we went for the hot fudge sundae - which might have been the best (although richest) sundae I've had.  Right up there with their cheesecake! Of course I love the overly huge portions.  What I don't love about the place is the long wait and the 7,000 calories I walk out with."
Leigh-Ann E.,"Valley Stream, NY",255,110,192,5.0,2/8/2015,"I have never been disappointed at the Cheesecake Factory. Their menu is huge and there are so many unique things to try. Too bad I can never save room for the cheesecakes which are amazing. This place gets super crowded, even when the 2 floors are open, so be prepared that there may be a wait. We actually only go for lunch because it's nuts at dinnertime. My favorite go-to item is the Santa Fe chicken salad which has 2 different dressings on it (peanut/cilantro) and is just perfect."
Rebecca G.,"Glen Cove, NY",705,170,33,5.0,1/15/2015,Had chris outrageous cheesecake was delicious called ahead walked in n got my order on spot hubby order lemon mesala. Yummy on both came to 20 dollars..for two deserts w ice cream.
Cherry C.,"Brooklyn, NY",81,45,43,5.0,12/26/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory never let me down. Although we wait for 25mins on a Friday night, we got good service as always. We ordered pasta and buffalo wings. The one thing to be pointed out was the waiters and waitresses there are well-trained or talented. They are very good at making customers happy :) that's very important in dining!"
Christina A.,"Plainview, NY",6,51,14,5.0,9/3/2014,I've been here to dine in and it's always been great service and awesome food! I have been taking out more often though now that my job is nearby. The woman that runs the take-out counter (I believe her name is Camille) is amazing! She's so nice and you can tell she really goes above and beyond for her customers. I always have a pleasant experience when I go there.
amy t.,"Jamaica, NY",0,75,32,5.0,2/19/2016,"Always good! The chicken sliders, pasta divinci  and crabcakes are always a must. Go before 5pm to avoid the insane wait."
Emily B.,"East Meadow, NY",0,9,,5.0,6/10/2015,"How can you go wrong here. Huge portions so you can always bring home leftovers for lunch the next day.  Dessert comes at a higher price, but is also quality."
Jennifer L.,"Rego Park, NY",0,5,,2.0,7/31/2014,"It's unfortunate how a server can make or break an experience. Went to the Cheesecake Factory last night. As always it was busy, not overwhelmingly busy but decent for a Wednesday night . They had a special because of the company's anniversary so cheesecake was half off. Food was good, large plates however deceiving because the interior size of the plate minus the rim barely hold any food, though I didn't have an issue with my thin slices Chicken and mountain of mashed. Naturally we ordered dessert though waited forever. It wasn't the waiting forever that bothered me but the waitress seemed to have forgotten about us. When I flagged her down I even said she can bring us any other slices I didn't even need the one we ordered. She said there weren't any cakes and they were baking, that's when I decided to check up on her excuse by running upstairs to check the cake display ( we were seated downstairs at the westbury location) the display was full and looked beautiful. Ooh well, exactly what the place is called- a corporate factory."
Kim M.,"New York, NY",6,31,60,5.0,1/18/2015,"Love this place!!! The food was beyond delicious. Waited about 1/2 hr for a table, but well worth it! After ordering a few appetizers I was pretty full. The portions can be a lot, but I packed the left overs to go along with my slice of cheesecake heaven. Will definitely be returning."
Lil Y.,"Manhattan, NY",25,33,,2.0,1/13/2015,"After waiting 1 hour for table, they took our orders promptly. I ordered the fish taco which was very disappointing.  The fish was undercooked almost like raw frozen fish, i had returned it back to kitchen.  I already lost my appetite but the manager did try to offer me something else.  I had no stomach to try anything else.  The cheesecake was just too sweet.  I give it two star just for the manager who tried to do things right."
Stephen G.,"Westbury, NY",9,53,,1.0,2/8/2016,Large portions of disgusting food frequented by low life and scum
Valerie V.,"Queens, NY",149,220,448,4.0,11/23/2011,"This place is wonderful!  The Steak Diane was a great surprise, the black peppers weren't overbearing but just right and the sauce was sweet. It came with garlic mashed potatoes which were okay."
David K.,"New Hyde Park, NY",90,302,59,4.0,11/5/2013,"If given a choice to have brunch at either IHOP or the Cheesecake Factory on any given Sunday, my obvious choice would be the Cheesecake Factory. The menu items may be a bit more pricier but the food choices are awesome (I must find another word)."
Danielle S.,"Deer Park, NY",1,106,11,2.0,10/28/2013,"I can honestly say that Cheesecake Factory isn't what it use to be. I was disapointed this time. Last time I was there was years ago, and it has declined. The food wasn't that good. I ordered the grilled chicken with couscous and asparagus. I was hungry and wished I had ordered something else. The buffalo chicken appetizer was very good though. The fried zuchinni was lacking. I can say that the pumpkin cheesecake AND the Hershey's cheesecake were worth it! Overall, not what it was once. :("
Shao L.,"Flushing, NY",100,40,57,4.0,5/12/2015,"Went here on Mother's Day . The food here is alright. We ordered the nachos,buffalo blast. Steak with salmon combination. I don't recommend buffalo blast and the nachos but the steak and salmon is delicious."
C. M.,"Queens, NY",2,40,,5.0,12/2/2014,I know it's a chain restaurant but I love this place! Cheesecake factory has never disappointed me! I love their pumpernickel  bread that you get as a starter. I've tried everything from pasta to cheeseburgers everything's good. My fav appetizer is their buffalo chicken blasts! every time i've come to this location there's never any wait time which is a plus!
Ityng H.,"New York, NY",17,210,,4.0,7/16/2013,"I've never understood American's appeal with huge, huge food chains.  Anyhoo... this Cheesecake Factory was busy even though the mall itself was eerily quiet.  I suppose it helps that they closed a chunk of the first floor.   The Skinnylicious menu is SUCH a great idea.  The portions are still HUGE so it makes me think that maybe the calorie count's not exactly accurate to the portion size.  Between the three of us, I think we took in 600 cal per person?  Not too bad right?  Especially since we ordered the  Ahi tartare - get it, don't get it, meh Margherita and fresh mushroom flatbreads - good portion though I would've liked the flat bread to be... flatter? Fire Roasted Artichoke - over ordered Chicken Lettuce Wrap - definitely get this!  We got it Asian style.  It was so crisp, fresh, and refreshing.  Plus the two dipping sauces were great. Pear and Endive salad - was also a must get.  I have no idea what was in the dressing but it was good...  Plus the salad was enough to feed three people... heaping plates too! Service was good considering that it was very busy... we had to flag different people on some occasions.  Alas.... The perfect end to a low calorie main is of course to order a cheesecake... per person... at 1K+ cal. per slice... agh... we were doing so well!  Their cheesecakes are good (snickers tasting one and a raspberry lime that was not terribly tart) but I always confuse the their strawberry shortcake vs junior's strawberry shortcake.  Different... not bad since it came with ice cream but I should've gotten a bowl of strawberries instead."
