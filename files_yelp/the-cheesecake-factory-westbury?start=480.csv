Raz H.,"East Norwich, NY",1,21,27,1.0,6/28/2015,i never had a good time at Cheescake factory. the food is ALWAYS greasy. always crowded and too   evenings. bathroom housekeeping does not match the pricing and level of this restaurant. staff always dry and in a hurry. i went there over the yeats but i am finally taking the decision not to go anymore.
Michael L.,"Douglaston, NY",77,277,313,4.0,10/18/2011,"Usually I'm not a fan of chains, but Cheesecake Factory is the exception.  Most dishes, not only are packed with food, but are well made. Skirt steak is excellent and the thai lettuce wraps are great to share for appetizer or light dinner. I hadn't been back in a while and I noticed they now have this ""Skinnylicious"" menu, terrible name, but good dishes. I had the all white chicken chili. DELICIOUS and just enough."
Joy W.,"Berlin, MA",1,3,3,4.0,1/17/2015,Very good food and best cheesecake in town. The only downside is the wait time is too long.
Jennifer A.,"Elmont, NY",22,14,11,5.0,2/17/2013,"I LOVED it here! Went with my friends yesterday for a birthday lunch and had a wonderful time.....I am definitely coming back...and hopefully soon! I'm in love with the Red Velvet Cheesecake and enjoyed the Factory Nachos! Oooh, and the Honey Oat bread they give as an appetizer.....DELISH! The waitress was also very nice and attentive."
Shaina E.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,106,88,3.0,11/15/2014,"What I will say is that no matter where I go cheesecake factory always tastes the same. The establishment has found a way to be very consistent across the different venues. If you're looking to binge, you've come to the right place I always end up eating to the point that I have to unbutton my pants and lean to the side but I STILL manage to have a full meal to take home for the next day. I don't like cheesecake (i know I know, please don't crucify me) but everyone who does enjoy it says that theirs is above average. I've also found that their drinks are good buuuut you order a couple drinks an appetizer and a meal and the bill isn't going to be pretty but on the bright side you've also purchased lunch for the next day"
Mauricio H.,"Elmont, NY",146,72,77,3.0,10/22/2014,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, what can I say.   Large portions, salty food, and pretty decent cheesecake."
toni k.,"Forest Hills, NY",0,2,,1.0,8/14/2016,"We've been to this LI location many times and never really had a bad experience.  Last night tho broke the long string of successes.  This review is not about the service, which was very good.  The wait wasn't very long but of course there is always chaos the closer you are to the door and spiral staircase.  Not a problem.  This is just for the food.  omg awful.  Fried calamari appy which was dark brown and burned so badly there was hardly any calamari left inside the burnt breading.  2 salads, what can they do to salads you figure, right?  One order was the Cobb Salad, ez pz.  Not here.  They must be having real issues back in the kitchen because it came out chopped beyond recognition and piled high in a mound in the plate, like a plate of dog food.  You could't tell lettuce from tomato from burned chicken to burnt bacon etc....Probably why they chopped it so you couldn't tell the ingredients.  The other salad was the Chinese rice noodle salad.  At least 5 inches high of crispy rice noodles piled in a mound on top of whatever else was under there.  Sooo disappointing.  Get your act together folks, every nickle counts."
Smith M.,"Baldwin, NY",0,2,,1.0,3/2/2015,"Horrible. I've been there 3 times in the last three years and the food has gotten progressively worse.  Each time I said I wouldn't go back and each time I forgot how bad the last time was and was talked into going. I won't do that again. The food used to be good didn't it? Well not anymore. The brown rice that came with my fried catfish was like stuck together with glue. The string beans were greasy and overloaded with garlic. The catfish had a decent  breading but was tasteless and there were pieces of fried fish fat included.  The half turkey sandwich and salad my friend got was also awful. Plain club roll bread with dry turkey and a salad of hunks of inedible ice berg lettuce.  My other friend got an herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes she said was just okay.  Considering the price for all 3 of us, $100, I won't be going back.  Don't know if this is all Cheesecake Factories but this one is horrendous. Don't go."
Mia T.,"Hicksville, NY",0,1,,1.0,2/3/2016,"Never apply for a job here. They make you wait two hours literally un-professional and you don't even know if you'll get hired. So pissed off. The staff seems nice, management sucks though."
Elisse D.,"Baldwin, NY",0,29,3,5.0,11/12/2014,"I came during the ending of summer for lunch on a weekday and it was great. There weren't a lot of people, the waitress was very nice and the place was very pretty and clean. It is a pretty big place. I will definitely come back, especially for that cheesecake!"
Natasha F.,"Glen Oaks, NY",94,138,157,5.0,4/25/2014,Always a fun time coming here.  Nice spacious restaurant.  They have large comfortable booths upstairs.  The seating area downstairs has a combination of booths and chairs. Nice and brightly lit downstairs and a little dimmer upstairs.  The service is always phenomenal.   All the waiters do a great job with pleasing the customer.  Whoever does the hiring deserves an A+ for that.  The food is always great -  highly caloric but great :).  My husband loves coming here as well.  He's ordered their burgers and they were very good.  The drinks are awesome - love their cocktails.
Patricia H.,"New York, NY",71,97,190,3.0,11/22/2010,"A date brought me here. While the date was a complete and total BUST. The Cheesecake Factory was not. I've always heard good things about it and I must say that it lived up to the hype. But I must agree with the previous reviews. Don't even attempt to try to do all three courses. The portions here are massive. I couldn't even finish my tacos. Delicious but you'll definitely be bringing a doggy bag home with you. The specialty cocktails are really good as well, maybe that's why I couldn't finish my tacos? Do I even need to discuss the dessert. Get the Tiramisu! The only thing about The Cheesecake Factory is that I spend about 15 minutes pouring over the menu because it's so expansive, there's literally something for everyone on there. The items on the menu are a bit pricey for some but I think considering the amount of food that you get, it's not that bad.  Be prepared for a 30-60 min wait on the weekend. Although it seems to go by pretty fast at this location."
Kristy R.,"New York, NY",368,1402,155,2.0,3/2/2011,"*sigh* I decided to give this place another shot because I had a $50 gift card and what else was I going to do with it?  I suppose I could have spent 50 on cheesecake but that would result in a Diabetic coma and those are no fun.  Trust me, I know. The food was just okay.  Lukewarm, not hot.  And the Thai pasta dish made my friend puke her brains out (for lack of a better term) the following day."
Chris P.,"Dallas, TX",23,43,9,4.0,10/25/2014,Had a good experience at this location its a smaller location with limited parking due to the surrounding restaurants nearby. It was a busy Saturday night and we sat at the bar. Service was a little on the slower side. Food came out pretty quick but getting out of there with our cheesecake and check was a different story. Took WAY too long! Food was great like you'd expect from Cheesecake.
John K.,"Long Island, NY",0,24,1,2.0,12/19/2015,"The cheesecake is fantastic. Start with the cheesecake and then leave, because the food sucks. Have dinner elsewhere and come here for dessert. The menu is huge, if they concentrated more on quality than quantity it might be decent."
Salvatore S.,"Valley Stream, NY",21,241,256,3.0,1/5/2013,"In the mood to consume 3,000 calories in one sitting, then look no further.  Good food with lots of options on their humongous menu.  Amazing desserts that you can view in their showcase before you decide."
Dominic L.,"Westbury, NY",14,86,271,4.0,1/1/2013,Place is awesome!   Dishes are big in portion.  A lot of variety.   Pastas are good.  The wheat bread is sweet and hot out from the oven.  The Salmon is excellent.   Sometimes over cooked.  Have to tell them before hand to cook in med rare.   Please order the passion fruit ice tea.  It's unsweetened and healthy.  Cheesecakes are good.  But not better than Vineros in Manhattan.   This place has it all for a better upper scale chain restaurant.
Reem C.,"Philadelphia, PA",293,329,6,2.0,6/11/2012,"To me, the Cheesecake Factory is usually fairly consistent no matter where you go. This wasn't so much the case with this location. Service was great and we didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes for a table. I ordered the Miso Salmon platter. I've had this menu item before and it is always good. This time, the salmon was overcooked and dry and there was hardly any sauce on the fish. The mashed potatoes were good as usual, but the vegetables were lacking. I usually get asparagus or a healthy serving of broccoli with my meal. At this particular location, I received about five pieces of snap peas that looked extremely pitiful. Maybe next time, the salmon won't have the life cooked out of it."
Chris P.,"Flushing, NY",28,117,15,2.0,7/2/2012,"Lets get something straight. This IS NOT FINE DINING. This is just another chain restaurant that has a larger menu. If you want to go on the spur of the moment be prepared to wait, usually around 45 minutes, to be seated. Now for a great restaurant this would be reasonable however the food here isn't anything exquisite. There are plenty of local places all over that you can get great food at that is actually made after you order it. Pass on it."
Alicia M.,"Floral Park, NY",0,3,3,3.0,1/25/2015,"i really like the food but the service is subpar. this location is always busy anf i always end up waiting 45min to an hour to get a seat. As for the food, I recommend gettig the chicken madeira for entree and the godiva brownie with vanilla ice cream for dessert. Delicious!!"
