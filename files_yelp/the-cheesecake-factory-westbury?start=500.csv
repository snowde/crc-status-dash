Shevona Y.,"South Ozone Park, NY",21,20,60,5.0,5/24/2012,"I'm in love with this place... The food, the waiters, the time they put into making the food look so fancy and elegant!  My ultimate favorite there is the stuffed mushrooms. So juicy and filled with so much flavor. I love getting the Shrimp Bistro. All their meals are very large, so usually my husband and I would share a meal and would sti have left overs. And to save the best for last, their cheese cake is Amazing! So much moisture And thickness of any flavor. This is by far my favorite place to go eat, any day! I would say for both my husband and I, we would spend about $60-$100."
Jaspreet K.,"Hicksville, NY",17,18,15,4.0,12/7/2015,I've been to three different cheesecake factories and this one is my favorite. The food and atmosphere is pretty much the same as the other places. It's just bigger in comparison.
R Y.,"Manhattan, NY",43,270,333,4.0,8/29/2012,"I can't believe after not going to Cheesecake Factory for over 10 years, I came back and enjoyed the food. This particular cheesecake factory is EXTREMELY crowded, but the place is HUGE so wait was only 15 minutes for my party of 2. It's true that for a chain the price is a bit high, but their portions are ENORMOUS! Here is what we had: 1. Mac and Cheese fried balls: Creamy, crunchy mac and cheese deep fried. need I say more? 2. Deep fried avocado rolls: the creamy avocado center with the crispy exterior wasn't the best part. It was dipping the rolls into the sauce and devouring this delicious creation. Get it. Get it when you go. 3. Eggplant sandwich: Delicious grilled eggplant and peppers in a hamburger bun. Delicious! Only thing I didn't like was the hamburger bun. Generic, too weak to hold the big slices of the eggplants and peppers. I had mine with the salad. Wish the dressing was on the side, but it wasn't over dressed. 4. Fish tacos: Huh, fish tacos at a cheesecake factory? Get it. Comes with rice and beans and the fish is deep fried.  Overall, very satisfied. After all this food, I couldn't eat their dessert. Amazing... My stomach could not handle the large amount of food I had devoured. I'll go back and try their dessert. Only reason this place doesn't get 5 star is because our waitress was missing throughout the entire dinner. A different girl came and waited on us. She was good, but again, where's our waitress? Also, the person who was suppose to guide us in on the second floor was REALLY rude. Didn't like the service as much, but again, food was definitely satisfying."
Julias R.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,1,,1.0,7/18/2016,"Eek! Methink not for real. This past Friday I went out with my boyfriend to eat here. We usually come here every month two or three times because we love it. Needless to say, we will NOT be coming back and I warn everyone to do the same. First, we get seated and the waitress off the bat asks me if I ever been to the restaurant, i respond of course. She comes at me saying ""OH because if it wasn't i would tell you to put your cellphone away."" UM, okay mom? I am 27 years old, I worked hard and wanted to have a calm enjoyable experience. I order a lemon water, comes with no lemon. Next, we place our orders and I always get the same (turkey club with a side salad). My salad comes and I was turned off right away when I saw how oily it was, and my boyfriend also saw it drenched in oil and told me not to even eat it. I let that go, and decided to eat my turkey club. Now this is when I start to lose my shit. I notice there is a lot of mayo and barely any turkey and since its a triple decker sandwich i decided to remove the middle of. I discover its the bottom of the bread. I didn't even know restaurants did that and then felt insulted because for the kitchen staff to even put that in my meal and think I would never notice had me thinking what else did they do? So at this point, my boyfriend calls the waitress over who gets the manager, Chris. Chris looks at the sandwich which I didnt even take a bite of, and looks down and says ""Oh thats weird"" then continues to tell me how he is going to yell at the kitchen staff...okay what is that going to do for me? I wind up taking a few bites of my boyfriends sandwich and leaving him my credit card, because we're a modern couple and why not. I go to leave because I was disgusted with the meal while my boyfriend paid. $70 dollars later, i realize that we were charged for my awful meal that wasn't even touched. Over it and this place."
Jay D.,"West Hempstead, NY",0,6,10,5.0,2/19/2015,Such a beautiful place to go to dinner! The wait sucks but it's worth it. The staff is very friendly and the food is always amazing ! One of my favorite places
Lenna P.,"Manhattan, NY",215,222,15,4.0,5/3/2012,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory for the FIRST time today. Yeah, I'm serious. I always assumed the food would be like shitty Applebees, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I glanced over the ""skinnylicious menu"" but I decided to pass on the healthy options. *WARNING!!! AVOID LOOKING AT THE CALORIE COUNT* Do you want to give yourself a heart attack? No, I think not. Have somebody else read you the menu options. Just dont do it to yourself.  I ordered the blackened chicken sandwich which was MIND BLOWING! FATTENING! DELICIOUS! Spicy Mayonnaise=crack. Our lovely waiter suggested this and I am so happy I ordered it. My cousin ordered the Navajo sandwich which was also very good.  We went around 1:00pm on a Thursday afternoon, so we didn't have to deal with a long wait.  I'll definitely be back."
Shelby K.,"Ithaca, NY",0,12,1,5.0,1/6/2016,Server Robert B. was super friendly and attentive. I've gotten used to mediocre service at chain restaurants and his really surprised me and gave me a great experience tonight!
Susanna Y.,"New York, NY",47,38,30,2.0,3/31/2012,"Not the first time for me at this Cheesecake Factory but my experience today really sucked.  My boyfriend and I got in at 4:20pm and was seated in 5minutes which was great. We decided on the food and ordered at 4:30pm but the food did not come until 5:10pm.  Just to rub it in our faces, the manager came to the table next to us (who was seated right after we were) and apologized about the food taking so long and offered them free salad, soup, and cheesecake. What really struck my nerve was that she went over to them multiple times to make sure everything was going well for them. Was it favoritism? Catering to them because they were older and had a child with them? Probably neither of these, but it's how I felt. :( We ordered a cheesecake to go after dinner and it took over 15 minutes for us to get it. Also noticed on my boyfriends mug of water had someone's lipstick stain. Nothing more gross than noticing this after dinner was finished.  I guess the only good thing that came out of this dinner tonight was that our waiter was excellent and super nice. He's not the one to blame for all the delays and unbalanced treatment that was going around by the manager. The food quality is generally excellent, and the bread you receive before your meal is great. Just this one night of irrational treatment and delays kinda ruined a lot of things for us. I mean... the restaurant wasn't even that busy for a Saturday afternoon/evening as there were several empty tables. Managers and/or those individuals that go around the restaurant insuring quality for all the customers really need to have a keener eye for what's ACTUALLY going on around them without me having to BLATANTLY ask for a manager to complain about stuff. Come on, guys!"
Beau G.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",362,109,350,4.0,7/11/2014,"'Twas my first time to The Cheesecake Factory and I gotta say, the cheesecake is damn good. I had the strawberry cheesecake and it was scrumpdillyicious. My gal had the upside down pineapple cheesecake and I think mine was better than hers, but it was still good. I would have given y'all 5 stars, but paying the bill was as weird as it gets. I went to pay the bill and they said I had to pay the server and me and my gal were stupefied like what are you talking about? Here's the bill, here's a hundred dollar bill. We're standing here. Take the money. Well it was a huge debacle for them and it was quite awkward to say the least."
Nancy O.,"Falls Church, VA",133,255,115,3.0,9/8/2012,"There are 3 things I love about Cheesecake Factory (None of which are cheesecake!) 1) Avocado Egg Rolls - I ordered them the 1st time I came here (like 15 years ago) and each and every time since then.  Creamy avocado and sundried tomatoes in a crispy shell with a delish, sweet tamarind sauce.  Get this and a side and it's a great meal. 2) Linda's Chocolate Fudge Cake - Must be shared!  It's like 1175 calories or something!  It's so chocolatey, gooey, and even better than any of their 100's of cheesecakes. 3) Their menu in general is massive - there's something for everyone.  It's definitely the place to go for a tasty meal because no matter what you order, it's going to be good.  Fattening.  But very good.   Why only 3 stars?  It is a chain.  The wait is usually pretty long.  It's a beautiful restaurant with a view of a parking lot.  Throw this place over by a beach or park, add a party room and somehow make the crowds die down....I'd love it!"
Imir L.,"Freeport, NY",327,46,,3.0,2/3/2012,"Back in college when you took a girl to The Factory (as we had dubbed it) it not only meant you had been saving your weed money to spend here, but the girl had to be awfully special. More then twenty years later I may not consider this to be the first place I'd take my special lady but The Factory is still a fine place to go. Thursday to Sunday nights will find you waiting at least forty five minutes for a table but once you're seated you quickly forget about the long wait because of a very welcoming and professionally polite staff and drinks that do what drinks are supposed to do.  The food is high end for Long Island which isn't to say it's a notch above White Castle but to say in Manhattan this would be a popular place for very good American comfort food. You'll also have to remember that after eating more then you're supposed to since proportions while not quite Texas, are still American, that the top button on your jeans might come under some serous duress.  I'm not big into cake but the rumor is the cheese cake is good enough for the place to be called The Cheesecake Factory. I wouldn't know; I still refer to it as The Factory and the smiles it produces are anything but assembly line."
JP H.,"Rego Park, NY",41,372,1,4.0,2/28/2013,"I have been here a few times and other then the fact that they are always packed to sin I find them to be really good. Their menu is one of the biggest I have ever seen in a restaurant and that is a problem because there is so many good things that we always get stuck trying to figure out what to get.  lol Their cheesecake is def better then average so whenever we are in the area ""We are from Queens"" we stop in. I wish they had some of these type of restaurants closer to us but we don't"
David M.,"Merrick, NY",94,466,346,3.0,10/20/2012,"I've had the opportunity to visit each of the CF locations on Long Island.  Aside from being the the most inconsistent one, this particular location has a number of strikes against it.  After this particular meal, I'm left wondering was it worth it?  Arrival was on the early side, and we were seated pretty quickly downstairs.  Breadbasket arrives with two loafs that were hard as bricks.  Trouble already.  Our waitress seemed more interested in talking with her  co-worker friends then helping us.  It would have been nice to ask me what dressing I would like on my side salad.  Food comes out and I'm genuinely pleased with my meatloaf sandwich.  Wifey is not pleased, none of her special requests were handled correctly. Banana Creme Cheesecake  was shared for dessert, was swimming in whipped cream.  On the way out I noticed countertop next to the host stand, opposite the upstairs bar had a layer of dust on it . Gross!  We just don't have these issues at Huntington or Lake Grove.  This was likely my last visit to this location for the foreseeable future.  I've heard through the grapevine they are actively looking for a relocation site nearby as The Source is close to being completely abandoned due to the property sale."
Brian S.,"Bay Ridge, NY",63,28,2,4.0,7/30/2014,I always enjoy myself at the Cheesecake Factory. Only have 2 issues . 1 is the wait which I know the staff can't control and. 2 is the menu. The menu is huge and it takes me atleast 15 minutes to decide what to eat. I like to always try something new Too many options. Cut menu in half
Santia G.,"Jamaica, NY",0,13,,5.0,12/1/2014,"I had the the herbs salmon with the mash potatoes and asparagus. OMG. it was the most mouth watering and the first taste melted in my mouth. It was heaven. Seriously! If you like/love fish, try the Herbs Salmon. It's worth it!"
Maria S.,"East New York, Brooklyn, NY",3,32,96,5.0,6/30/2014,"coming all the way from brooklyn to the cheesecake factory in long island totally worth it. loved it there, was everything i expected and more"
Chels G.,"Manhattan, NY",77,82,40,4.0,10/25/2012,"I've had a bad experience at cheesecake factory before, so this was my first time in about 8 years. And I'm glad I gave it a try again. Food: 4 stars (delicious!!!) Drinks: 4 stars (just had coffee, soda, water) Waiter: 3 stars (slow) Decor: 3.5 stars (good but average) Dessert: 2 star (upside down.. something. it just wasn't my thing, i guess) Good place to go for a meal with friends."
Charles V.,"Bay Shore, NY",22,135,27,4.0,1/11/2013,"I wish the menu wasn't 50 pages of reading material designed to make you over weight before you even order.  The shepherds pie is my favorite dish here and the calorie count scares the crap out me. I love the gravy and the slightly toasted mashed potato on top. The cheesecake is to die for with too any flavors to chose from, I always order a plain strawberry cheese cake to go.  For those weight conscious people out there, The food I just described is enough calories for 2 days of eating. I should change my pic,,hmmm I think the hard hat will look nice semi tilted on my belly."
Doreen L.,"Queens, NY",1060,860,5443,3.0,1/15/2012,"Cheesecake factory, you are amazingly crowded on a Saturday night.  I guess being in Westbury, and being family friendly makes the families flock in hordes. Oh the horror! Yes, the patrons flooded in like army ants. Angry parents would accost the poor host, demanding to be let in or to speak to manager. Multiple requests would be made to the one man manning the front. Occasionally, the ants would maul one another for attention with the host. For a party of 6, we were quoted an hour and half wait time. Usually in New York, if I am quoted more than an hour of wait time, I would expect the best ramen in New York, or a free show to Shakespeare, but in Westbury, I just hoped for a decent meal. While waiting, we walked around the desolate mall. See my review of the Source:  When the buzzer rang, we were actually seated within the hour.  We also walked by the servers counter and got to view which food looked fresh and smelled delicious. The salads, steak and tacos looked appetizing. The bread basket they brought had fresh slices of rye and white baguettes.  We ordered Boston salad, fish tacos, white chicken chili and two burgers.The fish tacos had lightly fried fish with generous heap of salsa and black beans with rice. You have to eat it fast or the sauce rips a whole in the bottom of the soft taco. The fish tacos and the white chicken chili were surprisingly spicy. The chicken chili was so spicy, we could barely finish it. My hands burned slightly after eating the fish tacos. Interesting.  Out of all the food, the salad tasted the best: crisp lettuce and bacon, sprinkling of blue cheese and home made croutons.  Our waitress was this adorable Korean girl, who joked with our nephew. She was extremely sweet to our multiple requests. We gave her a generous tip.  Great for large groups. Two large parties of 11 were in the restaurant celebrating birthdays.  Very inconvenient restroom- all the way left on the first floor. You have to wade through crowds of people by the bar watching the game and little grannies waiting to get in. Would I come back? Maybe next time I am in the vicinity. But I am not getting the white chicken chili."
LISA N.,"New York, NY",853,381,281,3.0,12/23/2011,"I'm not a big fan of Cheesecake Factory but my sister is in love with this place so I'm obligated to go once a year for her birthday and she picks the farthest one from my house to decide to go to, which is this one. Anyways, the workers are super friendly, every single time I go here I have a nice server.  Also the food comes out the way hot and fast.  The only negative is the bathroom is all the way downstairs, and I've never sat downstairs.  So they already have the most slippery floor and when I wear my heels I am walking like I am on a tightrope! But that's every CF then.  Also the parking lot here gets so packed, ihatechu. But the strawberry cheesecake and tiramisu are still my favorite desserts!!"
