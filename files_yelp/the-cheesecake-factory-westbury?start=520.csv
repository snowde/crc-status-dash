Raymond W.,"Queens, NY",3,76,7,4.0,7/26/2014,great food. great cheesecakes. great service. ordered the chicken bellagio-it was very delicious. don't order from lunch menu though! portions are not as worth it.
Kevon G.,"Rosedale, NY",30,52,20,4.0,3/27/2012,"Great ambiance and variety of food. Some what of an upscale Resturant for any occasion. I've been here plenty of times for lunch, dinner, birthdays, graduations any type of celebration. Great appetizers. Fried calamari and avocado spring rolls are a must have. Entrees are usually heaping portions of made to order food. Love the pasta dishes has well. And of course the best dish for last...dessert. Wide variety and seasonal variety of cheesecakes and cakes. I love the carrot cake and pineapple cheesecake. Only con the wait time on the weekend is sometimes long and a pain. But overall great chain Resturant."
Stephanie S.,"Westbury, NY",3,8,,5.0,10/31/2015,Everyone knows the Cheesecake Factory is great but what is even better is that they now have VEGAN options including the most amazing Vegan Cobb Salad. Yay!
Brianna K.,"Brooklyn, NY",199,236,314,5.0,3/25/2014,I threw my dad a birthday party here. Rented out half of the floor on the 2nd floor. The servers were on point. The food is amazing.  Huge plates!!! I always come out here with my family. I love this place. Thanks for doing my dad birthday party right
Christian B.,"Freeport, NY",170,212,97,3.0,7/11/2012,"Can't believe I've forgotten to write a review on this place.  Over the years since it has opened I've come here. I've tried many of their dishes. I was here just the other night with a friend. Jumped on yelp to update a review I thought I had written previously (I fail) lol...We ordered Avocado Egg Rolls, Chicken Madeira, Fresh Grilled Salmon, Fresh Strawberry Shortcake, Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake, and of course their famous bread. Oh that bread, I like the brown pumpernickel bread. I'm not a huge fan of the sourdough one. You can't just have 1 piece of it. The Avocado Egg Rolls were YummY. (Avocado is known as a super food, FYI) with the sauce that came with it. I prefer having the Chicken Marsala dish over the Chicken Madeira. The sauce on the Chicken Madeira was great. Although I'm sure you would be happy with either of those 2 chicken dishes. Their Shepherd's Pie is also really good. My friend enjoyed the Salmon dish. The mash potatoes that came with both dishes were really good but wow so heavy. To drink we decided water with a lemon was good enough. The sweet drinks here are way too sweet and I personally just didn't feel like drinking any alcohol so... Before I used to get their strawberry lemonade drink. Its non-alcoholic but yeah that hit the spot. My friend said the Cheesecake was really good. My Strawberry Shortcake was OK, I enjoyed the ice cream that came with it. I've had better. The downside to this place is their food is just all SO RICH. Forget about calorie counting here. If you are actually counting calories this is not the place you should be at all. Sure it tastes good but now I""m probably going to spend the next 2 weeks picking up my cardio at the gym just to burn off what I ate here recently. The decor is nice. The food is just so Rich. Their portion sizes are pretty big. Oh, I also really enjoy their salads too (didn't wanna forget that). This is worth visiting at least once. I'm sure you'll return again. This is a place I personally may only come once or twice a year at most and that's only if a friend really wanted to go here. Just because the food was again SO RICH lol..."
K K.,"BAYSIDE HILLS, NY",3,26,20,4.0,9/2/2014,"In reference to the curbside pick up order - when we got home I noticed that the food was not the same quantity you get in house.  I ordered a chicken caesar salad and it usually comes with at least 2 thin grilled chicken breasts where this one was one small one  (""where's the chicken?"") - which I thought may have been a mistake till we opened the Chicken and biscuits and found one breast instead of two.  It felt like we were scammed, especially since this place is well known for ridiculously large portion sizes.  CF should only be dine in and for that it is still 4 stars, the staff handles the large amount of diners well and I am not reducing my stars - but beware the curbside take out!  Same price WAY LESS!"
Amy B.,"Murrieta, CA",49,38,30,5.0,11/12/2012,"I absolutely LOVE this place. Besides having the most awesome cheesecake in the world. their food is incredible! The wait is not bad.. on occasion it can be 30-45mins or so, but they seat pretty quick. On a rare occasion the service can be so-so, but the food never disappoints! My favorite thing on the menu is the Sweet corn tamale cakes... it is 3 pattys of sweet corn with chopped avocado, drizzled sour cream, and a drizzled spice sauce. Also the Mac n cheese balls are great! They are so tasty. When we come here we get appetizers so we can save room for 1 of their 32 some odd cheesecakes! I would recommend this place to everyone! Run here!"
Natalie E.,"Queens Village, NY",171,193,3,4.0,11/12/2013,Always a fan of this wonder chain restaurant. Portions are large enough for seconds and even 3rd meals. Prices are decent and always fresh and new options added to the menu. One thing that bothers me is dinner time and weekends are crazy!!!! The wait is always an hour and so ridiculous but that's why you should go for lunch or on an off day ! :)
Vana W.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,44,14,5.0,8/30/2014,Was there yesterday afternoon for lunch at it was AWESOME! Service was quick and friendly. Had the Fish Tacos (yum) and hubby had a mac n cheese burger (he said yum too). portions are HUGE! Couldn't finish it. We shared a strawberry shortcake that was enough for 4! Really great also.
Wolf G.,"Delray Beach, FL",272,228,185,4.0,12/28/2014,"After going here with my friend last week for dinner, I could certainly say that based on my experience, The Cheesecake Factory is one of the better chain restaurants I have been to due to the high food quality, good value, and great service. We arrived here for dinner at 8:00PM, where we were greeted by a friendly hostess on the second floor of the restaurant who took our names and promised to have us seated in a booth. Ten minutes later, we were seated in one of the back rooms in a window facing the inside of The Source Mall, which was very comfortable. In addition, I found the decor to be somewhat upscale, with bright yellow colors on the walls and somewhat dim lighting. We then met our waiter, whose name I do not recall, but I remember he was tall and skinny with a goatee. We both felt that he was friendly, fast, and on point, not unlike my experiences with other servers at The Cheesecake Factory. After ordering beverages and perusing the textbook sized menu, with its many dishes as well as caloric land mines, I decided to order the Tuscan Chicken with a substitution of Mashed Potatoes for Farro due to my gluten allergies off of the Skinnylicious Menu while my friend ordered the Sandwich, Soup, and Salad Combo, which included a Turkey Sandwich, a Caesar Salad, and Corn Chowder. We received our food not much later and I enjoyed my Tuscan Chicken, which had two generously sized pieces of tender and juicy grilled chicken breasts drizzled in a sauce of pleasantly acidic yet sweet balsamic vinegar, a bite of basil, well-cooked and nutty asparagus, ripe and juicy tomatoes, and fluffy mashed potatoes. While I did not try my friends food, he enjoyed all of the components of his meal and I thought that his dishes looked well presented. As we were eating, we also received excellent service from Carlos, who cleared our dishes efficiently and with a smile. Since I still had a little stomach space and wanted dessert, I decided to order a bowl of Chocolate Ice Cream with whipped cream, as I am allergic to the eggs and wheat found in their other desserts, like their Cheesecake. I found the ice cream, which was a healthy portion of about three scoops, to be delicious as it had sweet and robust chocolate flavor with a creamy and cool texture. I also enjoyed the freshly made whipped cream, which was fluffy, creamy, and not overly sweet like commercially processed whipped cream. While this meal was not quite inexpensive, at a about a little bit over $40 for everything, I thought that the price was reasonable due to the high quality of the food and large portion sizes. Overall, I feel that The Cheesecake Factory is one of the better chain restaurants I have been to and I would definitely return again!"
Cory P.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",25,21,8,4.0,7/27/2014,Yes.  This is a chain.  But no that does not mean the food will be bad. The Cheesecake factory is a great example of a of relative quality food for a chain. Also buffalo blasts are just plain awesome.
Nena M.,"Westbury, NY",1,33,3,5.0,2/15/2015,"I have visited this location for years, on occasions. And always think of this place every time, we have a special occasion. The last time I came here was on November, a Saturday pre thanksgiving. This place was a mad house people couldn't fit here, me and my party had to actually stand on the sides of the stairs, because it was so crowded. We didn't want to wait out side. Since they gave us a beeper and when I asked the host he said it wouldn't work outside of the restaurant. Plus it was freezing. We had about an hour wait. Our sever, which like always I can't remember their name, because I'm always excited and talking. I was wowed by our waiter, even though it was super busy and he probably had 5 tables at the time. He introduced himself and took our drink and appetizer orders. He talked in such a professional and clear manner. We were a party of 6, he took all of orders and we didn't even needed to repeat ourselves!!! He read them back and I was happy. My mom had the gumbo, even thought my mom doesn't even have the idea of what gumbo is and it's extremely picky, loved it !! Everyone loved their food and finished it all. Great service from our waiter, got out refills and checked on us frequently. Also congratulations to the cook, most people never recognize the work of the people working behind."
Julia K.,"Manhattan, NY",229,241,,3.0,5/11/2014,"I got the nachos. Which, I love. I love nachos. They were huge and super heavy. There was no way I was ever going to finish them, but I did enjoy them immensely."
Joe S.,"Bronx, NY",4,61,19,2.0,3/4/2012,"Overrated. Over crowded.  Wait times for a table for 2 plus on the weekends are usually more than 1 1/2 hours.  The menu is almost too much to handle. The food portions are ample, so appetizers are really excessive.   The best is the free bread they bring, especially the dark warm bread. It is really too big, too much food, and too long of a wait for a table.  The food is just average, nothing to write home about.   But the deserts, are a different story.  Wow.  Red velvet cheesecake.  Simply sinful."
Erica P.,"Bronx, NY",10,8,2,4.0,3/18/2012,"This is my second time visiting the Cheesecake Factory and i have to admit i am a bit hooked. My friend took me a week ago and it was my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory. I just thought that they only made cheesecake. Boy was i mistaken.  I am in love with their ""Ritz Martini"" which contains champagne, triple sec, courvoisier and pomegranate juice. Can you say ""DELICIOUS""!!!!? My friend introduced me to the ""Louisiana Chicken pasta meal"", which contains Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms. I also ordered the ""New Orleans Shrimp"" which is shrimp with some tasty sauce, peppers, mushrooms and white/brown rice. I do wish there was more shrimp as for some reason restaurants are always stingy with shrimps. I also ordered two cherry cheese cakes to go and the server forgot to charge me or place them in my carryout bag. He was overall a great server as he did not need to write down our order and was very friendly, but i guess not writing down the order hindered him from not remembering my order in full. I called the restaurant when i arrived home, about this as the cheesecakes i ordered were not in my carryout bag, and i wanted to ensure i was not billed for  the ""mystery"" cheesecakes. Luckily i was not, however the manager (Keith) was concerned that i did not receive my cheesecakes and has now offered two slices of cheesecake for free. I just have to go within the next two days. Now how to do that with public transportation i will have to figure out later. Overall, i love the atmosphere. The waiting time was 20 minutes around 7pm, which was not bad at all. The waiting area, though was a bit chaotic and claustrophobic for me, but it could have been much worse. The staff was very personable and very efficient. I am definitely going back more than once if i can get a ride."
Haze P.,"JAMAICA, NY",32,55,23,4.0,8/16/2012,"I come to the Cheesecake factory almost twice a month. The only thing that I keep going back for is the cheesecakes. They have a great variety of cheesecakes and every time I go I end up bringing at least 3 other cakes home. My favorite is their 30th Anniversary Cake, which is layers of chocolate and cheesecake. Their Oreo cheesecake is also good, second favorite.  But let me just say the only reason why I give this restaurant a 4 star is due to their cheesecake. Everything else is not that special. Out of all the times I've been there, my food was never great. It usually is merely okay. Atmosphere is nice, but since it's such a big place, it's actually quite noisy. Plus if you're here on the weekends, I would say minimum wait time is about 2 hours.  Since I'm not wow by their food. Now I usually eat somewhere else and come for their cheesecake afterwards.  Just a side note, I heard Grand Lux Cafe is connected to them. And their food is MUCH BETTER. Even though they don't have the same dessert menu but it's worth a try if you're a little sick of Cheesecake factory's food. Their chocolate molten cake is awesome!"
J K.,"New York, NY",145,296,43,4.0,11/7/2011,"for a chain its not so bad! The wait can be long on weekends but so is every other restaurant on this strip. You just have to time to go 30 minutes or so before you want to eat, or go before 6 pm. I used to come here once in a while after shopping with the bf, its the perfect place to go when you cant decide what you are in the mood for- they have a little bit of everything and CHEESECAKE- hello always in the mood for that. ----However--- I stopped coming here once it was required for restaurants to post calorie and nutrition info on their menus. You can not get anything here that is less than 1000 calories, plus you can not go here and NOT get cheesecake who does that? and the cheesecakes are over 1000 calories! I'm no calorie snob but no one in their right mind should be able in good conscious sit there and eat 3000 calories. You must be insane!  Anyway this past weekend we said fudge it lets be fat and when we got the menus I was happy to see a new ""skinnylicious"" menu. DUMB NAME, but happy its here. And they had alot of options that were tempting in comparison to other chains that offer a ""lighter"" menu. Burgers, tacos, steaks, seafood etc all on the skinny menu. I chose the white bean chili with brown rice (less than 500 calories) and topped it off with key lime cheesecake a la mode because my ass isn't big enough. we had a great time, ofcourse my bf did not choose an entree off the ""skinnylicious"" menu but no matter what he eats he remains a 32 waist. Service is always  friendly, and the prices are decent."
Sean W.,"Garden City, NY",30,30,5,4.0,6/8/2014,This is the place where we have a birthday party with friends and wanna gain weight! Honestly Cheesecake Factory is amazing considering its pros and cons. I always want to try cheesecake there after my entree but never succeed. :( cuz you get stuffed before you try the dessert! Definitely will hang out with friends here if we have enough money to waste. :)
Russ D.,"St. James, NY",4,26,14,3.0,12/7/2013,Good Food - but they rake ya with prices higher than diner on everything...(which overcharges ya in the first place) --- Long wait ...depends on day & time...like fri/sat nites...
Wheel L.,"New York, NY",47,199,17,2.0,2/17/2014,"A 30 minute wait turned into an hour. The service was pretty bad. Water came 10 minutes after sitting down and we had to wait some more to order. I also made the mistake of going off course from my usual burger selection to try the rib eye steak. It was over seasoned, I asked for it to be medium and it was well done the first time around. The manager came by to apologize. Cool beans. The second time around was over seasoned again, and the entree just wasnt worth $25. My mistake for choosing steak at the cheesecake factory. The cheesecake was delish, of course. My waiter only began to come by more often towards the end when we were getting to leave. He also grabbed the signed credit card slip while we were still sitting. That was a first."
