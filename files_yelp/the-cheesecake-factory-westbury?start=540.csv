Sonja K.,"JAMAICA, NY",0,51,,4.0,5/15/2013,Best cheesecake ever! Whenever I go shopping at Roosevelt Field Mall I make a point of going to the Cheesecake Factory. I always order the Tex Mex eggrolls. They're delicious. I usually order the caesar salad with chicken. I can never finish it. The portions at Cheesecake Factory are huge! I always take the rest home to save room for dessert. My favorite type of cheesecake out of the many flavors is the vanilla bean cheesecake. With a dollop of whip cream it is mmmm mmmm good. I will go back!
Linda C.,"Brooklyn, NY",57,111,102,5.0,3/30/2015,"While i was visiting a friend in Long Island, I knew I had to try out the Cheesecake Factory! It was a weeknight and the place was still packed inside. However the food and dessert was definitely worth the 40 minute wait. Once we were seated we waited to be served delicious rolls of bread and butter while we ordered out entrees. I had the shrimp bistro and my friend had a fried macaroni and cheese in a ball which was surprisingly good! The portions are huge here! Then we shared a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake which was literally heaven in your mouth. It was the best slice of cheesecake I have ever had. There was at least 20 different flavors of cheesecake for you to choose from. Being an indecisive person is hard enough when all the choices sound so delicious but there is literally no more room in my stomach to squeeze in two slices of cake. I would love to come back for more cheesecake and dinners here"
Jay C.,"Lawrence, MA",61,10,2,2.0,2/16/2014,The service here is horrible 30 min. Waiting for a cheesecake. One poor guy doing all the work and a hole bunch of other idiots just standing around. GREAT!! Oh yeah and they have an attitude problem!!
Jessica C.,"Great Neck, NY",54,13,,5.0,9/5/2015,"The menu is fantastic - has everything you could ever want and the place is great. The cheesecakes are on another level, but that's expected of course. One of my favorite places."
Audrey K.,"New York, NY",286,376,559,3.0,5/5/2010,"Cheesecakes are HUGE, as is the food!  Anything you order whether it's a salad, burger, pasta dish or just an appetizer - it will be huge. The food is really good - if you know what you are ordering.  I don't think this place is fool proof, in that you can close your eyes and order and will be satisfied.. But if you know what's good (for your taste) you will find yourself craving it over and over! (For me - the shrimp and bacon club - this is the only time I actually LOVE the bacon, and also the thai lettuce wraps - which is an appetizer but more than sufficient for a meal.) Cheesecakes are impossible to finish - even for 2 people!"
Sheena K.,"ARVERNE, NY",4,14,,5.0,8/17/2014,"God help me when I dine here not to go over my calories, but the food is just heavenly omg!!!. The service here is great, ambiances is lovely, entrée portions is generous and the food is just yummy. This is my absolute favorite chain restaurant. The only down fall is my husband and i have 6 kids so it always takes awhile for us to be seated, but then again it's also understandable."
S R.,"Forest Hills, NY",0,28,,5.0,8/16/2014,"Love love the food, service, ambiance....my fav restaurant! Date night, kids night, every night lol!"
Sandycandy 1.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,54,72,3.0,8/26/2012,I still haven't tried the cheese cake..by the time I finish Mt meal I have boo room for dessert.but the food is ok
Edwin B.,"Hempstead, NY",6,4,1,1.0,6/25/2014,"I have been to this place twice, this place is all about fancy..they try so hard to be fancy but the food its not that great, I would't invest a penny in this place once again..totally not what you would expect."
Victoria M.,"Queens, NY",2,50,9,3.0,5/24/2015,"always loud and crowded but its exactly what i expect- the cheesecakes are awesome, tons of new flavors; also tons of food options (even healthier, lighter options, with calories posted on the menu)"
Katrina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",50,94,23,4.0,10/2/2011,"I don't really know what happened to the cheese cake factory but I will say I think they really fell off... My entree was just alright Wait: not bad less than 30 minutes, table for 5 I decided to get shepherds pie... It was so so Highlights... Strawberry lemonade is TO DIE FOR  Appetizer sweet corn cakes...Good enough for me to make it my last meal god it's delicious!!!!"
Mishae M.,"Newark, NJ",20,60,141,3.0,4/16/2012,"First off i start by saying, the restaurants absolute specialty will be their cheesecakes, you cannot go wrong with them, any cheesecake i have had from the factory has always been magnificent. However, the food is just not that good. The first time i had their food was a plate brought home to me by a relative who had went and ended up having a lot of food leftover, it was a angel hair pasta dish that tasted like an 11yr olds first try at making an Italian dish. Literally oily pasta, barely seasoned chicken and tomatoes with a bit of Parmesan cheese, was the meal. So my expectations were set pretty low when i finally had my first date with the restaurant. I have to say i was blown away by the ambiance, the architecture of the building is truly breathtaking and it has a very calming atmosphere. Once again though, the food was a total fail. My mother has ordered a penne pasta meal that was absolutely horrid. No seasoning whats so ever, it was if the chefs think that merely pouring olive oil over a pasta dish will bring out the taste.FAIL! I had a Margarita pizza which contained no sauce, thought the pizza was at least decent. We both had a glass of zinfandels wine which was excellent but had no reflection on the restaurant because it wasn't as if it was a house brew and ended with a cheesecake which of course did not disappoint. My advice is eat dinner before going there and then end the night with dessert."
Shameena P.,"Fort Worth, TX",48,21,132,5.0,6/16/2009,"We Always go here for any birthday's or special occasion when we cannot come up with a good spot to eat!

They have really  really good service, which is hard to find in ny!  P.S: DON'T WEAR HEELS, AND HAVE A FEW DRINK AT THE CHEESECAKE FACT...THE FLOOR GETS EVEN MORE SLIPPERY THAN IT ALREADY IS:) jk"
Alina M.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,17,61,4.0,9/20/2013,"Love this place! The Decor is spectacular the ambiance is great the servers, if I must say so myself, are gorgeous lol ... very friendly staff and no matter how busy it gets I've never waited longer the 30min for a table. The service is fast and they are very up to par with everything. The food is very good, always hot and drinks are always cold :) ... I live in Brooklyn and I travel to Long island specifically for THIS CHEESECAKE FACTORY for a reason! Lol .... I usually get the Eggrolls as an appetizer which are great! Has a little kick to it but not too spicy where its unbearable. For my entree I usually get Teriyaki Chicken (Without the bone) and substitute the rice for a side of Mashed Potatoes which is mouth watering! And a bottle of Pinot Grigio or White Zifendel to wash it all down. Dessert is also very good, I'm stuck on the Godiva Sundae .... I love chocolate so if u do too I'd highly recommend this! .... Prices are decent but keep in mind the portions served are pretty large so its all worth it! :)"
Alex Y.,"Little Neck, NY",17,9,6,3.0,7/31/2011,"Been here a few times, as well as other Cheesecake Factories around the US and you gotta love a good default for when you have no idea what you want to eat. I don't remember where i heard this, but the best private chefs are usually the ones who have cheesecake factory under their belt. Why, do you ask? Because they learn to cook just about everything.  At first glance the menu is quite comprehensive and overwhelming . It's good if you're not sure what to eat, as it offers tons of choices, but it's also bad because ordering can be a chore. I do have a few things that i have come to consistently like from this place: (be advised, the portions are pretty big so don't go nuts, or you'll never get to dessert) -Avocado Eggrolls- Yes, i do see the irony of a china man suggesting eggrolls, but they're actually pretty good. Love how the eggrolls mix with the tamarind dipping sauce. - Buffalo Blasts- Essentially, buffalo wings with out the pesky bones -Chicken Madeira - Chicken is moist and usually done right, the Madeira sauce is part sweet, part savory, which goes well with the chicken and the mashed potatoes that comes along with it. Must try for newbies to the chain. -Cajun Jambalaya Pasta- This is also a good choice for those who want pasta with a bit of a kick to it. The chicken and shrimp are relatively tender, but the pasta varies. I've had it where it was relatively al dente, and other times the pasta sticks to each other and seems a bit over done. -Dessert-? a lot of creative cheesecakes concoctions to choose from.  All and all this place is a great default if you're in the mood for something, but can quite figure out what. There is usually a wait on the weekends, so take that into consideration if you're starving. The decor is nice, very spacious, but the floors can be a bit slipper and the lights a bit too dim at times to read the menus. The reason this gets a 3 and not a 4 is because, the menus are a bit too much at times to find something quick. the food is good, and there are some stand outs, but nothing really hits you as wow, and the waits can be quite long. Otherwise, this place is definitely worth a try. =)"
Urva S.,"Hewlett, NY",24,28,6,4.0,4/17/2014,"Almost always packed but service is great. The food is always good. Their cheesecakes are to die for the red velvet and the oreo. The meals are all so good and filling, they come in large portions so make sure you come with an empty stomach. The service is great regardless of how busy it gets at the restaurant, always attentive and helpful."
Ava H.,"Brooklyn, NY",147,357,101,4.0,8/13/2011,"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, but I'll make a sacrifice for the Factory.  The appetizers are entree sized, and entrees are big enough to feed a family of four....so at the end of the day, is the Cheesecake Factory ever bad?   Since there are a million things on the menu to choose from, I always have to try my hand at something different (but I gotta have my strawberry lemonade).  The waiter I had was the best, just spewing out different things to choose from.  He mentioned that the menu is being revamped and they are introducing a new ""Skinny-Licious"" line and of course, one of the specials was BBQ chicken with corn succotash.  I freaking loved this dish!  The chicken was juicy as juicy gets and the BBQ sauce was nice and spicy that I even requested more.  The only downfall was the meat to veggie ratio should have been more evened out.   Even though I'm not a fan of cheesecake, the food is consistent, the service is fast and efficient, and the drinks are supersized.  Looks like a win-win sitch."
Priscilla R.,"Uniondale, NY",19,184,537,5.0,12/24/2013,"Amazing night party of two. Shared Nachos with spicy chicken and Baja chicken taco for snack or appetizers while sipping some speciality drinks. During which we decided to  have more options from the menu. Order:  Avocado Rolls ., Four cheese pasta. Dessert took home: Red Velvet & Strawberry Short Cake., and Eggplant Sandwich."
lillian p.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,57,20,4.0,1/17/2014,Great location in a mall and surrounded by malls so you can shop and eat. Prices are very reasinable and the portions are big. Good for cheapskates and groups.
Daebin Y.,"Long Island City, NY",28,81,,5.0,7/24/2011,"This place is always good.  Went early on Sunday before 6 and it was only a 10 min wait, but stared to get crowded after we walked in.  Had my 2 favorites: Chicken Madera and Jambalaya Pasta. Never been disappointed with either dish.  And we also ordered the Louisana Chicken Pasta. The pasta and the sauce was good, but the Chicken was too thin and crispy and not enough chicken. But the flavor was still good.  Been to CheeseCake Factory like 50 times in 5 different states and actually ordered a CheeseCake once. And we had it as an appetizer because we knew we'd be too full to order it for dessert. Maybe i should get one togo next time."
