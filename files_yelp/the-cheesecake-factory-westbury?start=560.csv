Vinny C.,"Howard Beach, NY",9,37,28,1.0,3/1/2012,"Grilled eggplant sandwich. Way too much eggplant on the bun. I couldnt even hold it.  They used Japanese eggplants which are really long and sometime chewy. The fat wide eggplants would be I much better choice, if they wanna make it work. Vietnamese tacos, cool idea...bad tasting. Snickers cheesecake..one bite and done. One spoonful has enough sugar to kill 30 diabetics. Too sweet for me...and the snickers overpowered the cheesecake.  Cheesecake factory gets one star because the food wasn't good, menu is 30 pages too long. I don't feel like reading a novel before i have to order a dish.   and they care more about the VEGASesque decor than the food."
Stephy S.,"NY, NY",5,35,11,4.0,3/25/2011,"My friends love this place. I am not totally crazy about this place. It is always packed on the weekends. Lost count of the number of times i have been here but here is a list of what's recommended or not. ***Recommended** Pasta  1) Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic 2) Cajun Jambalaya Pasta- flavorful and a little spicy Appetizer 1) Guacamole Made-To-Order  Cheesecakes ( too many varieties, can't finish trying all of them!!) 1) Godiva® Chocolate Cheesecake 2) White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake- a little too sweet but very good -Give it a pass- Small dishes 1) Fresh Baked Pizzettes (SAUSAGE AND RICOTTA)- too dry 2)Crispy fried cheese Steak 1) Hibachi Steak - Its a cheesecake factory, i don't know why i decided to try this. They are not a good steak place."
Nini C.,"Westbury, NY",0,23,,5.0,6/2/2014,"This is the place you go to have fun , eat well and have delicious drinks. The waiter was handsome , helpful and super friendly."
Ali J.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,101,1,3.0,1/24/2015,This is the spot to go when staying in on Long Island been here over 100 times in my life since I was a kid. I like the nachos the shrimp with angel hair the teriyaki chicken the Baja chicken tacos. Star taken off for changing the Oreo cheesecake I don't know why they would do that. I loved the old one now the new one has a lot of frosting. Another star off for I know the food tastes good but I know the quality is just US foods.
Amy C.,"Bronx, NY",1,45,99,3.0,2/16/2014,"The food was great, dessert is always good. But our waiter Leonardo M, was the worst, slow and unattentive. Worst we ever had"
Raisul I.,"JAMAICA, NY",25,23,41,5.0,3/15/2014,"I have tried almost everything on the menu. NONE was disappointing! ! I love this place.  I rarely give any place 5 stars,  but I would give this place 10 if the scale allowed.  Must try items are: santa fe salad, bang bang chicken,  spicy chipotle chicken pasta and kobe Barger."
Michelle R.,"KEW GARDEN HL, NY",132,217,17,4.0,6/19/2013,"I don't really understand why there are people who don't like ""The Cheesecake Factory"". All of the food there is delicious for a chain restaurant. The biggest complaint is the wait but once I'm seated the service has always been great. The portions are huge, but whenever I have asked the waiters to cut a slice of cheesecake in half to share with someone they have had no problem doing so. I like just coming in for a slice and have been satisfied with every one I have ordered except maybe the Kahula. If you wanna cut the price and portions down, just share things. This is a great place for dessert."
Allysa P.,"South Ozone Park, NY",213,231,121,4.0,8/15/2011,"Cheesecakeeee! I never understood why I had to wait long for a table and then when I'm walking to my table to get seated I see a bunch of empty tables.  I've been here about 3 times and although they have lots of different items on the menu, I always get the same thing. The jamaican black pepper shrimp. Its sooo good.  The cheesecake here is good but its soooo sweet, I think you can share one piece with 4 people because if you have more than 3 bites, you'll immediately have diabetes. Yummy though."
Heather B.,"Baldwin, NY",35,25,,5.0,10/12/2014,"My hubby and I eat here about 1x a year and was never disappointed! The prices are a bit high, thus why we only eat here 1x year. My go to dish is the parmesan herb incrusted salmon and once in awhile, I'll try something new. Overall, two thumbs up!"
P H.,"River Edge, NJ",48,22,,3.0,4/14/2013,"I don't understand the ridiculous amount of time people are willing to wait to eat here. The food is decent, but nothing amazing. The lines during prime hours are unbearable."
Joe E.,"Floral Park, NY",2,49,3,4.0,8/13/2013,"Why oh why did Cheesecake Factory take the blackened chicken sandwich off of the menu!!  I swear, when dipped in their amazing honey mustard, I swear it just tasted like summer. Like fresh outdoor mesquite barbecue goodness.  Maybe it's a psyche that will lead me to morbid obesity, but once in a while on those dreary cold winter days, I would come to Cheesecake Factory to remember ""summer"".  Maybe we're both crazy, but my girlfriend feels the same way about this sandwich, which was so thoughtlessly discarded from the menu.  Thankfully, the last two times I've been there the friendly bartender was able to put a special order in and deliver us plates that satisfied our bizarre addiction."
Dee C.,"Long Island, NY",784,109,1013,4.0,12/12/2010,My favorite place for Brunch!   I love the Lemon Pancakes and side of Bacon!   Wow it is so good!!
Neek N.,"JAMAICA, NY",0,18,15,4.0,7/27/2013,Cannot go wrong with this place. The steak Diane and salmon always a great combination. The mash potatoes are slamming!
Paige H.,"Mineola, NY",2,8,,5.0,3/23/2014,"Went late on a Saturday night and it was PACKED!  We were sat quickly, and our waiter was an absolute doll.  Prompt and courteous, despite juggling several tables that all seemed overly-demanding.  The restaurant manager delivered our first app, in order to apologize for our 2nd app being delayed - super nice. The only thing that was sort of off-putting was the busboys - they all seemed REALLY aggravated for some reason.  The busboy that was re-setting the table directly next to us was throwing the plates and utensils on the table, and another busboy was setting a table (not far from us) and was muttering under his breath.  Obviously someone running the show really got to these guys.  The bartender also seemed kind of cranky, but I would chalk that up to being super overwhelmed by the weekend crowd. All in all, it was a great dining experience - I'm not really a fan of chain restaurants, but this one is a-ok in my book."
Boris G.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,6,,4.0,3/22/2014,Cheesecake Factory is the only one that could compete with Juniors Cheesecakes. The food and drinks are good but the waiting time for a table is crazy. FYI-The southwestern rolls are the best choice for an appetizer.
Kay G.,"JAMAICA, NY",18,97,164,3.0,10/14/2013,"Overpriced and greasy. They should stick to cheesecake. Ive been here a few times, cant figure out why its always packed."
Elaine C.,"New York, NY",401,338,955,3.0,11/2/2013,"Waited half an hour to be seated on what seems to be a really busy day. They seemed fairly organized for such a high volume, food was okay and the cheesecake was good. All in all everything went fine and the food was good but nothing extraordinary."
Take T.,"New York, NY",0,49,1,5.0,6/4/2014,"Okay, I am going to give you what YOU want to know. What are some GREAT things to order??? Here they are . . . Appetizers: 1.) Fried mac and cheese, 2.) Thai lettuce wraps. and best of all . . . 3.) sweet corn tamale cakes YUM YUM. The following entrees were Excellent: 1.) Hibachi Steak and 2.) Chicken Madeira. Also VERY good was the 3.) Southern fried Catfish. If you order these, you will not be disappointed.  Our server's name was Jasmine D. She was great and is responsible for having given us most of these great suggestions. Ask for her to be your server!!  They have great huge booths to sit at and you don't have to worry if your toddler starts acting up as it is very noisy, so you won't get embarrassed."
Arthur L.,"Queens, NY",11,42,1,3.0,1/13/2014,Pasta da Vinci and Louisiana chicken pasta. I recommend the latter. Actually I always get that when I go and I am never disappointed. It's bowtie pasta and chicken cutlet. In terms of the cheesecake I recommend getting fresh banana cream. I have tried almost all of them and they are usually too sweet. This has the perfect balance.
Paul M.,"Garden City Park, NY",12,10,1,4.0,3/8/2014,"Ok...after a long wait,  Megan saved us!!! Her intervention helped get us to our table. Thank you, Megan.The skinny menu offerings are great! Got a margarita with low calories, full flavor. The goat cheese and beet appetizer rocked! And the pear and endive salad with grilled chicken was very tasty. Half came home with me. And my companion's entree, Jamaican black pepper chicken and shrimp  made his head sweat with delight!!! So, all in all, a good experience. Also, thanks to Jacqueline!! Next time, gonna try cheesecake."
