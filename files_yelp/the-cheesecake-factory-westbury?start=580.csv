Nika R.,"JAMAICA, NY",16,54,4,5.0,11/23/2013,"Our waitress Suzie MADE Our visit. She was funny, attentive & welcome we felt right at home! For Appetizers we had.... 1.calamari which was delicious but we could've had better dipping sauces than the typical cocktail & tartar. 2.Spinach dip- everything was fresh and house made even the chips..Entrees I had steak (it was a little overdone) & sweet potato fries (yummy!) He had Jamaican Jerk Shrimp which he devoured. Even though we were full We couldn't come & not have cheesecake so we got pineapple upside down cheesecake, red velvet cheesecake & dulce de leche cheesecake to go.. Oh yea all of the serving sizes were HUGE & the drinks were good I left with a buzz after 2 lol!!"
Laura M.,"Patchogue, NY",233,154,119,3.0,2/1/2011,"If you want to go from insanely hungry to insanely full, this is your place.  The food at The Cheesecake Factory is always HUGE and delicious and the desserts (cheesecakes, mostly) are from-another-planet good. The selection on the menu is gigantic: pastas, salads, burgers, etc, and it seems like there genuinely isn't a bad item. However, it's not even feasible to come here on a weekend. I used to do the big 1-2 hour wait for a table (1-2 hours! Really!) but I just don't have it in me anymore. It wouldn't be so bad if there was a PLACE to wait, but you just have to stand awkwardly in the doorway and eh, it's just not ever worth the hassle for me. I'm definitely always up for going on a weekday though!"
Dave N.,"Great Neck, NY",79,290,,5.0,8/21/2011,"By far my favorite restaurant chain. A lot of people think the Cheesecake Factory is overrated, but is in fact delicious. I have never had a bad meal here. Their burgers are out of this world (I've had 4 of them and all have been great) as well as their fish tacos and orange chicken.  I'm normally not a cheesecake fan, but there's is the exception to the rule. I can't get enough of the Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple cheesecake.  There is a wait usually for dinner time, but for lunch (weekdays and weekends) usually doesn't take long at all to get a table. Prices aren't that bad and the service is usually great. Plus, considering there are a ton of menu options, you can try something new each time you go."
Megan H.,"Long Island, NY",65,90,91,5.0,8/26/2013,"The decor is very cool, the food is just delicious, and the prices are affordable. AND THE CHEESECAKE, oh, the cheesecake. I wish I could swim in it (or something like that). All that aside, this review is specifically for their fantastic wait staff. I've been here a few times now and every single time, I have been exceptionally pleased with the servers and the rest of the staff. There is someone who greets at a desk near the door and directs you where to go (I've only ever eaten upstairs). The hostesses are quick and friendly, and the servers are so very friendly and accommodating. The last few times I've eaten here, I have had Calo (Calogero) and Jose. Both of them made me feel like a friend during my entire meal, even though it was quite busy. They returned frequently to check our needs and were quick to refill drinks and bring extra condiments. I could tell from their other tables each time as well, that everyone felt well taken care of by Calo and Jose. I live between two Cheesecake Factory locations and will make this my primary go-to because the excellent service pushes it over the top.  Also, I didn't have to wait here for a table for two during dinner hours, which was awesome."
Frank M.,"Carle Place, NY",24,42,10,3.0,12/13/2014,"i would give 3.5 stars if I could - for what the pace is it's A-OK+ - service is usually pretty good - place is crowded but kid-friendly and mostly efficient - prices are kind of on the high side but they don't skimp on portions and considering that portions run on the big side I think food quality and presentation is good -  kale salad with dressing, grapes and nuts is very tasty"
Sara S.,"Bellaire, Queens, NY",32,17,7,5.0,3/31/2013,All the cheesecakes are delicious but the tiramisu cheesecake is one of the best!! Salads are awesome and very fresh. You will have to wait to get a table but it is worth it!
Dan S.,"Oceanside, NY",18,5,,4.0,1/28/2011,"I went on a Thursday afternoon with my baby mama, which is probably best due to the usual wait that accompanies this place.  All the seating was upstairs.  The service was great and the menu is probably too extensive but that is hardly a negative.  I wouldn't get appetizers simply because the portions are enormous for everything from drinks to desserts. Keep in mind the highlight of this place is the desserts even if you don't have a poster of cheesecake in your room, don't worry you don't have to be a big fan of cheesecake because most of the cheesecakes are mixes of regular cake, caramel, fudge, peanut butter, etc. and are deliciouso."
Jaimee A.,"Manhattan, NY",2205,1524,639,3.0,6/5/2011,"This place is so not worth the calories. The food tastes good and with all the fat and calories in it, it should! The portions are huge. The cheesecakes are very tasty and the chicken and biscuits are my favorite but it is sooo fattening! You can't get a break with their salads either. The food is tasty but I would avoid it because of the fat and calorie content."
John M.,"New York, NY",0,3,,5.0,3/30/2014,"Came here on a Sunday night, great food and drinks, the dessert was beyond amazing.  We'll be back soon!"
Franco C.,"Oyster Bay, NY",829,2232,20,3.0,10/14/2008,"Cheesy Chain... Ok, I hate to admit it but I've been here.  This is a perennial crowd favorite for a variety of reasons. Firstly the portions are pretty big - apparently the Cheesecake folks are part of the ongoing battle of the bulge - and they are on the winning team.   If, after the appetizers and mains you still have room, there are always the various cheesecakes to add the finishing touch to your arteries. The food is tasty enough, but the place is always mobbed and it is not unusual to see people standing out front waiting to get seated. I try to avoid the place as I am not a big fan of crowds. Parking lot in front."
Tracy K.,"Syosset, NY",5000,784,1537,3.0,11/19/2008,**    salads **** mixed drinks ***  pastas  (bolognese was good) ***  service **** vibe/ambiance - upbeat cool place to go
Evie P.,"Ridgewood, NY",26,49,,5.0,8/24/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory should be renamed to CheeseCake Heaven.  I am a coffee lover so I truly love the Coffee Kahlua and the Tiramisu Cheesecakes.  All of their other cheesecakes are good too.  The touch of whipped cream against a smooth creamy cheesecake can make anyone's day.   As far as the food, I always thought it was too heavy especially since we all go for the Cheesecake.  Lucky for me this weekend, they had a Skinnylicious menu which shows lower calorie meals that are just as filling as the ones on their regular menu without the exaggeration. Great place, I love the chain and will keep coming back!"
Larry L.,"Queens, NY",0,28,,2.0,2/4/2015,"We came here about a month ago and didn't have to wait at all. We ordered the fried calamari, spicy crispy chicken sandwich and I can't remember what else. The food was far too greasy and nothing special. The waiter was very friendly. Come here early as this place fills up fast."
Lon G.,"Huntington, NY",192,342,46,5.0,7/9/2013,"Faves: Chicken Madeira, Chicken Bellagio, Jambalaya Pasta. This place is great every time!!"
Dave P.,"North Fort Myers, FL",335,163,116,4.0,8/4/2013,"I'm not a cheesecake eater........so I'm leaving that part out of the review. I've had their cheesecake and it's pretty awesome....... but I go there mostly for the food meals. I like the ultra varied menu.  I can pretty much get any cuisine I want there.  Sometimes I may get a huge asian salad.  Sometimes a turkey burger.........sometimes the miso salmon (my favorite). I've never had a bad meal here.  The worst part is the wait on weekends.  If you can deal with that, you won't be let down!"
Debbie J.,"Manhasset, NY",0,133,,3.0,2/28/2016,"want a 2000 calorie salad, this is the place for you!  easy to have 5 days worth of calories in one meal!"
R V.,"Levittown, NY",0,10,,1.0,3/13/2015,"Good food. Severely bad service. Sat at the bar for 20 minutes and the bartender didn't even say hello. Finally got someone's attention and asked for water and never got it. When the bartender came over didn't even greet us, said "" what you havin!"" Hes busy I understand but you don't have to pay for bad service. Will never sit at the bar ever again. Guy had no service adequate."
Tim L.,"Long Island City, New York, NY",106,1112,125,3.0,11/23/2008,"This chain restaurant is one of the ones that gets you coming back for their large portions, decent prices and that damned cheesecake. They have an assortment of style so, sometimes when you're craving something just a little different than NY style it pays to drop by. Floors here for some odd reason are super slippery. During my visit I saw not only myself and other patrons nearly eat it on their floors, but also some of the wait staff. There are plenty of servers and they have designated areas it seems so when it comes down to being taken care of there is always someone around. This one is fairly large and the pager they give you when you're waiting for a table seemed to work just fine when I was browsing books in the B&N next door."
Vincenzo D.,"New York, NY",0,16,,3.0,3/8/2014,"The service is not that great, the waitor was  a nice guy but it took him 20 minutes to bring our drinks out and another 35 minutes to bring out the food. We shouldn't have to wait so long to get what we ordered, also the quality of the food does not justify the decor of the restaurant. It has definetly declined in the last few years. I'm am sorry to say, I won't be coming back here."
Michele W.,"Queens Village, Queens, NY",43,39,,3.0,10/18/2010,"It seems that 2 out of  the 3 entries I have so far are about a restaurant with the word FACTORY in it. I'm gonna have to analyze that one later.   The Cheesecake Factory is always a fun restaurant to go to, whether its to catch up with an old friend, which I did tonight, or hanging out with a few buddies and being silly.  The waitstaff is always pleasant, and in fact, my waitress hiccuped her way through our order.  It was endearing.  It is a chain, so if you dont have one in your town, let me tell you about it. These restaurants are usually HUGE and the one in Westbury, NY is located in a mall. It gets very crowded during peak hours, and the wait can be up to, or more than, an hour.   It's a bit overpriced, but its mostly worth it.  The Asian-type foods are not great.... for that you'll have to go to Chinatown or Flushing for a taste of some authentic foods.  But the American foods, like the burgers, and even the Italian foods are pretty good (though i'm sure the real Italians would differ from my statement).  I usually get the pasta.  Even the bread they serve before the dinner is good.  If you decide to go here, expect to gain a few pounds, because the food is rich and the portions are big.   And the cheesecake?  you HAVE to save room for the cheesecake.  Sometimes, i go here just to grab a cheesecake with a friend.  Actually, I never liked cheesecake (horror!) until i came to this restaurant.   All in all, a good experience if you've never had it.  It's A-OK in my book!"
