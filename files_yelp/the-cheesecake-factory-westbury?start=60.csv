Dornell S.,"Elmont, NY",70,10,10,4.0,11/5/2017,They need to bring back the crab cakes !! The crab bites are too small but over all westbury has the best Cheesecake Factory in NYC
Jolene S.,"Cambridge, MA",75,383,2,4.0,11/28/2016,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory many, many times (for lunch and dinner and late late dinner with the family or in a large group). The food is consistently good. I have to remember how indulgent the Factory Hot Chocolate is and I really like the chicken piccata at lunch. I order that dish a lot at Bertucci's but I prefer The Cheesecake Factory version. Lots of food -- this place is a value and has the big ostentatious dining hall. Also there is a huge parking lot and it's close to all The Roosevelt Field shopping -- though I come from home just to eat here. Destination dining..."
Scott C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,7,5,3.0,8/24/2017,"Service - 1/1 Star The waiter that we had was very friendly and quick to assist with any issues we had. My girlfriend's order was incorrect the first time, the dish was completely wrong, and our waiter was kind enough to quickly apologize and retrieve the correct order. Maybe due to some unfortunate mishap in the kitchen or a lack of kitchen staff, the second time the dish came around, it was still lacking. The second dish was correct in order, but incorrect in ingredients and prep. I'm not sure if the chief was simply just out of it or wasn't feeling well, but the second dish was sadly prepared. Again we requested the help of our waiter to resolve this issue. Our waiter was a bit frustrated that my girlfriend's meal came our unsatisfactory again, so the waiter quickly called the manager over instead of refuting it with us. The manager noticed that the dish was incorrectly prepared and corrected it. The third time was the charm and the dish was perfect. Pricing and Quantity - 2/2 Stars The price of everything on the menu is expected of a medium class establishment and the portion size of everything is fantastic. The price you pay is definitely worth the amount of food you'll receive. Word of advice for those who are not big eaters: make sure you're hungry before you get the The Cheesecake Factory, or you'll be too full to enjoy your meal. Quality - 0/2 Stars Everything on the menu was mediocre, nothing pops up at you and makes you say WOW! While I was at the establishment I ordered a Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich with a side of French Fries for my choice of sides, the Bistro Shrimp Pasta, and Shimp Scampi with Steak Diane. NOTHING. I mean NOTHING out of that order was anything special. Literally my favorite item listed by me just now would be the french fries.... YES, you heard me, the fries... The chicken sandwich was literally the biggest piece of deep fried chicken cutlet I've ever had. If I wasn't a 6'1"" big guy, there's no way I'd be able to fit the chicken into my mouth, but I'm not commenting on the size of why it's inadequate, but the fact that it lacked any sense of taste other than crispy exterior with a slight hint of heat. The Shrimp Scampi with Steak Diane was just as bad, they had 4 pieces of cut steak with 5 pieces of shrimp and 2 pounds of mashed potatoes.... WHAT AM I SUPPOSE TO EAT THAT WITH? As for the Bistro Shrimp pasta, I didn't even want to taste it after they got the order wrong twice. Total Stars - 3/5 I would definitely not recommend this establishment for personal pleasure. If you wish to simply ""experience"" The Cheesecake Factory, by all means, stop by. Do not expect a memorable dining experience other than mediocrity and terribly small bathrooms. They are a 5500 sq.ft. establishment with only ONE set of bathrooms, male and female on the first floor. Needless to say that the sink is by the door, if you aren't careful you'll be hit in the back with the door while you're attempting to wash your hands in their small ass sink. The men's bathroom contains two stalls and two urinals with one sink, while the female bathroom consists of three stalls and two sinks.... sounds like a fun experience. Best of luck to all that wishes to visit this Cheesecake Factory, but this will be the first and last time I visit this one.  P.S. I love The Cheesecake Factory. Especially the one in Pleasanton, California. They have wonderful service and food there."
XueYing X.,"Queens, NY",204,78,83,4.0,7/7/2017,When we first arrive we got seated right away. Our server was Kiwi & she was so friendly. She always made sure everything was okay. The menu was a bit overwhelming because there were a lot of options. I wish they provided pictures in the menu. They serve bread & butter while you're waiting for your food. We shared a shrimp scampi & fried calamari. It was really good. The shrimp scampi was creamy and the fried calamari was easy to chew. I gave it 4 stars because it was really cold. I feel like they blasted the ac to the max. I was literally shivering & almost wanted to leave before we even looked at the menu.
Howard H.,"Flushing, NY",111,594,859,3.0,12/8/2016,"I've been here numerous times over many years.  It is in short, a gigantic caloriefest and does not pretend to be anything but that.  If you're looking to watch your waistline, this isn't the place for you (c'mon the name has to give it away). This location is always insanely packed.  Waits are easily 30 mins minimum no matter what time you come.  That being said, its got a large eclectic menu, service is OK (especially for a chain and a busy one at that) and its got the largest selection of desserts one can find.  My personal favorites are the Jamaican jerk chicken and shrimp and the chicken madeira.  Food here is decent but nothing to get excited about.   Of course the cheesecake here is pretty great but beware, one slice is almost the entire caloric allowance for an adult.  Bring the stretchy pants if you're coming here."
Nan Qi Y.,"Queens, NY",30,120,53,4.0,12/11/2016,"Though the wait could be long on weekends, my boyfriend and I always leave happy and full.  The dishes are very consistent as we order the Louisiana pasta/ chicken and mushroom pasta every time. Service is always spot on, bread basket and drinks are never empty.  I'd skip the avocado/mushroom French fries appetizer they have though. Not worth the $6 or $8"
Andy O.,"Bellmore, NY",92,23,2,4.0,5/14/2017,"Well, decided on The Cheesecake factory for mother's day. As always the wait is the worst but decided to sit at the bar and had the best service I have had in a long time. We had drinks right away along with appetizers quickly and our lunch served hot."
Susie B.,"Panama City, FL",194,52,40,3.0,6/12/2017,The hostess was super grumpy and barely looked up when she put us on the list. Our server was Nicole and she was great. Attentive when she needed to be. Food was pretty good. My mom's steak was cooked very well. The cheesecake is always on point. Thank you Nicole for a good dining experience. We thought the hostess was probably pissed that she had to train someone.
jean d.,"New York, NY",0,52,,2.0,5/7/2017,"Been here couple of times. Average American dining, bland food. Decent under paid staff"
Sabrina B.,"RICHMOND HILL, NY",75,14,,5.0,6/10/2017,"I LOVE Cheesecake Factory! I'm not even kidding. I can really go here every day and not get tired. This is my go to place when plans for dinner at other restaurants fail. You guys gotta have their fried mac & cheese appetizer! IT'S BANGIN'! So - being that I always order the same thing over and over again LOL, their spicy chicken chipotle pasta and cajun jambalaya chicken and shrimp pasta never disappoints (again, based off my experience). I also love that the waiters are always really nice and professional. Great customer service is a plus! P.S: I shall try the entire menu someday!"
Shannen C.,"Floral Park, NY",131,10,8,4.0,10/26/2017,"I've been to this location many times and each has been great and memorable in its own way. Food, service, atmosphere are great. The tables may be close together but that's any restaurant who is trying to get their guests sat as fast a possible. Food may take a bit of time but that's expected if one orders a steak or anything other than something thrown into a fryer. Drinks look/taste amazing. Get either the frozen peach Bellini or the Georgia Peach. Best server I've ever had there( he's waited on me and my family about 4 times) name was Hector F. Not sure if he is still there, but he's gives amazing service and always has a smile. I'm a manger or a restaurant so let me say that isn't always easy to have- a smile. But this Sunday I'm bringing my husband who is from Ireland and never ate a Cheesecake Factory. I'm sure he'll love it!"
Scott B.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,10,,4.0,12/13/2017,Always a sold chain restaurant.  Huge menu so plenty of choices for everyone.  Wait times can be long during peak times.
Douglas C.,"Middletown, NY",117,40,60,4.0,9/11/2016,"Cheesecake Factory never fails to disappoint.  Came here for a quick delicious lunch, I was greeted properly and all of the waitstaff were friendly and energetic. The Cheesecake Factory has a great menu with many options to choose from.  I settled on the Shepards Pie which is always a favorite of mine. The ground beef covered in gravy and mixed with veggies from zucchini, peas, carrots and onions all compliment each other while the creamy mashed potatoes tops it off. The flavors were savory and delicious where the portions were large enough to have another meal for dinner. The complimentary bread was used to wipe all the delicious gravy from the bottom of the plate. I wish I had more room for one of their many fantastic cheesecakes. Maybe next time...  I'm only giving this 4 stars because while using the men's restroom I saw a bug crawling around the sink. I understand it happens but still doesn't stop me from enjoying the food."
Amira M.,"Manhattan, NY",37,53,18,5.0,7/3/2017,"Love love love this place!!!! I love their sangria, it is just the way I like. Sweet and with little alcohol lol. We ordered lots of food the other day and I got to try a bite from each plate. The staff was very professional as well. This is my 2nd time coming to Cheesecake Factory. The first time was in Syracuse. I would come here again."
J A.,"Elmont, NY",87,109,,3.0,6/4/2017,"To me, Cheesecake Factory's food genuinely tastes good, and the cheesecake is delectable and heavenly. Since I surfeited on an appetizer and my main course during my last visit, I had to pass on dessert; the portions here are gargantuan. My palate has a proclivity for the heaps of Mexican-inspired dishes, such as the Factory Nachos and the tortillas stuffed with chicken. The little corn fritters that come with the meal are a delightful surprise. Recently, I ordered two Long Island iced teas, and they were far too watery. After two iced teas from Whitman's Paumanok, one would expect to feel at least a sliver of warmth, but I did not. Also, this particular Cheesecake has been filled with crowded, frenzied chaos for as long as I can remember . . . which is all the way back to around the turn of the century. The downstairs space is underused and often closed for seating; the bathroom is on a separate floor from the main dining area; booming voices soar from floor to ceiling. In other words, it's perpetual pandemonium, but I'll continue to return sporadically since, again, I like the food; also, service here is well-paced, and the servers themselves are friendly."
Colton C.,"Shrewsbury, MA",167,154,51,5.0,4/21/2017,"Probably one of the best medium-rare burgers I've ever eaten. The chef here knows how to cook!! I ordered the Smokehouse BBQ burger with fries and my fiancé ordered the chipotle chicken pasta thing. Both dishes were SO good. Also our server was very nice and attentive so that was a bonus :) not the cheapest restaurant, but it is DELICIOUS!"
Casey R.,"Springfield Gardens, Queens, NY",4,42,165,4.0,11/26/2016,Fantastic cheesecake. The only downfall is that there's always a wait time.  The food is good. The drinks are just as good. You always know exactly what ur getting. I've been coming here for so many years that it's lost it panache.  Did I mention the cheesecakes are fantastic.
Kandice L.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,10,4,2.0,9/17/2017,"I been to most Cheesecake Factory restaurant in NJ and love there food and services but my experience at this location wasn't great at all. I call for reservations and they said they can't take reservations for more than 6 people. So I asked abt how long is the wait for 10, she said abt an hour. We have party of 10 which long wait was expected. We waited about 1.5 hours. The buzzer we got was defected and didn't notice our table was ready until I saw a missed call on my phone abt 5 min ago. I ran to the hostess immediately and ask for my table, there was a line to get to the hostess, by the time I got to speak to the hostess, she told me to go upstairs where they serve bigger party. We all went upstairs and they told me that gave my table away because they couldn't reach me.  We complaint that the buzzer and he said he called me few time. So, it's my fault with defected buzzer and I missed the call.  He told me that I will have to wait abt another 25min and will do what they can.  we're very upset but there is nothing we can do. It 8:30pm and I'm with two toddler, 3 elder and my uncle family of 4 that was waiting to have bday dinner here. So we waited for almost another 40min, finally got seated downstairs. I didn't even bother asking when the 25min is up because I know it will just upset more when they giving me bullshi** answer.  The two  is for our waitress, she was great, very considerate and always came with smile. The food was ok, steak was overcooked (we ordered for medium rare but texture was tough, more like medium well)."
May L.,"Brooklyn, NY",290,7,21,4.0,8/20/2016,"When I walked in, I thought there was no line and a bunch of seats seemed open. But, there was a sign to proceed up stairs and bam, there was so many people but luckily, there was no wait. I was seated immediately. Off the bat, you can tell the atmosphere of cheesecake was a cozy environment but a bit noisy with the chattering, plates clanking and kitchen cooking.  The menu had a great number of selections. My friend and I choose to stick with pasta, the Louisiana Chicken and Spicy Chipotle Chicken. We both got the lunch size, and felt it was already a huge dish. We can't imagine how big the regular portions are.  The Spicy Chipotle Chicken, I would definitly recommend to get again. It was flavorful, not too spicy; the chicken and pasta tasted great. The Lousiana Chicken was the opposite. Too heavy with the grease and oil, I only tasted the bitter wine. The chicken was tasty and very crunchy, which ended up being the best part of a pasta dish. I understand why it might be the most calorie filled dish on the menu now.  Overall, Cheesecake was a good casual place to dine in for a nice filling meal. You just have to read the menu and choose the right dish."
Chris D.,"East Bronx, NY",14,43,73,3.0,6/13/2017,"I am so disappointed! We were at Roosevelt Field Mall and went to the Cheesecake Factory in Garden City specifically for the new coffee & cream cold brew cheesecake, which sounds so delicious and which we believed was being offered nationwide based on advertising seen on Facebook and the Cheesecake Factory website. Unfortunately the staff there had not even heard of the new cheesecake, and were not serving it :( What a waste of a trip. Otherwise we usually love CF and we eat there (not at this location) all the time and find the food to be tasty, fresh, and plentiful."
