Megan L.,"Elmhurst, NY",41,262,311,4.0,6/30/2013,"I often frequent this location. Although it is called the ""Cheesecake Factory,"" I am usually way to full to have any dessert. I am a big fan of the salads, particularly the Santa Fe. The portions are HUGE, so I can usually share an order with my boyfriend and we both leave full. I also like the raspberry lemonade. Free refills = yay! Although, there is usually a wait, especially during dinner hours, I don't mind waiting."
Christina C.,"Cambria Heights, NY",1,8,,4.0,4/10/2012,"As ""cheesy"" as this may sound I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory. I've had a strong affection for the The Cheesecake Factory since College; when I was first introduced. I even enjoy the The Cheesecake factory as an impromptu date with my Husband.  The unlimited strawberry lemonade is the best. I order refill after refill after refill......... If it's unlimited I'm going to the LIMIT!  I especially like the Shrimp Scampi. I like the bread the loud atmosphere everything. They also have great personalized pizza for children.  I'm comfortable with saying that if I was to die by lethal injection tomorrow my last meal could be the Shrimp Scampi from The Cheesecake Factory..."
Tina C.,"Queens, NY",1865,3972,9081,4.0,7/13/2008,"The down side is you'll be waiting for a table for approx. 2 hours even if you have a small party.  However, it's worth the wait as the menu gives lots of options.  Save room for cheese cake!   There are lots of choices for cheesecakes."
Dee F.,"Plainview, NY",0,49,7,4.0,8/27/2013,The reason why i only give it four stars is because when me and my boyfriend came here it was 9 o'clock around. They sat us downstairs which we were fine with. Then the waitress proceeded to politely rush us because the kitchen was going to close... i thought you closed at midnight? Then we learned the DOWNSTAIRS closes early..... why sit us downstairs if we are  going to be rushed? poor judgement of the hostess in my opinion... The decor and the food was delicious and is definitely enough to share. However everything on the menu looks so good its hard to choose. I got the vegitable burger which was delicious and my boyfriend got the chicken and biscuits which was very good as well! We also got the mac and cheese balls as an appetizer which were more cheese less macaroni which were served very decoratively.Would definitely go back again!
Eric S.,"Westbury, NY",3,11,,2.0,12/19/2012,Nothing spectacular. Dinner at any weekend night and most weekday nights is at least a 20 minutes wait. Food is nothing special also.
David G.,"New York, NY",15,71,1,4.0,11/28/2012,"i eat out... alot.  so ive finally decided to be one of those demanding customers as im tired of spending 100bucks and not getting great service or the table i want etc.   so, i go to high end places, chains, diners and dives (if theyre great)... houstons and cpk are my favorite chains but i like the atmosphere at cheesecake too and the value (typically i have enough leftovers for another meal the next day).   went to this CF again a week or so ago.  i really dont want to get anyone in trouble so im gonna leave out the really bad specific details, but lets just say our first server was so annoying and unprofessional (talking about their personal life, without solicitation, even touched my friend at one point).... that we left.  well, we left their section, went back to the host stand and asked for a table, specifically requesting the opposite side of the restaurant.  i go out to eat to escape and feel like im on a mini vacation, not to be brought back down to reality due to crappy service etc.  new table...... night and day.  our server Ivana was effecient, friendly (in a professional way), cheerful, well spoken, informed, etc etc etc. A+  i.e. great server. thank you!  i have to also mention 'Paul'(?), the waiter at the next table to ours was also phenomenal, i was shocked by how good he was, hearing him interact with those guests was very very impressive. just amazing.  I hope he is recognized by mgmt.   and of course the famous busser, i have seen him there a few times, im sure mgmt knows how good that guy is, the guy who methodically and rapidly re sets tables and scans the room, what an asset.   on another small negative, the bussers in our section seemed half asleep, repeatedly walking by empty glasses and plates on our table, to the point i had to ask one of them to please take them away when he was about to wander past us again for the 5th time."
Beth L.,"Bellmore, NY",278,556,475,4.0,1/2/2013,"hey,,,,guess what???? THERE IS ALWAYS A WAIT!!! that being said i seriously doubt anyone has a gun to your head forcing you to eat here. you don't like to wait,,,burger king has a drive thru. Its one of the last remaining stores still operating in the joke of a mall The Source. Yes the menu is HUGE,,,,they do a variety of cuisine's,,,some work some don't. Im a big fan of the Roadside sliders and the corn fritters. I like when my server engages me in conversation and doesn't just look at me like a dollar sign. Again you don't enjoy friendly waiters,,,,go to a diner. The managers are all professional and the staff are as well. I also like getting my money's worth. the portions here are huge so i like being able to share a dish wish someone and not spend a paycheck on a pasta dish that would leave a toddler hungry. Don't even get me started on the desserts here,,,,that place is responsible for my current love of yoga pants and i don't do yoga. The limoncello cream torte is my fav and you really can't find any of the cheesecakes that aren't amazing. Don't buy into the negative nancy's on here that seem to enjoy complaining about every petty thing and go,,,get a pager,,,,bring a book, kindle, Ipad whatever it takes and get ready to chow down."
'Rilla D.,"New York, NY",4,30,,5.0,1/18/2011,"Honestly anyone who's been here before & still complains about the wait is crazy. Yeah, there's usually ALWAYS a wait. Especially since the downstairs is rarely open anymore. But everyone knows that. Anyone who comes here & complains about how large the portions are or how many calories are in the meals is also crazy. If you're concerned about that, you probably shouldn't be going to a place called The Cheesecake Factory. Just sayin'... The cheesecake is insane. Of course it is, that's what they're known for. But it's not just that, the fried macaroni & cheese, taquitos, corn fritters & nachos are insane. The salads are HUGE. Every meal me or anyone I know has ever had has been perfect. The waiters & waitresses for the most part are friendly, helpful, attentive and awesome (most of them taking even large orders without writing them down...how do they do that?!). Never had a bad meal, mistaken order or anything missing. Last time I came here was before Christmas and they ran out of Peppermint Bark cheesecake and I am so sad about it, I almost took away a star. Seriously."
Billy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,370,3,5.0,1/6/2011,"I have to give CF 5 stars here for the simple fact I needed to be in and out in an hour to catch True Grit at UA Westbury and they did so with some minutes to spare. Dining alone, I kind of felt like Peter from Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but the staff was very friendly and the hostess even stayed at my table a bit to chat. Plus, dining alone gives you the option of eating whatever you want without someone judging you and if they are judging me because of all the food I got, my resolution is to be a fat American and live up to my stereotype. I went with the sweet corn tamale cakes which are always a great appetizer and can serve as meal. I chose to follow up with The Navajo Sandwich which is a chicken, lettuce, tomato, onion, and spicy mayo creation on warm fry bread. I haven't been able to find a sandwich like this anywhere else and it's an awesome, healthier option for those who are counting calories. Speaking of, CF started listing calories on the menu for items and also offers a healthy menu supplement, which probably goes against the clientele because people are going to a place called CHEESECAKE FACTORY!"
Lolly G.,"Long Island, NY",0,47,11,2.0,9/25/2013,"Party of 10 on a Monday at 7pm. Typical chain restaurant food, with a little pizzaz (they try I guess)!  Not my kind of place, glad we were done by 8:15p."
TJ W.,"Long Island City, NY",6,151,1,3.0,5/9/2011,"Went to cheesecake factory around 5pm on a Friday and had to wait about 15 minutes. I've heard stories of people waiting 3 hours to eat here, which I can't really understand. Upon opening the menu I saw an ad featuring Keith Hernandez advertising a cash for gold service...that's nice, but I was trying to find the appetizers. We setlled on the avocado spring rolls which were very good. For an entree we had the miso glazed salmon which was also very good and a chicken and shrimp pasta dish that was average at best. Now, I know this place is known for its desserts but both the pineapple and reese's cheesecakes tasted like they just came out of the freezer. Almost like a high quality sara lee cheesecake that grandma takes out the last minute when she wasn't expecting company. Very average.  $72 for the two of us...would I come back here again? Sure, but I wouldn't wait three hours for it."
Tarra R.,"Pismo Beach, CA",123,68,2,4.0,11/16/2014,The veggie burger was recommended and I concur it was far better than any other I've tried.
Andrei T.,"ASTORIA, NY",23,18,14,4.0,11/17/2013,"Good parking , great service and big food portions . Great place for a casual night out and not that expensive . Great desserts as well .If you never tried it yet its a must ! Enjoy !!"
Lee M.,"New York, NY",49,270,5,3.0,10/18/2010,"I suppose I have been going to my share of chain restaurants recently.  Came here on a Saturday evening after a movie - around 10:15pm, and it's amazing how crowded this place still is.  What's even more unbelievable are the amount of small children that are brought here for dinner after 11pm?!?   Now that the caloric contents of each item on the menu is posted, it makes dining here virtually impossible.  I can't in good conscience put down the bistro shrimp pasta for north of 2800 calories.  Even something that you think would be healthy, like the miso salmon has 1700 calories.  As such, I ordered the herb crusted salmon salad and my wife had the vietnamese summer rolls, two of the few options below 1000 calories on the menu.  I believe the salmon was poached - it's served cold.  Either way, it was cooked nicely, and came with asparagus, endive and mixed greens.  Overall, I was pretty happy.  As for the summer rolls, they're pretty decent too.  I do have a tough time looking past the cilantro but there are nice pieces of shrimp in there.    We shared a piece of the carrot cake cheesecake, which was fantastic.  Rich cream cheese icing, cheesecake and carrot cake all in one - you can't go wrong.  All in, with tax and tip, the bill was around $50."
Erik V.,"ASTORIA, NY",8,10,2,3.0,9/5/2011,Chicken Bellagio - 5 stars Wait time - usually a long wait around dinner time everyone working here is great (so far)
Kay C.,"New York, NY",2,56,2,5.0,10/14/2012,"Thai Lettuce Wraps is my favorite of the favorites. Highly recommended to folks who are on diet. You can fully enjoy the delicious food while not concerning about consuming too much calories.  Kahlua® Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake, OMG! I surrendered. It is soooo good. Forget about the sugar, forget about the excess calories, I couldn't help digging in. I almost wanted to eat it up mouthful. lol"
Patrick K.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,8,3,4.0,10/20/2013,The food was fantastic.the main dish was great ..the potato soup was great.. the apple streudel cheese cake with ice cream on the side was awesome..I just had to wait over 40 minutes to eat. .would have given five stars if not for that. .
Grayson C.,"Woodbridge, VA",18,11,1,4.0,1/16/2012,"Seriously, I have been coming here for a few years.  In particular, this one time I was on a date and it was I admit a little crowded.  Our wait in the waiting area proved to be the most taxing of our time here.  Upon finally being seated, everything else from that point on was glorious!  The food was exceptional.  The drinks were, without question, on point. The desserts  I find myself here whenever I visit home (NYC). The lack of the five star is that it is a family driven spot with many families visiting.  Intimacy is best when visiting this place later in the evening."
Shannon P.,"Whitestone, Queens, NY",24,32,8,4.0,9/27/2010,"I decided to update my previous review by giving this place 4 stars.  Why? Well, simply because everytime I go here the food is consistently good. I've yet to have a bad experience. It's still a bit pricey, but nothing one can't manage."
Peter R.,"Merrick, NY",10,73,,4.0,4/29/2011,Do what I do - order dessert first!! My favorite - carrot cheescake.   Although the chocolate raspberry truffle and snickers bar cakes are very close behind. Favorite dish - Thai Chicken pasta.     Runner up:  Teriyaki Chicken Go early - this place has the worst lines you've ever seen.   You'll know why after you have your dessert.
