A R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,49,,3.0,12/23/2013,"This place is great if you go during off peak hours. Consistent food, lots of variety, pleasant decor. However, if you show up during dinnerime, forget it. You will wait and wait and wait in an area of the restaurant that isn't very comfortable to wait in. I honestly cannot believe people have nothing better to do than wait 1.5 hours for this place. If I want dinner from this place, its takeout. One of the worst things they do management-wise is decide when to use the downstairs seating area. There is nothing more frustrating than a 45 minute wait and an ENTIRE SECTION of the restuarant is closed. Come on! That's just inexcusable. I want to rate this place higher, but its so crowded its impossible not to factor this into my review of the overall experience."
Frances R.,"Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, NY",7,19,44,4.0,5/25/2013,"nice casual datenight place :) overall nice ambiance, food, and service. Go here!"
Kaylin M.,"East Meadow, NY",54,3,,3.0,7/12/2013,"Service was very spotty. Our server was a little creepy and would disappear for long periods of times. Beware of the appetizer salads, its big enough to feed a family of 4."
Rebecca A.,"Freeport, NY",0,7,,1.0,12/19/2015,"I give this place one star !! Only because I can't give it anything less !! Tonight I went with a group of 16 and they gave us an approximate wait time of 2hours and a half ! We ended up waiting more than 3 hours and they gave everyone tables that came in even a group of about 20 and completely ignored us !! We spoke to the manager and staff several times ,which did nothing for us ! So useless and rude !!! I'm disgusted and offended !!! I even feel they discriminated against us for being Spanish and because most people in my group knew very little English to even say anything or argue back ,so they ignored us and kept pushing us to the side until we had enough and left  ,I will never ever come back to this crap of a restaurant  and will let everyone know how horrible , unethical and unprofessional this place is and the treatment we got by their staff !!!! The biggest waist of time and embarrassment I have ever faced in a restaurant !!! So much for a nice holiday dinner with classmates !!!!!!!! I'm enraged, we would've been treated better at a Burger King or any other fast food restaurant !!!!"

Shawn Shihang W.,"Mountain View, CA",23,6,,5.0,4/20/2013,"We were lucky to wait for only ten minutes before we were seated since we came here at about 5. You simply can not criticize the food here. This restaurant is always crowded, so I would say if you want to have a satisfactory experience, you should come early to have a seat."
Elsie W.,"Queens, NY",407,1587,3258,4.0,3/1/2008,"Even though it's called the ""Cheesecake Factory"", I actually don't care for the cheesecake. You can get better cheesecake for lower prices elsewhere. However, the rest of the stuff is pretty good! Sure, everything is a bit pricey here, but you get free bread for the duration of your visit!  I REALLY like the Fresh Strawberry Shortcake. My absolute favorite there. Whipped cream piled high on anything will make my heart skip a beat anytime.  The pasta is decent, and the Asian appetizers are something to look for! The drinks are pretty too! Expect a long wait at any time."
Nathan H.,"Columbus, OH",11,40,5,4.0,4/17/2013,I went here several times with friends and was not disappointed at all. Everything we ordered was fantastic. The blue cheese burger was awesome. My girlfriend had the fish tacos which were awesome too. The only thing I didn't like was the small beer selection.
Nadya C.,"Bellerose, NY",9,23,,4.0,4/13/2011,"Love this place! Great to stop in for lunch for the array of lunch specials, and dinner is always so great. The meals are huge and the menu is endless with options.  My favorite is the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and another great dish is Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Amazing!  Great drinks included their Raspberry Lemonade and any of their cocktails. Just one tip try not to go there on a Friday or Saturday night because the wait could be up to 3 hours around dinner time."
Sandrine E.,"Queens, NY",87,249,20,4.0,12/13/2012,What's not to love about Cheesecake Factory? Staff are very accommodating. Actually walked in and had no wait! This never happens especially for a Friday night but we were seated immediately my BF & I. We ordered drinks appetizers and burgers as entrees. Drinks were pretty good with the right amount of alcohol. As an appetizer do yourself a favor and yet the corn cake tamales. It's soooo good! My BF & I get it all the time. The burgers were surprisingly good! Very big and flavorful. By the end of our meal we couldn't possibly have any cheesecake. We were wayy too full.
Jolene V.,"KEW GARDEN HL, NY",6,43,3,5.0,2/19/2013,They can't make anything bad I  think! Spicy Jamaican shrimp dish is sooo good! Love their cheesecakes of course. You can tell a lot of research and time went into their menu and the decor is amazing! A little on the pricey side but the portions are on the big side.
Greg G.,"Baldwin, NY",0,7,,2.0,8/13/2012,"I'm only giving two stars because the food was good, but the service was downright terrible.   On a Sunday afternoon, after being seated, a waiter takes our orders for drinks then disappears for twenty minutes until a new waitress is assigned our table and takes our food orders.  So immediately we wasted 20 minutes on nothing.  Then the food arrives and half my order is missing (I ordered the soft tacos which are supposed to come with rice).   My friend orders a sandwich which comes out ten minutes after my other friends had received their food.  So we tell our waitress what happens and the manager comes over and asks me and my friend ""Do you want a slice of cheesecake""  Naturally I thought the cheesecake was free because they asked my friend and I if we wanted it.  So it turns out that I end up paying for the cheesecake after they took off the tacos from the bill. So you may wonder why am I complaining if they took it off the bill? I didn't want cheesecake in the first place, they tricked me into thinking it was free by having the manager come over and say ""Oh we're so sorry would you like a slice of cheesecake to go"" which is completely ridiculous!  Why would a manager offer something to a disappointed customer and then make he or she pay for it!?  I would have rather have just had the tacos taken off the bill and leave it at that instead of being fooled into buying cheesecake that I wasn't even in the mood for just so they could get my money off a slice of cheesecake that costs them nothing to make. Other restaurants that this has happened at usually the manager is CLEAR about what he or she plans on doing to make the customer satisfied.  At cheesecake factory it's just one huge mess. ** I will add that I had come here in the past (about a few months or so) and I enjoyed it both food and service.  Perhaps the place hired new workers since I was there last because this time was a complete mess and waste of time.  I won't be going back for awhile."
Betty B.,"Brooklyn, NY",92,46,1,5.0,1/5/2011,"This place is great! They have a very nice selection of pasta, the four cheese pasta I had was perfect! They are consistently good, every time I come here I have a very nice meal. Also, you can't come here and not try their cheesecake. My only complaint is that there are too many, I can never make up my mind because they all look so good! Last time I tried a new one I never had before, the banana cheesecake. All I can say is WOW, it was amazing! Their other cheesecakes are also equally as good, well at least the ones I've tried (chocolate, pineapple and strawberry).  And yes they are a little expensive, but with the quality being so good, it's worth it. Expect to wait at least 30-45 minutes to be seated as they are always packed at dinner time. I've went here once during the week for lunch, and there was no wait."
Tata N.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,7,,5.0,8/20/2014,Really testy foods appetizers are such a big portions after that u can't even eat sth :)) nachos was so delicious we were 4 and it was absolutely enough  for us. Cheesecake Factory is always a good idea
Heather L.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,81,20,3.0,5/5/2014,"I don't like being told the wait for a party of 5 will be a half hour long and turns into an hour.  We we're very anxious to try the food so we waited.  The service wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either.  Food is pretty good. I do find they are a little heavy handed on the pepper in the kitchen.  Their spicy chipotle chicken pasta was very good, thats if you like spicy.   I think their cheesecakes might be better looking then they taste.  I have gone to The Cheesecake Factory in the past to try cheesecake,  never to sit down, and eat and I find that their cakes are WAY TOO SWEET!!. I feel nauseous after a few bites lol. I stick with my low carb, sugar free, cheesecake with fresh strawberries.  You have to go either during the week when its slow or have the time to stay the wait.  They have a bar downstairs where you can have drinks while you wait.  I would return here but I don't think anytime soon."
Dre D.,"Brooklyn, NY",308,113,2,3.0,3/26/2012,"A lot of people hype this spot up.. I mean.. I do like it.. I enjoyed my meal.. but nothing blew me away.. will I be coming back? absolutely. The food was good, drinks were good. desserts... DESSERTS WERE AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! The desserts get 5 stars."
Rufio R.,"New York, NY",217,134,58,5.0,10/7/2013,If I'm going to get chubby then I'm going to the Cheesecake Factory. Their food portions are huge so plenty of main dishes are enough for 2 people to share. The real gem of the place is unequivocally their cheesecake desserts. Even the pickiest eaters I have gone here with have been unable to deny the powers of their cheesecakes.
Sharnell B.,"SAINT ALBANS, NY",10,16,,5.0,10/2/2013,Love their food.  It's very busy but worth the time. Love their strawberry cheesecake.  Frequent  repeated dining. Don't go like I use to due to the long waits to be seated but always enjoy the food.
Kay B.,"Flushing, NY",39,77,798,4.0,8/16/2012,Love this place but its a long wait...  thats the only thing that keeps me from going back regularly..   I do stop by to buy a cheese cake to bring home.. bears love those
Jovian M.,"OZONE PARK, NY",1,17,,4.0,6/20/2011,"A very nice place to go for a special occasion. They will feed you until you tap out. They definitely have a nice variety of foods, desserts, etc. I need quite a few more visits to try it all. Service was well and the decor is pretty cool. The only downer is that the wait time here can get ridiculous and so can the crowds at times. It's best to put your name in, go shopping for a while and then return if possible. One of my favorite items they serve is their Ceaser Salad- big enough for 3 and very tasty. If you can stand the wait time, you should have a nice night."
