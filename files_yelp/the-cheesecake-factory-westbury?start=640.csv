Sarah S.,"Westbury, NY",0,27,,5.0,11/18/2013,"Where to start?... This place always make me feel happy and comfort. It's near by my house so I can walk to there. I love here most in all restaurants around old country road. Although the food is a little bit over price, I think their design and service is still good. Sometimes I've finished my lunch or dinner, I still want to come here and buy a piece of cheesecake and bring it to home. I love cheesecake by the way! I'd like to order a refill drink, a main course(usually seafood), and a piece of cheesecake for a meal. It may cost $30-$40 in total."
Bianca L.,"Baldwin, NY",18,38,5,3.0,2/18/2010,"It's everything a HUGE commercialized franchise should be. Loud and busy, with a ginormous menu that is enough to stress you out and HUGE portions of gluttonous unhealthy food. Yeah, everything tasted good. Dog poo probably tastes decent when you  batter it, deep fry it twice and then drown the hell out of it in the richest, most decadent sauces. That's pretty much the rundown on your most popular cheesecake items. and boyyyy are they yummy. don't even bother with their lighter fare. the weight management salads? puh lease. they suck. You can get some grilled fish and steamed veg, but if that's what you're looking for drive and extra 5 minutes to legal seafood and get some really good fish. If you came to cheesecake, go big or go home. It sure isn't a fine culinary experience but it's fun. Especially with a group of people and some drinks. their sweet corn tamale cakes and avocado eggrolls are good.  The one thing about this place I will bow down to is their cheesecake menu. Oh sweet heavens. I wouldn't know where to begin as far as making recommendations, and if I started describing them this review would get way too long and may even start sounding pathetic. But i will say, do try their new red velvet cheesecake. They're hyping it bigtime, and it lives up to all the commotion. it's damn good. so is the coconut cream cheesecake. and adams reeses cheesecake. and the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. damn it!"
S Z.,"Syosset, NY",0,1,,1.0,10/30/2013,"Wednesday October 23 was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. We went to the Westbury, Long Island restaurant, one of my previous restaurant favorites. Although the place we were seated had many vacant tables we waited more than 30 minutes just  to place our order! The food was ok. The service was slow .We  then had to wait over 20 minutes to get the waiter to take the credit card so we could pay. Again bear in mind we were surrounded by  several vacant tables so this poor service was not due to "" rush hour"" I finally gave up and went to the""take out ""section  at the restaurant to give my credit card and the woman behind the counter called our waiter over to finally complete the financial transaction.When I sent a message to the Cheesecake Factory Web page I received no response. Is this any way to run a business? I think not."
Sarah A.,"Rego Park, Queens, NY",0,40,4,5.0,9/13/2014,"Amazing Americana burger with fries. Everything was absolute perfection. Friendly waiters, beautiful decor, fast service. No complaints. I absolutely love this place. Wish I could go here every week if it weren't so unhealthy lol."
Katiemarie G.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,17,,3.0,5/14/2011,"I love this place!!! i never ate the food, but i had the cheesecake. It's a little pricey that a slice of cheesecake is $8.00 but it's worth it!!!!  you have too wait forever to get your cake though.  I enjopyed it though."
Kenny B.,"OAKLAND GARDENS, NY",1,6,,5.0,8/8/2013,This place is great went on a tuesday not too busy. Service was great and my waitress was very attentive. Food came promptly with water and bread refills almost immediately as needed. I ordered the 4 cheese pasta. It was creamy though the ricotta was rather strong. For desert i ordered the hershey bar cheesecake i was in heaven two nice pieces of moist chocolate cake on a piece of creamy cheesecake in the middle covered in whipped cream and chocolate chips. Needless to say i plan on being back here very soon.
Sarah C.,"Great Neck, NY",7,10,15,1.0,1/14/2013,"I got food poisoning after I ate here. I got the avocado eggrolls which were good, split a mac and cheese burger, which was ridiculously heavy and tasteless, and the farfalle with chicken and garlic, which was even heavier and more tasteless than the burger. One of the three dishes, or quite possibly all of them, gave me food poisoning. My friend and I ended up feeling horrible for days and puking."
Sophia J.,"Bellerose, NY",18,62,,4.0,4/15/2012,"Love the Cheesecake Factory! Just wish there was one in the city though. The food is good. I like the avocado rolls as an app and the chicken and avocado club. The service is pretty on point and the cheesecakes are sooo good. I like the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake. The place gets soo packed so go right before 5pm to beat the crowds. Also, try The Grand Lux Cafe that's in the same area. It's owned by the same owners of the cheesecake factory."
Dee K.,"Mineola, NY",0,31,1,5.0,7/31/2014,Never a disappointment Very attentive and pleasant. Nice calm relaxed atmosphere. A lot of food for your money and it's pretty darn good.
Marisa F.,"Mamaroneck, NY",96,452,50,3.0,3/5/2012,"It's a Cheesecake Factory. Been to one, been to 'em all, and sometimes that's just nice. The menu is huge and the calorie counts are high, so come here ready to splurge. The prices are reasonable, though. If you need a spot to please a picky palate, Cheesecake Factory will have something that your choosy pal will like."
Jennifer T.,"East Elmhurst, NY",27,20,1,5.0,8/5/2012,"I haven't been to cheesecake factory in ages, and I have to say, it was such a good decision to go again. The only negative thing about this place is that they don't take reservations by phone or through the web. So my advice to you is, GET THERE EARLY! I've read some of the negative reviews about the place, and not to bash anyone else, but I do have one thing to say about them. Obviously, if it's so hard to get a table during the 7-8 time slot, then the restaurant is doing something right, especially since people DO stay and wait for 45 min+. So if you're the type of person that doesn't really mind what time they have dinner, just go early and you can beat the rush. Secondly, for people who have said that they're food is too heavy, you might want to try entrees from their ""Skinny"" menu. It has specially made drinks and plates that are smaller and lighter, and lower in calories. Win win all around.  Now onto my actual dining experience. Since I got there EARLY, around 530, we were seated immediately. Our waiter was superb. He was a true gentleman throughout our entire meal. He was courteous, friendly, and made sure that our dining experience was a pleasant one. My friend and I had drinks along with our dinner, and that was probably the only negative thing I have to say. Her cocktail was reasonably priced, but a sangria at 12.50 a glass? That's a bit ridiculous. That's like asking me to pay 20 bucks for a glass of fruit juice with some fruit in it.  We got the smaller sized appetizers which allowed us to get more than one kind of appetizer and we actually still had room for our meal. I got the Cajun pasta, and as my own personal recommendation, get it with spinach instead of the bell peppers that it comes with!  All in all it was a great dining experience and we ended up tipping our waiter 20 on a 90 dollar bill because he was just that fantastic. :)"
Jonathan S.,"BAYSIDE, NY",1,102,,3.0,8/18/2013,Good. The takeout service is hit or miss with getting the orders right.
Jacqueline C.,"BAYSIDE HILLS, NY",0,7,5,1.0,1/2/2013,"Forever waiting.  First, waiting more than an hour for table but front desk insists for 45 mins waiting. After they called, you need to wait another 10 mins at upstairs (for setting up the table).  The dishes are coming very slow, too. The foods are really average. I mean you can find similar quality from diner with much cheaper price. BTW, I don't even mention they count double on my drinks. This is totally a bad experience."
Danny N.,"New York, NY",20,20,1,5.0,12/23/2012,Late night dinner with wife after a long day of holiday shopping. I was pleasantly surprised and shocked that we were immediately seated around 9 PM on a Friday night. Tex Mex egg rolls are delicious and the spicy chipotle pasta filled me up! Good job Cheesecake Factory!
Hannah C.,"Fort Lee, NJ",639,479,56,4.0,10/5/2011,"i can't remember the last time i've eaten at a cheesecake factory, and personally, i don't eat at chain restaurants. i think the quality and taste of the food is sub-par, especially with the prices you end up paying. plus, nyc has so many great restaurants, i just can't imagine why anyone would go to a chain restaurant.  however, my friends and i were not in nyc, otherwise, we probably wouldn't have chosen this place. but because we had to take care of business in westbury, we weren't given much of a choice other than a slew of chain restaurants on old country road. i was so certain that my food would be pretty bad, but man, i was shocked at how good my fish tacos were. don't know what kind of fish it was, but it was so crispy and flaky and it pretty much melted right in my mouth...mmm. and of course, their strawberry cheesecake didn't disappoint and was absolutely delicious. not sure about other locations, but this particular cheesecake factory is on top of my chain restaurants' list. YUM!"
Carol N.,"East Meadow, NY",17,31,,4.0,6/26/2014,"I always enjoy a visit to the Cheesecake Factory and this visit was no exception. The service was outstanding as usual. The menu is overwhelming with dozens of choices. There is a Skinnylicious menu with slimmed-down versions of many of their popular dishes. My friend and I both chose the Margherita lunch pizza. I had the accompanying Caesar salad and she had the house salad. We expected small side salads but were shocked by the huge salads we each received. Not only were they oversized but they looked and tasted great as well. The pizzas were a pleasant surprise - thin crust with a delicious marinara sauce with pieces of fresh mozzarella and strips of fresh basil. It was just the right size and a perfect complement to the salads. We both drank water, which the server kept refilled for us. We skipped dessert, especially since calorie counts were prominently displayed on the menu and we had already done serious damage! Having the calorie counts is eye-opening but good because it helps keep you in line. All in all, a very pleasant meal at a great place. Prices are reasonable as well. Can't wait to return."
Denise M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,4.0,2/19/2012,Only went for the dessert. Their cheesecake selection is amazing and lived up to expectations. If you're ever in the Source Mall stop in.
Cristina B.,"Merrick, NY",0,67,5,4.0,1/16/2011,"Yummy food. They have a great selection of anything imaginable. And the food tastes great as well. It can be salty, but this isn't exactly a place to eat healthy. The cheesecakes are really their specialty, I haven't had a cheesecake I didn't dislike. I'm drooling for a cheesecake while writing this. As an added bonus, they also have a bakery where you can buy desserts from them. We got a cheesecake for my brother's graduation, and they wrote everything on top, very nice. Tip: Avoid this place on weekends, it's best to come during the week. Unfortunately, being in the source mall, there are over an hour waits on weekends."
James K.,"Kew Gardens, NY",24,94,64,3.0,4/24/2010,Amazing cheesecake to drool over!@!   I actually like coming here for the food in addition to the cheesecake.  The food here is quite good and the atmosphere isn't bad as well.  The food is quite more than I would like to pay however once a year isn't bad.
N T.,"Astoria, NY",0,62,,5.0,9/27/2011,"I love this place, the menu is so big you can eat here often and not have to order the same thing for a long time.  Food is always good, drinks are always good and the prices are always good.  The lines are the only thing that is not good :) sometimes the wait is 1hr so come early and build up your appetite."
