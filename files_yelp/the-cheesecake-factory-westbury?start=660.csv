Cris S.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,3,,3.0,8/2/2014,Took my family of five forty minutes to be seated. After I complained the GM stepped in and had my family seated within 2 minutes. The GM - Javier Gomez - saved the night and turned an otherwise bad start into a better beginning. I'll be back because of him.
Monica R.,"New York, NY",15,19,6,3.0,5/24/2010,"The place is nice, but the food lacks taste. The steak had flakey burn pices on top so it would hurt my throath when I swallowed.  Portions are HUGE! I took home more than half, and I do eat a lot. So if you want a lot of food for your money, come here for sure. I mean is not HORRIBLE, but is not as tasty as a place like this could be. Cheeseecake is AWESOME THO!!"
Kath B.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,207,,5.0,5/23/2010,"A bit crowded on almost every night for dinner time at 6-8pm. Good food, great atmosphere, and the best cheesecake."
Sherl K.,"Glen Oaks, NY",33,90,6,5.0,2/25/2010,"I HEART The Cheesecake Factory!!! Never had a bad meal there.  There's always a ridiculous wait to get in but it's so worth the wait.  My fave are the Salmon dishes.  I've been a vegetarian for 20yrs (no fish either), but one time a friend talked me into trying a piece of their salmon.....I was hooked! It didn't smell or taste fishy, it wasn't chewy...just DEEELISH! I will only eat fish@ the CCF.  Their salads are off the hook, pizza and pastas are very very good.  Unfortunately, I've never had their cheesecake...just not a desert fan."
Reda W.,"Port Washington, NY",1,4,,4.0,7/19/2014,Soooo much food bit so delicious. Highly recommend the jamaican black pepper shrimp w/ brown rice as a healthier option. I don't usually get plantains. & there s'mores cheesecake to die for!
Mark G.,"Hauppauge, NY",1,29,,3.0,7/2/2012,If you live NYC or the 'burbs and you go to a chain restaurant for a meal some would consider it a questionable choice.  Especially for their commercial cheesecake.  Invited to brunch there the other day I ordered the lemon ricotta buttermilk pancakes with fresh strawberries. I won't review anything else nor would I go there for a meal but the pancakes were nothing short of spectacular.
Denise W.,"Long Island, NY",52,6,12,4.0,6/26/2012,Classic favorite of mine. You can't go wrong here. The wait can be a bit of a pain though as it is almost always packed around dinner time. Pasta Da Vinci is my go to dish and let me not forget the Red Velvet Cheesecake is out of this world!!
Dominique D.,"Bayside, NY",1,35,,4.0,1/4/2013,"Always busy but definitely a fan favorite. All of the food here is good... the menu has a lot of everything so it can be overwhelming, be prepared to come back to try something new!"
Irena D.,"Jamaica, NY",0,10,,5.0,10/21/2011,"I know this is a chain restaurant, but cheesecake factory never ceases to amaze me.  They have a new skinnylicious menu and it is really great.  I order the summer rolls with the shrimp and its delicious every time.  The service is always great, and so are the cheesecakes!"
Sonny G.,"Malba, Queens, NY",2244,415,1191,4.0,8/25/2011,"My first time ever at The Cheesecake factory. It was sooooo good. I think I've heard in the past that they don't have good food, but whoever said that was nuts! I had the shrimp Francese. The shrimp was noting to brag about, but the overall dish itself was great. The spaghettini pasta and veggies were slightly al dente, but it was still delicious. I was able to substitute asparagus for artichokes, and add shitake mushrooms free of charge. For dessert my parents and I split the red velvet cheesecake and the Kahlua Cocoa cheesecake. WOW!!! This cheesecake is a trillion times tastier than Juniors, or any other place where I've eaten cheesecake. They have so many different choices from raspberry lemon, to vanilla bean, to Reeses peanut butter cup, to banana cream. I cant wait to go back and try more flavors. I also forgot to mention that I absolutely adore the decor! it's totally old school Hollywood art-deco themed."
Katrina C.,"Freeport, NY",39,7,,4.0,2/20/2013,Love this place. Pricey but not exactly killing your wallet (depending on what you order). Red Velvet cheesecake is DEEEElicious.
Tor C.,"Seaford, NY",0,12,1,3.0,6/29/2014,The restaurant is nice.  I went with one other person we sat in between two couples.   It was extremely loud with everyone trying to over talk the other people they were sitting so close to.  I like that they have the skinny menu.   I ordered the grilled artichoke.  It was wonderful.   All of our other food was very salty.   I really wish chain restaurants would discover other seasonings.
Angie C.,"Oceanside, NY",39,110,59,3.0,10/8/2014,"Me and my boyfriend planned a date to dave n busters today but after he read a lot of reviews he already didn't want to go. We got there and no one was there and it was dirty so we decided to eat at the cheese cake factory and go back for games. I can't remember our servers name but he was very nice. We came once before and never came back because the service the last time was awful. This guy was very nice I think he told another table he was fairly new,but he still seemed to knowledgeable and even said to ask for him next time we come. Maybe Eric? But I'm not sure. Anyway we each had two rounds of drinks my margarita was really good but the first time it wasn't filled up to the top at all , and my boyfriend asked for a glass for his beer and had to wait 10 minutes because they were out of them....it wasn't even busy. The second time it took the drinks about 20 minutes to hit the table but it wasn't the servers fault he came by a lot and let us know the bar was backed up. I was going to cancel the drinks if I saw him again without them. We got the nachos as an appetizer. They were really gross, we barley touched them and the server even asked if we liked them but my boyfriend said it was fine because there was previously a problem with my soda it had black stuff floating in it. We didn't want to complain again. I wasn't crazy about My burger either and the fries tasted like cafeteria fries. My boyfriend got the steak Diane, it tastes really good and he loved it. We got the peanut butter Reese's cheese cake...adams something? It was delicious! It was so good I wish that I just had that. I was disappointed that the bill was 90 bux .....110 bux with tip and I wasn't crazy about anything I had!!!! I feel like you can rack up a high bill really quickly here, none of the drinks have prices and neither do the desserts. I really practically hated everything I ate but my boyfriends food tasted really good. I just don't know how you can mess up a burger. I would say my boyfriends experience was a lot better than mine. The three stars is for the cheesecake and the server!!!!"
Amador A.,"Queens, NY",424,738,193,4.0,4/22/2009,"I wish my mind registers when I am full just a tad bit faster, the portions here are so big I wind up finishing my plate and suddenly realize I am Stuffed...what other reason is there to come here besides their entrees.....yup you got it right their cheesecake. When I come here I normally get the raspberry cheesecake which is just so delicious.  The food is very good and this Cheesecake factory is located in a very busy shopping/resturant area so its always busy.  When coming here on a Friday/Saturday night around 5p you will be waiting a least 30-45 minutes. Its worth the wait."
Mike Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",71,190,62,4.0,5/25/2009,"Cheesecake factory is cheesecake factory. It's a big, popular chain located in nice upper class suburban environments. Theres always the dim lighting, painted ceilings, menu with advertisements on one side and food on the other. No matter what you get the servings are huge.  Now don't go looking for the best meal of your life...but it is really good, always consistent.  There are a lot of different types of food to choose from and everything I've had has been good. I really enjoy the thai lettuce wraps as an appetizer, especially during the summer time as the lettuce which you wrap grilled chicken in with vegetable fillers such as cucumbers, shredded carrots, sprouts as well as noodles tend to feel really light but hold just the right amount of flavor (because its customized depending on how much of the three different sauces you add on[peanut, something, and some other thing]) for dinner i always am a sucker for the meat loaf.  i am a loaf kinda guy.  the meatloaf is good with the right consistency, sauce w/ onions.  mashed potato and corn sides. the chicken and biscuits is just pure comfort as you're eating large portions of chicken and biscuits smothered in gravy with mashed potatoes. steak la diane also good...but i would pick the meat loaf over it. The waitresses are attentive, portions are huge for the price...which is not outrageous considering the ambiance provided. i like cheesecake factory.  this one gets bonus points for us being seated immediately on memorial day at 9 at night (yeah...i know most places wouldnt be that packed at that time but still it was nice)"
Nona C.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",20,205,75,5.0,1/1/2010,"love of my life, you will always have my belly to feed!! i've had both crappy, awful service and outstanding attentive service but what keeps me coming back is the sweet corn tamales.  i will order that as my entry alone.  the filet mignon was cooked to medium rare PERFECTION and their salmon never disappoints me!  My brother ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp and Chicken and I think that is going to have to be my new favorite dish. the wheat bread with oat flakes on top are also so heavenly.. so soft, warm-just-fresh-out-of-the-oven goodness...  i want to go back already!"
Dora D.,"New York, NY",0,6,,1.0,11/11/2012,"The WORST dining experience I ever had took place at this Cheesecake Factory. To begin, it was Thursday night after 9PM, so the wait for a table was not bad. We got seated in 5 minutes. Everything went smoothly until after our waitress took our order. We noticed that our table and this other table were the only ones without bread. Which is fine since I did not want to be stuffed before our food came.  Little did we know, our appetizer took more than 20 minutes to arrive! Meanwhile two tables that came later than us were already working on theirs. I let the waiter know how long we waited for and he snaps back at me saying that's not what is says on his computer when he brought over our dish. Then some guy came over, who I assumed was the manager because he never introduced himself, told us that our appetizer was freshly made that's why there was a wait. Since he had an excuse, it felt as though he didn't want to hear what I had to say. That did not explain why the 2 other tables got theirs 10 minutes prior to ours and their plates looked more complicated. We ordered the Fried Mac & Cheese Ball, it does not take that long to make. Plus, when the dish came out it was only warm, NOT HOT!  After we finished our appetizer we FINALLY got bread! They must have just been letting the dough rise when we got there that was why we waited over 30 minutes for bread. Our waitress explained that our order did not get placed in the system, but how come she didnt't check? Meanwhile the other 2 tables were chowing down on their entrees. By then I am beyond annoyed and would had just paid for the drinks and appetizer and walk out if it wasn't 10PM and many of the restaurants are closed. Sadly by the time we got our entrees one of the table next to was paying their bill and ready to leave. I waited so long for my food that I lost my appetite even though I was hungry to begin with.  I ordered the Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Jambalaya Pasta. It was nothing special at all, very bland for something called cajun because I am expecting a lot of spices. Very disappointed.  After our waitress brought back our entrees, she asked my boyfriend, not me if he wanted water. And as expected she brought back one glass of water so my boyfriend asked her to bring out another glass. I didn't think she liked me because that took her 10 minutes to get meanwhile I saw her chatting away. The wait this time might be the ice cubes weren't frozen yet. Apparently our waitress was new, but there were many times where I could not find her to ask her where our dishes were or she would be chatting somewhere. I had new wait staff wait on me before and they were actually really good, so being new was not a good excuse.  One thing that really got me annoyed was if she made a mistake and knowing that our dishes are delayed kindly tell us before hand and not when you serve the dish! I would had understand. Again this is a Thursday night, it was not that busy!! Second thing that annoyed me was how the ""manager"" treated us. He never came to check back on us how the dishes went or on how our experience was, so much for management. If you are going to have a manager who works like that then no wonder your wait-staffs are below par.  To sum up my review if I could give NO STARS I would. Food was mediocre and service was nonexistent.  I will never come back to this Cheesecake Factory and I will not recommend it. There are many other restaurants in Westbury and I know on a weekend night you could be waiting over 1 hour for a table"
Kathleen B.,"Long Island, NY",135,451,17,4.0,2/2/2009,"Go to the Cheesecake Factory for brunch.  Yes, seriously brunch!  You won't forget it.  I was on an eggs benedict kick, and I had it there and they have really kickass lemony thick hollaindaise.  AND I could actually finish almost the entire plate.  This is the one meal here where you might be able to finish your entire dish (if you're not an ogre to begin with). Woot! Dinner and lunch, not so much, but brunch, yes please!"
Diana M.,"Brooklyn, NY",104,222,9,3.0,11/11/2009,"I've heard so much about this place being outstanding and amazing so I tried it. There prices for food were decent. They had a huge book for a menu of variety. Their drinks were a bit pricey 10 and above. I had a half hour wait and saw tons and tons of ""soccer moms"" around 6 pm.  The Cheescake: i thought it was ok, they have over 20 different varities of different types of cheesecake and other desserts Overall, I wasn't impressed, I live in brooklyn, so it really isnt in my area i doubt I'll be back."
Norman C.,"Forest Hills, NY",37,101,1,3.0,11/9/2009,"I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for over 5 years, but mostly because of family members that love the food there.   The food itself is pretty decent for a chain restaurant.  The portions are pretty large, and I myself love most of the appetizers.  I don't have much to say about the cheesecake selection vecause I'm usually stuffed by dessert time!   The worst aspect of going to the Cheesecake Factory is definitely the wait time.  On a weekend, it can be over 90 minutes for a party of 4, and I have on occasion waited over 40 minutes on random weeknights as well.   All in all, not the greatest, but a decent choice of food on Old Country Road.  (If you can stand the wait)."
