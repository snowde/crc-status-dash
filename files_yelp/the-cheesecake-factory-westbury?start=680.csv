Jessica C.,"Jamaica, NY",56,75,32,4.0,10/25/2009,"One of my favorite chain restaurants. You flip through so many different plates, each sounding as delicious as the last, making it very hard to choose just one. I have two favorite pasta dishes here, the Louisiana Chicken and the Chicken Farfalle. Serving sizes are huge a good family portion dish, and if you doggy bag it home it tastes just as good the next day. The wait time can be ridiculous, up to 30-45 minutes on a really busy day.  Oh yeah cheesecake here is a must try, that's what they are obviously named for, pineapple, godiva and oreo are tried and true."
Brian J.,"Elmont, NY",5,5,1,3.0,6/21/2012,I wasn't impressed overall with the cheesecake or the food. For appetizers I had calamari which was deelicious but I have bought better cheesecake from candy sellls by my co-works.  There is nothing better than good old fashion NY cheesecake like from Juniors.  I found the cheesecake to be too soft it reminded me of mousse.  As for the food I order chicken and shrimp gumbo and it tasted neither like shrimp or chicken and the sausage in it was bland it was spicey hot but that was the only  flavor.  Price wasn't bad consider is you can  spend $100 anywhere easily.  I will try the cheesecake factory again and try a different entree and skip the cheesecake.
Tisha D.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,5,,3.0,3/10/2009,"I do enjoy going to the cheesecake factory. It's reasonably priced and there are decent portions. There are nights were it's extremely crowded and my boyfriend and i will just settle for PF Chang's next door.  The cheesecake is good, but i'm a Brooklyn girl, so Juniors will ALWAYS have my heart :-)"
coleen j.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,112,66,3.0,1/4/2012,"Been here twice and to me it's just average. The cheese cake is not the best I've tasted. I think initially people are in awe of the scale and decor of the restaurant, but the food is nothing special. Nothing unique. I guess you can find pretty much anything on their menu at any other restaurant. Their portions are huge and their meals are loaded with calories.  Nice place for a gathering."
Greg G.,"BAYSIDE, NY",4,13,3,1.0,12/17/2013,"There have been a few times this year when I wish I had stayed away from chain restaurants.  This visit was one of them.  So we began ordering appetizers and a few minutes later the crab fried thingy came out with a nice lemon to squeeze on it.  Well, it had been squeezed, most likely by the table who ordered the same thing earlier in the night.  So I can look past a mangled lemon that some other slob touched then regifted to me for Christmas, but the waitress response was priceless.  ""They look like that sometimes."" She replied when I asked for a new one.  At that point I wanted to bang my head against a wall but maturity prevailed and we decided to pass on the app.  The mains came and were ok.  Standard cheesecake fare.  I get about 3/4 of the way through my beer when i looked into it and saw floating debris.  Lucky me, two things I didn't order for free.  It was most likely shallot or onion that made it through the dishwasher then dried onto the glass, and the beer released them.  I said something to our waitress and she offered what appeared to be an apology.  A manager came over and tried to rectify the situation by telling me the square shaped floaters in my drink came from the tap.  Soooooo, to sum it up, I wish Long Island had the A B C food safety rating that NYC does because this would definitely be a C."
Ari P.,"Queens, NY",40,401,,4.0,9/4/2009,"Yes, its a chain restaurant, but its one of the best options in the area other than Ayhans. Dave and Busters does not sit well in my stomach, and other businesses around here are just as expensive and don't deliver as much. *cough* California Pizza Kitchen *cough* I will agree that the wait can suck, but its not as bad as it used to be. I've never had to wait for a lunch, and dinner has always been less than 30 minutes. Tip: Only get a table upstairs, the downstairs has always been nasty. Food here is par excellence. I love the Eggplant Sandwich and Barbeque Ranch Salad. Pastas look great too. Cheesecake here is absolutely amazing, mass produced, but still delicious. Service here is a little sporadic, but it tends to be much politer than the White Plains location. The prices are a little high, but totally reasonable when you see how much you get."
Maryellen G.,"Bellerose, NY",1,21,1,4.0,1/27/2012,Food portions are gigantic and prices are pretty reasonable.  They make really good Lemon Drop Martinis!
J S.,"Queens, NY",0,9,,1.0,4/27/2015,"Literally the WORST restaurant experience I have ever had.  Ok I know its the cheese cake factory not some fancy upscale place I get it, but I've had better food and service at Wendy's.  After sitting down the waitress comes over 20 minutes later after being on her phone the entire time -_-.  After ordering my boyfriend asked a question about some buffalo chicken something dish regarding what was in it, she replied ""what do you not understand about buffalo chicken"".  She was some snotty 16 year old with a face full of acne and braces, it took every ounce of strength I had to not hit her.  The food comes out my salad was ok I mean its a salad not rocket science, but that buffalo chicken dish was DISGUSTING! I would not feed that to my cat.  It was not buffalo chicken it was like mashed up chicken deep fried and served in some bbq sauce, SO GROSS!  So now on to the cheesecake it was really good however after this bratty child gave us an attitude for asking a question she gave my boyfriend what looked like 1/3 the size of my cheese cake slice.  She literally hated him I think, left there asap and will probably never be returning.  And to the cheesecake factory if your reading this try not to hire highschool kids as waiters."
Stephen W.,"Oceanside, NY",16,42,,2.0,2/1/2014,"Not a fan. They are very busy and offer poor service. The food is mediocre at best, pasta is bland, chicken is dry... The cheesecake is their one redeeming dish, but I go to a restaurant for food, not just dessert."
Kenny W.,"New York, NY",33,31,,2.0,11/1/2011,"Been here a few times first review of the place. Service was lacking they seated us in the backroom and kind of forgot about us. We had apps. dessert etc.... but I came for one reason. Ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta heard a few reviews raving about it. I was not impressed. The shrimp tasted like if I had ordered a shrimp cocktail, chicken was nice and flavorful perfectly cooked. Pasta was for some reason gooey like when a Alfredo sauce breaks. The dish is just an insult to great Cajun food. On another note I usually get the Grilled Rib-Eye very nice well cooked for the temperature I ordered (medium rare)."
David L.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",25,35,8,4.0,2/22/2014,I ordered a burger and it was delish. The service was excellent and plenty of refills. The red velvet cheesecake was exquisite .
A B.,"Boston, MA",1,294,,5.0,9/10/2011,"I don't think I've ever had a bad experience at a Cheesecake factory, and I've probably been to about 5 or 6 of them and in different states. My biggest complaint about the restaurant are the portions are just way too huge. I usually don't make food decisions based off of calories, but when I saw that my meal + some of an appetizer + dessert (you gotta get the cheesecake) = more calories than I usually eat in 1 day (over 2,000!!) I was really disgusted. Even if I cut my meal in half and shared the dessert, it was still soooo many calories. I just don't get where they come from. The biggest gold star goes to our waiter, Tommy. He was the best waiter I have ever had, anywhere. He was attentive, but not annoying. He was knowledgeable, timely and very friendly. He deserves a raise!!!"
J N.,"Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, NY",0,50,,4.0,2/14/2014,"I give this place 4.5 stars. I had to wait 30 minutes even though I arrived at 5 pm on Saturday. When I finally got my space, it was so dark and noisy the whole time. Thankfully, I was seated in the tables with the benches.  I tried the Fried Mac and Cheese Balls appetizer and it was strangely delicious!!! However, it was pretty expensive. It was 10 dollars for 4 Mac and Cheese Balls. Their main courses are pretty good too and the portions are huge. My friend and I both had chicken dishes that were mediocre. The steak dishes were really good. The burgers are huge with a large side of fries.I had to package my main course home and so did my friends. Then, came dessert. The cheesecake was delicious and the two dollops of whip cream made up like almost the whole slice of cheesecake. Overall, this place is pretty good; it is better than all the other chain restaurants out there. If you are seeking a quiet and calm restaurant to go to, this is definitely not the perfect place to go. If you just want a restaurant with a great atmosphere, this is the perfect place."
Janet F.,"Bayside, NY",1,66,,5.0,3/20/2012,"For anyone who complains about the menu at the Cheesecake Factory, it's like going into a library and saying they don't have a book for you.  Yes, it's hard to make a decision but isn't that a good thing?    The food is not the problem here.  The food is delicious, the prices are great and the portions are enormous and to top it off it's a beautiful decor.   The problem with this restaurant is that they are a victim of their own success.  For all of the reasons stated above, this is why you have to wait so long for a table - especially on a weekend.  Back to the foodture (get it future, foodture... I know, I know... bad pun but couldn't resist) the food is consistently fresh and tasty.  I don't think I've ever had a bad meal here and that goes for all the Cheesecake Factorys that I've dined in around the country.   To really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory, go for an early dinner, go for lunch, go for brunch or go during the early part of the week.  Unfortunately, no matter how well meaning your server is,  you just aren't going to get great service on a Saturday night, so be smarter than the teeming hordes of fellow diners; don't eat when they eat."
Joel T.,"Bellmore, NY",1,5,,5.0,3/26/2014,"I was a fan when I first ate in Cheesecake Factory in Miami, more than a decade ago. My favorites are shrimp with angel hair and Thai lettuce wraps, and of course, its endless varieties of cheesecakes."
Lisa H.,"Brooklyn, NY",134,269,1,2.0,2/11/2011,I only came here twice and I think that's enough for me. Their food is very salty and not so great. I've had better food at Chili's and TGIFridays. Their cheesecakes are good....but it's easy to make cheesecake. Juniors is better anyway.
Adrienne S.,"Freeport, NY",31,42,35,4.0,12/23/2012,try the grilled tostada chicken salas.   this is such a delicious salad.  then add chocolate cake with vanilla ice for desert yummy.
Angel M.,"New York, NY",0,71,,4.0,7/6/2012,"Food is great, cheesecake even better but the wait is a bit ridiculous. Such a huge eatery people linger long after they've finished their meal. I just wanna yell "" get ur a!$ up so the rest of us can enjoy OUR meal"". Even the wait for takeout cheesecake is a bit lengthy. Come hungry, don't be in a rush & bring a few friends. It's a very busy place with a voyeuristic dining experience. Wide array of types from ""mob wives"" to ""love & hip hop"" & everything in between."
Cat W.,"Flushing, NY",46,165,816,5.0,7/4/2011,"The red velvet cheesecake is soooo good!!! It tastes so divine, seriously. The 30th anniversary cake is good as well (if you like a lot of chocolate). The strawberry short cake was amazing. There was ice cream in between two layers of cake, fresh strawberries, and whipped cream. All I can say is yum, and I can't wait to go back for more =)"
Karen B.,"Glen Cove, NY",32,125,1,3.0,9/15/2013,"The portions (even lunch size) at Cheesecake Factory are generous and of course the cheesecake is delicious.  The service was slow and inattentive, which was disappointing on what even the staff admitted was a quiet time of the day."
