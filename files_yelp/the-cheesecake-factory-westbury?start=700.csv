Melissa S.,"Jericho, NY",2,23,3,4.0,3/26/2012,"Always great food, and wit hthe addition of the skinny menu i can actually order a delicious meal without feeling guilty and huge after.  The skinny menu is amazing iwas able to turn my 1200 calorie lunch into a 450 calorie amazing meal that kept me full all day!"
Natalia D.,"Mineola, NY",105,181,87,5.0,7/5/2011,Had the orange chicken ! HUGE portions! must share! or take home the salad was amazing as well
Nicole S.,"West Islip, NY",0,1,,1.0,2/10/2015,"This is actually my first review of a place and I wish I could say writing this review was for a positive reason; however it is not. We had Deborah D as a server, and our experience as a 6-top (yes I am also in the restaurant business) was terrible at best. We first ordered drinks, most drinks were fine with the exception of my boyfriends beer being warm. Then we ordered appetizers, 3 out of 4 came out on time, we waited over 5 minutes for the tuna tartar which is raw and does not need to be cooked to be brought to the table. We then ordered a second round of drinks which brought us a beer in a cracked glass. We proceeded to entrees while resulted in a steak not being butterflied and cooked rare when we had requested medium well. The server did not check on the table once the steak which was brought out again. We also had to correct the check once it was brought out because they charged us for the warm beer. Needless to say we will not be going back to this location."
Mota B.,"Bellerose, NY",0,18,,2.0,8/16/2013,"Lately the past three times we came here the service has been terrible. Long wait to be served after being seated, food not the way it was asked for, and the quality of the food was also lacking. The cheesecake in white plains or jersey are far superior in service and quality. The wait time for food also was totally ridiculous. The waiters and waitresses were preoccupied socializing instead of doing their jobs. Don't come here!"
Rachel P.,"Bellmore, NY",3,141,,4.0,1/20/2013,My husband and I equate this to a high end diner. The menu is varied. There's something for everyone. It's a really loud restaurant so I feel comfortable bringing my three year old here. They list the calories on the menu. As a result I tend to order off of the appetizer menu for my entree.
Manuel M.,"Bronx, NY",13,14,2,3.0,11/16/2011,The service was great. The server was very attentive. Definitely enjoyed my meal. But I definitely recommend the Fried Macaroni & Cheese.
Helen W.,"Jersey City, NJ",46,277,2,4.0,3/29/2011,I love cheesecake. For a chain restaurant the food's pretty good. I haven't been to other Cheesecake factories though.  The wait is crazy on the weekends. They don't take reservations. For a group of 11 we waited 2.5 hours once but they told 1.5.
Jazzmine L.,"Corona, NY",0,8,,4.0,1/21/2012,"I love this place. It is usually crowded but certain things are worth the wait. Buffalo Blasts are my favorite but the Avocado Eggrolls are a really really close second! Also, try the Strawberry Creamsicle... Will always be my favorite chain restaurant!"
Irene R.,"Memphis, TN",214,559,90,3.0,7/20/2008,"I've found Cheesecake factory to be consistant in their food. We all know they have amazing cheesecake.  The other food can be hit or miss. I find that a lot of the stuff is really too heavy and makes me feel like I just ate lead. The salads are really good, and the way to go if you just want something to eat so you don't feel guilty just having cheesecake. If you go to this one on a Friday or a Saturday night expect to be waiting a while."
Gilbert T.,"Uniondale, NY",1,44,1,4.0,1/4/2014,"This is one of my favorite chain restaurants. There is a wide assortment of dishes to choose from and i am usually not disappointed with what i order. The wait is usually long to get a table (if you have a large group, or it is a really busy hour) and to get your food but they bread basket helps distract you. I love their honey wheat multigrain bread. Its the best out of the variety of breads offered. The portions are huge and are more than enough for one person usually. Their strawberry lemonade is good and comes with free refills."
John C.,"Bronx, NY",41,18,,4.0,1/2/2014,"good service, good food, good desert! ... missing one star because you need a location in manhattan"
Sarah L.,"Rockville Centre, NY",0,4,,3.0,1/5/2015,"I have been to The Cheesecake Factory many times, but it has been a while since I have been in this locations.  After trying on bridesmaids dresses next door a group of us went over to have a few drinks and some food.  The wait was fairly reasonable at about 15 minutes for a group of 6 people, but we did ask for a larger table to accommodate because 2 of us are bigger girls and one girl is 8 months pregnant.  When we asked the person who was seating us they were very nasty and told us we should have asked when we put our name down if we needed special accommodations, we had no problem waiting a little longer for a table if necessary but did not appreciate getting snapped at or embarrassed.  My second complaint was that after ordering some plates off of the skinny menu to share, we heard the waiter and the nasty person who seated us talking about us wanting more room because we were fat and then ordering diet food.  That really ticked us off and put a dark cloud over our fun day celebrating buying a wedding dress.  Other then the 2 nasty people the 3 starts are for the food being good, the bathrooms being clean and the wait not being to long."
Emily S.,"Lynbrook, NY",5,99,,5.0,10/1/2012,"This chain Restaurant is nicely decorated all over inside from the high ceilings to the beautiful fixtures. The food is just amazingly delicious here. Everything that I have ever ordered here was just so satisfying. Their cheesecake is wonderful and there are so many different selections. The portions are also very large. I always have leftovers. Also, the prices are similar to Ruby Tuesdays's and Applebees prices except the atmosphere and service that you are getting from The Cheesecake Factory is way better."
Lauren L.,"Astoria, NY",127,528,,1.0,7/11/2010,"So when I wait 35 minutes for a MUSHROOM BURGER, you know you don't even need to cook a mushroom so what should it take, 5 minutes to make, I expect it to come out warm, not FREEZING COLD. No apology and they still charged me for it (after putting it under the warmer so that it only heats the bread, thus leaving everything else still cold. Insane. I will never be back to this location, despite how much I usually love this food."
Samantha L.,"ASTORIA, NY",201,54,1,5.0,2/8/2013,"macaroni bites, macaroni bites macaroni bites!  theyre so amazing.  the pastas and everything are amazing i have never ordered something i didnt like and i have gone out on limbs like with the flatbread.  which turned out to be even better than a lot of the things ive had.  its really awedsome going there and just eatting apps cheap way to get the awesome experience.  highly recommend."
Jeffrey Y.,"New York, NY",21,225,72,2.0,4/16/2010,"Once upon a time, i was wowed by the hype surrounding the Cheescake Factory. After my last meal there I know now that when the novelty of the portion size wears off, you realize that the food isn't that great. Their menu is huge and going through the entire thing is daunting. I ordered the chicken madiera which is supposedly their most popular dish yet it was underseasoned. My friend got the blackened jamaican chicken which was more sweet than spicy. The tables are too close to each other with little room for private conversation. The wait isn't too bad if you come on a weekday but once friday rolls around, be ready to wait at least an hour."
M M.,"New York, NY",0,28,8,3.0,4/15/2011,"I love this place, but the wait is hell! You can expect to wait over 90 minutes on a friday, saturday, or sunday night. Even lunch takes 60 minutes to be seated. Great food and atmosphere, just not worth the wait."
Andy K.,"East Brunswick, NJ",376,1066,199,4.0,6/10/2008,Always delicious! I loathe chain restaurants but Cheesecake Factory is goodness in a big bowl. They have huuuge portions of pasta and good sandwiches. Of course if you have room left get a cheesecake...my favorites include the pumpkin cheesecake and godiva cheesecake. Long waits usually if you go on weekends.
Daniel P.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,305,69,1.0,6/10/2007,"Far too expensive. An absolutely insane wait, no matter when you are dining A miraculously high reputation which it does not deserve Food which is edible, and can also be found in more skilled variations at other restaurants Gaudy, unnecessary, and chunky decor Inattentive wait staff I've never felt content or happy after a meal here (and this should displease you, too) The tally= Don't go."
Bri W.,"Westbury, NY",5,18,1,5.0,5/10/2011,"Delish!Staff is great and food is scrumptious!I've never had a complaint about this place...everything tastes so fresh and cooked well,unlike Applebees-type restaurants where everything is microwaved.The environment is so great,especially seeing the chefs!I've been coming here for years and always invite new friends to come...P.S. Their piña coladas are sooooo fricken good!!!OMG!!!"
