Scott C.,"Floral Park, NY",15,111,,4.0,8/16/2006,"I'm going to play first I'll say something nice then I'll say something bad.  Nice: The decor is nice and the seating is very comfortable. Bad: The decor is nice while your standing and waiting(sometimes over 1-3 hours!)  for one those comfortable seats.  Nice: Their menu is huge and you can find almost anything on it. Bad: Their menu is huge and sometimes it's hard to find what it is you want to eat.  Nice: The waiters here are generally friendly Bad: The people who take the names and assign you beepers think way too highly of themselves.   Nice: The food is good and the portions are huge Bad: The food is good and the portions are SO it's hard to get to dessert!!(ok not much of negative there sorry!)  I can't do nice and bad with their cheesecake it's really good!!  It's second only to Junior's. Over all Cheesecake Factory is good but just be ready for the wait."
Jen W.,"Flushing, NY",98,407,190,3.0,11/13/2007,"There is always an insane wait at this place for some reason. I don't know why.  The dessert is the ONLY reason to go. The cheesecakes are really good, but sometimes the wait is just too much. I personally like the white chocolate macadamia nut, banana cream, key lime pie, and the peanut butter one who's name escapes me... the food there is ok, i like the fried chicken salad in which no one ever finishes.  so if there isn't a huge wait then go, i'm not about to stay there for 2 hours for cheesecake, and ok food."
Kimberly F.,"Brooklyn, NY",174,430,25,2.0,1/13/2008,"Pricey!!  If that is one word i can use, thats it, pricey!  This place is very pretty, and they is always a little wait. The food is ok, they have a great mix from tex mex to Italian. The meals are far to big! If your trying to have a 3course meal, good luck. I had the bread, and split the Nachos(which were just ok) and buffalo wings(very spicy!) And i was stuffed and couldn't even touch my main course i got it to go and grabbed the cheesecake. The Factory is bout quantity vs quality. A massive slice of cheesecake came out with half a can of whip cream! Waaayyy to much, but i stuffed my face, and got the extra to go lol. Pros: great parking and other things to do i the area, filling food, not feeling like a fat ass cuz everyone is eating like fatasses lol Cons:That price for thats only ehhh, is not cool, if ya can book it to Junior's in Brooklyn, waay better! The waitress was not happy to be there, and showed it every minute  another con that was a little strange, the floor was slipper was hell my friend almost busted her ass twice!"
Patricia R.,"Tampa, FL",93,192,61,5.0,1/12/2012,i love me some cheesecake factory. I have yet to be upset with any of my meals and if anything is wrong you just tell the waiter and its fixed with no complaints . The staff is always friendly  i give them alot of credit to wear all white because i know I'm messy my white uniform would be such a mess lol .the prices are a bit high but its so worth it because there portions are pretty big so i don't mind it all .I tried  the Cuban sandwich and shocking it was pretty freaking good which  i had in the back of my head it would stink but boy was i wrong .My main dish is the chicken teriyaki with rice  and it taste SO yummy and my hubby loves there Cajun chicken little and don't be fooled there is nothing little about the chicken at all . My main focus is the cheesecake i have tried pretty much half of there selection yeah I'm a fat girl i wont lie. But the Godiva chocolate cheesecake and the Hershey's peanut butter cheesecake is too freaking die for topped off with there yummy homemade whip cream so  yummy. Everything here is pretty amazing from appetizer's to entree to drinks and especially there desserts and they have other desserts but cheesecakes like Linda's fudge cake omg such a huge slice and its amazing as well. the decor is so pretty looks like the inside of a luxurious hotel type of them its great .
Marlo G.,"Hoboken, NJ",292,651,301,1.0,10/8/2009,"I stopped eating at this Cheesecake Factory after a satisfying meal---a roach crawled across the table.  The very kind General Manager told us they'd sprayed the day before.  Not comforting, especially when the seat was right next to the kitchen... :/"
Mike K.,"Ridgewood, NY",95,14,5,5.0,1/25/2009,"Cant get better then this place.  Food is great, service is even better.  Price is a little high, but not abusrd.  Food portions are huge which make up to the higher prices. Service is amazing.  Felt like whenever we needed something, they were always there to tend to our needs. Get the cheesecake!! No matter what! Even if you are full from the huge portions, take it to go!!! Go Now!!! ... I have spoken lol"
D R.,"California, MD",1,81,,3.0,1/17/2013,I have ate at Cheesecake factories all over the country and this was the most disappointing. Food and service didn't meet the expectations.
Spence B.,"Jamaica, NY",29,73,,2.0,10/12/2009,"I usually enjoy the Cheesecake Factory, but last night I had a terrible experience. We got sat rather quickly, but the food took forever to come out. After waiting about 45 minutes, my pasta dish was horribly over-cooked. Once I let the waitress know, she said the manager would be right over. This asshole took a good 10 minutes just to show up to my table. I was pissed at this point because my date was practically done with her meal, and i didn't even touch mine. When the manager finally showed up he apologized and ordered another dish. Long story short (or even longer) when my food finally arrived the shit was over cooked again. Fuckin' ridiculous.... I didn't eat the nasty shit, and was still charged full price for the dish.      The only reason I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt is because all the other times I've been here, its been good. Im going to give them one more chance, hopefully they redeem themselves.  Douche bags...."
Justmy O.,"Ridgewood, Queens, NY",1,21,,4.0,1/9/2011,"I love the food, drinks, great menu...sick desserts!!!  I don't like the wait and I also had a waitress one time who was quite a smart-*ss!  Hopefully she's not there anymore.  This is one of my fave places to eat.  Just be prepared to wait quite a while and possibly without a seat while waiting."
John O.,"Port Washington, NY",0,4,,1.0,4/2/2011,"Avoid this place on weekends.  Total chaos on a Saturday night, with a 90 minute plus wait. If you do manage the wait, avoid sitting downstairs at all costs.  We were seated downstairs by the reception area, it was like eating in a train station.  People on top of you and moving about  and very noisy, not to mention very cold because the revolving door never stopped moving cold air from outside to the inside.   This is probably why the appetizers and food arrived cold and not hot.  When questioned about it, all they could offer was they were sorry. We had a gift certificate so we had to stay. Never again!!!!!!!!!!"
Charlee L.,"New York, NY",0,50,7,1.0,12/12/2010,Well I would not come here again.  The food is not amazing.  The size of their meals are not that large compare to the price that you are paying for them.  I would expect that much or even more. If you have money to waste then it might be a fun night out.
Claudia C.,"Nassau, NY",52,25,32,3.0,8/10/2012,of course the cheesecake is the main purpose but the food it ok just choose correctly
Young G.,"Flushing, NY",17,15,4,4.0,4/9/2010,The salads and pastas here are awesome! I've never had a bad meal here and the portions are huge. The miso salmon is the best dish they have.
Simon O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,,3.0,2/5/2013,Thought this place would be better. Food is not up to par! Service was on point though.
Shirley Y.,"San Francisco, CA",74,146,237,2.0,2/11/2014,"I am not a big fan of chain restaurants when we have so many restaurant options in NYC, but someone from our group insisted we go there. Normally I would not wait for any restaurant over an hour wait unless they are dam good and we were not seated until over an hour and a half. My pina colada was pretty good even tho there wasn't much alcohol in it. There were complaints from our group that their drinks sucked (tasted bad and lack of alcohol). The waiter completely forgot one of our appetizers since he didn't bother writing anything down. My steak Diane was over cooked when I specifically asked for medium. I only tasted black pepper and salt. It was lacking the wine with mushroom sauce flavor as described on the menu. My friend got the grilled salmon and it was so dry he had a hard time eating it. The only thing they didn't screw up was the red velvet cheese cake. The cheese cake was probably the one thing worth wild in the whole restaurant. I also forgot to mention the service was horribly slow. Our waiter was no where to be found at all times. Never again unless it for cheese cake take out!"
Julietjojo W.,"Westbury, NY",11,9,3,3.0,10/2/2010,I love the environment not the food. But cheesecake is also good.  It's just too sweet.  Cakes are not pretty enough but love the Godiva one.
eliza b.,"Haddonfield, NJ",232,406,67,3.0,4/22/2009,"what i like about all cheesecake factory restaurants is that i can go to any one of them and know exactly what i want to eat. i love the luau salad. i ask for no fried wonton, and add avocado to it. perfect every time. including at this location. ok service, horrible ambiance, decent prices on decent wines, and exactly what i expected. good for you, cheesecake factory!"
Naima C.,"Queens, NY",50,143,232,4.0,2/24/2010,"Even though it's a chain,chain,chain resturant I do not hold it against this place I like it more than RL and there menu is sooo huge and being a gemini I love options but can become a little stressed out if I'm not sure what to order I have been to the CCF 3 times over the years the last time being this past monday my hubby,3 yr old girl , and I went I had the lunch size BBQ Ranch Chicken Salade(there is a picture of it on here it has the fried onion rings on top this salade was huge and yummy the chicken was moist and the ranch dressing was good ) and I had a pinapple mohitto sp ,hubby had shrimp scampy and herb salmon that came with mashed potatoes and asparagus,and dd had mini burgers from the kids menu she said they where yummy for desert I had the key lime cheese cake to go It was yummy whish I would have gotten another different slice of cc too !"
Jessica C.,"Manhattan, NY",7,6,,4.0,2/15/2011,I always enjoy an agreeable meal here.  Always busy and the wait is long but the service as well as the food is reliable.
Mindy L.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",15,47,,5.0,2/16/2010,"I dont know why but I really do enjoy the cheesecake factory. Me and my ex even waited over an hour on v-day one year. He always got the ribs with mash potatoes- always banging. I usually get the salmon. They also make kick-ass mango smoothies. Highly recommended. And of course, cheesecake....reeses, classic, strawberry, and raspberry are the ultimate guilty pleasures!"
