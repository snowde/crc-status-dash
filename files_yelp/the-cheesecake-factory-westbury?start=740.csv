Markus G.,"Jamaica, NY",0,4,,5.0,10/21/2012,Where do I start this place is amazing I came here for the 1st time to celebrate my birthday. The waiter was extremely nice so nice that my mom gave him a $20 tip. The wait was 15 minuets which was great compared to some of the other wait times I heard of. The food was the best part for the appetizers we had the fried mac&cheese(MUST TRY) and the fried zucchini sticks. For our main course I had the fish tacos with black beans and rice my mom had the salmon with carrots and my grandma had the shrimp basket. Desert was the best part I had the red velvet cheesecake and my mom had the pumpkin cheesecake. Another thing they did was the waiters sang happy birthday to me because we where celebrating my birthday  but they went a step extra and put a candle on top of the cake which has never been done at any other restaurant I have been to.  Also you will be going home with left overs that's because of the BIG sizes of the plates. The only bad thing I have to say is that it can get pretty crowded around 7ish.         Also if you are taking the LIRR there trust me when I tell you get off at the West Berry station NOT the Carle Place station. My family and I found that out the hard way.
Pav T.,"Hicksville, NY",8,30,1,5.0,7/19/2012,absolutly love the decor! amazing food. would definitly recommend the mac & cheese balls for an app! its delicious! I also love the four cheese pasta for a main dish!
Ronaldo M.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,12,1,3.0,6/27/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is great.  It's a nice place.  But sometimes, just sometimes, they can mess up.  Often, this place will give you great food, and great service.  Other times, it can be the complete opposite.  I remember one time when I went that they had completely switched our orders with another table and had to wait until this was rectified.  Then, the burger I had gotten was not pleasant to eat due to an extremely soggy, wet bottom hamburger bun.  I'd say go when this place isn't as busy, usually for lunch, when the waiters aren't cranking out orders like nothing and the cooks are as stressed."
Kouichi K.,"New York, NY",12,116,,2.0,11/9/2009,"I always ask myself why do I come here?  It's not that great and is definitely overpriced.  The portions here are humongous, which may be great for some people, but not me.  The menu is like a 200 page book and you never know what the hell to order.  The cheesecakes are good, but again overpriced.  With that, you have to wait for a table.  Why does anyone come here?  Is it that good?  I don't think so.  This time when I say I will never come back I will mean it."
Karen Y.,"College Point, Queens, NY",77,249,65,4.0,8/20/2009,"Mmm...Cheesecake Factory. I wanted to come here for the longest time, but never had an opportunity to do so. I heard stories about how other people waited on line for hours just to get in. My co-worker waited an hour and a half just to be seated for Valentine's Day. In celebration of one of my co-worker's birthdays, we decided to come to the Cheesecake Factory at around 5:30pm weekday. Parking could be moderately difficult since the Cheesecake Factory parking lot is shared with other Source Mall businesses. I tend to park nearer to the end where Dave & Busters is to secure a parking spot. When we arrived, we casually went to the hostess stand to reserve a table. It would be a twenty minute wait, which isn't bad compared to what I expected. When our party was called, we were told to go upstairs. When I arrived to the second floor, there is another hostess at a hostess booth who confirmed our party's arrival. We were seated by our short-haired, skinny female server, who grabbed a bunch of the thickest menus I've ever seen. The six of us sat in a booth. The decor seemed relaxing with low lighting and orange sconces. I am still going crazy over the menu book. It felt like twenty pages, but there were advertisements in some of the pages, which I thought was weird. Aren't I here to eat, not look at advertisements? The menu covered a lot of different dishes from Italian, Mexican, to Thai food. The menu selection is so massive that they boast that there are more than 200 menu selections. The question now is: does quantity affect quality? I'm still drooling from the last time I had Thai food at Sushi Thai Garden  , so I order the Thai chicken pasta which is linguini with sautéed chicken, Julienne carrots, green onion and a spicy peanut sauce topped with fresh bean sprouts. My co-workers ordered two appetizers, which are platter-sized. I think one of them was a Quesadilla platter, grilled flour tortilla filled with melted cheese, green onions, and chile alongside guacamole, salsa and sour cream with chicken. I forget what the other platter was, but I do remember they both tasted good. When my Thai chicken pasta came, my eyes and appetite opened. I love anything with noodles and peanut sauce so needless to say, it was a great meal with moderate spice. I did not end up finishing the whole thing though and had to bag it up in a nice ""Cheesecake Factory"" bag. Then comes the highlight of the event: dessert. Even though I normally don't go for the dessert, who am I kidding? This is the Cheesecake Factory and no way am I skipping out on cheesecake as a first-timer patron. My eyes delightfully narrowed down to the fresh strawberry. I imagined that it was cheesecake and strawberries swirled in together, creating what I imagine perfect harmony. To my slight disappointment, the strawberry cheesecake in front of me is actually a regular piece of cheesecake with some fresh strawberries and strawberry syrup spread on top with fancy balls of creme on the sides. I'll still eat it though, who am I kidding? Actually, I'm normally not a huge fan of cheesecake that much, but I'm willing to be excited for the cheesecake here. It was good and I think I dropped down about $40 in total including a portion to chip in for my co-worker's birthday meal. The waitress was nice enough to take our group picture. It didn't come out as well as I thought it would be since the flash wasn't that good, but she made the effort. What was a little bothersome was that she failed to bring us proper silverware for our desserts. We all had desserts, but no spoons. Instead of waiting continually for her to show up, we flagged down the busboys and they brought us the silverware instead. Actually, while our waitress was nice and brought us the birthday upside-down cheesecake for my co-worker, our waitress wasn't really around to check up on us to see if we needed anything. Yes, cheesecake factory is a busy place, but there's no reason to skip on the service. I had a good time here though and will see if fate will give me an opportunity to go back and try the Cheesecake Factory again. PROS: incredibly vast menu selection, delicious cheesecakes CONS: pricey, servers not available at times"
Ben C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,156,,4.0,12/22/2009,"If you're on a diet don't bother coming here.  Now, if you have an appetite (and patience..the wait for anything..seating..food..an extra fork..is long), you'll probably take a liking to this place. I'm not going to be a food snob here and look down on The Cheesecake Factory just because it's a chain. This is one of my favorite chains because of the hearty entrees, satisfying appetizers, and great, huge portions of cheesecake slices. My favorites are the Tex Mex Rolls, Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip, Cobb Salad, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (although I can do without the chicken and just have the shrimp), and Oreo cheesecake to take home and eat for dessert (because my friends and I are always too stuffed to eat it at the restaurant).  The downsides pretty much have to do with the size of the place: it is huge and it's very hard to flag down your waiter/waitress. The menu is extensive so it's hard to decide what to get and of course with a large menu, there's always the risk of something not being made well. It's no fine dining, but it's a nice time when all you want is to eat a heavy dinner and chat with some friends. I no longer live out in Queens (it was less than a 25 minute drive) but if I'm ever around Roosevelt Mall, I always try to return to The Cheesecake Factory. I've also been to the one near Topanga Mall in Cali and it was the same, dependable dishes, only I believe that one was just set up differently. One of my favorite chains, you can't go wrong."
Dawn R.,"East Northport, NY",32,56,74,4.0,8/19/2008,"The food is really good, there was a decent selection to choose from. I think I got lucky and didn't have to wait too long to be seated. The prices are reasonable and the cheesecake selection is crazy so many to choose from. I have only been there once but I would definately go back"
Tino G.,"Astoria, NY",44,138,1,1.0,10/9/2008,"Food is just ok, cheesecake with a gray curly hair in it... not so much.  Safe to say won't be going back there again."
Marie T.,"New York, NY",1,23,2,1.0,1/19/2014,"Where to start? Well, after waiting an hour for a table. We attempted to order our dinners. My husband requested no mushrooms on his burger, the waitress said they cannot do that. Ok, weird, but ok. Next item he tried to order they were out of. Ok, strike 2. Finally got our food. I noticed mine was only warm, not hot. After taking a forkful of mashed potatoes I found a piece of ""mystery meat"" inside the potatos. I took it out and cut into it to see what it was. It was not from my entree and had the consistancy of styrofoam. I sent it back, at this point frustrated after waiting so long for such a horrible experience. Just one more reason I will probably never eat at a chain resturaunt again. What a waste of a Saturday evening. We also noticed 2 other tables sending food back. I cannot understand how it was so packed! Oh and to top it off, the manager or whoever came over to me after the whole ordeal, apologized and then asked if I wasn't mistaken, that maybe it was a root!! A ROOT??? The idea of a large chunk of meat being mistaken as some sort of root is completely ridiculous. If they have roots growing out of their potatoes, there is a serious problem going on there. Either this guy thinks I am a complete idiot, or he is not too bright.  I told him to go in the kitchen, find my plate and take a look for himself. I don't even know how he had the gall to question me without seeing it with his own 2 eyes. Unreal."
Christina G.,"Kew Gardens, NY",2,15,,3.0,12/27/2009,"The cheesecake factory is definitely a hot spot on Old Country Road. Wait time is definitely and issue, but the food makes it up for the most part. Those ""being bad"" cravings are met when I eat here and they dont come back for a while. ( i love being BAD) The floor is super slippery though, as if they mop the floor with the lard from the deep fryer. My end point is that after some shopping at Roosevelt Field or even the Source (for the H&M) or before watching a movie at the Loews, The cheesecake factory ends the night off on a nice note."
Wing L.,"BAYSIDE HILLS, NY",46,38,2,4.0,8/19/2011,"Whenever we're shopping near Roosevelt Field Mall, My wife and I always stop by here. The food is always great. I can never make up my mind on what to order. I always leave having over eaten. The only problem is I hate waiting for any restaurant. And we always have to wait here. At least they have a beeper system so I can step away while we wait."
Danielle M.,"Long Beach, NY",330,271,,4.0,7/7/2008,Oh the the Cheesecake factory.  They have delicious Godiva cheesecake. Mmmmm mmmm good.
Tiffanee Li C.,"Glen Oaks, NY",0,16,,3.0,3/2/2012,"worth the drive over there for the cheesecake, but not for anything else.  had a chicken sandwich- the cheese was rubbery, and the bacon tasted like plastic.  none of the dishes came out at the same time... by the time my friends all got their food, it was all cold.  do it for dessert, but only if you aren't waiting for more than 20 minutes."
Lindsey L.,"New York, NY",4,100,8,2.0,3/23/2013,they've changed a lot of the recipes. it's not as good as it used to be. still loving the avacado eggrolls though.
Maria T.,"Beechhurst, NY",0,24,,3.0,10/22/2011,"Mediocre taste as this it typical for chain restaurants. The portions are huge, but it is not something I would accept eating the next day. As for the cheesecakes, I have eaten much better and definitely much fresher (only the whipped cream that they put on top tastes really fresh). I would go only if nothing else is around."
Katherine L.,"Uniondale, NY",7,71,3,3.0,1/3/2009,"Never my first choice when I'm in the area-but if its not the weekend its ok. Get an appetizer (corn tamales are a must!), share a salad, down a drink or two, and devour some nummy cheesecake-SKIP the entrees-they're not very good"
Guan-Tai C.,"Carle Place, NY",15,122,48,4.0,5/2/2007,"I've been meaning to try this place out for the past decade and I finally got around to it this past weekend. We made the big mistake of going at 8:30pm on a Friday night. Which, as we all know, is the most busiest time of the night for most restaurants. We had to wait 40min before we got a table and I figured we'd have to wait an additional 40min before we got our meals. However, despite how busy the place was, we still got our food very quickly. Our waitress did a great job servicing us. The food was good and I really liked the decor. I would definitely go back again. (I'm not a fan of cheesecake so I can't really comment on how good their's is)."
r b.,"Rosedale, NY",47,87,27,4.0,8/26/2005,"Okay. To me you only go here for the dessert. I'm sorry, but the food (and the portions) suck majorly, and it's quite costly, but the cheesecake makes up for it. My fav is the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake. Prices start at $7.50 for a slice, but it is soooo worth it."
John P.,"Long Island City, NY",0,38,,4.0,3/26/2009,avocado spring rolls. nuff said.
andrew r.,"Floral Park, NY",11,57,4,4.0,2/9/2006,"Yes, the wait sucks. Yes, the food is good. Is it worth it?  You'll have to decide for yourself.  Personally, I've never had a bad meal here.  The Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps are a nice starter. And the Orange Chicken is good stuff. Salads are nice and large. And the desserts are sweeeet. Prices are reasonable, the menu selection is varied (the menu is so long they found room for advertisements), and the atmosphere is comfortable. Listen people, you're in a mall - what do you want?  Some of the staffers seem self-important and empowered when they hand out beepers. Hey, I guess it's cooler than handing out free samples of bourbon chicken by the food court."
