Kim W.,"New York, NY",19,240,31,4.0,6/3/2010,"I love cheesecake factory but they lose one star b/c wait times are always super long.  There is a reason for the super long wait and that's b/c their dishes are really awesome.  If you truly don't want to wait for 1.5+ hours, then come on a weekday or come on off times when the crowd isn't so large.  I guarantee you'll like it.  My favorite dish is the farfelle with chicken and roasted garlic.  I recently went back and decided to try something new.  My new found favorite is the shrimp pasta special & the warm crab & artichoke dip as an appetizer.  The pasta dish had white wine with lemon and capers and chicken.  It was really delicious and it tasted like they tossed the pasta with cheese.  The warm crab & artichoke dip was creamy and a little tuna-ish but it was still really good.  I'm not a big cheesecake lover but the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake is the only cheesecake I'll eat. :)  They make an awesome lava flow too.  If you're unsure what to get b/c the menu's so large, don't be scared to ask your waiter.  They'll definitely point you in the right direction.  Man, I'm hungry just thinking about their food! :)"
Joseph G.,"Little Neck, NY",2,182,,4.0,10/14/2005,"Obviously the person who said that the food here ""majorly sucks"" did not get the chicken salad sandwich, which is the best I've ever had. It;s got chopped nuts and celery in it and comes on some kind of focaccia (sp?) bread that's awesome and a full salad. True, the prices are pretty steep which accounts for the star missing in the rating......this sandwich, for example, might run you 9-10 dollars plus tax and tip, but I think it's worth it. And the desserts, predictably, are amazing. A good place for a date or special meal in my opinion."
John P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,20,4.0,9/1/2012,reliable and consistent.  what can i say.  love the steak diane and the avocado rolls.  but have to spend 2 hours at the gym to make up for it.  we're here once a month at least.... too bad the rest of the mall is dying.  the mall is emptier and emptier every time we visit.
Victor C.,"New York, NY",0,55,,1.0,10/25/2010,"My wife and sister-in-law and two kids went there a few days ago. They ordered 4 or 5 dishes, including a rice dish and when my sister was chewing on her rice, felt pain as she had bitten a chunk of glass. She called over the manager who apologized and said that never happened before, etc. But still it happened. They only offered to not charge her for the rice dish. Beware, I think this is a sign of disgusting kitchen management."
Lynn J.,"Bellmore, NY",5,16,,4.0,2/13/2011,they have takeout!  it only took half an hour while everyone was waiting an hour and a half to be seated.  got some sliders and a santa fe salad oh and of course a white chocolate raspberry slice of cheesecake.  salad was fresh and crunchy with dressings on the side.  wonderful.
M K.,"Bayside, NY",0,31,,3.0,1/25/2010,"Let me preface my review with the following disclaimer  - I always rate places on a relative scale. For example, giving Cheesecake factory a 3 star rating does NOT mean I think it is a 3 star establishment on a global scale. It means that I consider it a 3 star restaurant as compared to other restaurants in its category. Okay, not that that's clear....We waited over an hour and a half for a table on a Saturday night, which is long, but I don't mind waiting most nights. It's good time to catch up with friends over drinks and it creates anticipation for the meal that's coming. So we finally sat down and ordered some drinks and the appetizer sampler. When the apps came, I dove right into the guac and chips and was not disappointed. Yummy, it's pretty hard to mess with guac and chips. Then I moved on the next item and although I was not sure what it was, tasted it. Hmm, interesting. Sweet and savory at once. Some kind of asian inspired flavor. Hey, does anyone at the table know what this is? Blank stares.  Shrug. Okay, let's move on to item #3. Hmmm, almost the same as item 2. Does anyone know what this is? Again, shrugs and deer-in-headlight stares. Have we had too many Stellas? What the heck is going on here? Everything on the app plate looked different, tasted eerily the same and no one could identify any of it. Thankfully, the main courses were actually identifiable and tasted much better. I sampled hubby's burger and it was yummy. My own dish (Steak Diane with shrimp in basil sauce) was pretty good too. The basil sauce was great. Dessert was predictable, but good. All in all, an okay night with some pretty decent food. Would I frequent this place? No way. Maybe once or twice a year. There are too many better places out there. This is NY!"
