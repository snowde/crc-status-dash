Ovon D.,"JAMAICA, NY",1,34,65,5.0,5/14/2017,"Have been going to this location for longer than I can remember. This time on Mother's Day, our server Beatriz was fantastic despite the frantic atmosphere in the restaurant. After waiting an hour and a half for a table () we got a booth upstairs (1st win) then Bea promptly met us at our table and took our drink and appetizer order.  Unbelievably, our appetizers came out quickly and when promised. She came by 3-4 times to check on us and make sure we were ok, and I know she must've been juggling multiple tables. We got our extras and entrees just as we asked, and there was ZERO laps in service. She even hooked us up with free apple juices for the kids. Bravo, Beatriz, and bravo to the staff of Cheesecake Factory for living up to the challenge of a ridiculously busy Sunday."
MichaelAnthony C.,"Franklin Square, NY",114,59,30,4.0,2/10/2017,"Always enjoy this restaurant.  I have not had many bad meals here and there is always such a large selection of food to choose from. Love the appetizers and main dishes, always recommend.  Only issue is the wait times, this place is packed on weekends - minimum 45 minute wait guaranteed.  I've gone on weekdays and we usually get a seat in under 15 minutes, which is key for kids on a school night."
Brent T.,"Queens, NY",8,5,1,1.0,10/2/2017,Horrible service on my birthday service Melissa totally forgot about my entire family for a big group when it was dessert time. Herb crusted salmon was bland don't think I'm coming back here any time soon.  Played 5 games of cards before anyone even took our dessert order. This is the worst time I ever had at Cheesecake Factory. Totally disappointed
Latoya M.,"Hempstead, NY",79,36,34,4.0,2/1/2017,"This was my first visit here, one Sunday after church in December. I was so pleased that my party of 6 was seated immediately. I was quite delighted with the huge varied selections on the menu. We all got something different and all I heard was ooohhh, yummmmm, this is so good. Needless to say we were happy campers. Only downside was the waitress' poor attitude ( very unpleasant), didn't seem like she wanted to serve us at all but we got her back with the tip. Will I visit again? Absolutely!!"
Notoya S.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,132,502,3.0,3/22/2017,"I do enjoy eating at the Cheese cake factory however standing and waiting in a small lobby / waiting area is such a deterrent. I called maybe about 40-45 prior to going to the location only to find out that they do not take RSVP. Once there we had a hour wait.  Once we were finally seated I must say that the food was bought to us in a timely matter and we didn't feel rushed . Overall, the service was ok."
Jay S.,"Merrick, NY",0,3,,1.0,11/28/2017,"Food poisoning for sure. Will NEVER eat here again. I frequent all kinds of restaurants daily- I am honestly disturbed that I was EXTREMELY ILL from a buffalo chicken appetizer and a margarita. The management team should be more aware of the old sour mix at the bar, and/ or the bacteria infested food."
Lina A.,"Brooklyn, NY",300,225,2798,4.0,11/30/2015,"Oh me oh my........I love the Cheesecake Factory!  The service is exceptional.....the servers are always on point. The bussers are overly anxious to clear your table even though you are still dining......sheesh breath....exhale......relax a bit.  The food is always so good and the pumpernickel bread is my favorite....I always request more lol. My friend ordered shrimp Alfredo which he was enjoying until he noticed that several of the pasta was clumped together, so I told him to request another plate because that wasn't cool at all.  The manager came over to ask what was wrong with the dish and was happy to replace it with a new order after my friend showed him what was wrong with it.  I absolutely love the dessert section of the menu which is so extensive, makes it so hard to just choose one selection because of the different varieties of cheesecake and other desserts.  I will definitely be back soon and I do recommend this restaurant to others as well."
Michelle D.,"Jamaica, NY",3,18,24,5.0,4/11/2017,"AMAZING, this is a staple forever in my mental notes, the service was awesome . But my food was even greater I ordered the Chipotle chicken which was a bit spicy but perfect and the portion size was big enough for me to have left overs the next day! Wether on a date or just a family outing this is the place to be the choices of food & desserts are ENDLESS ."
Sophia G.,"New York, NY",1,4,1,1.0,9/2/2017,"I bought the original cheesecake. From the display, I saw a nicely decorated with cream and what not.. that's what I ordered when I purchased the original whole cheesecake. But what I got was the factory made frozen cheesecake. Just the same thing which I can pick up from costco. Such a disappointment from the bakery shop. Will never buy cakes from here ever again."
Jihye B.,"Levittown, NY",219,113,126,4.0,12/22/2015,"It's a chain, so I feel it is only fair to compare it to the other Cheesecake Factory nearby at Walt Whitman Mall. This restaurant is two floors and there was ample parking, even on a busy Friday night. We went early, so were promptly seated, although when we left at 7:30 that was no longer the case. The one at Walt Whitman is smaller and more crowded, imo.  My table ordered a few appetizers. The spinach dip was good and the Tex-Mex egg rolls were bomb, but the Vietnamese spring roll was hard and underseasoned. It looked like they had pre-made the rolls and left it in the fridge, but you can't do that with rice paper because it gets so dry and hard so quickly.  I had the fish tacos for my entree. The tacos were good but what I was really pleased by were the black beans on the side. The other girls at my table seemed to enjoy their sandwiches, pasta, and salad.  Then, the cheesecake! I love the cheesecakes but they're on the expensive side. I ordered three more slices to take home for other people and it was over 20 dollars. The cheesecake creations are unique, certainly, but I could get a whole pie of cheesecake for that price.  Our servers (another girl had to help our original server for some reason, no biggie) were polite and they bothered to check up on whether everything was okay, etc.. But when I was getting the cheesecakes from the front, one server started to yell and be rude to her fellow waiter. It was uncomfortable.  Overall, it's a chain restaurant and you shouldn't expect bold or concise flavors, but they're consistent and safe enough to cater to a wide audience."
Jerett G.,"Woodmere, NY",38,350,108,4.0,3/5/2017,"Brought the wife here for a much needed date night. Being in The Source mall is a little sad given the mall is basically abandoned except for a few remaining stores. As for the location, it is easy to get to and the parking is abundant. It does get a little crazy on the weekends, but I feel the waiting time goes by pretty fast. As for the food, if you have been to one Cheesecake Factory you have been to them all. The food is delicious and consistent to what I would expect. My only complaint is that our waiter went on break in the middle of our meal so it felt like we were a little forgotten for a period of time. All in all it was a great evening and we will definitely be back."
Christopher S.,"Queens Village, NY",115,61,105,4.0,7/18/2016,"This is our 2nd time going to this Cheesecake Factory. We went on a Friday night and had waited 15 minutes (not bad) and went upstairs. The waiter, Mike, was a cool guy. We gave him our list of drinks and appetizers and he didn't even write it down. We were impressed with his memory since the menu has at least 1,000 items on it. We only wanted to try the appetizers this time. We had ordered the chicken pot stickers, southern fried chicken sliders and eggroll sampler. The southern fried chicken with fries could have been better. They were very salty. Now the chicken pot stickers were very good! One thing though about the eggroll sampler..they give you 4 pairs of different eggrolls. We just didn't care for the avocado in the eggroll. Next time we will focus on the other three..Tex Mex, Crispy Cuban and Firecracker Salmon. The Firecracker Salmon eggroll was the best...hands down!! Now for the drinks. My wife had ordered the Factory Peach Bellini. She took one sip and said it was too fruity. So of course..like a typical wife..she had tasted my drink (Caribbean Cooler) and took my drink yet passed me hers. I only had a sip of that Island type drink! You all need to try the Caribbean Cooler!! We were so stuffed with food that we had to take two cheesecakes home. I am not a cheesecake person but I loved the Hershey's Chocolate Bar cheesecake. The added chocolate chips made it even more decadent. My wife loved the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake. We definitely will be going back in a week or so since we had a good time."
Belchicnyc B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,,1.0,11/18/2017,My experience was really bad because I took my lil 7 year old niece for her birthday to Cheesecake Factory in garden city and the waiter name Melissa M didn't sing or wish with her crew even though I requested her to do so in the beginning. She really ruined the moment for us. Never going back to this location.
Goksun a.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,28,37,5.0,4/17/2017,"My favorite is fresh strawberry cheesecake....! It's delicious.Friendly staff, clean and fast service."
Carrie F.,"Phoenix, AZ",94,108,103,3.0,8/11/2016,"Came here for dinner on a wed night at about 830pm was shocked at how busy they were.  It's a two story restaurant yet they were only serving on the second floor? Wait was 20 min, not bad went quick but just seemed like a cluster of people crammed right in front of the take out area.   Food- the brown bread to start is deadly - very good - try not to get full on it alone.  Avocado rolls was the app we ordered they were tasty but the dipping sauce it came with was the best part.  As for my main dish- the menu is extremely overwhelming , to me when restaurants have so many options they tend to lack on taste with the dishes.  Ordered the Kobe burger - was ok nothing amazing, I tried the other dishes that people had ordered and overall nothing special most lacked flavor.  I can see why I don't come often.  The only good thing about the large menu is we dined with a diverse groups of eaters ( picky, vegan, and vegetarian) and everyone was able to get a dish."
Shari P.,"Hempstead, NY",619,218,2275,2.0,10/25/2015,"Ugh. Every time someone coerces me into coming here I'm always left disappointed & wanting to never return. There's just nothing about Cheesecake Factory (besides their cheesecake --the irony) that makes me ever want to come here. They aren't in my top 10 or my top 30 list of go-to places for food. Never ate anything memorable here like wow I need that again asap. Just blah  Today my father begged me to pick him up some food so I said let me give their ""curbside to go"" a try. I called in my order on the phone and they also had a designated parking spot for that. You give them a call when you get there and someone will come down and bring you your food to your car. If you're paying with a credit card they will take it and go back inside to swipe then return with the receipt. Whatever works-- I ran out the house looking a mess so that was my only option lol. I won't say it's not really convenient so kudos for that.  As for food, I ordered the spicy chicken pasta which wasn't spicy and very tasteless. The pasta was undercooked and the chicken was just huge chunks and under-seasoned. It was greasy and I couldn't even finish it because it was just so bland. I felt like I was eating just to eat and I prefer to enjoy my meals.  This is why I don't like this place. Just like its twin Grand Luxe they don't have any specialities. Nothing memorable--20 menu pages of crap. They need to really cut their menu in half and work on perfecting a few dishes. Sorry but I'm not sorry."
Isaiah F.,"Freeport, NY",3,3,1,1.0,5/14/2017,"This is probably the worst chained restaurant to be honest. I was here before and it was soooo good. But I think they changed employees this time, my waffles are burnt, my strawberries taste like fish, and the put nuts on my food when I didn't order it. I'm allergic to nuts. Definitely not coming again"
Naresh S.,"Queens Village, NY",3,48,83,4.0,8/21/2017,"This place would have been 5 stars had they taken reservations. We arrived at 7PM Saturday evening so waiting for a table was expected to be a an hour or so. We ended up being seated at 9PM. Two hours we waited, to me I thought that was too long. But nevertheless the four stars are for our server and for the food. The dishes which were Jamaican black pepper shrimp, rib eye steak, chicken pasta just to name a few, the food and appetizer are delicious highly recommend this place if you have not been here yet. The decor is warm and welcoming. Our server was tentative always coming around and the food was fairly quick to come out with all dishes coming out at the same time. The place wouldn't be called cheese cake factory if they did not serve cheese cakes. Let me tell you they have about 32 different types of cheese cakes and we tried about 6 different ones and all tasted awesome. So stop by if your in the mood just for cheese cake you won't be disappointed."
Serena N.,"Jersey City, NJ",115,528,7140,2.0,2/19/2017,"Stopped by here for lunch and was a little surprised by the lack of service. We went upstairs to be seated at there was no hostess in sight for at least 10 minutes. Once seated, our server took our order but never offered us any bread, we actually had to ask her for it. The table next to use was brought bread right away. We also notice they received a medley of breads and all we got was 1 kind. We ordered the chicken samosas which were oily and over salted. The avocado egg rolls were really good. For lunch we got the pizza and salad special.  The pizza was not good, did not taste fresh at all and was ready made. The salad was a basic Cesar salad. We also ordered the Cobb Salad which was $14.95 for the regular portion, this came with chicken: I asked for a side of grilled salmon in addition to the salad which the menu stated was an extra $5. I expected to pay $19.95 for a chicken and salmon Cobb salad. I clearly told my server I want both. When I received my salad there was no chicken in it, just the salmon. I figured the server didn't hear me and that she substituted the salmon for the chicken. When I received the bill I was charged $18.95 for the salad. For the extra $1 I could have had both the chicken and salmon which is what I wanted. Very poor service, server wasn't not paying attention at all and was in another world. I emailed the business about my experience and spoke to a a manager who just said 'thanks for the feedback.' Ummm what about the fact I didn't get what I ordered and was charged extra for something I didn't didn't receive."
Joshua F.,"Brooklyn, NY",38,100,18,1.0,2/8/2017,"I'm here right now finishing my meal - it was just plain awful. My partner and I started going as a joke a few months back and even though the service is beyond subpar, we ordered good items and the experience was somewhat kitschy and we kept making the drive from Brooklyn and went back. The past couple times, it's just gone downhill. The burger- which is suppose to be medium rare ordered- has come well done or medium well at best, and the last two times I've had to sit and watch my date eat his meal while I wait for them to make a new burger. The service here is so inconsistent. I also am not a huge fan of how my issue with the burger was corrected this time around. If I have to wait 30 minutes after our appetizer for mains then another 20 minutes for my burger done to the correct temperature I ordered, then why am I not checked in on by a manager or something? Or something taken off the check?  I think this is a sign not to go here anymore. Oops, my bad..."
