Chris C.,"Columbus, OH",189,96,228,4.0,12/27/2017,"Christmas Eve and took my daughter out for lunch and some shopping at Crocker Park, ended up at Cheesecake Factory....No wait, but fairly crowded inside...When I visit any CF I always order the Thai Lettuce Wraps as a starter, basically it's chicken satay, with 8-10 pieces of bibb lettuce, accompanied with chopped cucumbers, shaved carrots, cilantro,   Thai noodles and 3 sauces (all 3 are excellent) - Thai Chili Sauce, Peanut Sauce and a Tamarind Sauce, trust me when you construct that 1st wrap  try 1 or all 3 on your creation - you won't be sorry.....Daughter and I enjoyed the wraps - they never disappoint....For our lunch I ordered a Fried Chicken sandwich on a Brioche Bun, with a side on Buffalo Sauce and Fries, my daughter order a Pasta Evelyn dish which is rigatoni pasta with pesto sauce, roasted red peppers, pine nuts, broccoli and shallots.....The sandwich came with lettuce and tomato and slice of pepper jack cheese and blue cheese dressing....definitely recommend it, big piece of chicken that was cooked perfectly accompanied by buffalo sauce and blue cheese (it's a winner)...My daughter's pasta looked good, she said it was too much for her so she boxed it up for later.....we both agreed that we would split a piece of cheesecake (duh), we order a lemon meringue cheesecake...presentation was pretty....cheesecake was a bit dry, but taste was good.....I like CF's, I usually get a good meal and walk away full and satisfied, the CF at Crocker Park fit the bill as my daughter and I enjoyed our Christmas Eve lunch...."
John Z.,"Lakewood, OH",13,5,16,1.0,12/24/2017,"I bought three 10"" cheesecakes for Christmas Eve. After standing around for almost 30 minutes, the cheesecakes were mercifully extracted from the refrigerator-freezer and I made my escape. But not before paying $165 for 3 cheesecakes. BTW, that weren't busy...at all! I was told that they were still a bit frozen, but if I left them out for 2-3 hours, then they would be fine: ""ready to serve."" Not wanting to leave anything to chance, we waited SIX hours, and after SIX hours, the cheesecakes were STILL rock hard! Our children took their children home, the expensive dessert still intact. Perhaps we'll try to chisel some free at midnight. What a waste of $165.00!"
Colie R.,"New York, NY",44,110,219,3.0,7/11/2017,"I came here with a party of 4 on a Friday afternoon and everything was fine. The Cheesecake Factory for the most part has pretty average food I feel.  The service was fine, our drinks were refilled quickly.  Our waitress was friendly.  I'm a really big fan of the fact when you order Ginger Ale you get it in a Canada Dry Glass bottle with a cup to pour it in. Our table ended up getting:  Fresh Basil, Tomato and Cheese Flatbread - This small plate was very small.  I would have enjoyed had the pieces been a little bigger as the tomatoes were almost the same size as the piece of flatbread themselves.  Skinnylicious Factory Chopped Salad- Julienne Romaine, Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Avocado, Corn, Bacon. Blue Cheese and Apple with Our Vinaigrette.  The person got this because it was under 500 calories and it was enjoyed.  You get a lot of salad in it.  Skinnylicious Asian Chicken Salad- Grilled Chicken, Romaine, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Green Onions, Cilantro, Rice Noodles, Wontons, Almonds and Sesame Seeds Served with Our SkinnyLicious® Sesame-Soy Dressing.  The one complaint on this one was there was barely any salad dressing on this so she just had to order an extra side of it Sweet Potato Fries with Aioli Sauce -  The fries were okay, I've had some with much better seasoning and flavoring, felt the fries didn't have a ton of flavor, the aioli sauce did help though.  Overall this isn't a bad place to come if you are shopping in Crocker Park."
Breanna L.,"Avon, OH",72,28,7,2.0,12/23/2017,"We love getting curbside from here. Probably do so once a week. Tonight we ordered steak and meatloaf..both the same price. The meatloaf had a ton of mashed potatoes and the steak probably had 1.5 Tablespoons of mashed potatoes spread out as thin as they could get it. I'm not sure the cooks reasoning behind this but it is absolutely absurd. Giving two stars because the taste of the food did not disappoint. However, do not order steak if you're looking for a portion for an adult..maybe a toddler would be happy."
Margaret F.,"Erie, PA",4,51,221,5.0,10/29/2017,Out of every chain restaurant this is probably the best. Definitely on the pricy side but worth it. But the food is always good and fresh. They do have a large variety on the menu.
Trichia C.,"Norwalk, OH",0,3,,5.0,1/5/2018,"As always, the food and service was nothing short of amazing. Our server even sang our son happy birthday and decorated his cheesecake plate so nicely as well as even a candle in his cheesecake. We live an hour away but always make the trip as much as we can"
Tiffany S.,"Avon, OH",96,199,152,5.0,10/9/2017,"If you like to make sure there's something for everyone, you'll love the Cheesecake Factory. Their menu is practically the size of a small encyclopedia! Sooooooo many selections, everything is tasty and the portion sizes are ginormous. I usually order the crusted romano chicken w/pasta and made to order red sauce,  eat about 1/3 of it then pack up the rest for home so I have room for the banana cream pie cheesecake -- PHENOMENAL! The service is great, and the atmosphere is your typical CF- high ceilings, beautiful paintings, over-the-top lighting and marble table tops. Be prepared for a wait if you go on the weekend. We usually have one of our party go put in our name, while the rest of us do a little shopping :)"
Ashley L.,"Westlake, OH",175,174,377,2.0,6/1/2017,"Cheesecake Factory: I am officially closing the book on you. A few weeks ago my family and I visited you as I suspect was due solely on behalf of the Abilene paradox. Using Yelp check in as my time frame for reference, I started recording the times.  Sat at 9:20 Ordered at approximately 9:30 Received first dinner at 9:50 Received second dinner at 9:58 Received third dinner at 10:06 Received fourth dinner at 10:12 As you can see from above, each of our dinners arrived with (by restaurant time standards) a huge gap in time in between them. If this was a business meeting or a date where one would have to wait to eat, each person's dinner would grow cold as it sat there. Since it was my family, I just watched everyone else eat while I waited for mine. A 22 minute time frame from when my sister got her dinner at 9:50! Either the server and/or kitchen has a very poor time management skills or food time management. Our server, who was very nice, seemed in over her head, disorganized, and very stressed. We were very patient and nice to her despite our frustrations.  To make matters worse, I later left a complaint on Cheesecake Factory's Web page and heard nothing back from them. In all honesty, all I wanted was acknowledgment.  Overall, the food is too expensive and mediocre. The service was not up to par. There are so many other ""elegant"" restaurants that I would rather enjoy visiting, so that is what I will do! Buh BYE, Cheesecake Factory."
Nancy K.,"Cleveland, OH",124,229,400,3.0,5/26/2017,"Service was slow, so slow the guys next to us asked to have part of their meal comp'd. We stuck through it bc we love the cheesecake factory food. My shepherd's pie was great. Tasty and hearty on a cold day. My bf's burger also was satisfying. I was tempted to get my cheesecake before the food but wrestled my inner 10-year-old in favor of getting cherry cheesecake after my food. It was amazing. It made the sucky service worth it."
Doni F.,"Twinsburg, OH",68,403,646,4.0,9/26/2017,"Oh, I don't go There often but when I do, I head straight For the cheesecake. Yes. Although, their actually lunch and dinner menu is well worth ordering from Cuban Bites, Sandwiches, Salads...the works. However, today it was the Classic Cheesecake and it was creamy and freshly made you could taste no back taste from storing. My companion had the Mango and Keylime Cheesecake and enjoyed the combination. I'm sure most of you have stopped into a Cheesecake Factory if you live in the area, but for those who haven't, please do. As I said, they have a regular lunch and dinner menu with many choices as well as a variety of drinks, teas, an open bar, and desserts.  The restaurant is large, roomy, casual, fun for the family or just a nice stop. Staff is pleasant and well trained. This place can also be so packed at certain times of the day or weekdays that you may have to wait, or walk. So, I would recommend selecting midday if you are at leisure."
Mark V.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",0,45,1,1.0,11/12/2017,By far the worst service I have ever received at a Cheesecake Factory. The wait staff rushed us and the kitchen staff was loud and very rude. We ended up leaving .  I contacted the chain but they had no interest in speaking with me.
Ashley O.,"Cleveland, OH",25,280,334,4.0,9/13/2016,"My husband and I ordered takeout for our anniversary. It was easy to order, but then we had a few issues with pick up. First, it took a really long time for our food to be ready and then when we went to park in the designated togo spots, they were filled but no one was inside. I ordered the chicken Madeira which was good, but I lost all of my sauce in my mashed potatoes. Next time, I'll ask for some extra on the side.  My husband got the Cuban and fries and thought they were good. We ordered two cheesecake slices, which were of course the best part."
Jim C.,"Sheffield Lake, OH",46,66,51,4.0,2/22/2017,"My wife and I arrived at 5pm on a Friday and chose to sit in the bar area to take advantage of the happy hour offerings. Seating was plentiful throughout the restaurant. Ambiance was inviting and appearance was clean. Server was pleasant and offered advice when I had questions. At 6pm, the lights were dimmed and atmosphere became more intimate.  We both ordered spicy chicken sandwiches for our main course but started with the happy hour discounted nachos as an appetizer. Drinks were discounted (a dollar or two for draft beer). We soon found that our sandwiches, which were large and well prepared (if a bit light on sauce), were completely unnecessary. The nachos were significantly discounted, plentiful, decadent, and delicious! I highly recommend them. Chips must be fried on-site and have a unique, welcome taste to them. They aren't meant for anyone on a diet, as they're loaded with cheese and toppings. We had to pack up our sandwiches after taking a small taste only to check the flavor while still hot. In the future, I would order one or the other. Not both. We also ordered an Adam's Peanut Butter Cheesecake to go and enjoyed it later. Hands down the best I've had."
Lee C.,"Los Angeles, CA",663,15,2,5.0,7/8/2017,"It's been so long since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory. Thanks babe for bringing it up. Our grey goose martinis were amazing especially with the blue cheese olives!!! The ahi tartar is just to die for! If you haven't tried the seared ahi entree or the fish tacos you are missing out!   Friendly environment  Even though it was busy we were sat within 5 minutes.  Our waiter was a bit hoverish, but they still get a 5 star!  We will be back."
Mary Jo S.,"Westlake, OH",6,15,6,3.0,5/16/2017,"Usually a big fan, for a chain, I have enjoyed their wide variety of tasty food .  Not this time, the beet salad was small, dry and tasteless.  My friend had the Sangria, heavily watered down, barely a taste but  a hefty price $10.95.    The chicken pot stickers were wonderful but it ends there.  I'm VBas hoping this was a one time bad hair day."
Monica L.,"Littleton, CO",227,850,,5.0,5/5/2017,Their Factory nachos may be the best nachos on the planet.  They are FANTASTIC!  I recommend getting extra of the delicious pico.
Lisa B.,"Elyria, OH",73,56,265,5.0,8/20/2016,"What can i say,  I love the cheesecake factory. I stop in a few times a year and I love it!  I've never had a bad meal.  Sure it's on the pricey side,  but It's worth it.  I had the Louisiana chicken pasta and it was delicious!  My friend had the Chicken Bellagio...that will be the next thing i try she said it was delicious as well.  We spilt the Turtle cheesecake for desert. 2 thumbs up.  Our waiter was attentive and entertaining.  This location consistently exceeds my expectations. Give them a try,  you won't be sorry"
Christy H.,"North Olmsted, OH",0,8,2,1.0,12/5/2017,"My ABSOLUTE worst experience being here. I've came many times here and never waited THIS long for my main course to come out. I have been very patient with them and waited but by the time the pasta came out, I just honestly didn't have an appetite anymore because i waited so long for my food. The manager came by and apologized and offered us dessert but didn't fix our check even for curtesy of not enjoying or eating my main course. Disappointed at the management and how they want to resolve the situation. Now we know not to come back at that location. Very upset with my visit tonight."
Ron C.,"Sterling Heights, MI",44,1072,3959,3.0,2/18/2016,"Being a fan of the TCF, but not being able to get into the one in metro Detroit, this was a great option. Thankful that they took call ahead seating as we called 90 minutes in advance, Nicole was gifted in hospitality. We arrived at 4:28 , all metered parking .25 per 15  3 hour maximum . The hostess kiosk was empty, no one not one person staffing it, we were part of 2 couples waiting to be *noticed *recognized*seated ( as 5 servers gathered behind the cheesecake display case  ) Finally a manager from the back of the house saw our dilemma, jumped in and sat both parties. Steven was our veteran 11 year server, knew the menu back & forth and was a bigger than life persona . ( when we could track him down as he was a.w.o.l. several times ) Don't get me wrong , very good server, smart & friendly, and got more than 20% , but less time gabbing at every order station with your coworkers would be wise. Now beyond the bumps in the road, our food was 5 stars , and the portions were huge, which provided leftovers and 2nd meals for us both . My wife ordered the:  Crispy Chicken Costoletta Chicken Breast Lightly Breaded and Sautéed to a Crisp Golden Brown.  Served with Lemon Sauce, Mashed Potatoes and Fresh Asparagus. $17   three large chicken breasts lightly breaded and moist through & through. I ordered: Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp Sautéed Shrimp with a Very Spicy Jamaican Black Pepper Sauce. Served with Rice, Black Beans, Plantains and Cool Mango Salsa. Available with Chicken or Chicken and Shrimp. I ordered it with both chicken and shrimp, plus they allowed me to swap out white rice for brown. Both dishes were 5 star in flavor, taste & portion size Boxed 50% of our meals for today's lunch and ordered 2 pieces of cheesecake for home triple vanilla bean & salted caramel food  5 stars seating -staffing -getting the ball going  2 stars"
Ben S.,"Cleveland, OH",271,900,774,5.0,3/12/2016,"This time around, at this location, my Cheesecake experience was surprisingly good, impressively so at times.  The waitress we had was really on top of her game. She was always friendly and checked back at the table at all the right times. She filled drinks right away and even brought my friend fresh limes each time she topped up his drink without him asking for it.  For an appetizer we got the Avocado Eggrolls. They were delicious and I loved dipping them in the Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce. The breading was light and they were packed full of avocado. There was of course the good warm bread and the waitress proactively offered to replenish it.   I tried the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas. The Tomatillo Sauce on top of them was quite flavorful. The portion was appropriate.  My friend got the Luau Salad. The chicken was thinly sliced. The special dressing was a great compliment - very fresh and light. The kitchen did forget the chicken initially, but our waitress was able to quickly rectify the situation.  Another friend ordered the Chicken Bellagio. The chicken was lightly breaded and the cream sauce was light and not overwhelming. The portion was big as the two chicken pieces are served on top pasta.  I would order any of these dishes next time and based on this experience, especially the service, I would consider returning again soon."
Caroline D.,"Brooklyn, NY",634,348,16,2.0,7/30/2016,"Came in on a Saturday for lunch, it was super busy. Our server was a gem, super cheery and helpful with a smile as big as Wyoming. The food is mediocre at best and has no depth of taste.  I had the veggie burger made out of various ingredients, but the main taste was of farro and mushrooms. Honestly it was extremely bland and the only thing that kind of saved the meal was the side salad, which was pretty good.  The fresh baked bread from the beginning of the meal was pretty good, but it took forever to come to our table. Decided to get the Oreo dream cheesecake after our meal. It was so huge, we couldn't even finish it. A mound of chocolate icing on top, but again the flavor was lacking. All we could taste was sugar, no chocolate, no cheesecake, no Oreo, just plain sugar overdose. We left almost half of the slice because it was so lacking. I wouldn't come back to any of these (not about the location) again. The food isn't worth the price and will make you feel heavy and overly full. I don't understand why these restaurants are so popular."
Henry C.,"Rocky River, OH",1,15,,4.0,2/8/2017,"Two of us went in on a week night for an early dinner. We were greeted and seated very quickly to our own little section. Our waiter was prompt to the table to take our drink order but that was the last time. Drinks came very quick after the long delay of telling us it was not available. Not usually a big deal except it was the one advertised on the menu! Ordered the soup and only after 15 minutes after finishing the bread, it arrived. The tortilla soup was very good. But the slow refill made the soup spice linger a little longer. Food finally arrived after the table that sat after us received theirs. We got the Burrito Grande and the Chicken Belligio. The food made up for the wait.  We got the Snickers Cheesecake to go. It was good of course but was just normal cheesecake with a chocolate crust and snickers ice cream topping on top.  It had just enough sweetness to it.  Will be back again but a little shocked at the slow service during a slow time."
Sara P.,"Provo, UT",238,233,88,5.0,2/9/2017,"Typically coming to The Cheesecake Factory means a 10-15 minute wait on weekends. To my surprise I was seated immediately! The portions here are HUGE, so typically I only order an appetizer, which today's choice was the fried mac 'n cheese. Service was a little on the slow side, but they made up for it in the end."
Jean S.,"Lakewood, OH",59,78,155,5.0,2/18/2017,"Trying some fried avacado to die for!  Along with fried mozzarella, zucchini and eggplant!  Amazing!  Lightly  coated with flour, crispy on the outside and light and succulent on the inside!  Also had a Tomato, Mozzarella & Basil  Toast .  In a well done crisp flatbread with Greek yogurt as a spread with luscious toppings as stated above.  Our waiter was great!  Timely service.  Topped it off with a Chocolate Diva Cheesecake that I shared!!!   Amazing experience.  Moderate to high prices but has great lunch specials from 11-5 starting at $11 dollars!  I can't wait to go back!"
Stevie T.,"Massillon, OH",83,2,,3.0,10/7/2017,"We got there after 7, they don't take reservations so we were expecting to wait. We waited for about 45 minutes and our buzzer went off to be seated. We walked over to wait to be seated and a group of 5 that got there after us was seated before us. Then we got drinks. My friends a Moscow Mule, which was I think around $10 and my other friend got a martini that was almost $12. The Moscow Mule did not taste like one, but still was good. The martini was okay. Then they got a Tequila Sunrise and an amaretto sour. Both drinks were way too strong and not made properly. I understand that this is not steakhouse and has cheap food or drinks, but if you're going to charge the corporate price, then the bartenders should know how to make drinks. We got appetizers: macaroni balls, baked potatoes bites and nachos. All were good. Then when we all received our entrées we were disappointed. Four cheese Penne pasta, fish tacos, and I think some type of shrimp scampi. Once again, the price should match the quality. I know we don't live in New England and have catch of the day, but the fish was too ""fishy"" so I assume it wasn't that fresh.  The cheesecake was spot on as always.  They were busy so I understand some things but they could step it up a little.  I've had much better experiences at other locations."
Michele D.,"Cleveland, OH",0,11,4,5.0,11/12/2016,"This was my first visit to The Cheesecake Factory as I had a gift card to use. First of all the decor and ambiance are very appealing. I was expecting it to look like it does on The Big Bang Theory. It is much nicer and more upscale. There was a bar area that looked comfortable and inviting. We were seated promptly. Our waiter was Brian and he was fantastic! He was triple seated in his section and was attentive to all of his tables. He didn't miss a beat and took care of everyone in a timely manner. Super friendly and professional! I ordered a Long Island Ice Tea and it was PERFECT! The menu is extensive ...15 pages or so. There is something for every taste palate! For dinner, I ordered the pork chops and it came with homemade apple sauce.  The food was delicious! I would definitely go back again sometime. The only downside for me is that it's in Crocker Park and I am not a fan. But for those of you that are, I recommend stopping in The Cheesecake Factory for a drink or dinner after you're done with your shopping!"
Alisa I.,"Fort Wayne, IN",9,45,69,4.0,12/24/2016,Really enjoy the small plates and appetizers. They have a lower calorie menu (Skinnylicious Menu) and lots of mixed drink options. And can't forget about the cheesecake!  Yum!
Timothy J.,"Fort Wayne, IN",20,62,99,4.0,12/23/2016,We always have a good meal here and it gives you what you'd expect from this chain.  It's in a great location in Westlake to boot.
Kirk C.,"North Olmsted, OH",0,8,6,5.0,9/19/2016,"The food here is consistently great.  I've tried many items on their extensive menu and I've never been disappointed.  I really enjoy their appetizers, the fried Calamari and Crab Cakes are a couple of my favorites.  The ambience here very nice and the staff are very friendly and attentive.  Lets not forget their incredible cheesecakes, my new favorite is their Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake."
Mary P.,"Cleveland, OH",14,1,,2.0,1/24/2017,"Dear cheesecake factory:  is this your best? We were celebrating with family over some great news and chose your establishment to enjoy creating this family memory.  Unfortunately,  it will be remembered as the memory from a place not to go. We arrived and checked in with our party of 7 just around 6 pm. We were told that all the beepers were dying and to return later to get one. We checked in every 15 min and finally got one. Then we were told to wait a while longer.  It was just past 9 when our dinner order was taken. Some of the table was able to order appetizers and other half  was only offered to order beverages.  The food finally arrived and was mediocre at best with 2 of our diners not liking the entre. It wasnt until the dinner plates were being cleared from the table that we had a opportunity  to express dissatisfaction with the food. We were offered to order something else but at this point everyone else was done with the meal and table cleared. Honestly, the 4 hour experience wasn't worth the wait or the insult of finding that parking ticket on our window after. Spending such a disappointing amount of time at your establishment.   Getting  slapped with a parking ticket was quite a surprise since we parked in your lot and went along  the ridiculousness  required to eat there. Clearly  spending our time and money at your establishment was a very bad idea. Memories taken that night include: the 2.5 hours plus for a table. The not so great food, unrecognized disatisfaction with 2 meals or checking back in a timely fashion to see, and lastly the 30 dollar ticket. I hope it's very clear to you we will never be back and we have taken the time to alert friends and family of things to expect should they still feel like throwing away time and money here. #Sorrynotsorry #disappointmentatthecheesecakefactory"
Camille M.,"Berea, OH",0,12,,4.0,8/11/2016,"The cheesecake is just phenomenal. Expensive, yes, but eating a slice of cheesecake is a meal in itself: so rich and wonderful. The food is average. It's good, but nothing fantastic for the price. Lunch portions are a better deal, but again, the food is nothing phenomenal compared to other restaurants in the surrounding area. I'll regularly stop in to just get a piece of cheesecake to go, which they'll happily box up for you with a cute side of whipped cream in the container."
Steve K.,"Norwalk, OH",42,144,1194,4.0,3/23/2016,"We just stopped in to pick up dessert for a friend. Fast service, but could be friendlier. No issues, or complaints! (Maybe get some animal product free desserts...)"
Bill B.,"Littleton, CO",1,134,4,3.0,10/10/2016,My family of 4 plus a uncle ate here for dinner before heading back to Denver.    Around 3 pm. Seated fast. Staff friendly.   Food great as always.   My daughter ordered the bang bang shrimp and thought it was the best thing she has ever eaten at the CCF.
Cassie B.,"Cleveland, OH",42,85,145,2.0,12/3/2016,"The food choices are plentiful. It's definitely one of the better chain restaurants. I usually get corn tamales which are good. My complaint is an unnecessarily mean girl working the hostess station. I got confused about our seating and asked a question, very nicely. She looked at me like I was an idiot and snapped at me. She was awful. I would avoid coming back here just because of her unpleasantness. Seriously, even if someone is having a bad night, don't take it out on your customers."
Jon S.,"Parma, OH",52,16,14,2.0,3/26/2017,"We decided to take a rare visit to a chain restaurant. The place is huge! Ambiance and decor is very inviting. But that's where it ends. Although the menu is quite large, the prices are quite high, and the food pretty mediocre. Drink prices are too high! Almost $12 for a Jameson Irish martini??   I thought the $19 I paid for my Bang Bang shrimp/chicken was not worth it.  Was somewhat on the bland side. Guess I'll stick to the mom n pop locally owned restaurants."
Jesse G.,"North Baltimore, OH",11,84,75,5.0,8/7/2016,We had our first experience with Cheesecake Factory here. We ordered the spicy chicken noodle meal and it was awesome. The meal and bread was very filling and tasty.  We washed down our meal with lemon raspberry cheesecake and it was awesome.  Our staff was very friendly and took care of us very well. Great experience and we will visit again.
Valerie R.,"Studio City, CA",80,2,,4.0,2/26/2017,"We came at a really busy time so service was sort of slow but our waitress was good. Super friendly and the drinks were good, food was excellent. I ordered garlic pasta and it was to die for.  It was a little loud for my liking and there were tons of families in there for a sunday afternoon. Tbis happens to be b onenof my favorite places to eat in the  Crocker Park area."
Brittni Z.,"Avon Lake, OH",37,4,5,5.0,2/26/2017,Great food and choices of wines and liquor... can't say anything negative about this place besides the wait time to be seated. That's expected on a Saturday night though.
Mary B.,"Cleveland, OH",21,1,,1.0,2/21/2017,"Follow up from our dinner Jan 21, 2017 review listed under Mary P.  The Cheesecake Factory responded and asked that I visit their website. I have responded twice and I have heard nothing back from them.  It looks as if their online - yelp attempt to resolve this issue was fake. Not sure why they would tell me to contact them for nothing."
Megan W.,"Westlake, OH",0,1,,2.0,7/30/2017,"I usually love coming here but more than likely will never come to this location again. I have been waiting for a single piece of cheesecake for over 40 minutes. All they keep saying when I ask how much longer is soon. Horrible, horrible customer service. They should be ashamed of themselves!"
