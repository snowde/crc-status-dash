Chrishana B.,"Cleveland, OH",82,101,128,5.0,4/29/2014,"I've never been a Cheesecake food chain fanatic, but i have to admit the cheesecakes are sooooo good. I usually go just for that. I'm not crazy about all the food on the menu. I stopped in here for a slice of cheesecake since I was shopping in the area. The customer service was good and of course I ordered my favorite, the red velvet cheesecake. It was packed and ready by the time I paid for my food and I couldn't have been happier. I didn't get a picture because I savored every bite by the time I got home and forgot to take a picture!"
Heather R.,"Canton, OH",0,14,1,5.0,11/29/2015,"I love the new skinnylicious menu!  I had the Tuna Tataki salad and it was amazing!  We went specifically for the low carb cheesecake, which is delicious.  It is a bit pricey but worth it to me."
Matt D.,"Wadsworth, OH",1,5,,2.0,4/15/2015,"The girlfriend and I drove an hour to Westlake for her birthday dinner @ The Cheesecake Factory. She ordered the cobb salad, I ordered some Asian salad thing. First screw-up was when the waitress didn't bring my salad dressing. BINGO! I knew this was going to be a bad experience. She didn't come to check on us after dropping off our food. I had to get up and find someone to bring me dressing. Really? And I'm paying $12.00 for a salad. Usually I don't complain, but a server has one job. SERVE. If you can't do the basics, find a new job."
Hamilton A.,"Brecksville, OH",0,105,4,1.0,3/24/2014,"TWO HOURS.....REALLY??? On a Wednesday evening, it should not take two hours to get dinner. It should not take 20 minutes to get a glass of wine. They were not busy; there was no waiting. We arrived at 5:00. We didn't leave until 7:00. When we brought it to the attention of the mgr., he said, next time bring it to my attention sooner. There won't be a next time."
William C.,"Cleveland, OH",3,4,7,1.0,9/6/2013,"Officially, Cheesecake Factory became the Cheezwhiz Factory with the ruination of the formerly perfect Factory Nacho recipe beginning today."
Lefemme M.,"Cleveland, OH",497,93,55,4.0,4/14/2014,The Mojoto was great.. The service was okish .. but clean and not that busy around a sunday night for a party of 3.
Kaity K.,"North Royalton, OH",111,85,80,4.0,1/26/2014,"I've always had a good experience at the Cheesecake Factory, and last night was no exception. There was a huge snowstorm, so we had almost no wait at all (which is a big difference from the usual packed entryway). Without all the people in the way, I was able to fully appreciate how lovely the inside of the restaurant is (reminds me of Disney World!). We were taken to a small table where one side was a chair and the other was a bench that spanned the entire length of the seating area. That's a little weird since you're basically sharing space with complete strangers, but it worked. Our server was extremely friendly and very attentive. The bread that they bring you to stay was warm and delicious as usual. I ordered the crispy buffalo chicken sandwich, which was cooked nicely. The meat was moist, and the buffalo sauce added just the right amount of heat. My only complaint was that the cheese could have been melted for a few seconds longer on top. My boyfriend ordered the ""chicken littles,"" and his plate came HEAPED with chicken... He now has lunch for today! After our entrees, we scanned the extensive dessert menus and couldn't come up with one option we both agreed on since the menu is so vast, so we ordered 2! I got the s'more cheesecake (since I have a new obsession with anything s'more themed) and it was incredible; the chocolate cheesecake with graham cracker crust and gooey marshmallow fluff tasted just like a campfire s'more fancied up. I brought half of it home so I could enjoy it a little longer! Bill ordered the warm apple crisp since he isn't the biggest cheesecake fan, and it came out warm and bubbly with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream topping it off. Yum!"
Rita T.,"Cleveland, OH",6,39,,4.0,2/7/2014,"Unless you're eating out during a snowstorm or the Super Bowl, if you show up during a typical meal shift, it's common to wait up to an hour to be seated (sign in and go stroll the stores and outdoor kiosks while you wait). It's a fun atmosphere with good service, so this  restaurant is always busy. One of our visits included a large group, and we arrived at the early side of the dinner hour. Despite the fact that Cheesecake Factories don't take reservations, we were soon seated and our servers did a great job managing a large party. Menu items as listed tend toward calorie-rich, but servers are perfectly willing to adjust entrees to your specifications, and with an entire Skinnylicious menu, it's easy to make even those entrees even healthier."
Misti S.,"Cleveland, OH",4,21,,4.0,6/27/2012,"Mmm LOVE this place.  We went on a saturday evening and waited about 20 minutes, which wasn't all bad.  Asked for a high chair and the hostess ignored me so we went without..made for a fun dinner with a 2 year old! LOL Anyway, hubby got fish tacos which were amazing, would have preferred the fish to be a bit more seasoned.  The black beans were great.  I got a chicken club sandwich and a side salad.  Both were out of this world great!!!  Side salad is really big.  I took half of my sandwich home.  Baby got corn dogs, pretty good.... he really liked the diced fruit we ordered instead of fries. Got the kahlua cheesecake which was awesome!!!  Overall wasn't too pricey - I think we spent around $41 and that was a lot of food."
J M.,"Elyria, OH",0,5,,1.0,10/26/2014,"I ordered the Cobb Salad,it horrible uncooked bacon ,wilted lettuce,and it looked Ames,my hubby ordered tostada salad another disappointment,cold  grilled chic,for the price it was dissociating,and the waitress was rude about the tip,horrible as the food was she shouldn't expect anything,I won't be eating there again..."
Mike N.,"Cleveland Heights, OH",58,629,2,4.0,10/5/2013,"So this is the restaurant chain with the huge menu featured on Big Bang Theory.  As always, the structure looks like a theme restaurant at a Disney park.  There is the large menu and now a smaller lite menus.  They also have weekday happy hour with reduced prices on drinks and small plates.  Nice, attentive service.  Food arrived in a timely manner and was well prepared and flavorful.  My only complaint is that like many chain restaurants, the food is mildly overseeasoned.  Perhaps that encourages you to order more drinks.  Then there is the cheesecakes.  No they are not healthy, but they are amazing comfort food.  Overall, items are pricey, but portions are generous and you will iikely be taking leftovers home.  This is a great place to go after shopping or  movie.  Would go back."
Jim E.,"Belleville, Canada",455,286,1086,5.0,9/1/2012,"We came back to this location on our way home, we ordered a peach smoothie and chocolate milkshake for the road and they were delicious! We also brought home an original cheesecake and red velvet, we are continued to be amazed at the quality of the Cheesecake.  We also bought a Cheesecake Factory beanie baby and found the staff more friendly this time."
James P.,"Cleveland, OH",0,32,,3.0,11/25/2010,"Weird service. When I asked for a table, the concierge told me that the wait would be a half hour and that I could take a seat at the bar. But her tone betrayed something fishy was going on. I understand that you don't want to seat a person to a whole table because they won't be buying as much, especially on a crowded night, but....whatever. Portions are huge and are boxable.  Guacamole was not bad, if not overly rich. The chips that came with it were crisp and substantive, like freshly forged iron shovels scooping snow out of driveways. They were not as hard as iron though, just amply crispy. The salmon in ginger sauce was a find. I did not expect a food item of such high quality in a place like this. It was an appetizer, but I don't remember the exact name."
Shannon C.,"Cleveland, OH",198,150,2,3.0,12/6/2012,"Five stars for being my go to cheesecake spot. With curbside service, all the selections and close proximity to my house, I go here all the time for desert. Why only 3 stars? Way too many menu items, overpriced dinner menu and execution of their dishes. The pasta is never sauced or buttered and sticks together. The taco's are just OK and none of their other dishes I have tried have impressed, other than the steak and scampi combo (which is garlicky and delicious). With all the other great and unique places to eat in the city, this is my last choice for dinner."
Paul W.,"North Ridgeville, OH",1,1,,3.0,3/4/2013,"The food was good standard cheesecake factory food. However the lighting was so bad that i felt like i was eating in a dungeon. It was so cold that it may as well been a cave. I had to use the light on my phone to see the menu, which inspired others to do the same. (thankyou table of buisness nerds beside us) I will go back but only at noon maybe then they will have good lighting."
Terri D.,"Rocky River, OH",11,67,,4.0,2/27/2014,"oh yeesh. i cant believe i am actually writing a review on a chain. on a chain by the name of cheesecake factory. ok. call me a sucker. call me other dirty names. i can honestly tell you this: i heart the CF. yep. there ya go. i heart it. TLA true love always.  first of all. i am a girl who loves options. lots o options. keep your options open. i love that the menu is like 1000 pages long. i love that their cheesecake menu is longer then a child's storybook. speaking of cheesecake lets start with the big D. dessert.  i love the peanut butter cup cheesecake. i love the snickers bar rendition. i have tried the banana and well, i am not a huge banana fan, but even that is good. the other desserts are bigger then texas. like not kidding. portions are their thang here. like a really big thang. you will always have enough for two or three or four depending on your appetites.  they do offer a skinny licious menu now, which, i mean that is all well and great, but if you are going to go big, just go big. or go the freak home. like why go to the CF if you are going to order skinny? um, not this chick. or i guess you could go skinny and then order one of those HUGE pieces of cheesecake.  i typically order the same thing every. stinking. time. i. go.  well there are three menu items.  appetizer. fried mac n cheese balls. hello. love me some balls. mac n cheese balls that it. oh the crispy outside and cheesy insides.....holy heavenly shizzy. put em on your list.  entrees: spicy cashew chicken chicken and biscuits bang bang chicken n shrimp and  i just lately tried a delicious pasta with crispy shrimp and lemon butter sauce. i subbed penne for the linguine, but oh emmmm geee. probably 1500 cals, but again, you ARE at the CF.  so there ya have it, love doves. get on over the the CF and have yourself some fab treats. just an fyi~ the high tops in the bar are first come first serve. so no waiting. you can hang around like vultures and grab them as they become available. a lot of people do not know this so it makes getting a table rather quick if you have an inside source! :)"
Kyle C.,"Cleveland, OH",68,19,15,4.0,4/16/2013,"A longtime fan of Cheesecake, especially the Reese's Chocolate Peanut butter cheesecake and their sweet potato fries... service was excellent as usual..."
C P.,"Rocky River, OH",0,1,,1.0,8/30/2013,"The negative effects of this dining experience (on my pallet, stomach, and wallet) inspired me to join yelp to warn others to avoid the place. Of the six entrees served to our party of six, four were saturated with garlic and salt. Its amazing how they were able to come up with so many variations three main ingredients: salt garlic and butter.  I am lying awake now hours after the meal with indigestion, regretting the choice to eat there. The waitress, while very attentive, frequently interrupted our conversations. I was told the cheesecake was good. They automatically add 18% to the bill for parties of 6 or more, which offends me. This is my third meal here in the last 5 years. Each has gotten progressively worse. The next time I return to this location it will be another business. My guess is that it won't be long."
Alexander M.,"Boston, MA",0,6,,1.0,8/28/2014,"Friend and I ordered two salads for lunch at work today.  It was $28, they left cashews of of the cashew salad and the only difference between the two was mine had peppers and his had tortilla strips.  Place is such a joke.  $28.  Give me a break"
Shannon S.,"Cleveland, OH",6,3,1,3.0,7/21/2013,"We were told the wait was 45 minutes but we were seated in about 20, service was good and the waiter was polite, my daughter ordered the fettuccini alfredo with chicken which we all thought was really bland, my wife had the chicken marsala which we thought tasted kind of like a teriyaki chicken and I had the hibachi steak which was really good but small, they had to get a box for their dinners, We all had a different slice of cheesecake also,  the snickers, adams and kaluha, and we have no complaints about any of them ! we had to get a box for those too, total bill was $94 without gratuity, don't know if we will ever dine here again but definitely would order a slice to go...."
