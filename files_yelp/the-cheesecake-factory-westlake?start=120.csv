Belinda B.,"Brunswick, OH",0,1,,1.0,9/21/2014,"One of my favorite restaurants but such an honest disappointment. My friend and I had gone to Cheesecake Factory last evening and had a horrible experience.  - I used to be a receptionist for 5 years. I understand how frustrating it might be to have an overcrowding number of people by the front desk checking in.. With that being said, I had always given the clients/customers a friendly smile, an assurance on their wait until being served, and most importantly, TO MAKE SURE I WAS POLITE TO THE CUSTOMERS (even if I was going crazy inside my head, I had to make sure they would have a pleasant experience, so they would come back). Oh my goodness! Yesterday was a disaster! I arrived around 6:45 PM, I checked in the front, AFTER she asked ""next person in line?"" I had asked for a wait of two people.. (The woman at the front desk, was older, around her 50's, glasses and short hair.. accompanied by a male, in his 30's..) She completely IGNORED me, and asked the next person in line. Once the woman behind me had gone up to the desk, the hostess then had the nerve to ask me who was first in line.. Are you serious? You had asked me to come forward to help me, completely ignore me, ask another customer to approach up front, then ask who was first? Before either of us had the chance to speak, she quickly looked at the other woman and asked her if she was first.. Of course the woman said she was..? Shocked and disappointed, I waited until she was done helping the other woman. When she was done, I had told her I had been at the front desk first, before the other woman.. She replied, ""The wait for two people is about 40 minutes NOW."" (The reason why I put caps on ""now"" was because of the way she said it. She gave me attitude at the end.. I'm sorry.. but that is not how you treat customers. Honest. I had never received such a horrible experience.  ...Continuing on with my experience... I said, ""Okay"", we were handed a pager.. 1 HOUR AND 25 MINUTES LATER.. We were finally seated. The one thing I dont understand is that other parties of two who checked in AFTER US had been seated first. I was not the only one who was utterly angry, but another couple was also very disappointed, they had waited with us 5 minutes after we were checked in.. I know they dont have ""call ahead's"" on weekends due to how vastly busy they are but they seemed to get a lot of other people in front of us.. odd much?  After being seated, a server came, asked us for drinks/appetizers..  we ordered their spinach dip, which came out very watery..  my friend and I also had pasta, which was disappointingly undercooked.. Again, I repeat myself.. Horrible experience.. Even though I am a Cheesecake Factory fan, it's highly doubtful that I'll come back.. Believe all the raving bad views because it's absolutely true.. Please save your money and go to Brio across the way.. AT LEAST they'll treat you 10x better than they do at Cheesecake Factory."
Alan P.,"Memphis, TN",7,37,1,3.0,10/17/2012,"I found it rather bland. The service was excellant and the menu rather extensive, but just seemed like something was missing. I will give it another try, I could have just hit a off night."
Marco D.,"Houston, TX",0,10,,2.0,9/1/2014,Was there on Sunday afternoon. Basically the food is overpriced and average at best. Friend of mine had the 'Orange chicken' and frankly I couldn't tell if it was chicken or fish. $2.95 for a glass of Coke? Are you kidding me? I really don't see the difference between this and any Olive Garden or Maccaroni Grill.
Lisa K.,"Berea, OH",5,41,13,3.0,8/18/2012,"The food is always good, but very expensive.  I had a gift card otherwise we wouldn't have gone.  I had a amazing raspberry martini, but it cost $10.50!"
Dieter D.,"Westlake, OH",0,4,,5.0,8/6/2014,Cheesecake Factory is the best overall restaurant on the West Side.  We go there 2-3 times a week and rarely have a problem.  Have never had a problem with the service.  Give it a try. You'll be glad you did.
Megan M.,"Seattle, WA",1,21,,3.0,7/13/2014,"I had the Ahi Tartare and the Chicken Taco Lettuce Wraps. The Ahi was totally small. It didn't look like the picture and had barely any ahi in it, but it tasted good. The chicken wraps were okay. A good amount of food, and the sauces were good, but they did fall apart. The cheesecake was awesome. I got the reeses cup cheesecake which was tasty. Overall wasn't too bad tasting. The service however, was horrible. We had one server lady who was not very personable and forgot to put my ahi in. I had to remind her when the other food arrived and it was supposed to be an appetizer. Then they switched servers on us to another lady. She was slightly better, at least more personable, but still not that great."
Sarah S.,"Cleveland, OH",46,141,,3.0,1/17/2014,"I try to steer clear of chain restaurants, but my sister and I couldn't get in anywhere else so we stopped in at the Cheesecake Factory. We sat at the bar where we had a fantastic Mai Tai. I'm not usually one for fruity drinks like this, but it was perfectly made. To eat, we split two appetizers. One was the crab cakes off the ""lighter"" menu. They were very small, yet very good! I have to imagine they were on the lighter menu simply for their size. We also had the spinach dip, which we believe came off the lighter menu as well because it was extremely spinach-y. We had wanted to get the warm cheese and spinach dip, but I believe we got something different. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't what we were hoping for in a dip. I find that the menu is a bit overwhelming for all of the choices that they offer, but whatever they make, they deliver well, so they're obviously doing something right."
Lucas E.,"North Royalton, OH",62,41,21,5.0,12/24/2011,Mom had the mushroom burger and my wife had the chicken sandwich and I had the catfish.  all the food was perfect.  i would definitely come back.
S Marie P.,"Hampstead, NC",1,20,,5.0,2/23/2014,"Grabbed a seat at the bar and a bartender immediately came over to take my drink order. Despite there being an hour wait for  table, I ordered dinner at the bar and had it within 10 minutes. They were busy but incredibly fast and polite. Good food and great service at this location!!"
SeaElle R.,"Cleveland, OH",78,178,25,3.0,5/4/2011,Wait for a table at 3pm. Very expensive lunch with a glass of wine and cheesecake.
Rosa K.,"Westlake, OH",41,195,,4.0,10/7/2010,I like the fact that they serve you a ton of food on your plate. I used to dine out here to meet aquaintences for fellowship. The menu can be pricey at times.
