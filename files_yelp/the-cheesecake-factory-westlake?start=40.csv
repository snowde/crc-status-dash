Kaylee D.,"Brunswick, OH",136,4,,5.0,1/8/2017,"Absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory. Every time I come I have to wait 10-25 minutes which is understandable because they are so good. The menu offers a variety of food which I always have a hard time deciding what to get. My favorites are the chicken piccata, Mac and cheese bite appetizers, fettuccine Alfredo and the pasta carbonara. The drinks are good too! Highly recommend a Georgia peach. Before you leave, you must get a slice of cheesecake even if you have to take it home. They're very delicious and offer such unique flavors. The only downside to coming here is you have to pay for parking on the side of the streets or behind the restaurant in a parking lot or you have to walk a little bit to a parking garage with free parking. Overall, every experience I have here is a good experience!"
Bryan S.,"Westlake, OH",0,22,,2.0,12/20/2016,"Another over-hyped location. I have no idea how this is possible, but I don't really like their desserts. I keep trying new things and every time I'm like ""I paid 9 bucks for this?"" They try, and things always look fancy. I must be broken. As for the place, its huge! And they have you sit shoulder to shoulder with another couple which I hate. If you ask for a booth, expect to wait... there was always a wait. The layout is really clustered and uncomfortable. The waitstaff always seems overworked and forgetful.  I have tried quite a bit of the menu and only like one thing... White Romano. Its an Alfredo remake of their chicken and spaghetti dish and its pretty great. Try it."
Deb C.,"Amherst, OH",1,54,,5.0,8/18/2016,"I made reservations a day in advance and I'm glad I did! The restaurant was super busy and the booth that was reserved for us was roomy and had a lovely view of the patio. We were celebrating our friends' 50th anniversary and I wanted it to be special. I told the person scheduling the reservation and the server our reason for being there. I was a little surprised there was really little interest expressed by either one. Some places ask when you make the reservation if you're celebrating a special occasion. We ordered drinks to start off, they were good and the server was pleasant. I ordered the herb crusted salmon and it was cooked to perfection. My son's filet and friend's steak were equally tasty. We had a special dietary request and the kitchen cooked it just right. The food and atmosphere at this location is very good so I'll be back."
George B.,"Westlake, OH",1,15,27,2.0,5/17/2015,Service was mediocre. The sandwich I got was the Italian and the bread was like biting I into a brick. I asked to have it hot and the waitress said she would ask if that was ok... The sandwich wa as 80% turkey and very little Italian.  We won't be going back any time soon.
Steven K.,"Cleveland, OH",4,51,1,2.0,2/7/2016,"Reasons why this place is crap:  1. The hibachi steak, is not really a steak. It is actually pieces of over cooked steak, that they dumped soy sauce on after it was cooked. The bean sprouts are probably from LaChoy, and the mushrooms.....I'm not sure what was going on there.  2. The water is served in plastic glasses.  3. Beer selection sucks.  4. There are light up vaginas on the ends of all the outer booths.  5. The service sucks.  6. The food is overpriced for the quality. *quantity does not equal quality  7. Ads inside a menu are in very poor taste.  8. The music is really loud for a restaurant.  However, the Key Lime Cheesecake is amazing."
Stevie M.,"Fremont, OH",0,4,,5.0,6/22/2016,"Went here after leaving Cleveland for the Cavs Championship parade. It was actually pretty good! The service was wonderful, absolutely no problems. The meal portions are quite large, I took most of my meal home. Prices are decent for the amount of food you get. So if you're around and want to try something new, highly recommend The Cheesecake Factory.  P.S. Would recommend the raspberry lemonade!"
Rami M.,"Chicago, IL",187,350,44,2.0,12/28/2014,"I went here with my family for dinner last night, and we did not have a pleasant dining experience, mostly due to the longer than advised wait time. We put our name on the waitlist at 6:15 PM, and were quoted a 55-70 minute wait.  The hostess told us to check back in ""an hour"" to see where we were on the list.  Shouldn't we have been quoted 60-70 minutes instead of 55-70 minutes?  We did as told, and were advised to check back in 20 minutes.  After 20 minutes, they told us our table would be ready ""any minute"".  It took 10 more minutes for our buzzer to go off, and 10 minutes after that to actually be escorted to our table.  I remember being seated at 8PM (1 hour and 45 minutes after we put our name on the list). I understand this location was especially busy, but I would appreciate honest information so that we may best plan our evening. In addition, the food took long to be brought out.  My mother ordered a French Country Salad, and it did not contain asparagus as advertised.  We were sent home with a boxed salad.  The food we ordered did taste very good, the portions were huge, and the waitress was very cordial.  I wish we were not stuffed on bread (since we were hungry for waiting for much longer than expected), so that we may have enjoyed our meals a bit more. I remember initially being interested in purchasing a gift card with a stipulation of returning at a later date to claim your reward (a slice of cheesecake).  However, I decided against that, because I am not sure I will return."
Emma A.,"Cleveland, OH",3,67,30,1.0,1/1/2017,"I have to just re write my review since my last one was good. I will NEVER come back here again. I just walked in for lunch the restaurant is empty and because my 2 year old is sleeping in our stroller which is not that big the blonde hostess refused to seat us. She told us we can't sit at a table and every single open seat is reserved. Regardless, that is horrible customer service. The restaurant is 90% empty. So instead of seating 3 adults and a toddler they told us they cannot help us. Thanks Cheesecake Factory every time my family comes we spend over 100.00 eating and now I never eat at any of your restaurants let alone this one again."
Ahmad H.,"Cleveland, OH",0,8,,1.0,5/25/2017,"Two days ago on Tuesday (5/23/17), I took my family to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate my brother's birthday. Regretfully, we didn't have a celebration--instead, we had a disaster.  It was the most dreadful dining experience we've ever had and I am so upset that it had to happen on a loved one's birthday. We're a very patient and forgiving family with a combined 32 years in the hospitality industry, but your staff sucked every ounce of patience in us.  We arrived at 7:30 pm. It took 15 minutes for a server to acknowledge us after we were seated by the hostess. A server named Jessica S. finally appeared and took our drink orders (we were a party of 3). Our drinks arrived 5 minutes later. As we browsed the menu, she said she'd be back shortly to take our food orders. We decided no appetizers because the restaurant wasn't busy (it was a Tuesday night) and we didn't want to be too full for our main dishes. A basket of bread would've definitely sufficed for the meantime. She vanished without offering any bread, which is customary at Cheesecake Factory. All the tables surrounding ours were receiving fresh baskets of bread. A short while later, I heard Jessica ask the table DIRECTLY beside ours which was seated after us, ""Would you like some bread while your appetizers are being made?"" Sure enough, she served them bread.    Five minutes became 20 and still no bread and no Jessica, at least not at our table. She was busy providing undivided attention to her other tables. We eventually stopped her and asked for bread; she said a fresh batch was being made. She took our dinner orders and left;with empty glasses in front of her and no question if we wanted refills. I thought to myself, ""Will I have to be asking for every little thing the entire night? But she doesn't look like she's training or overwhelmed. She seems to be on top of things with everyone else."" I couldn't decipher what was going on. Carelessness? Selective service? At this point, it's 8:30. People who came after us were already eating their entrees, and some were even getting their checks. Jessica would skip our table and ask the others if there was anything they needed. I had to ask a different server walking by if we could get some bread and she happily obliged; yet again, we never got any. We sat there sipping what was left of our drinks, watching Jessica serve everyone else. If it wasn't for my family, I wanted to leave. They kept saying, ""What's going to be open around this time?""  Honestly, bar service elsewhere would've been more merciful for a birthday than this. I'm forgiving of wait times and honest forgetfulness from staff, but that night was straight up unforgivable. It's past 9 pm and still no entrees and no explanation. At least show some consideration and let us know what's happening in the kitchen. Short staffed? Backed up? I got up and went to the hostess stand and told her that I'd like to pay for the drinks and leave. She said she'd need to get the manager Sarah to honor my request. I explained to the Manager how negligent and horrible the service was, to which she was initially/seemingly apologetic. Sarah was shocked at what was happening and said verbatim, ""It's not even that busy tonight."" She asked if I'd be willing to have a seat and get some food in me while she tried her best to make the situation right. As soon as I walked back, our food mysteriously appeared on our table with a basket of bread. Sarah returned 5 minutes later as we were eating and asked if we wanted a couple slices of cheesecake to-go on the house. I was offended that that was her solution to the problem, and for a family who didn't want dessert. An entire table of cheesecake could not sweeten this awful experience. We paid the original bill of $70 and that's around the time Jessica would come to our table to ask about refills and such. It was too late. If that was your form of an apology, apology not accepted. You're sorry because you were told on. I've been a loyal patron of this Cheesecake Factory in Westlake for years. For God's sake, my family even hosts parties of 20-30 people during the holidays. But I was shown two nights ago that we are no longer wanted there. We were always kind and generous, but now I regret the time and money we wasted in the past. And the fact that the Manager never offered any resolution for a family who didn't want dessert made it worse. I'm sure that when this happens to other guests, better resolutions are made. However, I'm not quite sure what filter your location uses to gauge what kind of treatment a certain people gets over others. You may never share that information, because you can't, but the public will always know the difference and never feel welcomed again. From Michaud's in Strongsville to parties we've catered in Cleveland, I have never seen such poor service with blatant audacity. And no matter what kind of training your staff needs, I suggest you add kindness and fairness to your employee handbook."
Arielle S.,"Lititz, PA",193,8,1,5.0,10/1/2016,"Always have great food at cheesecake! Came here for a late lunch after not being here in a while and had an amazing server, Kyle! He was so friendly and helped us with our dietary needs. Definitely recommend him!"
Brittney C.,"SC, SC",5,1,,2.0,4/23/2017,I ordered the lemon chicken and it came out raw. The manager offered to cook the rest of my half eaten chicken. Not sure if I'd go there to eat chicken again or to even eat for lunch breakfast or dinner but everything else was delicious and by that I'm talking of the cheesecake.
Amanda G.,"Medina, OH",1,9,26,4.0,8/3/2015,"For an appetizer we had Cuban Rolls with Roast pork, ham, pickle, and cheese. My dad says they remind him of a Cuban sandwich, but it doesn't taste exactly like one. But the taste is excellent. We also had a Chicken Lettuce Wrap. Too much ginger for my taste, but my parents like it. They would rate it about 3.5/5     I had the Bacon- Bacon cheeseburger. It was too big for me to finish. But was absolutely delicious.     My dad had a Mexican salad. Again, it was too big to finish. But he liked it.     My mom had a Hibachi steak. Too big to finish. And was delicious.      My grandma had a Chicken Quesadilla.It was a nice proportion size. Very good.     Overall,  the dinner was amazing. 3.5/5 for the dinner"
Ralen B.,"Cleveland, OH",111,6,11,3.0,6/18/2016,Get here early on the weekends or expect to wait over 25 min. Great drinks and apps. I .mostly come for happy hour. Try the shrimp scampi and steak diane
Bobby B.,"Bay Village, OH",29,104,23,1.0,11/3/2015,"This place is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE.  Been here before, food has gone downhill! 15.95 for 4 pieces of VERY tiny pieces of fish with approximately 15 fries. Absolutely absurd! Server was alright.  Our party will not be back. Embarrassing to come for a birthday party dinner to have the food suck!"
Cheeseburger M.,"Hudson, OH",102,62,,2.0,10/31/2015,"Good morning (in case you're reading this in China?). I dined here on Friday evening with my gal. They sat us literally on top of another couple. Has this place heard of privacy? (For 2 seconds). Also the waiter put his butt in my face? Why? AND WAIT A MINUTE I ALMOST FORGOT, HE ALMOST ELBOWED MY DATE! (Geez, what a jerk). So. The reason this place didn't get 1 star is because the mural on the wall gave my gal and I something to talk about. I DIGRESS. The omelette tasted like eggs! Thank god. However the fish tacos should have tasted like something that tastes good. (They should leave these to Barrio) Good night (people in America). Yeip"
Laura L.,"Ashland, OH",0,4,,2.0,8/27/2016,"Service was way below expectation. After taking our order, our waitress just disappeared. No refill on my water & my friend's water, we had empty glass for at least 15 mins. No one came and check on us. And finally she showed up to give us the bill without asking if it was one check or not. So we had to ask her to spilt the bill. Also she clearly didn't notice the empty glass so we had to ask for refill.  Food was good, and of course the cheesecake was delicious. And that's the reason I didn't give it a zero or negative (if I can). We were really unhappy and got a little bit angry later because after we were all finished, our waitress still didn't show up and we just sit there with nothing to do (nothing to drink because no one cared to notice the empty glass). I like Cheesecake Factory even though lots of people claim it is overpriced. I appreciate good food and good service, but obviously this time, it didn't worth the price."
Top Reviewer I.,"Lakewood, OH",0,19,9,3.0,2/12/2017,"Visited late afternoon on 2/11/17.  Had to wait over 1/2 hour for table. Others that came in  behind us were told 50-80 min waits. Wowza.  Once seated, initial beverage service was prompt. I would add that although polite and serving a large table, attention to detail needs to be improved as although I was specific that I would like a glass of water without lemon, you guessed it, it came with lemon. I passed my citrus wedge on to another glass and moved on. Taking orders seemed to take longer than expected - prob took 20 mins just to put out order in.  Food came out promptly. Quality was good, portions were large. We anticipated this and several at the table ordered to share. This worked  in our favor as all left without feeling overstuffed. Only 2 of the meals needed a doggy bag.  Overall the experience was probably as expected. Long wait, marginal service and oversized portions. A slice of cheese cake for $7.50/slice seems very much like a money grab. Good but not worthy of that price."
Susan G.,"Portage, IN",0,2,,3.0,3/30/2017,We were traveling and found Cheesecake Factory by accident and decided to have lunch. I'm a big fan of it in Chicago but was disappointed on this one. My husband ordered the cheesesteak sandwich and when he took a bite the meat was pink and still raw. We called the waitress and when we told her about it she laughed and offered to get him something else. He declined due to the fact he was grossed out. I ordered the burrito grande and it was good but it was filled with a lot of rice and very little chicken. For the prices we have to pay to eat here I expect high quality food and service.
Phil B.,"Olmsted Falls, OH",59,4,,2.0,3/27/2017,"This was my first time here. The Food was good, but the service and experience was horrible. They didn't have the beer I wanted, then they didn't have the entree I wanted and then they didn't have the cheesecake I wanted! No apologies from the server or a manager and no comp on the bill for our inconvenience. Won't be going back."
Harp L.,"Cleveland, OH",0,8,,2.0,3/26/2017,"My niece picked this for her birthday dinner. Called for a rezzie - no reservations, come in and wait.Sis planned for 7:30 on a Sat. I arrived at 7, anticipating a short wait. The wait was quoted as 75-90 min. I only waited because this was a birthday choice. Waiting area was very crowded, busy with take-out, but then a party allowed their children to sit in the middle of the entrance/exit aisle - smh..... Sis approached hostess stand at 73 minuted point(hostess quoted time)and was told in a rather surly manner that tables were running on time as quoted and we would be a few more minutes. We were seated around the 90 minute mark - I didn't check quote time.  Server was very prompt, knowledgeable and friendly. He did a very good job and was rewarded well for his service.  The food is just awful. Deep fried Man & Cheese was cold in the center, crispy Cuban rolls were hot throughout and crisp on the outside but doughy. Crab & artichoke dip was very strong/fishy flavour.  Entrees were not much better. Bang Bang Shrimp & Chicken lacked any bang, lukewarm, Chicken Chile was OK.......Factory chopped salad looked as though it had been factory produced - rather than chopped, it looked masticated, almost crushed and runny. One party member had Eggplant parm with some unidentifiable spag type side(zucchini pasta???) that was cold, unsauced and a little congealed. We didn't complain about anything as we had already waited 1 1/2 hours to eat. Not worth an additional wait or the dreaded manager visit to the table. Cheesecakes were very good. The rest of the party LOVED them. It's just not my thing. Again, the server was great, but I don't really feel the food was worth it. The food rates somewhere on the lower end of mediocrity. I don't understand the attraction."
