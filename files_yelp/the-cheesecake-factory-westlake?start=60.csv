Alisia A.,"Westlake, OH",189,186,155,2.0,7/30/2015,"Eh, just eh. I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, I think they are too cookie cutter. Upon arrival, we had to wait 20 min for a table on a Wednesday evening at 8pm, strange I thought. We were seated at our booth and waited. We probably waited for a good 10-12 min before the server approached us. We ordered everything at once since we didn't want to keep waiting.  2 dirty martini's and a cosmo arrived to our table shortly after. Followed by our skinnylicious appetizers. Everything we had was OK. Nothing too bad but nothing too great either.  Their cheesecake on the other hand was delicious. I would just go back for the cheesecake!"
Teejay B.,"Brunswick, OH",126,181,200,2.0,7/17/2015,"If I could give two sets of stars, I would. Alas, since I cannot, The Cheesecake Factory shall receive a dreaded two star review. Better than one, but only just. I want to like the factory of cheesecake, I really do. The food is mediocre and overpriced, the tables are too close for comfort, and the service leaves something to be desired. I have been here on numerous occasions and my experience is always the same. Let's reflect on the most recent trip, shall we? I came here with my sister and niece for a girls day. I warned them of my experiences ahead of time but my niece was set on a giant slice of cheesecake. There is no talking a member of my family down when it comes to sweets... The new orange chicken dish was completely overpowering with orange flavor, and not in a good way. It left a bitter, syrupy taste...literally and figuratively. The Cajun chicken pasta was OK, but my sister had numerous pieces of gristle in her chicken and I found a tortilla chip in mine. I won't complain about a bonus chip, but I'm pretty sure it didn't belong there. After all that, they both agreed with my original statement, until the cheesecake came to the table... This is where the second set of stars would come in handy. The cheesecake is damn good. I mean, take home a slice of each and eat it everyday until it's gone, good. I have had better, but not by all that much. I would give the cheesecake a four star review. Creamy and rich with just enough of whatever makes it different...Oreo, raspberries, or whatever else. So in conclusion, The Cheesecake Factory should stick to that of it's name and leave the rest to someone else."
Tom K.,"Elyria, OH",99,17,,1.0,9/8/2016,"I've gone here now for the past two years. I'm guessing 8-10 visits. I go here because my best friend and his wife like to go here. The cheesecake is good. Expensive, but good.  But the food is not. I've tried a variety of items. The are rarely seasoned. They are dry. They lack taste. I tried the chicken and biscuits tonight. Terrible. Two flattened pieces of chicken with tasteless gravy on the plate. Two small muffin looking ""biscuits"" on the side. After salting this concoction three times I gave up.  Why is this place always busy? It must be the dessert because it sure isn't the food."
E H.,"Brunswick, OH",8,5,,2.0,2/28/2017,"I had the eggplant parmesan. It was terrible. Way too much garlic. The pasta that came with it was also disappointing. Very plain with a few herbs sprinkled in. My companion got the fish tacos. They were good. But the thing that I really hated was the way the seats were. We were a foot away from the next table and couldn't help but hear everything they were taking about. That seating arrangement was very popular at the trendy restaurants in the 1980's. I hated it then and I'm over it now.  We were planning on getting dessert, but couldn't wait to leave."
Jacque M.,"Northfield, OH",0,2,,5.0,2/20/2017,"Drinks were delicious, food was amazing, and our waiter Dan, was the best! Can't wait to go back and try more food, and I would even request Dan to be my waiter again."
Abbaron J.,"North Olmsted, OH",0,9,,5.0,1/15/2017,Great place to eat at. Amazing staff. Quick and definitely my favorite place for desert lol
Precious R.,"Cleveland, OH",149,108,136,5.0,8/6/2014,"This is my favorite chain restaurant. I have yet to have a bad meal here. The food & the service always stays consistent. I think you get your money's worth since I can never finish my whole meal. My favorite dish is the Chicken Katsu, the chicken is juicy & crispy. My second favorite dish is the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps, perfect dish if you want something light.  I prefer this location over the one in Legacy Village because the wait time isn't as long. During the weekend at the one in Legacy, I've wait anywhere from 1 hour to 1 hour & 30 mins which is insane."
Brandon D.,"Sheffield Lake, OH",0,8,,4.0,11/12/2016,"I love the chicken costoletta. The sautéed chicken and lemon sauce is perfect! Their chicken and biscuits is my other go-to. Enough for two meals. Their multigrain wheat goes great with either. The only issue I have with the restaurant and the reason they lose a star, in my opinion, is their seating. I can't stand how close they seat you to other patrons. You're essentially eating with strangers. I know they want to maximize available tables, but I do not want to have a date or private dinner with another party like 24 inches away. Especially if weak bladders are involved by your ""neighbors"". The obligatory crotch or butt in your face as they try to squeeze pass is not always appreciated when you're trying to enjoy your meal."
Linda C.,"Westlake, OH",4,103,12,2.0,3/12/2016,"Way too noisy.  Nothing special about this place.  Prices are moderate to moderately high and I have yet to eat anything here that sticks out in my mind as being wonderful.  As mentioned, the noise level during peak hours becomes deafening for my liking.  I can't think of any reason to eat here again.  I've eaten here several times in the past 2-3 years, and each time I think it's going to be really good, but it's not.  The bread they serve with the salads and meals is so boring, and although it looks like it might taste good, it's a huge disappointment."
Derek B.,"Birmingham, AL",151,121,73,4.0,6/25/2015,"I'm not big on chains but if you're going to go to a chain, I don't know of a better one to visit. The Salmon Genovese was delicious. And the service had been very good both times I've been to this location. Note the parking is free in the parking deck but not on the 'street' or in the back lot closest to the restaurant."
Easy C.,"Wadsworth, OH",0,278,600,2.0,3/21/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory at Crocker park is big, crowded and overrated.   I had dinner yesterday at around 6 PM.  It was packed.  Had a veggie burger, and it was good.   Service was fine.  The menu is huge, so there are lots of options (salads, sandwiches, pastas...), but it all has this mass-produced feel that makes it somewhat boring.  Also was sitting about 15 inches away from a young couple (on a date?) that weren't really talking and me being right there made it feel even more awkward.  Seating arrangements seem designed to fit as many people as possible."
Debi S.,"Vermilion, OH",29,44,1,4.0,11/29/2014,"We went on our anniversary. We go here maybe 2-3 times a year. It's not cheap,  so it's a usually a special occasion. We just went on our anniversary. Service was impeccable,  as usual. Food was delicious,  as usual.  HOWEVER. ....we usually will order a piece of cheesecake to go. The portions are so large that we end up taking leftovers,  and dessert to go,  too enjoy later. We ordered our usual slice to share,  and one to take back for my parents to share. When we took out out later at home to enjoy,  it was miniscule. The prices  had not shrunk. But the cheesecake was about 1/4 the size it usually is. And the really disappointing part. ......the pieces being served up for consumption at the tables were normal size. So I guess they reduced ours because it was going home?   Moral  of this review.......check your dessert  before you leave. They may need to fix it."
Kaitlyn S.,"Bakersfield, CA",12,10,4,3.0,5/18/2015,"Their service was nice and the food was mostly good.  The food came out really slow. There were not that many people. I had ordered the spaghetti. There wasn't enough sauce for me at least. I could barely taste it. I asked for more sauce and it tasted better than before. I would eat here again, but if other options weren't available. I wouldn't recommend to friends."
Jesco D.,"Cleveland, OH",8,66,10,1.0,7/12/2014,"I hate Cheesecake Factory with a passion. A MASSIVE menu is the absolute WORST concept a restaurant can front. It clearly shows since all 3 times I have been to this establishment the food has been unappetizing and just pathetic. Chicken Marsala was raw with a bland and watery sauce, I had 3 different kinds of noodles on the dish, how I have no clue. Any meat is not prepared to specification. Servers getting tables mixed up constantly.  The issue is a massive menu, a massive kitchen, massive portions with a massive amount of employees just spells out a massive failure. Having a bible for a menu isn't appealing, it's just stupid. You sit there and spend 12 minutes going through everything and can barely see what you are reading if you choose to dine after dark. It hasn't failed yet in that each time I would find something different to try I would pretty much know something would be wrong with it.  That's another thing, the ""ambiance lighting"". I suspect the reason for being that dark is so you can't see how bad your food looks when it arrives, so when you eat your meal there really isn't anything to look at and question.  If anyone else is just the biggest fan of this chain, great, good for you. I'm not. The whole franchise just needs to disappear."
Samantha F.,"Dayton, OH",322,465,1113,2.0,2/12/2013,"Cheesecake Factory, you get 2 stars cause, well...I'm just not a fan.   The food wasn't great, my order wasn't correct, and our server was meh.  She kind of disappeared after our food was brought to us.  Honestly, the best part of the meal was the bread basket.  Not sayin' much there. The Cheesecake factory menu is hugeamongous!   Yep, it is true.  They have their ""skinny"" menu which I scoff at.  Seriously just cause it is under 700 calories doesn't make it ""skinny"".  Maybe if I wanted a ginormous meal & a huge slice of cheesecake I'd like you more, but I don't.   The place was clean.  The location is pretty.  I can't complain on the aesthetics. If you like this sort of place, you'll probably be fine here.  This is really personal preference."
Tina C.,"Westlake, OH",15,44,105,4.0,1/26/2015,"4 because I'm basing this review off of many visits and not just the most recent awful one.  We had to wait 20 minutes for our table (they don't take reservations) and then another 20 to order, and another 50 minutes- hour for our food to come out. We were a group of 6 and it was about 330 on a Saturday when we arrived. Just a heads up to call in or plan accordingly for a wait. Weekdays there usually aren't a bad wait and service is faster. The food is always good, and the Adams cheesecake or the fudge cake is incredible."
Vince V.,"Cleveland, OH",260,399,835,3.0,7/30/2015,"Call it what you will, but the food here is very well more than good enough, and would taste even greater if it didn't come with the label of ""chain restaurant."" If you are concerned about the caloric content of each serving that could feed a family of five, then, eat a fraction of it and have the rest packed to go to, um, feed your family of five... just sayin'"
Maureen K.,"Grafton, OH",0,8,1,3.0,5/10/2016,Atmosphere and decor awesome. Wait staff great with service. Food was mediocre and overpriced. The cheesecake was even mediocre. Average meal around 15$. I don't think that we would personally go back.
Katie M.,"Westlake, OH",0,18,20,4.0,11/15/2015,"Love their pretzel covered chicken and of course, you gotta get the cheesecake. Plan on a large serving and a long wait. The service is good but it's almost always crazy busy. It is worth the wait! Also, you're close to other people usually."
Nathan F.,"Cleveland, OH",3,5,,2.0,6/4/2014,"Let me start by saying I like this restaurant chain. I feel it has pretty decent food and portions for the money you pay. Now getting down to the issue I usually go the the Beachwood OH location however its now 15 miles farther from where I live since moving to strongsville.  This visit was my second outing at the Crocker Park location and  I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.  The taste was subpar, the sauce tasted like under ripe tomatoes and salt.  The noodles themselves were firm and starchy. The service was good, our server was ever present and we did have to wait long for drinks etc. I suggest if you are in the area and can get to either restaurant head to the Beachwood location."
