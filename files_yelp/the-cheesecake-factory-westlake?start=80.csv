Jon A.,"Galion, OH",117,113,277,3.0,5/24/2015,"My wife and I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory prior to yesterday afternoon.  We arrive at 3:30 on a busy and beautiful day at Crocker Park.  We are seated immediately and after reviewing possibly the most extensive menu I've seen we decide on Chicken and Biscuits for me, and a BBQ Chicken pizza for my wife.  The food comes out within ten minutes and is pretty good.  My dish consisted of three very thin skinless boneless chicken breasts that have been sautéed with peas, carrots, mushrooms, and onions.  Also came with two ""Buttermilk Biscuits"" that looked and tasted exactly like cornbread (wth?), and mashed potatoes with the red skins left on.  The dish is very good, but I am disappointed that a menu the size of War and Piece did not mention that the mashed potatoes had red skins left on, and that the dish came with peas, onions, carrots, and mushrooms.  My wife's pizza was also very good though a slight criticism would be that it had too much chicken, and that was a little dry.  To finish the meal off we shared a piece of red velvet cheesecake which was one of the best desserts I've had.  Overall we give the food four stars. Now about the service:  it was not very good.  We happened to be seated at a table very close to the waiter / waitress station which unfortunately for me, was all I could see.  The waitresses dancing, one waitress hitting the other on the butt, seven of them all standing around as if they had nothing to do - it just wasn't what I wanted my view to be inside of this beautiful, expansive space.  The Cheesecake Factory would be smart to create an area where the wait staff can stand out of the view of the customers.  Our waiter was not very good, and he didn't check on us often, and was not good at refilling our drinks.  He also left at one point and came back to our table smelling terribly of cigarette smoke - it was disgusting and to me, not appropriate.  I'm not sure if waiters taking smoke breaks while they are in the process of waiting on a table is common, but I can't remember having this experience previously.  We give the service two stars overall. The bill with a 15% tip was $52.  We will be back, but that is based solely on the location, and most notably the food which was very good."
Scott H.,"Navarre, OH",79,81,106,4.0,10/18/2015,"We always look forward to coming up to the Cheesecake Factory. They offer quite the variety of food. Also most all their pastas are available in a gluten free option, and tastes great. Sad to say most of the time I'm to stuffed to make it to their cheesecake. Which I think is some sort of foodie code violation. But  you can get a piece to go or better yet a whole cake frozen to go. Just make sure when you order gluten free to remind the kitchen to make any meat toppings gluten free also. (Like grilled chicken instead of breaded)"
Kimberly F.,"Avon Lake, OH",50,9,4,4.0,11/26/2015,"We waited a long time for a table to be ready. They were super busy so I understand that it would be slow. When we sat down, it took the waitress a long time to get out drink orders and to bring us refills and such. I ordered the Mac and Cheese burger and it was very good! The fries were really amazing too. I would recommend this place if you have plenty of time on your hands. Go Cheesecake Factory!"
Suezann Z.,"Strongsville, OH",22,19,4,2.0,5/8/2015,First off horrible  service! Second got put in a booth and it was disgusting! Floor was all dirty under us and the cushions were all sticky! We ordered appetizers and my Mac and cheese balls were burnt! I found a hair in the calamari. Got our entrees and jst didn't taste good at all! I literally went home and threw up. I have went to cheesecake before and had an average time but the last time got me saying I will never go again just thinking about the food I ate make me gag
Fallon F.,"Cleveland, OH",31,62,33,2.0,3/9/2015,"I haven't eaten at a chain restaurant in quite some time- and now I remember why. First, I must say, I was only here because it was a friend's birthday lunch and it was her pick.  When we arrived, the restaurant was packed but we didn't mind waiting, so we put our name in and sat down. About two minutes later our party was called, which was perplexing since there were many many people waiting, all of which had arrived before we did. I'm not exactly sure how that happened, but we weren't about to complain about a shorter than expected wait time.  We were seated in a booth in the corner, and then we waited. After about 5 minutes of no one greeting us, some in my party started glancing around wondering where the server might be. Having working in the food industry throughout college, I reminded everyone that they were extremely busy and our server was probably doing the best he could. But after about 10 more minutes with not even an ""I'll be right with you"" I couldn't even justify what was taking so long. Finally our server did arrive, said nothing about the wait, and took our drink order. He was friendly and informative and did make some recommendations. A few of us ordered cocktails and we put in an appetizer because we were afraid of waiting again.  Alas, we waited again. Drinks took about 10 minutes. Bread took an additional 10. Then our server was back, and he was grumpy. He snapped at us, he was short, and he seemed genuinely irritated. When he brought us a drink refill, he didn't even hand it to the right person, he just slammed it down on the table. Maybe something happened at another table? I get it. But it was very uncomfortable.  Then out of nowhere, our entrees arrived! But where was the appetizer we had put in long before?? Apparently we weren't getting that. And our server never came back to check on is, so we were never able to bring it to his attention.  Our entrees are what you'd expect from a chain restaurant, generic, unoriginal, no excitement. The food is overpriced for what you actually receive, but again that's what you get when they need to hike up the prices to make a profit for their corporation.  Our bills were dropped off and I saw I was charged $10.50 for the watery, I think they forgot the alcohol mojito that I ordered. But what did I expect really?  Just an affirmation to why I forgo chains altogether. I honestly can't wait until restaurant groups like this are done for."
Cindy J.,"Las Vegas, NV",106,79,188,3.0,2/16/2015,Nice people buy slow service and got the food wrong. We had ro run out to put more quarters in the parking meter.
Tom F.,"Cleveland, OH",1,19,,5.0,3/9/2015,"Avoid weekends, always a really long wait. I come on weekdays for dinner and lunch and then eat at bar for faster service. Great food, huge menu and more expensive than most chains, but worth it."
Kenzie S.,"Berea, OH",52,14,1,1.0,2/28/2015,"Overpriced. Not one healthy menu item other than an over priced salad. $12+ for romaine lettuce in a medium sized bowl with a few veg on top. No way. You want to charge a lot, fine. Then just have the quality ingredients and portion sizes to match. Husband agreed. Nothing special. Argggg...."
Christi S.,"Lakeside Marblehead, OH",30,27,23,3.0,4/24/2015,"Im not sure why I came back so soon.  Very disappointing.  Asked they be sure the potatoes were hot because it took them 3 times the last time and no, they were not as hot as they should be.  Also told waitress we would be splitting food with the children to save room for desert.  Didn't see waitress for a while so we used the bread plates.  When I mentioned to waitress that it would have been nice to get extra plates for the kids she said I should have asked her... I thought that was a given.  She then sloughed  us off and went to the next table. I muttered under my breath that she wouldn't be getting as good a tip to teach grandchildren.  She somehow overheard and flippantly said she didn't care.  Wow!"
Chad B.,"Amherst, OH",45,52,13,2.0,11/2/2013,"I usually have a great experience at this restaurant. Tonight was not one of those nights. I ordered the chicken marsala dish for dinner, and when I received it it tasted absolutely like nothing at all. When I am from the waiter that my meal was unsatisfactory, he offered just to take it off the bill or if I wanted to wait another 20 minutes or more for a meal. At no time did any manager come over to apologize for the inconvenience or the fact that I had to share my wife's dinner since we were with another couple I do not want them to have to wait.  I just thought that was very unprofessional, and it really made me take another look at other options in the near future."
Chris G.,"Philadelphia, PA",45,36,12,4.0,1/4/2014,"Came in on a busy Saturday evening and was promptly told to wait one hour; the place was definitely popular! Staff was friendly and accommodating and portion sizes were large. Our food came out approximately half an hour after we put in our orders, and the waiter graciously offered us extra bread to tie us over in the meantime. Although the food quality might not be considered gourmet by any means, for the price, it is worth it."
Rick W.,"Brunswick, OH",40,206,16,4.0,8/16/2015,"i've always really liked The Cheesecake Factory. my favorite menu item (Thai Chicken Past) was removed a few years ago so that made me sad.  the funny thing for me was that i love cheesecake but never even tried their cheesecake until last year. i'm not very adventurous and just get the strawberry cheesecake which suits me fine. our previous visit to the factory i tried the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo. it was great. delicious proteins and the sauce was incredible with a touch of spice.  last night i had the Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane combo. I was worried i'd ordered too much and wouldn't be able to finish it, but it was a pretty decent sized meal and i was able to scarf it all down. the sauces both were a mushroom wine sauce. delicious. the chicken came with asparagus which was cooked perfectly. the chicken itself was weirdly tender (very soft) but the taste was perfect. delicious. the steak was cooked just the way i asked but was a little on the salty side. nothing terrible and perfectly edible but that'd be my biggest complaint.  Danielle had Salmon w/ mashed potatoes and broccoli. her broccoli was almost raw and wasn't seasoned at all. this was disappointing to her (and would have been to me also). she also said her mashed potatoes tasted too salty. her fish, though, was very good according to her.  this visit was a nice night out with friends so all in all, a good time.  i don't know when we'll be back again. it's kinda pricey for a chain style restaurant and the wait times are ridiculous (we tried to reserve a table since we knew we had a larger than normal party, but were told they stop taking reservations after 2pm on Saturdays. why?). we're also not too keen on the seating which usually has you sitting about 3 inches from the next table. it'd be nice to have some privacy or elbow room. heaven forbid you have to get up to use the restroom. your rear end would probably graze the plates of the tables next to you."
Dorothy W.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,8,2,5.0,2/19/2016,I am in Ohio on business and eat at the Cheesecake factory almost every night I am in Cleveland.  The menu is big and has a nice variety of foods.  There are a decent number of super healthy salads and dishes that makes it possible to have a desert some nights without totally killing my diet.  The quality of the food is excellent and the service is always superior.  Highly recommend this restaurant.   The only time I stay away is Friday and Saturday night because I know the place will be just packed.
Camille B.,"Berkeley, CA",67,145,104,3.0,8/31/2013,"When it became the law to post nutritional information on menus, my friend told me that his favorite meal at Cheesecake Factory was 2100 calories and I haven't been back to Cheesecake Factory since... Until now. We were away from home, staying at a nearby hotel for the weekend, for a friend's wedding and decided to eat here for lunch. I ordered the sesame soy Ahi Tuna appetizer and shared a slice of the Mango Lime cheesecake with 2 other friends.  The Ahi Tuna was waaay too salty.. it was hard to finish... Good thing the portion was small.  If it weren't so salty, it would have been delicious!  The Mango Lime cheesecake was excellent. Not too dense.  Sweet and tart, and jam packed with Mango flavor. Loved it."
Colleen P.,"North Olmsted, OH",198,282,255,3.0,6/18/2011,"I've been here for a few different occasions...and overall I feel like three stars is just about right. I went here recently with a group of girlfriends and they seated us in the middle of a bunch of booths at a huge round table...a little uncomfortable but workable...I don't particularly care for their food, but expect to pay about $10 for a sangria or a glass of wine. They are always crowded though, so it must be the overpriced cheesecake that keeps them coming in."
Emily S.,"Lakewood, OH",26,56,9,5.0,9/24/2012,"I have only done take out from this location, but every time, the orders have been perfect. My company stays late during the end of the month, and we usually order about 10 meals on a Friday night. They are able to separate specific meals into different bags per our request, and they are always correct. The employees working the Carry Out are always very nice and accomodating. It is also very nice how they will bring your meals directly to your car, which would be very nice if you had a car full of kids! We keep ordering from Cheesecake Factory month after month. The food is always great and my coworkers love the Skinny Licious menu! It is nice to have a healthy option at a place that was made from cheesecake."
Xela N.,"North Olmsted, OH",7,207,,2.0,4/26/2015,"I don't usually go to TCF, but we had a pair of gift cards to cash in on, so off we went.  Without trying to be literary or sound like an expert reviewer, I will just be direct here.  My soft shell shrimp taco was very bland tasting, as was the sauce it came with (needs a better, tastier sauce), as was my Greek salad.  The crab bites were very good though.  My wife's chicken sandwich was ""average, at best"", in her own words.  And my daughter's chicken fingers were good, but her fries way too salty.  In dissapointment, she barely touched them.  Her chocolate cake was mediocre too.  My wife and I split a carrot cake, which was delish.  Average, way overrated and overpriced food (our bill for 3 came to about 95 dollars), a long wait to get seated, and a long wait to get our food as well.  That said, our excellent server Alyssa was so utterly professional and kind, that I would have felt bad telling her that I didn't like the food there.  So there.  Would I return?  I don't think so.  Maybe just to take out some cheesecake, that's it."
Val V.,"Elyria, OH",3,14,3,4.0,12/4/2014,Red velvet cheesecake is the bomb. Like that they're offering healthy choices showing calorie count. Pricey but the serving can last me another meal.
Marissa K.,"Cleveland, OH",4,106,,1.0,7/3/2014,"I don't know why I went back to this Cheesecake Factory.  The food is never as good as the Columbus or Lyndhurst.  The service is usually not as friendly either.  Today's visit diffently proved that.  We were seated right away which was nice.  Then proceeded to sit there for over 20 minutes without any beverages.  One waiter asked us and said he would help us. So we saw he had other tables, so we waited (cause I was going to wait 1 more minute so that it would be an even 20 minutes at that point) while he helped his tables.  When he left, we thought, well now maybe we will get something to drink.  Then we saw him cleaning the tables.  I saw other people while waiting who did the bussing, not the servers.  So we all got up and left.  Then one in our party wanted to talk to a manager on our way out.  He happened to be at the hostess station we were passing.  He basically rolled his eyes at us with a smirk on his face.  Didn't even offer any platitudes or apologies (barely even looked at any of the four of us).  The restaurant was not that busy, not even half full.  Plus, they had plenty of people working there and walking around. Edit: So I pasted this review to the company's website.  The restaurant's General Manager just called me to apologize.  He was at least kind enough to do this.  Still highly doubtful I'll go back to this place."
John C.,"Strongsville, OH",39,82,86,4.0,3/3/2013,Wait was 75 mins. Saturday night around 6 pm. We shopped and came back and were seated promptly. I enjoyed everything about my meal.  Except they rang out of bang bang.  My favorite dish.  I had to settle for the southwestern salad.  So everything here is served in huge portions.  I guess I get what I'm paying for because it justifies the price on all the menu items. Server was as good as it gets.  Greeted us as soon as we were seated and took care of us no problems.  He did a great job.  If I had any issue I had to ask for a drink refill.  Not really a big deal. Overall I was pleased.  I'd come back.
