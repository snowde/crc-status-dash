Ross H.,"New York, NY",292,94,376,4.0,11/25/2017,"I have been coming to this Cheesecake Factory location for years, and they always do a great job. Be warned that if you come at prime hours you will wait to be seated up to 45 min easily, this place gets packed. The menu here is massive, to the point where it is genuinely hard to make a choice sometimes, which is why I usually always stick to the same items I love. Tex Mex Egg Rolls Sliders Deluxe Angel Hair Pasta with Shrimp Cookie Dough Cheesecake Chicken Caesar Salad Everything here comes in massive portions. I would stick to the pastas, burgers, and appetizers (which are entree size). That's what they do best here."
Carolyn F.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",8,82,433,1.0,1/5/2018,"UPDATE: I received a generic response from someone at the restaurant. Essentially, this person confirmed that they don't take reservations. SHORT-SITED, especially since White Plains has so many great restaurants that see the value in group dining. THAT SETTLED IT: I definitely will NOT be dining at Cheesecake Factory White Plains until they become more guest-centric.  ORIGINAL REVIEW STANDS!: UNhappy Birthday: We were staying in White Plains at Athens CAMBRiA and Crowne Plaza and wanted to celebrate my Daughter's birthday over dinner at The Cheesecake Factory, White Plains on a Thursday night We were a party of 8 so at @5:30 pm, I called ahead to reserve a table. Being just 5minutes away at the CAMBRiA on a Main Street, we knew we could make it by 5:45.  Rob gave us such a hard time with the "" reservation rules"", and would not confirm a table for us, stating that 15 minutes was outside of the window that qualifies for a reservation and telling us to walk in and ""wait"". So I pressed him to get him to give me a firm time for the earliest reservation time he could offer. His response was, ""what time do you want? REALLY, Rob? Frustrated, I responded, ""the earliest you can CONFIRM a real reservation so we are not standing around."" I reminded him that we were celebrating my daughter's birthday. This fell on very deaf ears: After MORE back and forth, he reluctantly offered me 6:30- (a full hour later). When I hung up, I felt resentful of the treatment and a polled my Group. They no longer were excited about Cheesecake Factory. No one wanted to go there anymore, so I called back in order to cancel and explain why, but I was bounced around two more times and placed on hold when I asked for the manager- So, ultimately I hung up in frustration. TOO BAD they were so difficult, because their attitude LOST a birthday celebration for EIGHT covers. The single star is strictly for the attitude. As an aside, I dine out for business nearly 10 times/week and have had some good meals at Cheesecake Factory over the years, but this experience soure"
Christopher R.,"Westchester County, NY",4,83,,4.0,11/3/2017,"For casual dining, this place is outstanding. Went with my wife last night and had an excellent meal. We were seated right away and I couldn't get over the size of the place. The atmosphere is very comfortable and spacious. For appetizers, my wife had the ""Pot Stickers"" which are chicken-filled dumplings with a soy ginger sauce. She's had them before and raved about them. I had the buffalo wings. They were crispy, flavorful, and well presented. For main course, my wife had the ""Cuban Sandwich"" and I had the ""Bacon-bacon cheeseburger"" which is exactly what the menu said it would be. Cooked right and very flavorful. Tiffany, our waitress, was very friendly, polite, professional, and attentive. Even the bus staff was polite and courteous. We passed on dessert but instead, purchased a ""30th Anniversary"" cheesecake to bring home. All in all, an excellent casual dining experience. My only reason for omitting a fifth star :  Like other Yelpers (and this cannot be attributed to the establishment itself), I found  that parking is not very convenient and you have to pay for  it.  Other than that, the service was excellent and the food very enjoyable."
Colette H.,"New York, NY",590,443,3227,1.0,11/2/2017,"My food was good, hence the one star.  The bartenders (were both) inattentive. They didn't ask me home my food was. It was difficult to flag them down and I would've ordered more but they didn't come over to check on me. I don't know if I'd come back here. The service wasn't up to par."
Mercedes C.,"White Plains, NY",92,561,4122,3.0,9/10/2017,"Is it petty of me to just write about a slice of cheesecake? Maybe.  While I've lived in White Plains for 16 years, I think I may have visited Factory once. Nothing terrible about them, but very little, grabs my attention here. Nonetheless, we moved away from our usual City Limits pastries to have something different.  Worth mentioning, service was pleasant and smooth on the phone. Placed an order for a L'e'moncello Cream Torte for The Man and a Chocolate Cheesecake for pick up. Just five minutes away and the young lady said, that it'll be ready right away. And sure they were- speedy and waiting for me at their counter.  My Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake at home later that night, looked decadent. Taste? Lacked a real cocoa punch for me. Insignificant to many, I take chocolate anything- serious. On the other hand, The Man's Lemoncello Cake, was very nice and refreshing.  For $17 and change for both, my Chocolate Cheesecake wasn't all that. And feel their cheesecakes in general- are overpriced. At that moment, I just wished White Plains had a Junior's. A slice of Junior's Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake, begs me to have another- primarily because, it's that freaking good and cocoaey.  I personally feel that for the $8 and change that I paid, Junior's tops, Cheesecake Factory's 'Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake' in taste and price- ANYTIME."
Akeyla S.,"West Harrison, West Harrison, NY",122,20,12,2.0,12/20/2017,"There was a slight wait when I came into the restaurant but nothing that I could not deal with. When I was seated, a dirty menu with food was given to my friend and needed to ask for a new one. I had recently reached out to the Cheesecake Factory expressing a bad experience I had and they provided me with a gift card. To be truthful, I cannot say that my most recent experience was much better. The food came out after a good amount of time but when I asked for more brown bread, it took a fairly long time for the bread to come out and my waiter had included brown and white bread (which is fine, just shows either a lack of communication that white bread is standard or forgetfulness). I truly love the Cheesecake Factory food and I think it's a fairly nice restaurant given how relatively cheap it is but overall, I think the quality of the service and decreased over the years."
Sisi Z.,"White Plains, NY",22,2,,2.0,1/7/2018,Slowwwwwwwww! Take forever to get your take out. Steak tasted incredibly dry! The worst steak ever ever
Juliane L.,"New York, NY",361,610,1323,5.0,7/20/2017,"Did you know that there are 1000s of calories in a slice of cheesecake??!!! Omg. Haha. I used to eat them quite often before the numbers came through, a looooong time ago. Well, well, needless to say I totally skipped the cheesecake this time around. Adulting gives you serious guilt about a 1000 kcal something dessert.  Of course, the bread is awesome. An awesome chemical storm. And the dishes are, gotta say, yummy. Huge, huge, huge servings and lots and lots and lots of kcal.  I like that there is a skinny menu, where you can actually order a healthy dish with reasonable calories. Healthy and tasty.  I can go on and hate the numbers, but I always love the Cheesecake Factory. May actually be the only chain I would vouch for."
Liz M.,"New York, NY",0,10,8,5.0,11/11/2017,"Best Cheesecake factory I ever been to! So many options on the menu. Our waitress was super nice the portions here are huge I'm sure you can even be full with just an appetizer as well. Our nice waitress packed up the rest of my food because I just couldn't fit anymore lol. The signature cheesecakes here are so fresh, I would recommend the Oreo dream slide! We got ours to go. Overall this is a huge Cheesecake Factory and it will not disappoint in the rich flavor of food and speedy service."
Sarah W.,"White Plains, NY",6,111,120,4.0,8/6/2017,"Three stars for regular food....five stars for cheesecake! Like most cheesecake factories, this place is huge and family friendly. Service is great and fast. The menu is so big that they don't always execute everything 100% (twice I have ordered the choli and it has been watery). But the cheesecake is amazinggggggg."
Stacey M.,"Phoenix, AZ",9,20,,3.0,11/20/2017,"I will at least start out by saying that our food was delicious, I had the vegan Cobb & it was loaded with good stuff & my husband had their fettuccine which was very tasty! However, when I have to use my cell phone light to read the menu and to see what I'm eating.... the place is way too dim! Even the table next to us is using their cell phone light to read the menu. This is enough to make me really irritated and why I gave them 3 stars. I  hope they will acknowledge this and brighten up the place a bit."
Jennifer Y.,"Valhalla, NY",2,23,22,1.0,9/9/2017,"Definitely the WORST service out of all the Cheesecake Factory locations in the area. We have probably been here 15 times out of convenience (location, hours). There is one particular server who is seriously so horrible (blonde/light brunette guy with a beard). Arrogant attitude, no consideration, obviously hates his job. We dread it when he is chosen to be our server. And we aren't even picky either! We just want to get our drinks, order our food, eat it, and leave. No special requests. Not sure why they're so bad at that. When we went to the Palisades Cheesecake Factory, I was so surprised that our server was actually nice and friendly (something we are not used to at the White Plains location), so I asked to speak to the manager just to thank her for the great service!"
Ale U.,"Upper South Providence, Providence, RI",0,6,4,5.0,10/16/2017,"Thank you guys for making a special moment in my family, the staff went above and beyond to help us do a gender reveal.  Forever in my heart :)"
Liana L.,"Valhalla, NY",363,566,1512,4.0,3/27/2017,"For whatever reason, my friends at school traditionally go to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate their birthdays; I guess it's one of the only places that can seat large parties (we had 30 people at the last one) and has affordable options that everyone likes. Also their bread is bomb. :)  Portions are huge (my entrée always ends up being 3 meals for me), the food is consistent, the service is good and there's bright lighting outside for a nice group photo. I learned on my last visit that the usual dim lighting only starts around 7pm, so if you want nice photos in the restaurant, go for lunch or an early dinner!  They're really great about accommodating reservations, though there was one time when we had a party in the 20s around 7-8pm and we had to wait an hour. :( In general, whenever I go there in a giant group, it takes at least 3 hours ... so the food doesn't come that fast for large parties, but it's probably okay in smaller groups. If your reservation is pretty early, though, you'll probably get seated in a timely manner. It's been fine the other times.  I always get the Jamaican black pepper shrimp with rice, pineapple and plantains - the flavors are amazing. The spiciness level varies, but the spicier the better :) I highly recommend this and I can't even make myself try anything else because I always want this. The brown bread is super good, and they always bring us warm, fresh bread (and again when we request more). The avocado egg rolls appetizer is also phenomenal. They sing happy birthday and include a dessert for birthdays.  Overall, I do really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory; I'm only docking a star for the hour+ wait when we had a reservation because that was really annoying - it's rough enough to block out 3+ hours for dinner without adding an extra hour for waiting. :( I recommend CF for smaller groups, but it totally is a solid option for large ones too."
Monica M.,"White Plains, NY",43,296,287,4.0,4/12/2017,"Have been here 10+ times, so this is an average of all of my visits. Great service for the most part, has been spotty at times. Amazing food- the food definitely never disappoints. The waits on the weekends have never been more than 15-20 minutes which is doable. The parking is in the garage and they validate under an hour, which unfortunately, I have never met. It's $3 cash for 1-3 hours. Overall, really love this place. Amazing food and drinks and good service."
L G.,"Southampton, PA",0,33,28,1.0,7/23/2017,"Not starting off very good! Was seated at obviously dirty table and the waitress just dropped greasy menus at the table without saying a word. The a bussing per placed silverware on the table we asked for the table to be cleaned first. He came back with a dirty rag and wiped the table picking up the silverware with his now dirty hands. The waitresses took our orders finally and came back with our drinks. My ice tea tasted lick spearmint and appeared to have chewing tobacco in it. I ordered the filet but was given a mock filet! The side of carrots and pecans had dried oregano on them, discussing!"
Mike W.,"White Plains, NY",0,2,,1.0,10/23/2017,"Back in March my wife and I were celebrating our 31st wedding anniversary with our five year old granddaughter and against my better judgement I disregarded the reviews of your restaurant. I wrote this back in March and never sent it. I ran across it again and decided you should know what you took from us that evening. It was supposed to be a fun relaxing evening instead it was an expensive disaster. I hoped against hope the reviews were wrong they were dead on unfortunately. We arrived before the evening rush and was seated in the bar area right next to the POS station. So think about this, the restaurant is one fourth full and you give us the worst seat in the restaurant. We weren't asked if this table was OK I was told it was OK. As we sat down my wife looked at me and mouthed the question is this table OK? Over my shoulder I heard two employees talking at the terminal and not wanting to hear that all dinner I went up and asked for a new table. Your restaurant made me ask for a new table already not a good start for us relaxing and you doing your job. We were then taken to the back of the restaurant where we should have been taken first.      The food was so late to come out of the kitchen one of the managers came out and apologized for the delay. Prior to that nothing was said about the delay we just sat there trying to keep our granddaughter entertained and wondering why our drinks weren't being refilled. Then as if that wasn't enough, built into the ledge next to the table there was a vent that had a rattling fan every time it turned on. We just chalked it up to the experience. When the food did arrive it was good no complaints except for the salad. After we finished our dinner my wife wanted cheese cake so we ordered it to go. At this point little had gone right for us and we were ready to go so I had hoped for some urgency from the management staff with this request but we had been forgotten it took another twenty minutes for that to happen. I thought you might like to know you could have done much better.       After I wrote this letter I was offered thirty dollars for the unsatisfactory service then on further insistence of this disastrous dinner I was offered the full price of the meal back seventy dollars. At this point seventy dollars doesn't even cover the amount of effort I had to put out just to let them know their incompetence ruined our evening. In reading the recent reviews they still haven't figured out customer service. My advice just don't go they don't deserve your business."
Rich C.,"Narberth, PA",0,4,,2.0,9/15/2017,"Started with bad smell that thankfully was not in the dining area. Then not greeted at the table for seven minutes. After that, things got better. The San Pellegrino, while pricey, was served promptly and at a very palatable and refreshing temperature: 42 degrees. DO NOT forget to get your dressings on the side. They must use a half cup in each salad. Salads reviewed today: 1.  House:   The house side salad was a small bowl of mescalin greens. The proposed dressing might have helped, but it was bland and uninteresting. The greens had been pretty abused, bruised and battered, but were fresh and dry. No wet or rotting bits. The side salad gets three stars.  2.  Fresh kale:  the kale was fresh and odor free. No small feat. And dry. Good flavor balance between the raisins, Marcona almonds and scallions, but the real winner was the celery leaves. Brilliant, simple and delicious. The salad needs citrus, so a small spritz of lemon did the trick. In fact, there were some Granny Smith apple bits in there that, had they been dressed in lemon, would have made the combination much improved. The dressing is not reviewed. Three and 1/2 stars for the kale salad.   The hamburger was served on a brioche style roll. It was fresh, toasted on the correct side and delicious. The lettuce on the burger was badly torn pieces of iceberg lettuce that had to be removed and replaced with mescalin. The tomato slice was and end. The burger was ordered medium and served close to medium, a bit overcooked. The pattie itself was flavorful, lean and proportional to the roll. The over cooking was this reviewers fault, took too long evaluating the the salads. The burger gets 2 1/2 stars.  Average:  3 stars before value considerations.  The total cost of a small plate salad and the lunch entree with a side salad and a pellegrino was $22.00, with tip, $27.00.  I left my Amex and was not contacted, so I cancelled it.  Overall, with value considerations for price, the Cheesecake Factory gets two stars."
Tash A.,"Hillcrest, Queens, NY",276,2,,1.0,10/14/2017,"I thought it was odd seeing a dog in the lobby, but what was worse was when the girl went behind the counter and employees starting touching it. THEN people who work in the kitchen started touching it and went straight back to work. I usually like the Cheesecake Factory, today I went, the wait wasn't too long, they walked me back and my table wasn't ready so we walked back to the front got called again.. and when we got back to the back our table was given to someone else and the second table they had available was still not ready..very upsetting, just wanted to enjoy some stuffed mushroom.."
Joe M.,"New York, NY",1,11,2,2.0,10/10/2017,"I predict this location will be closed within a year or less.  I've been frequenting this place since it opened.  Over the last year or so, the food, service and general upkeep have all gone downhill.  It's a shame, but hopefully it will be replaced with something better."
Tiffany L.,"Bath Beach, Brooklyn, NY",41,167,573,3.0,5/26/2016,"This location is better than the others I've been to. The servers are attentive and seem to be good at addressing the customers. I ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp and my friend ordered the fish and chips. For dessert, we ordered the Oreo dream extreme cheesecake and the Reese's peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake. The bang bang chicken and shrimp was seasoned well with spices and the pasta still had a bite, the way I like my pasta. The different colors added to the aesthetic of the plate. My friend said the fish and chips were not oily. However, the fish lacked the proper moistness and a little more seasoning. The Oreo cheesecake was absolutely divine. The layers melted in my mouth and the balance of sweet and tangy was perfect. The Reese's cheesecake was alright. It didn't really taste like Reese's; it resembled more like wholesale brand peanut butter."
Gayle E.,"White Plains, NY",2,2,,1.0,5/28/2017,"I don't know whether the management has changed here, or what, but this place has gotten dreadful. We were there at an off hour, when the place wasn't full, and waited more than 30 minutes for food. Our waitress was hiding, so we couldn't ask her what was up, and the people on either side of us (who came in and ordered after us) were halfway through their meals, while we were sitting with nothing. I finally spotted a manager and waved him over, and his response was ""Oh, you want me?"" He left, never to be seen again. Food finally came out and was cold and the sauce was broken, so clearly it had been sitting for a long time. The waitress finally came over after the runner brought the food, and was trying to cozy up to us, commenting on my tattoo, asking if she could get us more drinks. Too little, too late. We're done with this place."
Samantha K.,"East Northport, NY",366,95,181,3.0,1/15/2017,"I've only been to this location for happy hour in the bar area. Both times (at least 9 months apart) the service was lagging and waiters were flustered when dealing with a group of 7-8 of us. Overall the deals are great if you're looking for small plates and mixed cocktails. Beer on tap is only $4 during happy hour. I suggest sharing even the small plates, it's a lot of food and it is Cheesecake Factory!"
Ash S.,"New York, NY",4,33,3,1.0,7/9/2017,"This is the third time i ordered from this place, but no more. First two times i was conservative on leaving a review.  Note: i have had cheesecake factory food in many cities! Many things about this place - as compared to other branches in other cities, the portions are small ( but generous on oil - yay fat people), almost always undercooked, and this third time this was stale as well. In addition, this third time i called them up to complain about food - i was put in never ending chain of talk-to-my-manager.. I ordered 4 different pastas, fries, and cheesecake. Only cheese cake lived upto its name, others strictly no... Good luck, but these people lost my business."
Aloysia C.,"Bronx, NY",0,3,,1.0,10/29/2017,"I was in today around 2:30 with my husband and son we were seated immediately.  However we were at our table for 15 mins. There were waiters casually talking to each other and tending to other guests. I noticed a few waiters walk by and look at us but no one said anything. We decided to leave when I told the hostess she was apologitic, however when she told who seemed to be the manager ,who seemed to be to busy to look at me, his response was ok take care. Totally disrespectful I don't know if I will ever feel comfortable going back so I won't. P.s I still had to pay for parking when we didn't even patronize the establishment."
Antonina N.,"Valley Stream, NY",4,19,2,5.0,7/9/2017,"Cheesecake Factory food all tastes the same, I am leaving this review because I loooove this location.  Idk about the hostesses and bakery section people they seem to hate their job but............  The servers /bartenders are amazing ! Everyone is so friendly and warm and make the experience. There are three particular servers that I always ask for because they are the sweetest, but the rest of the staff is just as wonderful"
Frederick V.,"Westtown, NY",0,4,1,2.0,8/3/2017,"First time here. Restaurant was late by a few minutes opening its door to the public. About 10 people waiting. No comment by the person opening the door, not even ""Welcome"". Waitress was nice and attentive. Had to shoo away fruit flies that likely came from the Whole Foods next door. Menu prices about average for the area. The food was good and cooked as ordered. To move my rating from a 2, to a 3 or 4 in the future, the restaurant needs to focus on the details of providing excellent customer service. The technical aspects of providing a lunch were there, but the little things that make the experience memorable were absent. Unfortunately, that's the norm these days will all too many restaurants."
Ishrat A.,"Falls Church, VA",0,8,,2.0,10/9/2017,"The service was very bad. Went to dinner at 8 pm on a Sunday night and after we got seated, no waiter or waitress came to our table for 15 minutes. Finally, we asked an employee if we could get some water and he said our waitress will be with us in a couple of minutes. After 20 minutes, the waitress finally arrives. No apology or explanation for why we had to sit so long without a drink. She doesn't ask if we want anything to drink or if we want bread. She asked us if we're ready to order. After this, we asked to talk to the Manager, his name was Joe. He did nothing to make us feel welcome. Eventually, I ordered the steak and chicken combo. It was not bad, nothing special. My boyfriend ordered the cheesesteak - it was awful!!! The meat was so chewy. He barely touched it. I will never eat here again. Servers are bad, management does not care, and food is a hit or miss. Go anywhere else!!!"
Shannon M.,"Larchmont, NY",25,16,1,5.0,9/24/2017,"Just had a great customer service experience while picking up a whole original cheesecake for my son's birthday. The manager, (Michael?) came over to help because the people behind the cheesecake case were swamped, shortening my waiting time, excellent! I was offered the sour cream topping which was spun decoratively onto my cake, which I've never been offered in all my years of coming to pick up my son's birthday cheesecake, and he even threw in a cake server to make the job easier. While I was waiting, another person came out to tell me that they were making the topping and it would be a few minutes, so I was given time to run my errands. It's nice to see great service when youre just running in."
Nelson G.,"Bronx, NY",28,10,8,1.0,2/26/2017,"Came here with my wife on a busy monday night. The wait was 15 mins to be seated, which is fine. Once seated we were brought hard/cold bread which really turned us off. We asked for warm bread and once again received COLD/HARD bread.         Anyhow we ordered calamari as an appetizer. After it was brought out, we asked for marinara sauce. Which was never brought to us.        My wife ordered chicken romano, which was unpleasantly cold. On top of the fact that the waitress was not attentive at all. We were not asked once if everything was ok.       Finally I must add that many employees walk around with uniforms that look like they haven't been washed in weeks. Not very presentable."
Nick S.,"White Plains, NY",44,28,1,3.0,8/30/2017,Great food great portions great menu great for large group.  Downside a little pricy and they sometimes have a problem with separate checks for our large group.
Big Z.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,1,1.0,7/21/2017,I just spit out a staple when eating my leftovers from last night for lunch. There was a staple in chicken (chicken little). I could have choked on this. Needless to say the service was terrible when I was there. Don't come here.
Audi T.,"San Francisco, CA",23,1,,1.0,5/13/2017,"Went in for dinner and was told it would be an hour wait. Ok, we know they get busy and we were willing to waitWell after an hour and a half we are still waiting and the hostess has an attitude!!!   15 minutes into being seated and still no bread, wait staff or any acknowledgement that we are even in the restaurant.  Mind you I have 3 children with me.  Never again!!!"
Paula M.,"Bronx, NY",195,310,172,4.0,10/15/2015,"Love this place. Love the location although because I don't drive it isn't very convenient but who cares it's worth the trip! But please open one up closer to the city.  Love the decor, I don't know exactly what to call it, but it's awesome, beautiful. This place is HUGE!!!  Tables HUGE!!!  The service is always good, I love how clean and polish the staff is and very friendly. I had a girl names Leann she was so cute and really nice, great personality and  attentive.  I would love to have her work with me so if you read this Call ME!  The FOOD, YUMMMM, HUGE portions at a reasonable price.  I love that they give you complimentary bread & my fav is the wheat one, I think that's what it is. I always get the CRISPY CHICKEN COSTOLETTA: Chicken Breast Lightly Breaded and Sautéed to a Crisp Golden Brown. Served with Lemon Sauce, Mashed Potatoes and Fresh Asparagus. My mom had GRILLED PORK CHOP: Center-Cut Chop Served with Housemade Apple Sauce, Mashed Potatoes and Fresh Spinach. Also delicious and my niece had the kids spaghetti and meatballs, I tasted it and  So0o0o good as well.  The CHEESECAKE!!! My ultimate favorite, the red velvet. I've tasted others and none compare. I also took home and tried the pumkin, ehhh not my favorite, just really mushy so strange. My niece had the oreo that was pretty good. We also had the raspberry lemon, it was ok, a bit too tart.  Love this place and go every chance I get which unfortunately is not many."
Chris S.,"Beacon, NY",4,15,10,1.0,7/11/2017,"The slowest service ever the appetizer came before the drinks and waited more than an hour on the food. 2 hours till we got our food. My and one of my friends drink was great, but my other friends drink was terrible. We spoke to the manager and she as just nodding her head up and down and all she offered was 3 free cheesecakes. We here pretty much there for 3 hours waited for food for 2 hours ate for 15 min and waited 45 min for a bill and dessert.  I had to ask another server to charge my card cause our server was no were to be found. I never leave terrible but this was BAD"
L K.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,32,,1.0,7/7/2017,"Food is fine, but takes FOREVER to come out, even when the restaurant is empty. This would be fine if they validated for more than 1 hour, which is never enough to cover even the quickest meal there. Over 1 hour the validation is useless and you have to pay the full 3 hour price, and the garage takes cash only. Highly recommend against this location until they start validating for longer, or the garage adjusts their policies."
J C.,"Yonkers, NY",0,9,,2.0,3/17/2017,Overpriced for what it is a chain restaurant chicken tastes frozen.  Shepards pie watery.  Was load server not very pleasant. Other locations a lot better.  Had to pay to park as well.  Usual lower westchester nonsense overcrowded overpriced poor quality.
Steve T.,"Stamford, CT",94,81,71,5.0,6/10/2017,"Really good place. Service and location are really good! Can't go wrong with the factory nachos with chicken....delicious in every bite. Also some dishes I recommend, the Cajun chicken littles, the Chicken Madeira, or the factory meatloaf! All delicious. The cheesecakes are phenomenal. Can't go wrong with a peanut butter cheesecake or Hershey chocolate one."
Jeffrey P.,"Penn's Landing, Philadelphia, PA",12,11,,1.0,1/9/2017,Came here the first time with my family (6 of us) and they brought everyone's meal out but mine.  I thought the meal would be right out so I didn't say anything...15min later (which felt like forever) the waiter comes back and said they made my meal wrong and it would be out in 5 min.  I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich...which has 2 options of either buffalo style or chipotle mayo.  I was guessing they screwed up and put chipotle mayo on it.  20 min later the waiter finally comes back with the wrong sandwich.  Everyone was already done eating long before that point and he also forgot the some side orders and some waters. I got gift card so decided to try it again a month later.  Ordered the same crispy chicken sandwich chipotle style...figured they couldn't screw it up twice.  I happened to get the same waiter...an hour later the chipotle mayo crispy sandwich arrives.  NEVER AGAIN!
Erika T.,"New York, NY",6,144,5,2.0,11/7/2016,"This 2-star review is for the service here (because, let's face it, food at every Cheesecake Factory is practically the same). My friend and I arrived at 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon -- well after the brunch crowd, well before the dinner cowd. Yet we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. When we were seated, the place wasn't crowded, meaning there were plently of empty tables around us. It took another 10 minutes for our server to take our order. She had just cleared a nearby table so her hands were full of empty dishes, so she tried to commit what we said to memory, asked each of us to repeat ourselves. Did I mention there were only 2 of us? And we ordered 1 appetizer to share and 2 entrees- that's 3 dishes to remember.  After 25 minutes, all 3 dishes arrived at once. Yes, the appetizer along with our entrees, even though she specifically asked if the app should come first and we said yes. In the 25 minutes of our wait, we witnessed the table next to us got the wrong check. During the meal, our water glasses were never refilled, and we never saw the server. She finally noticed we were done, cleared the table, and I had to ask for water. She asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu, we said yes. Another 10 minutes go by. We see lots of other wait staff just chatting with each other - at least 2 groups of 3 within my sight. And of course, *our* server was nowhere to be seen. But when she finally reappears, it's with our check, at which time I reminded her that we would like dessert. To top this all off, when we tried to have our parking validated, we were told that it's only if we'd been here under an hour. Yeah, well, whose fault wast that?!"
