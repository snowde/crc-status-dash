Kristelle V.,"Yonkers, NY",33,103,76,5.0,7/16/2011,"I LOVE TCF!!! which is what my greedy girlfriends and I call it to be greedy and lazy :) Don't be a snob, their food is awesome!! The menu is ginormous, but everything I've ordered has been greatness. This is my go-to for girly dates :) especially during Happy Hour, $5 drinks and appetizers! awesome mango margaritas! Great entrees include Miso Salmon, Herb encrusted Salmon, Hibachi Steak, Pan Seared Salmon, Chicken Madeira, Chicken Marsala, jerk chicken and shrimp with black beans and rice and mango salsa...I'm pretty sure everything is awesome. All their appetizers are amazeballs as well, I love their avocado wraps (OMG). My bf ordered something that came with succotash (Thufferin Thuccotash hehe). It was the first time I tried it and it was lovely! Portions are enormous, especially for the prices (about $10-$15 for lunchtime and $15-30 for dinner? yeah sounds about right) This location is convenient with all the stores nearby...it's right across the street from the Westchester Mall. However, the wait can be ridiculous. I mean RIDICULOUS. My family hates when it's my turn to pick a place to eat cuz I almost always choose TCF and none of us are very patient. There's a Whole Foods in the same building, as well as a Dick's Sporting Goods, but the beepy thing only works in the immediate vicinity, i.e. sit your ass down by the door.  I always feel like the food is worth the wait. ooooh and the brown bread in bread basket :) I love."
Leonardo D.,"Valhalla, NY",4,62,5,3.0,2/25/2014,I am a fan of cheesecake factory but it seems like the service was not up to par when we came during a non busy time.  The host had to ask this waiter to seat us several times before the server begrudgingly complied and seated us without talking to us .  When we asked for straws with our drinks our tables server forgot and we finally were able to get them from someone else.  When we were served our lettuce wraps as an appetizer they were on a very small plate and we were given very small plates .  It's a messy dish so most of it wound up on the table. Though I am nitpicking That kind of attention to detail ads/detracts to dining experience. It was a waste of half of our portions. When the waiter brought out our order he brought me the wrong side on my sandwich.  We had seen that he didn't put in our order right after he took it so that didn't surprise us.  Nevertheless we enjoyed the food add wet usually do here.  Disappointed this one time about service
M. S.,"Cortlandt Manor, NY",1,10,,1.0,4/15/2012,"Food good, menu too extensive. The service was awful, the worst ever. Inexcusably slow. Apparently, the plan is once you're seated, you're staying forever with nowhere to be later with nothing to do. Well, we did. (Had to get to a train to get to NYC; thanks to the service, forced to drive down.) Better: When we complained about the waitress to the manager, nothing down to make angry customers happy. Well, same to you, buddy; we know where we're never going back to. The drinks were great -- except for the price and lack of alcohol. And the managers were maybe worse: They essentially defended unacceptable service. It was so bad an experience, that it's hard to review with using an F bomb."
Randy F.,"New York, NY",25,188,5,4.0,8/3/2011,"I think The Cheesecake Factory defines America in terms of what Americans really like to eat and how they like to eat.  Reason being is because.... A- Big portions--- Nothing here is the size of a golf ball. Even the lemon wedges they give you for water are bigger.  B- Big Menus--- Looking at the menu here is like reading the Koran.  C- Big Seats---- A booth at Cheesecake factory that is normally able to fit 4 people in typical restaurants can fit 6-8 people.  D- Fancy / Suburbia classy atmosphere- Outside of big cities like NYC and DC, people flock to Cheesecake factory no matter how hot it is, how cold it is outside, how bad the economy is to enjoy these 5000 calorie desserts and 3000 calorie penne while they are with their date/ loved ones/  C- Not a pretentious place- It may be very "" White"" this place, but you can see all walks of life dining here especially this location in White plains.  P.S this location doesn't have free parking so either you walk here from the train or just suck it up.  Came here last week for a couple of friends. I haven't been to this location in years since I am a city boy and I am poor. Flash forward to last week my friend took me to a country club and after shopping at neiman, I decided to get some grub. Rather then eating at whole foods as always and being the fact that it was 11am, we decided to wait it out for the 1130 opening time. First time ever I never had to wait for a table and first time ever I waited for a restaurant to open up. muhahahas.  Ordered the Jumbo shrimp carbonara with linguine. The portions are huge. Oh my mother of god. If Kim jong Il brought his people to the cheesecake factory, no one would leave his country, because everything was just excessive. My friends Chinese chicken salad was like the size of a personal pizza pie and my other friends Chicken Marsala was hugggeee. Even though the portions were huge, the food was really good. My shrimp with pasta tasted very garlicy and the shrimp was well made. It was not overcooked and so was the pasta. The server and the bus boy brought us bread countless number of times as well as refilling our cups with water. Food coma ready to happen...  For a city boy, coming here would make it seem affordable because everything here is roughly 15-20 dollars an entree and the portions are big enough that you can take home for your next meal. For an average Joe who lives in the middle of Nebraska and has to take his girl out on a date, this place would deem high class or pricey. So It can go both ways.... BUT FYI don't come here on a Saturday or Sunday for brunch. The wait is epic bad."
Bryan G.,"Fort Myers, FL",9,25,,5.0,7/29/2014,I came here with my wife and friends. love it great place to eat and rest your mind.
LISA N.,"New York, NY",853,381,281,3.0,6/22/2011,"Louisiana chicken pasta (ask for angel hair and extra sauce)...best. Floors, slippery and don't dress up when coming here, there were so many times when I was wearing heels and had to hold on to one of my friends just so I wouldn't slip and fall.  SERIOUS LAW SUIT WAITING TO HAPPEN. THE WAIT: oh god. The wait is ridiculous, they give you one of those beepers, and you wait. I've impatiently waited for over 1.5 hours before, I would've left, but my family wanted to stay.   Beers are cold, wine glasses are big.  Too crowded though. And strawberry cheesecake and tiramisu are good.   I would just rather support little restaurants than chains."
Kassy M.,"San Diego, CA",260,1352,639,2.0,5/27/2011,"Aside from their delicious cheesecakes, this place sucks. 1. Overpriced parking in parking garage 2. They have a long wait at times 3. Overpriced food 4. Horrible decor 5. Annoying Westchester mothers talking very loudly 6. Mediocre food"
Rachie R.,"White Plains, NY",1,47,1,4.0,7/17/2014,"pretty good food, a lot of variety, good value for your money and depending on how busy service can vary but generally pretty good regardless you usually have to wait to be seated as well based on when you visit plus you have to pay for parking the only thing i don't like is the fake wannbe white plains crowd"
Dan M.,"Cranbury, NJ",0,19,,4.0,10/4/2012,"You can't really go wrong with the Cheescake Factory. The menu has more options than Chinese take-out and the food is dependably great. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the service is always good. There are, however, two problems: (1) parking costs $3.00, and (2) it gets insanely packed (and noisy) on weekends."
Viv S.,"New York, NY",5,16,,4.0,1/5/2014,"The Cheesecake factory has very good food that is consistent each time we go there.  The service is always good too.  I have had the pasta, burgers and many other dishes. The only negative is the long wait to get in that usually spans about an hour to an hour and a half."
Sadri B.,"White Plains, NY",5000,1934,449,4.0,7/26/2014,"Since this place has open I have been a loyal patron the menu is a phonebook but not as big as before but still many choices. From apps to entrees you can't go wrong. Service from staff is always good, I always come here with my buddy porcelli He loves the potato skins stuffed and the Orange chicken for entree. When he is finished it looks like vultures ate it cause there is nothing left . As for me I am not a big cheesecake fan but there are other desserts that are yummy. Mr porcelli loves cheescake He always orders 2 slices which he sucks down faster than a speeding bullet my God what a slob when the whip cream is all over his face and shirt.  Over all I dig this place"
Dj C.,"Port Chester, NY",1,6,1,4.0,4/24/2015,"Excellent service from waitstaff and great tasting food for the price. Wide selection from pasta to seafood to burgers. Desert select is big as well, only reason this couldn't get a 5 star is subpar quality with the apple crisp desert. Too doughy, not enough apples. Other wise two thumbs up!"
Chris F.,"Elmsford, NY",0,1,,1.0,7/9/2015,"If I could give 0 stars I would. It took our server 10-15 minutes to come and take our drink order. It's one thing if your busy but they weren't. The waitress was very flustered and seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. It took her another 15 minutes for our drinks to come, our appetizer came before our drinks did (including ice water).  Food came out very quick and it was very good but the customer service aspect was the worst experience I've ever encountered. I asked for cheese for my pasta and it took 5 minutes when grabbing cheese should only take a minute. Asked for water which you have bus-boys for that reason took 6 minutes. Let me say again it's one thing if it's busy, it was the slowest I've ever seen this place. It must have been our servers first night because she was not attentive and friendly at all. Will not return"
Jennifer A.,"White Plains, NY",0,4,,2.0,2/14/2013,"While the prices have remained the same since the cheesecake factory has opened the quality of the food has gone way down as well as the quantity. The plates are the same size but instead of actual food on the plate the plate is carefully covered by sauce and much less food than before.  The service was very poor, the waitress did not know about items on the menu. She insisted on telling us the soup of the day  and specials even when I told her we knew what we wanted. The waitress said she didn't think my mashed potatoes could be changed from regular to garlic. When I mentioned they do it all the time she said she would see.  Bread wasn't brought to our table until 15 minutes after our beverages showed up. Our entrées came before our appetizer. When I mentioned the appetizer hasn't arrived yet the server not the waitress offered to take our food back and put the plates under the warmer. We cancelled the appetizer. Our waitress tried to take away our plates before we were finished eating. We dined during a shift change and ended up with a waiter with a strong accident that also tried to take our plates. He also treated us like we were longtime friends. I do not want my waiter calling me 'mon' or talking to me as if we know each other. Especially if he is going to attempt to take my plate while I'm still chewing my food. We weren't there long, maybe an hour when we decided to leave, so it wasn't like we were sitting there for hours. Also several times the staff moved about to crowd around a table to sing happy birthday, they sing very loudly and sound horrible. It interrupts conversations and is a nuisance please consider stopping it."
Tricia E.,"White Plains, NY",0,5,,3.0,6/10/2014,"So in my opinion all cheesecake factories have the same environment of being loud and busy at times so no surprise.  The only thing I did dislike is for the past few times I have been to this one the waiters have been not that great.  I understand the busy environment but wished was more friendly/attentive staff.  The food is good I love the fried macaroni balls, herb crusted Salmon and dessert is always on point!"
Jing Y.,"Manhattan, NY",41,144,38,4.0,11/7/2011,"This is the place we always come to for special family occasions and their food is consistently good for a chain restaurant.  With the exception of their Thai Chicken Lettuce Wrap, all their other portions are huge!  You also can't go wrong with the abundance of cheesecakes!"
Alyssa D.,"Yonkers, NY",31,70,,4.0,11/29/2010,"Dear White Chocolate Raspberry Cheescake, I hate you. No I love/hate you, but more hate you.  Eating you for the past two weeks has led my grandmother to ask me if I was pregnant.  When I told her no, she told me she didn't believe me and wanted me to take a pregnancy test!!!  I hate to do this through the Internet, but I'm breaking up with you.  Your ex-lover, Alyssa"
Janice K.,"Tarrytown, NY",0,95,,2.0,1/25/2015,"Always a really long wait and the hostesses are rude. The cheesecake is awesome but thats about it. Food is just OK, could be better and it seems they have been running out of bread everytime i go"
Jimmy C.,"Oakland, CA",173,105,219,3.0,10/17/2010,"Like others, it feels a bit pointless to review this place since they follow the chain restaurant standards pretty well. So it's exactly what you expect from a Cheesecake Factory anywhere else in the country--except that the bartender will know how many fumbles versus interceptions there were in the NY Giants game. But I do have some pointers, so here we go... I was hungry, I didn't feel like eating in my hotel room by myself, or in the Whole Foods cafeteria, but had to do some grocery shopping, so to the Cheesecake Factory I went.  Some tips: On an average to busy night, avoid the first floor parking lot, once you get sucked in, you're stuck on a slow, one-way loop of people waiting for spaces and there's always the a**hat that takes up 2 parking spaces because they don't want a door ding in their luxury-brand car. Don't they know that just makes people want to damage them? Park in the plentiful 2nd floor, I like the wide corners in the turns--makes me want to go drifting. If it's just one or two of you, consider hovering over the bar until a seat opens. Much better than the 1 hour wait. Of course, put your name on the front desk wait list just in case the bar is packed with people watching sports instead of eating. If you're eating here because you don't know where else to go, consider the smaller restaurants in nearby Tarrytown. If you want rich, heavy food, you're at the right place. If you want something lighter, always ask the staff how something is made. A simple braised catfish will be drowned in a cream sauce just on principle. I liked the goat cheese and beet appetizer--very simple and served with walnuts, no sauce. Simple, fresh, and just right, They don't validate for parking."
Christina B.,"New York, NY",0,74,,4.0,1/5/2015,"Something for everyone, reasonable prices.  Service is usually good, kitchen is inconsistent in getting orders correct when any special request is made."
