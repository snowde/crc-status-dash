Antoine S.,"Oswego, NY",0,10,,4.0,8/1/2016,Food wise you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Delicious food and the fact that you can sit outside during the summer is a big plus. Never had bad service but sometimes I do feel like we are rushed through our meal.
Gabrielle D.,"Greenwich, CT",1,9,,5.0,9/10/2016,"I have been to this specific Cheesecake Factory location countless time and yet this is the first time I am EXTREMELY satisfied with my service. Ariel was amazing from start to finish, she constantly checked us, our food and made sure we satisfied through the entire course of our meals. She is kind, smiles constantly, is personable and definitely the kind of employee you want to keep around. I work in Sales myself and walked out awfully delighted tonight something I did not expect. Thank you Ariel!"
Topaz M.,"New York, NY",63,8,2,4.0,11/11/2016,I went out for date night with my fiancé. We started out at another restaurant which had terrible customer service. So we ended up at The Cheesecake Factory which was my original first choice. Our waitress Kourtney was great! She was very attentive and friendly. If I was reviewing her only it would be 5 stars. The food was good we had pot stickers as an appetizer and the chicken piccata for the main course. The main course could have had a bit more flavor but it was still tasty. Overall it was a good experience we even took home a slice of pumpkin cheesecake which was delicious.
Alexandra C.,"New York, NY",672,1862,61,4.0,10/3/2014,"Yes, I love big portions and yes after all these years I still love going to Cheesecake Factory!  It is the one and only chain restaurant I find good quality and quantity at.  Still have yet to have anything bad here.   Apparently from the crazy long wait this place still gets a lot of others agree.    Try it at an off time if you don't like waits! Am so craving their oreo cheesecake right now.   But the latest dessert I had- their hot fudge sundae was excellent!"
Jennifer L.,"Peekskill, NY",768,555,818,3.0,6/11/2013,"Ugh. I've eaten at this location a number of times in the past and have never been so disappointed.  Typically we love the Cheesecake Factory but this day that I had lunch with mom and my little one -- the kitchen was totally off! Our waiter was nice and friendly. He took our order and put a rush on my daughters Grilled Cheese. I ordered the Factory Burrito (which btw I've had at the Palisades CF and at the time loved it, which is why I ordered it again here)... Well, it was definitely not like I remembered it. It lacked flavor completely and was quite bland. (I forget the name of my mother's dish but she had a salad with chicken... the chicken was dry and straight up gross. It was to the point that she didn't even finish it.) Anyways, though we had a very unenjoyable meal, chances are we will be back. Not in a any rush to come back, but in due time we will...."
Trish P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,,1.0,2/23/2017,"Awful service, rude manager, billed for drinks we didn't receive and served the wrong wine twice.  Manager came over to give us attitude.  Mediocre food.  Will NEVER go back!!!"
Lil S.,"New York, NY",61,167,263,1.0,10/25/2016,HORRIBLE Service!!! Do not come here if you are planning to spend 3 hours for a meal. Like seriously are we at a fancy 10 course restaurant? NO! Took us 20 mins to get our soft drinks and bread. Then it took another 15 mins for the waiter to come and get our orders. We went to the restaurant around 2pm for brunch on a Sunday and the place wasn't even that crowded. NO WAIT! shocking right? There is a reason!! Took us an an hr to get our main entree too! Ridiculous! Then we find out that the waiter was sitting on an empty table chatting on this phone. WTF! Like seriously? is this how you run a business? Then I see him chatting with the other waiters. Are we just hanging out here or working? The food wasn't even that good. The french dip sandwich was WAY too salty. Very disappointed and we usually like to go back to cheesecake factory because of their food and cheesecake. Would not be going to back to this location!!!
Harris N.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",4,154,58,2.0,5/8/2014,"I normally don't review major chains since everyone knows what they will get.  This place will be an exception. Cheesecake Factory always draws a crowd.  Not sure why that is.  Maybe it's the massive food menu they have that has everything you can imagine.  Maybe it's the varieties of cheesecake you can get.  There typically is a wait to get a table.  This one was no exception.  We were there on a Friday night and we had to wait probably 15 minutes to get a table for 4.  I didn't think it was too bad of a wait. The food there is solid.  I had the pan seared salmon with angel hair pasta, sauteed mushrooms and spinach and lemon caper sauce.   I thought it was a very well prepared dish with plenty of balanced flavor. Sometimes lemon caper dished can get too acidic for me, but this one was good. We also had 2 different cheesecakes which I thought were their standard high quality cheesecakes that are rich creamy and sweet. So why the 2 stars? Bad service. We were seated at the booth.  A few minutes later someone zoomed by and gave us bread and butter.  Then, no waiter for over 10 minutes.  Finally, he shows up and takes our drink orders.  We had to restrain him to get him to take our full order at that point.  Then we waited 30+ minutes for our food.  In that period of time, the waiter showed up twice.  Once to drop off the drinks.  The other to tell us the food was coming soon and that was at the 25 minute mark. Hopefully this is an isolated case of a bad server."
Marla G.,"Baychester, Bronx, NY",4,16,9,1.0,11/20/2016,"Im so displeased with this place and their takeout service/car side to go. Last time I ordered takeout, my Steak Diane was burnt and the mash potatoes were hard. I figured I would give them a second chance and just order dessert; I assumed that you couldn't screw up dessert. Well I was wrong! After being on hold my entire car ride to the restaurant, I am informed that it will take 10 minutes to prepare.... 10 minutes for a slice of cheesecake that is already sliced and baked. I say okay and begin to wait. I call 20 minutes later and am informed that someone would be coming right up. 5 minutes later I call again in hopes that they would say they are sorry, on their way, something.... ANYTHING. Nope, I am answered by someone who doesn't seem to know who I am or about the ONE slice of cheesecake that I ordered almost 30 minutes ago. Needless to say I cancelled the order and they could care less. I wasted gas, the parking fee of $3.00 because I had been there longer than 15 minutes, and my time. Im glad the one in Ridge Hill is there as an alternative because this customer service was horrendous."
Audrey C.,"Stamford, CT",3,42,4,4.0,5/31/2016,"I loveeee the cheesecake factory! Everytime I go i never really get the cheesecake though (which is ironic) but the food is super good. The portion sizes are perfect as well and it's all so tasty. The drinks are huge and amazingg as well although when I went this past Sunday my Strawberry drink was watery and garnished with a lime not a strawberry like everyone else's that i noticed... Also my servers are always so nice and bubbly but my server on Sunday barely checked on us , and took forever with us while all his other tables got everything very fast. I'll be back but hopefully not with the same server."
Janica G.,"Tampa, FL",167,109,123,4.0,2/23/2016,"I hate the fact that the lines always seem to be long for this chain restaurant but it's always good food with good portions for cheap! You can get a plate that looks like and tastes like its worth 40 but only pay $18 or something cheaper. I love their cheesecakes. I've always been a fan and a visit to America isn't complete without getting a cheesecake from here! I love it! Cheesecake tips: red velvet, dulce de leche caramel, white chocolate and the Godiva chocolate cheesecake!"
R K.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,13,,2.0,12/10/2016,"Food is just ok, the location and ambience, better (relative to White Plains standards). The last time we went there we got a waitress with dirty hands and dirty clothes. Our order was not taken correctly, which resulted in an unacceptably long waiting time."
Giulio S.,"Hawthorne, NY",0,7,,1.0,7/1/2016,"Very unprofessional all around , from the start bad service ,had to wait 50 minutes to get the food The waitress had a bad attitude very unprofessional Defiantly not going back"
Noe M.,"Tucson, AZ",12,22,,2.0,6/24/2016,"We always expect a bit of a wait at this consistently good restaurant chain...our visit at 1400 hours on 6/23/2016 was a painful reminder of how long the wait can be.  We were told 10 minutes when we signed in.  A half hour later, we were finally seated.  It took at least 15 minutes to get our iced teas and water.  Bread was not available 'til it came out of the oven...another 15 minutes passed.  After being seated for some 45 minutes some ""warm""...not hot...bread arrived!  Salads were good, but warm food arrived cold...shrimp, french fries, etc. I don't blame the server...I blame the management, or the kitchen...for this quick lunch that took about an hour and a half during late PM hours!  The fact that there were a number of empty tables in plain sight, tells me that the kitchen is not properly staffed, or they didn't have enough servers on hand.  A planned ""pleasant later lunch"" turned into a tedious and cranky dining experience.  I hope that Management will take note of this issue."
Deborah A.,"New York, NY",36,136,133,2.0,5/26/2015,"This used to be the one and only chain restaurant I would visit, the food and service were always top notch, now its just ok nothing special. I find that the food is lackluster. The service has dropped off as well. Once the food came I was forgotten. It wasn't busy either..only about 1/3 of the restaurant was full. Maybe it's just this location, I visited the Albany Cheesecake factory a few years ago and everything was fabulous. Not likely to return to White Plains!!"
Jazmin T.,"Union, NJ",0,4,,2.0,5/30/2016,"Seated right away, but after that everything went down hill but it was 430pm so I wouldn't expect anything less. Our waiter wasn't as attentive to as as opposed to his other tables. He took our order and left and never brought over the bread. We noticed when he went to go greet other tables, he bought the bread with him He came back after five minutes to ask what my order was because he forgot what it was. This place is a chain so I didn't expect the quality to deviate much. We got our food, still no bread and had to ask for it. Halfway through our meal, the waiter shows up with our bread. Didn't see him for the rest of time until we flagged him down for our check.  Here's some advice to the wait staff, pay attention to your customers and not the soccer game playing on the TV."
Steve N.,"Albany, NY",163,381,696,4.0,3/15/2014,"As the old adage goes: ""If you've seen one, you've seen them all."" This CF is pretty much the same as any other CF, and that's a good thing. We were pleased with our visit to this CF. The kicker was that despite the restaurant being packed, our food arrived to the table in a timely manner and piping hot. For my thoughts on Cheesecake Factory in general see my other review here: "
Prashant C.,"Forest Hills, NY",13,27,2,3.0,7/3/2015,Before writing this review we visited the restaurant twice. After having a bad experience on first visit we decided to give it one more try but unfortunately had same experience. I was fasinated the the ambiance and a grand menu the place offers but food was very sub par. First time we ordered Jamaican Shrimp and fish tacos. The Shrimps were ok but the fish tacos were very bland; no taste and no hint of salt. When we gave our feedback to the waiter he advised us to take it home and FIX it. Quite an advise I say. On the next visit we ordered Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. When the dish was served there were actually two small shrimps on my dish and quite a bit of chicken pieces. I was not expecting this cheap trick of saving money in a place like CCF where you pay premium than the local restaurants. The service was pathetic where they changed three servers on our table and no one had a clue what were our orders and priorities. They took 45 minutes to serve our first dish and drinks. As it was a nice sunny day and we were sitting outside and enjoying weather we let it go. PROS  - Ambiance - Larger than life menu - Generous Portions  CONS - Sub par food - Bad Service
Matthew K.,"Hawthorne, NY",99,9,,5.0,5/3/2015,"Eat a lot and stay a while for the good company. Gary, our bartender, and Dana our server recommended the Mac & Cheese Balls for an appetizer and the Asian Pear Martini to ""loosen up"" after our long day of shopping at the Westchester Mall.  Dana brought over our Martini that Gary made and it really hit home. He made it to perfection! Our beautiful, quick and easily understood server, Dana recommended the Mac & Cheese Balls and I couldn't have been happier. I will certainly be back for this duo and great food.  They are sweet like their delicious cheesecake. Get it!"
Sss S.,"Bronx, NY",1,16,,5.0,10/31/2016,"Service always good, crab cakes are always delicious. And cant go wrong with the shrimp scampi, my favorite here!"
