John S.,"Bronx, NY",122,47,12,2.0,11/5/2014,"The food is what you would expect from Cheesecake Factory and I am happy to give them 2 stars. The service at this location is extremely lacking.. Our server took our order and we did not see her again for an hour when the runners brought the food. No Refills, No Bread, No apology for the delay.  And avoid any business that charges you to park in their lot while you spend good money at there business. My party spent an additional $18 to park to meet for dinner on top of a $200 check. Go Screw!"
Josephine M.,"Yonkers, NY",0,6,,2.0,7/13/2016,"The went to this restaurant in Ridge Hill. First of all we ordered the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich, which we ordered before. When we received the sandwich, we couldn't believe the size of it. It was half the size it normally is. When we asked the waiter why, he said it is the same size as always. I believe they ran out of bread and put it on the bread that they give you in the basket.  Very disappointed. Then he told me to make sure I put my parking ticket in with the check so he could validate it, I did and it was never validated. Had to pay the full $3 to park. I will not return."
David B.,"Larchmont, NY",2,93,25,3.0,3/10/2016,This place is getting stale.  A lot of the options are still solid.  In particular they do great salads and apps.  But the service is often slow and the whole experience is tired and badly in need of a refresh.
His H.,"Bronx, NY",7,9,,4.0,11/15/2014,"Reason: Weekly dinner date His: Not new to the chain, but this is my first time at this location. Decor was nice. Wait wasn't bad, though the entrance waiting area can be a but crowded. Food was great. Drink wasn't to my liking. Price was reasonable, food was better. Her: Drinks were strong enough. Appetizer and food was good as well. Took doggie bag home. Key Lime pie was amazeballs. Overall: This location does the chain proud. Good service, better food and reasonable prices. Definitely a fan and looking forward to coming back."
Jen M.,"Harrison, NY",0,5,,2.0,6/30/2016,"The cheesecake was delicious as always, but they refused to do curbside service even though it is advertised on their website. I normally wouldn't mind walking in, but you have to pay for parking here so it was a bit inconvenient."
Alexander A.,"San Diego, CA",69,55,4,2.0,9/4/2014,"This place used to be so good, in terms of service and food. Food is still consistently cooked well, but the service has taken a big downturn. There are still a few good servers/waiters, but the rest of them are rude, slow and incompetent. This is a reflection on the management staff to me, are they even screening who they hire now, let alone training them? Our last visit consisted of our waiter not acknowledging us for 15 minutes, then another 20 minutes after our order and drinks have come, we ask for bread, we get a flippant answer about how all the bread is baked in house, great so where is it? Minutes after we request for it, he flys by the table basically tossing it to us without saying a word. We notice other tables also having issues with this guy, that he needed to be replaced by someone else, who was much better. I guess he got demoted to filling up our waters. We are regulars that live in the area, but given that this happened over a month ago and we haven't gone back since, is an indication of how badly our expectations have become."
Amanda C.,"West Bronx, NY",11,55,7,4.0,9/1/2015,The kids menu was so big I thought my son wasn't going to finish. Service was a little slow and there weren't a lot of people but the food was great expect the soup of the day. 1 piece of cheesecake gave for 5 people to share.
Alexandria P.,"Croton-on-Hudson, NY",0,4,,4.0,2/14/2016,"Very large, filling portions, make sure you save room for the cheesecake. Chris's outrageous cheesecake is so poppin. Bbq ranch chicken salad is the ultimate salad if you're real hungry. Substitute croutons for the onion things though. Skinnylicious chopped salad is good but the bacon pieces are a little too large."
Natasha C.,"Augusta, GA",1225,486,2599,4.0,4/10/2016,"Who doesn't like this place. I haven't dined at Cheesecake Factory in some time. It's mainly because the portion sizes are ridiculous and even their ""Skinny Menu"" is high in calories. However, they still have pretty good food. I ended up ordering the Black Bean burger with a kale salad. The burger was huge and I ate all of it. I tried to save room though for the 1,000+ calorie slice of cheesecake I'd likely order. I dined with a few alumni that were also present for our conference. Everyone enjoyed their food and our waiter was nice. My friend brought her 9 year old daughter along and she was even pleased with the kids menu. I did leave with a slice of the Chocolate Cheesecake. I saved it for later. Unfortunately, I have no pics for you all. Which is not my style. But I was beyond hungry, with that being my first meal of the day, so pictures were not on my radar. Everything was presented well and the place smelled amazing. I'm sure I'lll visit a Cheesecake Factory again in the future."
Dan F.,"Spring, TX",147,385,417,5.0,11/23/2014,I sat at the bar and had two Boston Lager and watched NYGiants lose. I do not blame the Cheesecake Factory but I would if I could (jk). Staff was really cool and they serve the full menu in the bar. Fun place to watch a game!!!
Virginia S.,"Scarsdale, NY",27,1,,1.0,9/10/2016,"I have to tell you I have always loved coming here but haven't been in about 5 months. This past Thursday night I had the worst experience ever and will not return. I joined 3 friends had a reservation under my name and they did not have the courtesy to even properly guide me to our table. It was not in plain site. We should have left then. It took 45 minutes to get Ice tea and cokes, another half hour to get bread then we ordered appetizers and dinners. The apps came fast enough, but the dinner took another hour. We are Now getting near 10pm and the whole place was not that crowded. The waitress was helping a few tables near us but ignoring us. The entrees finally arrive and one was wrong. 2 of us ordered Miso Salmon with white rice. I told my friend to take it and Waited for  the other back to be corrected. The waitress arrives and makes me feel like a criminal for her mistake. We had said we both ordered the same! I cannot digest brown rice so it's not an option. The Manager then comes over and makes a big deal about what is this about no brown rice? I said I never ordered it. I can't eat it and this is really horrendous service and behavior. She then tells me they are out of white rice and it will take 20 min to cook. I then cancel my entree but they all convince me to order and I order a chicken dish that my friend had. You'd think I was down town at Police Headquarters. So order goes in waitress finally showing up and offers me a salad .. That's nice, but I told her I can't have a salad for same reason I can't have brown rice!! I'm recently out of hospital for gastric surgery and can't have that much roughage!! So dinner arrives my friends are long finished and we order cheesecake to go. They comped me Cheesecake but made me and my friends feel awful for their mistake. There was no apology, no acknowledgement of a mistake and absolutely no service until a major error occurred. All four of us and our families will not return. We can easily go up Ridge Hill if we want a Cheesecake fix and believe me we have plenty of other choices where we may spend our money. How totally insulting and never never again. Who trained them? Don't waste your time there!!!"
Amirah E.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,30,2,1.0,1/16/2016,The food made me and all of my friends sick after eating here. It was ten of us. The waiter also wasn't very nice.
Nichole T.,"Long Beach, CA",2,128,24,1.0,6/28/2016,"Food and service are subpar compared to other cheesecake factories. Cold soup and managements response was ""it's the end of the day""   Yikes!"
Andrea P.,"Stamford, CT",1,16,,2.0,8/16/2014,"We used to like it here, but the food was always inconsistent. Kale salad sometimes has cheese other times none, things like that. For some reason the coffee always takes forever to get to the table also.  I've been able to get over these things and keep giving it a shot but I'm done giving this place a shot Go in on a saturday, waiting for about 10-15 mins with not one person even offering us water. Table next to us was experiencing the same thing, I noticed. That table went to talk to someone and still nothing. We complained (nicely) and the girl didn't even apologize. She said ""ok"" and watched us walk out.  You're done cheesecake craptory."
Danielle C.,"Yonkers, NY",0,7,,2.0,8/22/2016,"I went to this location last night with a friend and was seated by the bar. The waiter came up to us and said I'll be right with you. He didn't come back until 10 minutes later with menus. He told us he'd be right with us another 3 times (another 15 minutes later) to order our drinks. We ordered drinks and our food. When our food arrived, he checked on us once and never refilled my empty glass of water. We had to flag him down for the dessert to menu and for the bill too. Instead of paying attention to us, he was too busy chatting with his coworkers at the bar area. This chain has gone downhill! This happened to me in 2 different locations."
Marcus S.,"Wakefield, Bronx, NY",2,22,,5.0,12/12/2015,"This place has the hands down some of the most consistently good food of any chain restaurant that I've ever been to. Their pork, chicken, seafood and red meat dishes are absolutely fantastic! So much so I take my wife there every year for her birthday. And she loves it. The place is always crowded on the weekend and for good reason. My only knock on the place is the mixed drinks. Very watered down. It is what it is though. I go there to eat. I guess I can get blasted at home! Lol! Enjoy! You won't be disappointed."
Giovanni O.,"New York, NY",0,402,83,2.0,10/17/2014,"The food is way more consistent at this Cheesecake Factory than the Yonkers location so it is still worth the trip but the service has definitely gone downhill. The last two times we came the service was noticeably bad, always having to look for the waiter. Last time we came our waiter left, literally left, and someone else came 20-30 minutes later saying he was supposed to cover for him, if he can get us anything... Yea the check.. Comes back another 10-15 minutes after that. Where is the management? If that Louisiana Chicken Pasta wasn't so good we wouldn't be back."
Jeff S.,"Bucks County, PA",569,1715,407,1.0,7/23/2012,"We've been here a total of 3 times since we moved up to Westchester and the food has gotten consistently worse every time. Aren't these guys supposed to be know for their consistency? During our last visit, everything came out a hair below room temperature, and the dishes seriously looked re-purposed from previous diners plates. The staff also vexes me to no end. They're good about getting things out fast and they have that typical Cheesecake Factory go getter attitude. But their gregariousness and pleasant nature is so over the top it makes me dizzy. Stop being so effervescent! One star, just for those great booths which I could never, ever bad mouth."
Richard S.,"White Plains, NY",0,13,,5.0,7/16/2016,Consistently great food. The Louisiana Chicken and Pasta is a must.  Chicken and Biscuits and Cuban sandwich also good. All the salads are terrific and If you can afford the calories save room for dessert. Curbside pickup is also convenient but it's up a level in the garage not on the curb.
Mike V.,"White Plains, NY",2,9,,4.0,2/24/2015,"This is a good place to drop in and relax. The service is ok, but friendly. The menu is big with a lotta choices.  I luv their desserts and appetizers.  The lettuce wraps and crispy crab cakes are great!!! We went there last night and we were like 15 people, we were seated quickly and are server Judey was a doll. Dinner time is an all together different animal here though, but its a big place and the lag in service at that time is understandable.  If the humongous menu slows you down order a burger, they are fantastic!"
