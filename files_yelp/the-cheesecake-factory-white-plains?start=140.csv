Shatika J.,"White Plains, NY",0,12,,4.0,11/25/2015,I really like this restaurant.  The decor is cool; a cross between casual and upscale. The jamaican pepper shrimp and the fried mac n cheese are my favorites.  I have experienced instances of delayed service but on average the service is good.  The drinks are interesting and adequately lubricating :-) its a nice pkace to take a date.
Deborah T.,"Lyon, France",27,109,37,5.0,10/6/2015,This is the place to go!!! I had so many good times there and the food was so great! I can't even count how many times I spend seated there with my friends and enjoying some great food. I know all Cheesecake Factory must be similar but I have a pretty huge love for this one!
Arben P.,"Astoria, NY",94,47,6,1.0,7/11/2015,"It's noon on Saturday July 11 I Just sat at the bar and waited 10 minutes while the bartender was chatting away with a waitress. His back towards me and she was facing me could have told him at any point, ""hey you have a guest at the bar"". The hostess was very apologetic when I told her but it was too late I left. 0 stars for service."
Salani L.,"Mount Kisco, NY",10,142,12,5.0,12/13/2015,I dunnowhat type of stuff I was on when I wrote my first review but NOW...the cheesecake factory wp is FIRE!!! Legit everything on their menu is so tasty like wow i cant believe its a chain i luv it huge portions guilty pleasure
B D.,"Stamford, CT",0,22,8,1.0,6/6/2016,so we went in with about 25 minutes to be seated with no one at the front after about 5 minutes and then we were told there was one servers to sit us where everyone else was sitting that so we had no choice but to leave the place they did offer us a seat at the bar but we have two children with us so that was not a good idea in the first place so after paying $3 and parking driving all the way back to Stamford Connecticut I sit on my porch pissed off thank you Cheesecake Factory
Ebony C.,"Charlotte, NC",92,134,77,4.0,7/21/2014,I've dined at this location a few time s and I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever! This location is down the street from The Westchester mall.  Their food is pretty good and the service is not bad at all!
Ben H.,"Harrison, NY",4,35,31,1.0,5/25/2015,The parking at this building is horrendous. Not to mention watching the people here stuff their faces with cheesecake and ridiculous portion sizes is sickening. I would rather be water-boarded and starved for a month then come to this location.
Enmanuel R.,"Purchase, NY",5,10,7,4.0,4/15/2014,"My friend and I shared the ""Garlic Noodle"" with shrimp and it was delicious and we were both satisfied. After that we also shared the ""Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake"" and it was amazing too, actually I think it was too big because we could not finish it. They have a very good service but the place was crowded and we had to wait around 20 minutes but I think it was worth it because we had a lot of fun."
Dominique M.,"Pelham Gardens, Bronx, NY",34,7,2,1.0,7/29/2014,Horrible service at this location ! Firsts I had to wait 10 min for a hostess to even seat us I had to call the restaurant while standing there just to get the attention cause a couple before us was waiting and got nothing ... As we were sat we waited almost a half an hour for our appetizer which was only beef kabobs when asked what took so long out server said they had to throw it out cause they over cooked the beef so I ask for a new drink before I can even stop the server he takes my 1st drink still half full and leaves !!! I'm write now making this review as I've been sitting here waiting for my main course oh did I mention still ok appetizer ?!!! So livid !!!! The Cheesecake Factory in Short Hills NJ is the best one I been too !!!!
Mark M.,"Scarsdale, NY",49,31,137,5.0,9/4/2015,Stopped in yesterday for lunch and was happy to see the sweet chili sauce is back to normal!
Katrina P.,"Scarsdale, NY",0,3,,2.0,11/19/2016,"We should have known it wasn't going to be a good night at this place when the hostess started slowing down toward the back of the house and announced that our table was taken.  The server was friendly but it didn't seem like she had a handle on things either. About 20 minutes after ordering I was told that they didn't have my selection but the other meals were ready. Since I replaced my choice with steak tacos and a side salad, I was asked if we wanted the other 3 meals (two of them kid meals) to come out with the salad which I said yes. So another ten minutes later my salad was brought by our server, but nothing else. The manager came back another 5-10 min later surprised that we didn't have the other 3 orders. Another 5 min and the husband got his food....and we were told that they thought someone else got the kids'. Finally the rest came after another 5 min and my son began to tear up because his bow tie pasta was penne instead. The manager was nice enough to replace it and when he asked if he could have both so he could start eating she agreed which was nice. I was a little annoyed that the server or manager didn't offer to take something off the bill but I guess they felt we were square with the extra helping of pasta and I'm not very assertive with that kind of thing. Honestly they seemed like nice people working there and the food was adequate but it was a s--- show and I don't think we'll return."
Matthew S.,"Stamford, CT",1,13,,1.0,8/16/2014,"The only thing consistent about this place is it's going downhill. Food is often not prepared as requested. Service has gotten terrible. Today we sat for 10 or 15 minutes and no one came over. Not even water. Same with other tables nearby. We complained at the front and got an OK, no apology. I've never seen a manager walking around.  It's a shame because I've been eating here since they opened. The food can be good, but these days you never know what you'll get, if you get served at all."
Israel V.,"Port Chester, NY",0,1,,1.0,5/31/2016,I went on a Sunday to a cheesecake factory when it was time to pay the bill we all decided to split the bill and I told the waitress that we were going to pay 120 cash and the rest in the credit. So we signed the paper without realizing she's only put that we gave her  $40 and charge the card for the rest there no way you could confuse the $20 with $100 bill she stole from us and then I called and they said there's nothing we can do because we signed so always check your receipt before you leave and look what you are signing
Alex V.,"Bronx, NY",84,46,126,4.0,2/17/2012,"I would've given it a 5 but lost a star due to the horrible wait time, maybe they should build a new location to help with the excess costumers.  The wait is definitely worth it b/c of the food and quality of service from waiters/waitresses. Worth the wait and money in every way possible. This place never disappoints, the food/the whole menu looks delightful and what I ordered was just delicious, AAAA++++ on the chicken croquette."
Danny G.,"Congers, NY",116,48,4,4.0,3/10/2014,I find that the cheesecake factory is always consistent no matter which one I go to and they do certain menu items extremely well. I usually line to order their Mexican food items. Their Factory Burrito and Chicken Tortillas are two of my favorites. I should have stuck with those on my recent visit. I ordered the Factory burger and was disappointed.  The servers are very attentive and responsive. Overall I enjoyed my experience as usual.
Monique D.,"Greenwich, CT",39,32,10,4.0,6/14/2015,"The food was good! Very quick. Flavors on point and cooked well. Fried calamari, salmon firecracker, sweet potato fries delicious! Not crazy about the burger. The waitress was ok. She warned me about the bread. Very good alone but not right for a cheese burger. Overall good experience."
Alex S.,"Mount Vernon, NY",0,4,1,2.0,9/6/2015,"My wife use to work in White Plains and wanted to go to the Cheesecake Factory for her birthday. So being the ever dutiful and frugal husband I purchased a discounted gift card online and off we went.  The decor and atmosphere were great and seating comfortable.  My wife enjoyed her teriyaki glazed salmon and carrot cake (although there was way too much whipped cream).  I ordered the shrimp and angle hair pasta.  Unfortunately, the pasta was hot but the 5 small shrimp in the dish were overcooked and cold.  Also, they put prices of cilantro in the dish that was chewy.  I did complain to the waitress, she said she would inform the kitchen but nothing was done about it.  I was very disappointed.  Smh  Hope I have a better experience next time, maybe I try the Cheesecake Factory in Ridge Hill."
Douglas W.,"Mount Vernon, NY",3,65,51,4.0,3/27/2014,One of my favorite restaurants. Food and service always good servers are always friendly and try to make u feel welcomed. I think I've only had 2 bad experiences over the many years I've been visiting this location.  The ridge hill location is only 10 minutes from me yet I happily drive the extra 15 minutes to white plains. I shouldn't have to beg for a waiter and remind people that I ordered something 45 minutes ago.  Last night we went for a birthday dinner and everyone had a good time. The fried macaroni cheese balls were awesome. We had Steak Diane which was excellent. Shrimp scampi pick cashew chicken 4 cheese pasta all of which was delightful.  My only complaint why I can't hand out the extra star is the drinks. It kills me that you pay $10 for these cocktails that have lil to no alcohol In them. It doesn't cost anything to make your customers happy by making the drinks even somewhat decent. 9 times out of 10 I have to complain and get into a mini argument with the waiter to get a decent drink. I don't expect it to be a bar. But for 10 bucks I should get something other than ice and juice.
Rita G.,"Bronx, NY",1,7,4,4.0,8/2/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has excellent service and decor, restrooms nice neat and CLEAN!! THE  FOOD WAS GREAT!!"
Jay S.,"Dallas, TX",114,230,440,1.0,7/5/2013,"Edit as of 7/30/14: The Cheesecake Factory has gone DOWN THE TOILET in the past year. What was once a staple of my life (see original review below) is now just a mockery of what it once was. To begin with, the service at the White Plains location has gone steadily downhill. At one time, there was a waitstaff of regulars who I looked forward to seeing, but now it's just a revolving door of disgruntled and overworked servers probably grumbling over how poor the tipping is. First the food. Then the prices. Once-oversized portions are now ordinary. The kid's pasta which used to provide enough pasta for my two kids to share and then have for lunch the next day now consists of about 30 pieces of penne -- barely enough for one hungry child. Kid's Chicken Fingers used to have seven or eight large pieces. Now, it's four to five small pieces that are mostly breading and gristle. Good luck finding any chicken in there these days! The Chicken Romano is now sliced so thin that the breading outweighs the nearly invisible chicken and I'm left eating a plate of grease and fried fat. The old standby -- Shrimp Scampi and Steak is completely pathetic. Gone are the fresh oversized jumbo shrimp and now you get three sad small shrimp that could have been plucked from the Chinese Buffet. And the steak medallions are closer to the size of quarters than the giant medallions one used to get. Dessert: Cheesecake slices that seem to have shrunk and gotten thinner during the past year. The strawberry shortcake went from awesome to Awww...s&^t. Finally, the prices: Despite lousy service, smaller portions and food that become barely edible, the prices at CF have continued to INCREASE in price. A family of four cannot eat here for less than $120 unless you skip dessert and stiff the waiters. This review is not culled from a single visit. It is based upon our last (and final) five visits from the year 2014 in which we have come on weekends, weeknights and weekday afternoons. There is simply NO EXCUSE for how such a restaurant has gone so far down hill so incredibly fast. When I suggested CF as our farewell dinner for my son going off to sleepaway camp, my wife balked and said, ""Really? It's been terrible the past few times."" I told her, ""Let's give it one more chance.""  And we did. And there you have it. ______ OLD REVIEW _____ The Cheesecake Factory is remarkable for its consistency. Sure, they've missed the mark a few times in my 500+ visits but I would say that 90% of the time, both the food and the service are excellent.  The White Plains location is conveniently located across from both the upscale Westchester Mall and the newly renovated Crowne Plaza hotel. Weather permitting, patrons have the option of sitting outdoors on a nice patio -- unfortunately, there's not much to look at other than traffic patterns. Prices are reasonable considering the large portions -- and kids meals are moderate priced and include a small drink. Service can vary but is usually quite good, with waiters frequently offering to refill empty glasses and provide additional bread on demand. In the unlikely event you get a bad seed, the management is quick to remedy problems here. Favorite choices include Chicken Romano, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, and Chicken Costaletta. The crab bites and chicken tenders are great starters and the strawberry shortcake and Linda's fudgecake with a scoop of vanilla make excellent alternatives to cheesecake for dessert. For the value, you can't do much better in White Plains than this."
