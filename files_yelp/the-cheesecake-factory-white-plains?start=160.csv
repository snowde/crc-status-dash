Keith F.,"New Rochelle, NY",1,22,1,4.0,7/16/2015,"A nice family friendly place.  Even though the place was crowded, we were able to get seating within 10 min.   I  had the nachos and Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp.  Both were really good!"
Royal V.,"Bronx, NY",10,112,196,5.0,2/22/2015,"We've been here, Ridge Hill and Palisades and they are all great. The cuban rolls and crab bites are yummy. Ive yet to have a bad food experience at either locations. Of course the cheesecakes are fantastic!"
Johanna S.,"Bronx, NY",74,20,12,5.0,1/17/2015,"Whenever my family and i want to have a good meal this is the place we come. Great drinks, great meal. Simply delicious.!"
Jeremy S.,"White Plains, NY",0,58,,4.0,11/27/2015,I absolutely hate the location. I hate the parking garage. I hate the crowds of people and kids flinging crayons. I hate how 4/5 times I go it's Shaquasia's or Teresa or Becky's birthday and 14 other woman act as though it's the first time they've seen an alcoholic drink in the past 10 years yet it's also the last party they plan on attending. But- I love the bread. I love the chicken piccata. I love cheesecake.
Juliana P.,"Greenwich, CT",28,2,,5.0,4/18/2015,"Nice place to go with your family and friends, with delicious food, great reception. Nothing to lose if you stop by."
Greg M.,"Harmony, FL",66,216,39,3.0,2/6/2013,"#Yelp100 - Another Tuesday finding myself at Cheesecake Factory again, this time it's empty, I mean really empty, but our waitress still finds a way to ignore us.  Really wish I had her name as I would love to mention it here. The food, as always is very good, Hibachi Steak this time, the wasabi mashed potatoes are GREAT! But the service is what keeps me from uping the rating."
Sen-Pei H.,"New York, NY",315,421,316,3.0,12/28/2013,"I'm not a big fan of cheesecake, however, this one was pretty decent and creamy. One bite was all I could handle."
Shygal R.,"Mount Vernon, NY",2,23,,4.0,4/2/2014,"For a chain restaurant, they happen to be pretty consistent with their food.  It's also a good place because the menu is very diverse, so there is always something for everyone! I especially like their chicken pot stickers (which is AKA chicken dumplings), the chicken/cheese quesadilla, the burgers are good as well as their pasta and steak dishes. If you like fruity 'chick drinks', I recommend their Tropical Martini-delicious!"
Nancy S.,"White Plains, NY",63,55,72,4.0,8/14/2014,"So the Cheesecake Factory is a nice concept. Cheesecake is good, right? The decor has an Egyptian feel.. I like it. Now the food is good don't get me wrong but when it takes 15 minutes to read the 200 offerings, it gets a bit much. It's dinerish. Ok. So having said that, I like a few items a lot. They happen to be appetizers. I tend to like  a 2 appetizer diner. I get to try more and I don't feel guilty because I'm finishing everything rather than the huge portions CF are known for.  Here are a few of my top faves. ahi carpaccio, buffalo blasts, fire roasted artichoke, sliders and crispy crab wontons but I def like ALL the appetizers. I also like the flatbreads (mushroom) but they are a meal to itself. The entrees just aren't my cup of tea because of portion size and we all like different things so we don't share but my husband likes the fish and chips, ribeye or filet. My daughters always gets the white rice and black beans and nacho platter and I hear no complaints! Overall I recommend! They due have gluten free items, just ask!"
Nikhil G.,"New Haven, CT",52,51,7,4.0,1/11/2015,"My first visit to TCF was at this location. The fried avocado appetizer was quite brilliant, the black pepper shrimp was great as well. They ran out of the cheesecake (seriously?) but the experience, all in all, was worth four stars."
Gordon B.,"Alameda, CA",11,53,10,3.0,2/6/2013,"I agree with Greg - the service at this Cheesecake Factory is mediocre at best.  The quality of the food on par with what you'd expect from this chain.  It takes all my willpower not to order desert every time I eat here...   and by that I mean diving across the counter and slamming handfuls of cheesecake into my face.  Shameless, I know. Not a lot of good options within walking distance of the Crowne Plaza, especially in winter, so the Cheesecake Factory will get plenty of repeat business from travelers like myself."
BM T.,"New Rochelle, NY",3,3,,4.0,3/24/2014,"Great service and wonderful food.  No wonder its almost always crowded and getting seated can be quite a wait sometimes. The wait-staff are efficient, polite  and ready to serve.  Great for family as well as for a romantic dinner.  Just a super place to go with the family.  If you haven't tried it yet - you must!!"
Mathangi K.,"White Plains, NY",2,1,,4.0,11/4/2014,"Massive portions. Great food! Must try the warm asparagus salad, fried mac and cheese and also the garlic noodles with oven dried tomatoes and artichokes."
Clif T.,"Orangeburg, NY",0,1,,1.0,3/13/2015,Typical Cheesecake Factory with scalding hot bathroom sink water.  They must not want their customers and employees to wash their hands!
Anthony C.,"Eastchester, NY",0,8,,2.0,3/8/2015,"Food is just up to Cheesecake Factory standard, if you get it hot. Service is always terrible. Never less than a 20 minute wait for a table. You'll wait 20 minutes at your table for a server to get an order and another 15 for your drink or water. Parking garage is a joke. You can find the staff smoking outside the stair door to walk into the restaurant at any time. Needs more seating, better staff and people who care about CF's reputation"
Jeff S.,"New Rochelle, NY",0,8,2,3.0,3/27/2014,"This place has fallen a notch or two in the past year.  For one, the menu has dropped some great items such as chicken taquitos and New Orleans shrimp.  The beer selection on draft does not change, it's the same 4 beers.  They should have a local craft beer on tap.   Also the place is not as well kept as it should be; messy tables not cleared long after the people have left; table tops not wiped clean, crumbs on the seats, etc."
Amanda D.,"Westchester County, NY",122,129,38,5.0,7/13/2013,Love the Cheesecake Factory :)
Dave B.,"Port Chester, NY",0,11,13,3.0,1/16/2016,"Saturday night at the Cheesecake Factory was not a smart idea. As expected it was a long wait. Took an hour to seat 6. And a looking wait to be served. It seemed they were understaffed and the servers were spread thin. The food was usual fare. The Jambalaya pasta was OK. A little dry and light on flavor. I remember it as better in the past. The Thai lettuce wraps were good. Love the dressing with it and the chicken was tender. Overall, good family time but food was just OK."
Christopher S.,"East Rockaway, NY",225,49,43,1.0,12/16/2014,"Eeek this Cheesecake Factory destroyed my view of the chain. Went there last year and had horrible service (and for a Cheesecake Factory thats what they are known for!) sever never came to take our drinks, no table touches, and tore up my gift card with money still on it. When i complained the manager asked me to have lunch with him. I went there during lunch to find out he was gone and there was a new manager. Maybe that's a good thing? Either way, head to the Yonkers location - much better service. I used to go all the time but since I moved up here, sorry to say it's no longer a staple"
Ella M.,"White Plains, NY",2,23,7,4.0,1/17/2014,I really like this place. I have been a few times - and we always have fun - even the children ! I have had a few dishes that I was not SO impressed with - but I have had a lot there that I really do like.. The atmosphere is very nice and fun - the service is good.. The drinks are good.. This is a good place to bring out of town guests - or the kids on the weekend- a good place for a business lunch - etc...
