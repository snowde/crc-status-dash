Erika J.,"New Rochelle, NY",0,13,,2.0,8/20/2015,"It's been years since I've been and he service has really changed. Came here on a Saturday afternoon, wasn't too packed but they seated us towards the back corner. Took 20-30 mins for us to finally get up and ask for a glass of water and for someone to take our order as they obviously forgot about us. Food was screwed up and not what I ordered & my friends food was way too salty. Took a very long time to get our check & the waiter never came back to take our payment so I had to find someone and pay there (he had an attitude about that too). I'm sure the cheesecake is still great but aside from that, I have no reason to return."
Jennifer G.,"Bronx, NY",302,141,128,3.0,8/13/2012,"To begin, I don't know why the waiters wear all white! They look as if they work at an insane asylum. The decoration does not remind me of any bakery, dessert, or anything even slightly related to cheesecake. It looks more Mediterranean than anything else...That aside....   So many things to pick, none of which are all that healthy. There is certainly something for everyone. The avocado wraps are a great appetizer. I usually perform room temperature guacamole, but despite it being warm, it doesn't taste overly mushy and has a lot of flavor. It comes with a dipping sauce that gives it a slight sweet taste, which I loved.  I suggest you try the Skinnylicious Salmon and the unsweetened passion fruit ice tea with 2 pieces of lemon.  I have also tried the skinnylicious chicken Mexican taco appetizers which were delicious. They are wrapped in butternut lettuce which reduces the carb intake which is usually high because of the tortillas. The biggest flaw with this dish was that there was just a single, small piece of chicken among all of the salsa and cabbage. It could have been better with some chopped chicken...oh well... Now to the important things... The cheesecakes....well they have everything under the sun! Personal favorite is the lemoncello cheesecake! YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST try it!"
Dexter N.,"Auburndale, Queens, NY",703,2,7,5.0,1/3/2015,Great food! The service is better then the other locations. The employees are friendly and the waiting is not long . If you ask for a booth they accommodate you in a decent manner.
Aileen A.,"Stamford, CT",6,1,,2.0,2/17/2015,"Beautiful restaurant, went in a couple of times but its been a while since the last and maybe not anytime soon or never again. It was a Sunday, came in here with the whole family. And while waiting to get our orders we noticed how filthy their forks are! from one fork to the next, it was disgusting. We told the wait stuff about it and he just apologized quickly and gave us new sets of fork. my husband was ready to leave, but i am starving. Ha! Clearly though someones not doing their jobs! Glad it was us and we did not make a scene out of it! it could have been worst!"
Cat B.,"White Plains, NY",0,7,1,1.0,12/30/2014,I wish there was a such thing as a negative star.  The service here is horrible even when slow the service is horrible go to another Cheesecake Factory.  So many excuses for poor service will not be returning
Craig T.,"West Bronx, NY",52,85,122,4.0,7/5/2013,"Great food with large portions; Amazing cheesecake that represents the name well. You will not be disappointed dining in, I guarantee it!"
Allison C.,"New York, NY",196,1583,434,4.0,6/15/2010,"Once a month, I work at the Westchester Division of New York - Presbyterian in White Plains. I work from 5 AM until 10 AM. As the taxi passes the Cheesecake Factory as I enter the hospital campus, I have to control the amount of drool pouring from my mouth while fighting back tears over the fact the this fine establishment doesn't open until at least 11 AM. I'll NEVER be able to go there after work. Sad face. So when I found out that my department's work retreat was going to be held at Westchester, a lucky case of verbal diarrhea caused me to say, ""HAPPY HOUR AND CHEESECAKE AFTER THE RETREAT!"" Best case of verbal diarrhea EVER. After seven hours of discussing lovely department matters, a mojito and a slice of banana cream cheesecake was just what the doctor ordered.* Nice to share this time and caloric consumption with my lovely co-workers! The inside is fancy, the food is delicious, and they make a mean mojito. One star off for the fact that we arrived at 3:50 PM, ordered drinks by 3:55 PM, and they wouldn't give us the Happy Hour prices until the clock struck 4:00 PM. Come oooooon. COME OOOOOOON.  * - Wow, did I really just make that joke? Silly hospital humor. I'm seriously impressed with myself. I'm bragging about this one!"
Meagan D.,"White Plains, NY",69,47,11,4.0,12/15/2014,Delicious food but a little pricey for a chain. And I hate coming here when it's busy because if you don't get a booth they squeeze you in between other parties (so close you can place your elbows on their table). Overall a good choice though! Just request a booth :)
Mike P.,"New York, NY",1,17,5,2.0,6/5/2014,"The restaurant was pretty empty yet we had to wait 5 minutes for a table for four. It took the waiter 15 minutes to come ask us for appetizers and drinks. We ordered pasta dishes which took 45 minutes -- which came out cold and with the appearance that they'd been microwaved. Two of them were the wrong dish. They also brought the wrong drinks to our table too. It was weird. And when the manager came over, she brought us more drinks, but charged us for them and then added an extra a pasta onto the bill. It was a little ridiculous how bad the experience was. I tipped anyway, because they pay their waiters like 3 dollars an hour, but if this were Europe there was literally no reason at all to leave a tip."
Kelly P.,"Greenville, SC",236,478,212,5.0,7/12/2010,"I cannot believe I have never been to the Cheesecake Factory before-I've lived in Westchester all my life! Well, I am glad to say that today this has all changed. And, thank God, because it's amazing.  It reminds me of Atlantis inside-it's beautiful! (As are the bathrooms, just so you know.) We were seated by a lovely woman in a booth next to the window, and had the most pleasant waitress! Bread was great-the brown bread was really sweet and tasted like it could be made into a cookie! My friend & I shared the avocado egg rolls, which were amazing, and I instantly regretted agreeing to share. They were just . . .  perfect, absolutely perfect. My friend thoroughly enjoyed his Thai Salad, and I went to town with my absolutely gigantic Thai Chicken Pasta, that I actually had to get wrapped up because I couldn't finish it. (I never do that ever.) We were full by the end, so we got the chocolate truffle tower cake to go, which I demolished in the car, because it was absolutely phenomenal! And, I brought a slice of regular cheesecake with strawberries back to my momma's house, which was delicious because, of course, I stole a bite.  Ah, what a beautiful discovery!"
Elaine B.,"Scarsdale, NY",0,22,,2.0,1/2/2016,I ddn't appreciate having to wait sooo long for both entree and dessert.
Jim D.,"New York, NY",0,23,1,5.0,6/9/2012,"This is the most consistently excellent chain restaurant in the country. I have dined here dozens of times (and countless times at other branches of the chain across the country) , and am almost always delighted with my experience.  Many items on the appetizer menu are as good as you'd find in the highest-end restaurants anywhere (ahi tuna roll, faro salad, corn tamale cakes, beets with goat cheese, shrimp with corn grits).   The ingredients are obviously fresh and well prepared.  Salads are enormous and beautifully presented ( standouts include the Luau salad and chinese chicken salad).  Entrees are often quite good, but can be overly filling due to the over-the-top preparation, that pleases at first but leaves you stopping halfway through.  However, the new skinnylicious menu of low-cal items is a good solution, with low-cal, low-fat preparations.  Tuscan chicken, white bean chicken chili, chopped salad -all excellent.  The wait staff is uniformly well-trained, gracious and eager to please. I've found that almost any special request is accommodated.   This chain is a remarkable achievement - great food that's almost always well-executed, and at a very reasonable price.  HIghly recommended."
Adam L.,"Ronks, PA",9,44,2,1.0,1/2/2014,"I apologize in advance for individuals about to read this review, but I would highly HIGHLY advise it: Our experience and the White Plains Cheesecake Factory was single handedly the worst dining experience I have ever had in my extensive dining experience of restaurants of all sorts. All is true. -My girlfriend and I stopped by the Cheesecake Factory on our way to ny in a snow storm thinking it was a safe bet due to their brand consistency (or so we thought!) In a rare night of 7-10 inches of snow the restaurant was extremely empty and tables were vacant but none the less we were sat in the ""bar area"". This wasn't a big deal to me but I would much rather be seated in the main dining room. Next, our server made his way over , introduced himself and took our drink order. I asked specifically for sugar substitutes and he had forgotten them on two occasions, then finally brought them and apologized. Once a again not a huge deal to me.  His words after bringing the sugar subs was""freshly baked bread will be on it's way shortly.""  Sounds great to me except it didn't make it's way over until 15 minutes later after our appetizer was brought out and we had to ask for it. When the bread came out it was stale and hard as if it had been sitting for days in the kitchen. Once again I continued to be optimistic and think things would get better but I was so wrong  After our appetizer our entrees came. I ordered the Tuna Tataki Salad. Now, I get the salad nicely arranged looks delicious. Until I take a closer look. The Tuna is beyond purple , it was a completely unhealthy color. I go to touch it and see if there is an issue and it is covered in ice, it's absolutely frozen. I cut it and take a bite and my gf does as well and both agree the tuna was frozen solid. Now this is getting strange. Let's take a look at my gfs dish. She orders the shrimp scampi. Looks appetizing as well but then she goes to eat the shrimp and soon realizes that the shrimp had been cooked with the shell completely on! No jokes here , she was sitting there peeling her shrimp as if she was first preparing them herself. We called our server over who apologized and then said they are preparing a brand new salad for me. Great problem fixed right? Not at all! Manager comes over and tells me they are now OUT OF Tuna Tataki.  She brings me a menu and I decide on the Salmon Salad. After she is just standing their waiting for me, gives me no recommendation and even says""I'm not sure where the salad page of the menu is, they just rearranged this thing."" Mind you this was the FRONT END MGR at the CHEESECAKE FACTORY. She didn't know her own menu.  Now it doesn't even end there.  The Salmon Salad comes out just 5 minutes later and it is rock solid frozen just like the tuna. The asparagus is flimsy and looked as if it had just been picked, wasn't cooked to any degree or ""chilled"". Frustrated, I call the manager back over and she insists that the salmon is supposed to be ""chilled"". Now, I understand the meaning of chilled but it shouldn't be frozen and when I go to cut into it and take a bite I shouldn't have ice in my mouth and have my teeth feeling the freezing temperature of the fish which was exactly the case. She continues to argue with me over the meaning of the word chilled and I just decide I've had enough.   After the hardships I tell her I've had enough and that we are going to call it a night. She brought us the check and comp'd our entrees but did not try to make situation right, both her and our server acted as if they were ""fed up And done with us"" absolutely not on Cheesecake Factory level standards.  We will never be returning to this Cheesecake Factory. It was completely unfathomable to me how service could be this poor at a restaurant known for their brand consistency.  Our server couldn't wait for us to leave and avoided eye contact with me when he brought the check, shoved it in my face , I said thank you multiple times he never even turned his cheek for acknowledgement.  Enter at your own risk."
Joseph M.,"Chappaqua, NY",0,7,1,1.0,1/19/2014,"Service extremely slow ,very crowded ! Very dirty tables and silverware ! Management needs retraining and better customer relations ! Will not be back or tell anyone I know to go to this location. !!!!!"
Roy s.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",1,28,,1.0,7/2/2014,"The worst, slowest most apathetic service that destroys what otherwise would be a fine experience. The place is clean and nicely decorated and the food is about or even better then you would expect from this kind of place.  Overall this could be a reasonable big chain option but when the service is so bad you leave frustrated and upset the the choice is clear NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN.    We came in a group of 7 that included 2 NYC restaurant owners and 3 small children. Our waiter Danny greeted us promptly and after that it went down hill.  We waited a very, very long time for drinks ( long enough to go through 2 baskets of bread and still no sign of drinks).  The food that we ordered at the same time we ordered the drinks was unusually slow to come out but worse then that the adults were served first while the children's meals were delayed another ten minutes and then came out staggered. Ok we can forgive the slow drinks but serving the kids last is bad form.   We try to make it up to the kids by ordering them ice cream for desert. We are then subjected to sitting at a table half full with dirty dishes (no one bothered to finish clearing  the table) and wait 15 minutes but no ice cream or service of any kind arrives. At this point I go looking for Danny (our waiter) and explain we no longer wish to wait and can I just get the check. Another 5 minutes pass and I am finally given the check as I am standing by the front door trying to end this torture.  No apology is offered, no one seems to care that we are leaving without having received what we ordered nor is there a manager anywhere in sight to witness a customer standing at the front door trying in vain to just pay his bill and escape this nightmare of bad service.    Way to go Danny, nice job turning 20% into 10%.   Way to go Cheesecake Factory management, nice job turning what could have been a customer into a never to return detractor."
Thomas A.,"Watertown, MA",288,817,326,3.0,7/19/2010,"This place is hugeeee. It's right next to the whole foods and walking distance to the Westchester Mall.  The food is good. I'm not going to lie. They have some good menu choices and not so good menu choices. The problem here is the calorie count which they display in the menu. It really makes you think twice of what you want to order. If the calorie counts weren't displayed...ohhhhh boyyy. the sky is the limit. Their burgers are great, cooked well, and they butter up their buns. The green chile cheeseburger could be better because they didn't put enough roasted green chiles nor jalapenos. Miso glazed salmon is good. THeir cuban sandwich is good, their brunch menu is good. honestly, there is not much where i wouldn't order. The only regrettable thing is their pizza which is pretty tasteless. Their apps are great, brunch specials, lunch specials are all reasonably sized and portioned nicely.  You have to come here with an empty stomach because they do provide a lot of food, which is probably why the cal count is so high on some dishes. Desserts are amazing too. I love their cheesecakes. This place also provides take-out orders and curb-side pick up. They can accommodate multiple large groups and are kid friendly.  This is one of the go to brunch/lunch spots for my family."
Michael L.,"Philadelphia, PA",12,215,6,3.0,10/15/2012,"I'm a fan of the cheesecake factory (once I ignore the calorie counts they are now required to put on their menus). The food is always good and fresh, the white uniforms they wear are always so sparkly and clean, and the interior designs are always so ""visiting your aunt and going to that one weird bathroom where she thought she would take artistic license."" The service was just okay last time I was there. It could have been I went at an off time, but at times I felt forgotten about. That being said, it IS the cheesecake factory, so if I want a salad the size of a bear cub, you know where I'll be."
David B.,"New Rochelle, NY",1,9,,1.0,10/8/2014,"This place used to be good, two years ago. The service was slow. After waiting for  what felt a long time, the food arrived COLD. We asked for the food to be re-heated, they returned the food which was still cold but with hot plates. We asked for the manager, who agreed that the food was indeed cold. They went ahead and made another order all together. We waited for another 30 minutes for our food, which arrived warm but with cold french fries. The food tasted very blunt, it was plan horrible. We didn't want to bother and wait any longer and just had the food without the french fries, paid our bill and left. Will definitely stay away from this chain. I don't recommend. Awful food and service."
Georgia C.,"Pearl River, NY",0,2,,5.0,10/3/2015,I went to this Cheesecake Factory on a Sunday night with a group of about 10 or so. It was very busy and they don't take reservations so we decided to hang by the bar until a table freed up. Every single staff member who walked by asked if we were okay and if there was anything they could get for us. On top of that every single one of our dinners was amazing. Thanks!
Rod B.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",12,211,,2.0,12/27/2013,"We have been here several times over the past few years. The lunch service was terrible. They were always very slow in every capacity from taking your drink order, bringing your drinks, bringing your food and clearing your check. The dinner service was better and more efficient. The dinner service was not stellar just better than the lunch service. The price of cheesecake slices was a huge rip off for the size of the slice. As for the food itself, it was pretty nice for a chain restaurant. It was probably the best of the chain restaurants I have been to so far. You do have to pay for parking which will makes eating here more expensive and puts you at the mercy of the staff to get out of there before a new hour starts. There were too many times we left only to find out we would be billed for an extra hour."
