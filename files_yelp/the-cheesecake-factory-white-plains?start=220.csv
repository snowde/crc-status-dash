Kayla K.,"Honolulu, HI",94,35,1,4.0,9/7/2010,"I love Cheesecake Factory, partly because I am always there with good company and partly because the food there is delicious. Yes, it is pricey and the wait can be really long but it is worth it in my opinion.  Get the Red Velvet Cheesecake, you won't regret it ;] It is AMAZING. You will love it. Guarantee. The brown bread is another reason why you will love Cheesecake factory. It is just too good. Soft and sort of sweet. Reminds me of chocolate just because it is sweet and is the color of chocolate brown but it doesn't really taste like it.  One favorite dish is the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. The sauce isn't too heavy but it's flavorful and has some of the best ingredients in it. Lightly battered shrimp, arugula, tomatoes, mushrooms in a lemon-garlic-basil-butter sauce. It was amazing. Another favorite is...well I forget the name but it's a cream sauce pasta with chicken and arugula and prosciutto. It's so yummy! Sooooooo good (:  I'm going to have to go back for that Wasabi Ahi. That sounds delicious and yummy. I can't wait!"
Christine W.,"White Plains, NY",81,47,32,3.0,4/14/2011,"I have been to quite a few CF's all around and I think they are all pretty consistent to each other. This one is alright and really no different from the others. It's just one of those fall-back places to go that you know will deliver acceptable food. Portions are large and the wait staff is usually friendly, unless if it's extremely busy. The only downside is the $3 parking garage for anything up to 2 hours. That's a freakin' ripoff for parking, yo! Don't even think about trying to buy your $15 at Whole Foods to get your parking validated... it will only work if you were there for less than an hour. (Yes, I tried)"
jill w.,"New York, NY",0,346,,3.0,10/9/2014,"Standard cheesecake factory dining (in terms of atmosphere, food and service). You know what your going to get and you get it."
Lily S.,"Stamford, CT",81,296,109,4.0,1/3/2009,"I hate the fact that they don't accept reservations, but the wait for a table is worth it. I love the food, the drinks, and the desserts. My fiance and I came here for both of our birthdays and to celebrate our engagement. I always get the shrimp scampi because it doesn't taste ""traditional""...the dish has a very good twist to it. All of the drinks I have had here (both non-alcoholic and alcoholic) are good. The chicken quesadilla is GREAT. I wish they would make the dish a little bigger.  The only problems I have with this restaurant are the wait (I think I have waited for 45 minutes for a table), the dim lighting, and the fact that the waiters wear very dirty white sneakers lol."
A B.,"Mt Vernon, NY",0,94,74,3.0,8/13/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory used to be the go-to spot for my friends and I. I used to LOVE their veggie burger.. you know, the version from back in 2005.. They have changed the recipe twice, that I know of, and they can't seem to get it right. Just go back to the other one!!!! Thanks."
Monica M.,"Danbury, CT",74,167,,4.0,7/9/2012,"I know it's a chain restaurant but what can I say?  J'adore the Cheesecake Factory!  The menu is quite extensive.  Some of my fave items: Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip, Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad, and Chicken Madeira.  If you come on the weekend, prepare to wait at least an hour for a table.  Their cheesecake is to die for.  My favorite is the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cheesecake.  It happens to be the slice with the most calories but I spread the portions over 3 days!"
Jason R.,"New York, NY",49,261,13,3.0,4/18/2010,"Cheesecake Factory (CCF) is one of the very few chain restaurants I actually enjoy. On a mall trip to The Westchester, we decided to have a late lunch at CCF. Usually the wait can be 45mins plus but it was rather quick since it was in between lunch and dinner time, about 10 mins.  We were seated in the back part of the restaurant and had a very friendly waiter. It took us about 10 mins to decide what appetizer we wanted to start with, and another 10 for our entrees. There are just so many choices.  We decided on the Buffalo Blasts for appetizers, they are kind of like wontons filled with buffalo chicken and cheese, fried and served with buffalo and blue cheese. Here is where CCF gets knocked down to 3 stars for this visit, one of my biggest dining pet peeves. After only 5 mins of having our appetizer our entrees arrived!! First of all we hadn't even made a dent in our appetizer so it would be at least another 15 mins before I would be ready for my entree, Second, the waiter should know to give us sometime between our appetizer and entree, isn't there a waiter rule book that says something like 5 mins between the time the appetizer is removed and the entree arrives. And lastly since we were seated in a table for two I was balancing my entree plate w/ my hand. We have 3 huge plates on the small table, drinks, appetizer plates and a bread basket. Just Common Sense!  My spicy cashew chicken was a bit salty ,the few bites I was able to eat after that giant appetizer.  CCF next time don't rush me! I dont want to rip and dip, i want to savor every moment of our time together and maybe cuddle afterward."
R B.,"Elmsford, NY",54,29,,5.0,4/20/2012,I have gone to this cheesecake factory dozens of times and never wrote a review. I must say always a great experience when I go. We never dine on busy nights like friday or saturday but when we go during the week the food is always great and the service is good as well. My favorite is the Chicken Madiera and my girlfriend loves the Chicken Romano.
Perry G.,"White Plains, NY",6,41,,4.0,2/10/2013,"Excellent food, service is always pretty near perfect, managers are attentive.  Food is plentiful, and very reasonably priced.  Nice place to go to for an occasion or just for dinner."
Paola C.,"New Fairfield, CT",130,234,19,4.0,1/25/2010,"What bad can you say about the cheesecake factory... the cheesecake slices are decadent, the service is wishy washy, the tables and chairs are big and comfy, the food is massive, and well.... its the cheesecake factory. The sheer amount of variety in this place is insane and you can literally find anything to tickle your fancy.... I especially enjoy their seared tuna on the new ""bites"" menu and their cobb salad which is probably at least 2000cals for a salad.  The one downfall to this amazing menu... here in NY its mandatory for calories to be dispayed... not fun to look at how many calories or even pounds your food is costing you in your diet.   Tiramisu cheesecake, dulce de leche cheesecake and marble cheesecake.... oy so good! I should try some of the other desserts but its just soooo yummyto have the cheesecake over and over and over again with a big glass of milk.... mmmmmmmmmmmmmm."
Jackienrich B.,"Bronx, NY",0,63,,4.0,1/17/2014,"waits are long during the busy times of day, but service, food & dessert is really good"
Shari W.,"New Rochelle, NY",14,21,18,4.0,1/5/2013,"Learning that my son had an allergy to tree nuts, the staff was quite attentive, assured us of their safety protocols and checked in to make sure that all was well.  The food is just so delicious and even the lunch portions are large enough to create a 2nd meal at home. Def worth the price."
Aj B.,"Cortlandt Manor, NY",15,6,,4.0,3/1/2012,"The waiting times are going to be rather hit or miss when you come to this place. I came here with my girlfriend and two other friends on Valentine's Day, but of course it was sometime between 5 and 6 in the evening - not too late at night. I was prepared to wait a couple of hours - imagine our shock when we were told the wait was going to be 20 minutes, and imagine our bigger shock when our pager started ringing in less than 10.  Everything here is top notch; The appetizers, entrees, desserts. I have no idea why you'd complain about a menu being ""too big""; in my opinion, that means it satisfies a higher range of people. Everytime I've come here, I've always ordered the Chicken Piccata dish; this place gets it right every time and has set a new standard for that particular entree that no other place gets.  They always start you off with a complimentary bread basket; just judging from the bread alone, you know this place is going to be wonderful. My personal favorite appetizer here is the Avacado Eggrolls, but I've sampled their Artichoke and Fried Calamari as well; even such a common appetizer like fried calamari will surprise you when you get it from this place. However, their beer selection has a bit to be desired; when I asked for a Samuel Adams seasonal, the beer I got tasted almost like a slightly enhanced Budweiser. I'm familiar with the Sam Adams taste and that was not it! It wasn't enough of a deterrent to ruin my experience, but still. It's called the Cheesecake Factory for a reason; the selection for cheesecake at the end is just amazing, and they've never gotten them wrong, either. We haven't compared a regular slice to Junior's yet, but that's for the next time we're (definitely will be) returning to this place. =) And as a bonus, their bathrooms almost look like they're paved with gold."
Renai M.,"Bronx, NY",44,12,198,4.0,3/18/2012,"You would think a place called the cheesecake factory would have the most delicious cheesecake in the world however that's not so true. Its yummy but nothing to write home to mom about. Their drinks and food items make up for the lack of WOW in the desserts category.  The best part is they have a ""skinny menu"" with low calories items that taste even better than their higher calorie counter parts."
Leilani B.,"Bronx, NY",49,30,5,3.0,3/9/2012,this place used to be my favorite place until they decided to take the BEEF SHORT RIBS OFF THE MENU NOOOOOOO NOW ITS JUST OK
Sean G.,"Hartsdale, NY",4,39,,4.0,1/11/2013,"For chain food this place is a beast. Cant go wrong.  Love the bang bang chicken and shrimp. This place does it all very well, american, asian, italian, etc.  Love it."
Rachel S.,"Greenwich, CT",34,154,93,5.0,8/29/2012,"This place...... IS AWESOME. I've never had a bad thing here before! The only downside is the enormous wait in line for a table on weekends. Delicious, good variety, and the portions are so huge I always take home half for the next day's lunch. My favorite apps are the spicy ahi tempura roll (SO GOOD) and the fried mac and cheese. My favorite main dishes are the crispy chicken costelletta and chicken madeira. The key lime cheesecake is to die for if that's something you're into! I would eat here everyday if I knew I wouldn't gain 20 pounds in a month. Great place for a celebration or a splurge. Can't give it a higher recommendation."
Josiah D.,"Maybrook, NY",1,4,7,2.0,12/2/2012,I went on a Saturday night for a birthday party and had to wait for 3hrs. Then when we finished eating the waiter messed up the checks. On our way out we also saw a roach. I recommend not to go there ever.
Sheila L.,"Armonk, NY",14,11,10,1.0,10/9/2012,Pretty Gross!  Went there about a year ago and my friend was eating her salad when all of a sudden it looked like she was choking.  As she was not actually choking she was choking on a LONG piece of black hair (She is a blonde and was for sure not hers)  The manager came over and apologized and told her that her meal would be taken care of and asked if she wanted anything else.  She told him she had lost her appetite and that she was fine.  As myself and one other member at our table were completely skeeved out  we started looking in our own food.  Then we had come to discover there were little black hairs all over our table.  The manager had come over again and told us all of our meals would be taken care of and we could take home cheesecake for free if we would like.  We were all too skeeved out that we left in a hurry!
Cat W.,"Flushing, NY",46,165,816,3.0,7/13/2012,"The cheesecakes, macchiato, and coffee were good. The shrimp lollipops were sort of disappointing. Also, I wish they cleaned their utensils better...there was food on my friend's fork...so much so that she was able to wipe it off with a napkin -_- My favorite was the fresh banana cream cheesecake. If you like bananas, then definitely give this one a try."
