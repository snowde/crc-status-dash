Shira F.,"Massapequa, NY",388,384,1085,3.0,5/10/2012,"This restaurant is huge and has an insane amount if options to choose from. Last week I came here for lunch with my family and we ordered everything and their brother because we were all so hungry!  First we ordered cocktails, I got the blueberry mojito, sweet, with a little kick! My mom ordered the passion fruit mojito and her boyfriend ordered the mai tai. She sucked hers down quick, so my guess is that she liked it!  As for appetizers, we ordered the guacamole, spicy, but it was not spicy in the least! We also got the southwestern eggrolls and the these deep fried buffalo chicken things, concept was gross, but they were surprisingly delicious!   As for entrees, the 5 people in our party ordered different things, but I ordered the BBQ ranch burger and it was great. The waitress made sure it was cooked to my liking, but after all of those appetizers I could barely take a bite! We also ordered cheesecake to go. I highly recommend the red velvet! It's huuuuge though, takes me about 3 days to finish haha.  The food is average, hence the 3 stars, but this trip I probably would have given 4 stars just based on the service because with how busy the restaurant was, our waitress was still very attentive!"
S S.,"Brooklyn, NY",26,287,881,2.0,6/4/2012,The Cajun Jambalaya Pasta tastes too buttery for me. And the Samosa tasted way too salty.
Jason C.,"Basking Ridge, NJ",79,488,10,2.0,2/6/2010,Un-attentive waiter chatted noisily with coworkers and customers 5 feet from us. Un-attentive waiter cast us off onto another waiter who was also un-attentive. Un-attentive waiter number 2 then tried to run off with my change. He tried to play it off but the cash register computer thing-o was right next to our table and he had to ask how much cash I had given him.
Jose Antonio M.,"Scarsdale, NY",71,8,,4.0,12/20/2010,"Great selection, good flavors, fast service. Big portions... So we never had space for the sweets!"
Stephanie S.,"New Rochelle, NY",25,2,,1.0,8/11/2015,"I went here on Friday with a friend , the hostess was very polite sad us down quickly , when we were seated the waitress said "" I'll be right with you "" we waited for 45 minutes , after 20 min I asked another hostess to get us a table she clearly did not care , after that I told the manager I was furious !!! The manager got us another waiter who took our order ( he was very nice ) the waitress that we had originally came back trying to kiss our behind and said she was on break ... Saying she had told them she was ... Which was a lie because she came back 15 min before and was attending a table across from us thinking we wouldn't notice , she apologized over and over ... I was very upset to the point where I was so close to telling her to go away .... Needless to say never coming here again ... Ridge hill is way better . Shame on the hostess who didn't care as well ... Horrible don't go here"
Maven T.,"White Plains, NY",28,80,17,3.0,6/26/2012,"The food is consistently good; however, trying to choose from the ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA they call a menu is a difficult thing. TOO MANY CHOICES! Best to go online and check out their menu beforehand, so you're prepared to make your choice ahead of time--it really is a mammoth menu. I always have a hard time selecting what to get.  Service runs from good to mediocre. The White Plains location is: Too big and vacuous; Too loud (don't expect to be able to hear your dining companion--don't even THINK about having a conversation); Too crowded ALWAYS."
Banana R.,"White Plains, NY",0,35,,2.0,1/26/2013,"Wait time is out of control, average food, prices too high, hassle to park. Do yourself a favor and just get a cheesecake to go and eat dinner at home or at a better restaurant. I do love those cajun chicken tenders though."
Holly S.,"New Rochelle, NY",62,148,21,3.0,8/3/2013,"I normally wouldn't write a review about a popular franchise that most people know of, and what to expect, but my last experience here was bizarre. First, I'm a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, where I've never had a bad meal. I especially love all the variety on the Skinnylicious menu. The White Plains location leaves a lot to be desired though. Our waitress was real friendly and helpful, don't get me wrong, but in the end her extreme pushiness was a turn-off. Apparently, the kitchen ran out of the honey wheat bread during our meal, and she was wonderfully apologetic. I am training right now and staying away from gluten, so I was secretly happy because I love their honey wheat bread. We did not seem disappointed, nor did we ask for another round of the sourdough loaf. At the end of the meal, she said the kitchen was almost done with the honey wheat and if we'd just wait another five minutes she'd give us some to take home. I politely declined, but she kept insisting. We said no two more times and walked toward the exit. I stopped off in the bathroom, and when I came out, hubby was holding this large bag with two loaves of bread. What was meant as a kind gesture came of as very pushy and a desperate attempt to wow the customer. I get it. Bad economy. Stores, restaurants, and every other retail franchise is going above and beyond to impress the customer. It's annoying. I did not need this diet sabotage, and three No's should have been her cue to back off."
Maureen C.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",2,42,,2.0,4/1/2009,"I really, really, do not understand why so many people are nuts for The Cheesecake Factory.  Just don't get it.   An hour-and-a-half wait for dinner at a chain restaurant?  Check. So-so chicken entree arriving lukewarm (after receiving and sending back another diner's dish)?  Check. Toilet paper strewn across the ladies room floor?  Check. The cheesecake itself was creamy and decadent, but was it worth an hour-and-a-half wait?  No way.   I think two stars is pretty generous.  Whole Foods is right next door- I'd much rather fill up a couple containers at their salad bar, pick up some fresh fruit for dessert, and run home to eat in peace and quiet."
Anjelica Maria M.,"Bronx, NY",3,28,,5.0,10/1/2012,"I love The Cheesecake Factory is always great, no complaints. Good service, good food! My absolute fav is the steak Diane with garlic mashed potatoes, yum."
Natasha S.,"Watertown, MA",2,72,35,5.0,5/28/2012,"Georgia peach and tropical martini are must-trys! Chicken farfalle with roasted garlic is the best dish on the menu. Love the chicken bellagio, too. Mac and cheese balls are to DIE for! Buffalo blasts are also great. Godiva chocolate brownie sundae is delicious if you can save some room for it. Reese's and red velvet cheesecakes = heaven. Life would not be the same without Cheesecake Factory."
Winifred X.,"Seattle, WA",244,673,121,3.0,1/20/2010,"I came here last night for dessert, parking is at the nearby garage (walk through the Whole Foods store), it's convenient but not free ($1 for 15 min. or $3 each hr)..  I ordered the new ""red velvet cheesecake"", which I wanted to make a direct comparison with CPK's ""red velvet cheese cake"". The verdict:  -- cheeasecake factory's version is thicker layers of cheesecakes in the middle, which is awesome if you want more creamy stuff. But because it's more cheesecake, the overall dessert is being served at a lower temperature, thus making the cream with white chocolate on top very dense too.  -- Personally I prefer the CPK version, with the opposite ratio of cake vs. cream cheese filling. Defrosted and served at slightly fridged temperature, it's much smoother in the mouth, which goes very well with the velvety moist cake part..   =) overall, it's a good place to come to for an evening out in White Plains."
Rich J.,"Yonkers, NY",82,535,155,4.0,5/18/2011,"Well since I reviewed Legal Seafood I might as well review this place too (this is what happens when you are bored and drinking). Inhumanly long menu with many suprisingly healthy choices, upscale choices (tuna carpaccio, kobe burger) and they are made pretty well. I did have low expectations coming in, but I have to say I am a fan now..not all chain restaurants are evil after all."
Patrick W.,"Coventry, CT",9,83,,4.0,3/6/2010,"It's a Cheesecake Factory, similar to every other Cheesecake Factory. Expect waits on Friday and Saturday evenings, large portions, and delicious cheesecake. The service here is slightly better than other Cheesecake Factories I've been too, but the ambience isn't quite the same.  Better than some of the mall locations, but not nearly as neat as the location in Chicago or the standalone one in Pittsburgh. One interesting thing to remember is that the calorie counts for all their dishes are posted on the menu. If you're like me, this will probably cause you to avoid something with 2500 calories in favor of something with only 1700 calories.  The portions are huge so you should probably only eat half of them anyway. Besides, if you ate everything you wouldn't have room for dessert -- unless your Joey Chestnut or Kobayashi. For a good laugh be sure to check out the total calories for a 10"" cheesecake on their bakery.  Love how the 10"" red velvet cheesecake has 18000 calories, and what delicious calories they are."
Marina E.,"Virginia Beach, VA",67,532,1676,3.0,10/24/2009,"I love how many different items are on their menu.  This is only my second time I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory.  I was neither impressed or unimpressed.  They make an excellent mojito!  Service was good and the portions were way more than any normal person should even think about eating, but whatev. I'd go again and try something else."
Benson B.,"New York, NY",8,37,,5.0,1/5/2009,"I usually hate going to chain restaurants, but I absolutely LOVE the Cheesecake Factory!  Price is reasonable, food - super large portion, wait staff (in WP, at least) really friendly and fast, good atmosphere and it's simply delish!   Everytime I walk into the Cheesecake Factory, I always wished I owned the restaurant.  It is a goldmine!  You can't make reservations and there's usually a 25 minute wait...up to 2 hours on the weekends!  So worth it though, it's good to kill time at the huge bar they have.   Feel free to also seat yourself on the high tables on the bar area - we scored a seat there in less that 10 minutes of waiting and we got to watch the Vikings lose while eating =(  My ultimate favorite is the Beef Ribs, you have to try it, meat falls right off the bone and it's tasty and tender. I'm hungry."
Juan T.,"Manhattan, NY",282,456,507,4.0,2/17/2009,"This is the place to go for great food in White plains. I went there on Friday the 13th, yes i know bad luck day but it was great. The place is at a prime location, it has parking and easy to get to from anywhere in the area. The Restaurant is Huge and well maintained. Wait time is 45-1 hour on weekends for a group larger than 4 if you go before 9pm. Food was so delicious, OMG i was full with the appetizers. We ordered the factory something...Its just a bunch of different meals from quesadillas to some Asian rolls..they were all yummy. The main courses were all great and big portions. I ordered the beef ribs, it was like watching the Flintstones cartoons and seeing how much they ate. Huge, just Huge (i now that what all women say to me - jk). Food service was great, very attentive and fast. they really earned their tips. Food barely took 15 minutes for it to come out and its made fresh. Price is very reasonable and well worth it, the total for all meals for 5 adults and a kid was around $175 and we 4 of us had drinks, appetizers and main course meals. Will surely go there again.  The only con is that they do not take reservations."
Linda W.,"Hartsdale, NY",0,11,,2.0,1/13/2013,"The menu boggles the mind. It's the size of a novella. How can you do that many dishes well? Having said that, for a quick, cheap meal to catch up with a friend, it's good enough. If you want to linger over your lunch or dinner and chat, this is not the place. Very noisy. Typical chain restaurant but they do an okay job of it. Get the corn fritters. Yum. Creative cheese cake flavors; however....honestly? Not the best cheese cake I've had."
Matthew S.,"Stamford, CT",8,107,5,4.0,1/31/2009,"We'll do a compliment sandwich, hold the mayo: Something Good: Location, location, location.  Right next to the Westchester Mall and Whole Foods, Cheesecake has a prime locale.  (Note: you will have to park in the garage) Something Bad: They don't take reservations!!!!! arggg so annoying.  And then they tell everyone the wait will be 10 minutes.  I mean the place is pretty big but c'mon, there are like 16 other couples waiting.  When they say 10 minutes they mean 20/30. Something Good:  The menu.  My opinion is that the menu is very well selected.  Being a chain they have to appeal to many taste buds.  They might be stretching themselves a little thin, but everything I've had has been tasty.  This would be a good place to bring a group of finicky eaters, as I'm sure they would be able to find something...and they have CHEEEEEESECAKE!! sweet. And there you have your sandwich.  Next time we'll have the crusts cut off for you."
Yvette S.,"Port Chester, NY",59,14,,1.0,7/17/2012,I came here for my birthday and it was ruined by this restaurant. I specifically stated I had a food allergy and I was assured that it would be taken care of. Instead I had a reaction to the allergen and then I was offered by the manager desserts with the allergen as compensation. I suffered for the rest of my birthday.
