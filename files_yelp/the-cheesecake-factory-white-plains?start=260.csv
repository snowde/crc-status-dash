Keejoo L.,"Alexandria, VA",168,532,130,4.0,8/22/2009,"Best place ever. It has such a eclectic bunch of foods, anyone you being here is going to find something that they love and will end up taking some of it home for the next day!  I wish that you could make reservations. Sometimes the hostess seems a little confused about whats going around and I am not just saying for this one, all of them.   They seem to be in real tourist areas, malls; downtown inner harbour baltimore, etc. but that might just be a generalization."
Amanda M.,"New York, NY",243,71,1,3.0,12/7/2010,"I don't know how to rate the Cheesecake Factory. I don't always get a great meal here... I love their avocado egg rolls, soups, salads, Thai chicken lettuce wrap etc. A few things I didn't like were : chicken salad sandwich, sun dried tomato pasta and their wings ( my friend ordered I just tasted).  I do however like their cheesecake! vanilla bean , key lime and strawberry mmmm!!!"
LV F.,"Greenwich, CT",21,51,31,4.0,7/20/2011,"I've been hearing people rave about this place forever, but I finally had the chance to try it for myself a few days ago.  The place is huge, clean and pretty inside.  The staff is knowledgeable and attentive. We happened to come during happy hour, and even though we weren't drinking...they had a ton of appetizers and small plates for $5 special. The food was good, it came out fairly quickly, and there are a million options!! I'd definitely come back!!"
Kris V.,"New Haven, CT",90,205,13,4.0,6/23/2011,"We have been to this location several times, and have always had great service. We've eaten at the bar, and on the patio. This location seems to live up to the standards of other Cheesecake Factory's as far as food quality, and cleanliness. The only thing about any restaurant in NY is that they show the calories in everything! No one wants to see that their favorite slice of cheesecake is 1,000!!!!!!!!!! CRAZYNESS!!!!!! But none the less, a great location."
J G.,"White Plains, NY",0,12,,2.0,2/13/2013,"Be ready to wait forever.....to get a table. Don't even try to make a reservation either. Food is iffy. Pretty good for a chain restaurant, but if your stomach is proven to be a little funny at times, stay close to a bathroom after you finish your meal. I think I've said enough."
Lisa R.,"Mamaroneck, NY",28,162,125,1.0,1/7/2013,"Ok so someone bought me a gift certificate here when they had heard that I had never been. I really had no desire to go because I just didn't. I was at the westchester mall and faced with the food court options which are bad I convinced my husband to walk over to cheesecake. We were with our two kids so I was happy to see so many kids there. The noise level is what I like when eating with my kids. Constant bustle so no one tables noise really sticks out.  We were seated quickly. We barely got settled And our waitress asked us to order. We should have told her we needed a minute but we were really starving so we chose quickly and hoped for food to come soon.  The wait begins.... My kids ordered apple juice. Our sodas come and no juice. Ten minutes later still no signs of our waitress. We grab a busboy and ask for the apple juices. Another ten minutes the waitress comes over with apple juices  and says "" we ran out of apple juice. Someone had to go to the store to get it!"" wow- so I felt bad that someone had to go next door  to whole foods.  So anyway our food comes out  like 20 more mins later. I was a little taken a back by it looking like Applebee's food. I had tacos- they were ok. My kids barely ate their food and they were starving and they are usually good eaters so that was a great waste of money- well a gift certificate. We glanced at the dessert menu - everyone was ordering the cheesecake.  We waited and waited no sign of waitress. I have young kids I need good service. I need people to wait on me and bring me food some what quickly. I need to get checked on. So ianlly my kids wouldn't sit still an longer. We got our coats on and I told my husband that I would find the waitress and have the check brought to him. I walked up and down the restaurant three times with no sign of my waitress. Finally I grabbed a waiter and begged him to please have my check sent to my car! I left. My husband comes out 15 minutes later and says she finally came and she had no check but she had soda refills!!! And she was all like "" ohh I am sorry  I wanted to bring you refills!"" my husband was like "" well we have to go now the refills would have been nice while we were eating.""  anyway--- never never going there again! Food was whatever and service was terrible!! And by the way I don't think thy ran out of apple juice. I think that waitress forgot them and that was her line to make us think she was trying her best( just like the refills) when he defiantly wasn't!!!"
Rick R.,"Tarrytown, NY",30,146,,4.0,8/5/2009,"We had a great meal here!   First of all, I love the Robert Mondavi Cabernet.  It is so good.  I've had it many times and I just love it.  We also tried the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and the sauce on top of them is tasty and rich.  The mushroooms themselves are just ok. For dinner, I had the vegetable chopped salad.  I've never had this before and I absolutely loved it!  I got it with blue cheese dressing (their blue cheese dressing is better than average) but I think the vinaigrette would also be good. The service was very good and I really appreciated our waiter's efforts.  I was pleased.  I was way too stuffed for Cheesecake this time but I'm sure it would have been delicious.  Unfortunately for my weight-control, I'm no stranger to Cheesecake Factory cheesecake  :)"
Amelia Z.,"Bronx, NY",272,399,14,4.0,12/14/2008,"I don't consider myself above chain restaurants...so hey, I have to admit, I like this place. The boyfriend and I, after a day of holiday shopping, walked here from the Galleria mall. We arrived at around...hm...5:30ish?   There was a wait, but fortunately, it wasn't long for two people. We shared a chicken quesadilla appetizer, which was actually very fresh, and garnished with amazing guacamole...though actually I've never met guacamole I didn't like... My main dish was the Lousiana Chicken Pasta...which I could not finish. It was massive...but of course, there was cheesecake...had the Raspberry Chocolate Truffle, and yes, I'm still fantasizing about it. All in all, a pretty good chain restaurant. Nice atmosphere, and friendly [uber-friendly] service. And for those who think I totally violated my diet, we walked back to the Metro-North station. So it all canceled out. =P"
Ying C.,"Manhattan, NY",181,240,112,2.0,1/4/2013,"I came in to get a slice of cheesecake for takeout.  The reception lady behind the cheesecake counter was SLOW beyond belief.  It took her at least 8 full minutes to just give change from the register to the waiting waitress.  She finally took my order after that, and the kitchen staff took like 30 seconds to put a slice of cheesecake in a tupperware container.  I paid, and the phone rang.  She picked up the phone and just left that cheesecake in the container there.  Hello lady, a bag for a take out order?  Plus, it's SNOWING outside. After waiting for another 3 minutes, I finally asked the same kitchen staff to give me a plastic bag.  She was quick and even asked me if I needed a spoon and some napkins.  I know this is not NYC, but c'mon, you can grab a takeout plastic bag right under the register while you're on the phone.  Maybe she wasn't even planning to give me one in the first place?  What a shame for a well-established chain restaurant!"
Patricia R.,"Tampa, FL",93,192,61,5.0,11/13/2012,"I love cheesecake factory . They have amazing food ,drinks and there cheesecake is to die for .They are a bit pricey but you can't complain because the food portions are huge so you definitely pay for what your eating trust me . We usually get sliders or the chicken buffalo blast which is fried pieces of chicken in hot sauce with melted cheese in side it's just amazing served with extra hot sauce or blue cheese. Usually for dinner I get there Cuban sandwich yes they have a delicious Cuban sandwich with fries or I get the chicken teriyaki which is also a favorite of mine .My husband usually gets there meatloaf which he likes or the Cajun chicken littles and trust me there isn't anything little about this lol . Now there white sangria is amazing and there mojitos as well .now the cheesecake i usually get the Godiva cheesecake or the chocolate raspberry truffle soo damn good and hubby gets a huge slice of Linda's chocolate fudge cake which is simply amazing and just a chocolate lovers dreams . I have never been disappointed at any cheesecake factory yet . I just love this place ."
L C.,"Westchester, NY",158,419,47,3.0,1/20/2007,"The Cheesecake Factory is really just a step or two above TGI Friday's in the ladder of chain restaurants.  No matter what you order, you walk out feeling huge and disgusting and like you just ate 4000 calories (you probably did).   They try to fool you with their long wait, beepers, and so-busy hosts in black with headsets, with the mass-produced upscale decor and the ridiculous 20+ page menu, but like a wolf in sheep's clothing, Cheesecake always seems to be looking around to see if anyone's discovered the ruse yet.  Well, this time, I did, dammit!  With a million delicious non-chain restaurants in the world to go to, I think this was my last visit to a chain, ever.  The food is heavy, rich, and basically why America is fat.  The desserts are cloyingly sweet and leave you clutching your tummy in an overdose of ""why did i eat that???""  I'll give Cheesecake the benefit of the doubt, though,with 3 stars, because with a menu so extensive, SOMETHING must be not completely over the top.  And the Mexican soup we had was actually pretty good.  But, ugh."
Sam G.,"White Plains, NY",0,20,,4.0,6/28/2012,"i have been going here for years and I always love whatever I order! Over the years I have tried a bunch of different things from here but the one I always have to get the avocado spring rolls! They are consistently delicious and always fresh and crispy. This time, I went with a friend and we both sampled each others orders. Their portions are great; my friend made a whole meal out of two appetizers. I got the crispy crab bites and the skinny-licious flatbread with roasted pears, blue cheese, gorgonzola, arugula and pecans.....It was absolutely wonderful!!And as only $5.95 and under 500 calories its even better! The crab bites were also great- crispy, fresh and a wonderful dipping sauce! All in all the meal was great!"
Veronica i.,"Chicago, IL",3,14,,5.0,4/30/2011,"One of my top favorite restaurants! Perfect place to bring the family, a hot date or for a girl's night out.  The inside is beautiful, the prices are really good for the HUGE dinner portions they serve and the desserts are WOW.  The only negative is that it's so popular that it gets pretty packed on Friday and Saturday evenings..but it's def worth the wait.  Waiters are attentive and food comes out pretty fast.  The complimentary fresh, warm bread is delish! Crowd tends to be anything from casual to super dressy..seems everyone loves this place!"
Darius K.,"Commack, NY",7,35,,3.0,2/14/2008,"At the risk of offending the foodies who consider reviews of chain restaraunts, beneath them, I offer this for consideration. I went here at 1pm on a Saturday and had an hour wait for 2 people.  Ordered the Sunrise burrito, companion ordered an egg salad sandwich with a soup.  My burrito came out and was literally a foot long.  It was good....for lunch on Saturday, breakfast on Sunday, and late lunch on Sunday.  The egg salad sandwich had a rediculous amount of mayo on, which was not all that appealing. The three stars relate to the economic benefit of eating here.  And they have good bread."
Kate O.,"Scarsdale, NY",5,27,,4.0,6/7/2012,"I usually hate/won't step foot into a chain restaurant, but Cheesecake Factory has won me over.  Especially when traveling throughout the country, this is a place where you can find a consistently good meal.  The food is consistent and I've never had a problem with the wait staff.  The one turnoff is the calorie content, but they do have low calorie options on their menu and also show you the calorie content of each meal (many restaurants do not).  I am in LOVE with their Luau Salad - I order it nearly every time.  Their bread is delicious.  The drinks are good (and strong!) and I enjoy all of their appetizers.  It is always packed, but sometimes if you wait by the bar and are with a smaller group - you can snag a bar table and get served a bit more quickly."
Clifford B.,"White Plains, NY",0,16,,5.0,3/29/2013,"Everything tastes good.  I've had maybe two dozen different items and enjoyed them all.  Prices are okay, and the portions are very large; even the lunch-sized portions are more than I usually eat for dinner.  I never have enough room for cheesecake.  Service is generally good, although they could refill water glasses once in a while."
Charles A.,"Redding, CT",4,108,5,4.0,1/19/2009,"Good food, good service. At times you need to get in line and wait for a table. Try the AvocadoEggrolls with Tamarind/cashews sauce."
Debra C.,"Port Chester, NY",0,13,,4.0,3/18/2013,The prices are reasonable for the quantity and quality of food you get and its always an easy place to go with the kids as long as the wait isnt terrible.
Jannat B.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",1,73,,1.0,9/17/2012,"first and last time i will visit this location, drove an hour to get to it because i was craving my favorite cheesecake factory meal, they basically ruined my favorite cheesecake factory entree, the wasabi crusted tuna, overcooked it, to their credit, the manager didn't charge me for it and offered to make it again but we were pressed for time, such a disappointment"
SA F.,"Frederick, MD",1,121,103,3.0,5/5/2010,"90 minute wait for table, but food was excellent. Service was okay, had to repeatedly ask for drink refills and they completely forgot about my friend's margarita."
