Todd S.,"White Plains, NY",0,15,,4.0,12/30/2012,Actually surprisingly good food and decent service (note restaurant was nearly empty since we were having an early dinner).  Some strange limits on food choices though such as no crackers for the clam chowder.  Desserts are huge so split them.
Tough P.,"Bronx, NY",0,15,,3.0,9/27/2010,"Nice place, food is okay, had better. Too pricey for some items on the menu. Come on $6.95 for a slice of cheesecake. The waitress tends to us and few other tables, but tends to spend time with the other patrons because they speak spanish. This place is 'Over rated""..."
Ruchita T.,"Hawthorne, NY",0,11,,4.0,9/9/2012,"Excellent food ,great ambience and prompt service !"
Kevin R.,"Yonkers, NY",1,6,,4.0,8/21/2010,"Awesome. The food was pretty good, the decor was pleasant and the cheesecake...wow! Being that its in the restaurant name, they definitely got it right. A huge variety of cheesecakes, the dulce de leche is my personal favorite. Been here several times, never a bad experience."
Jordan W.,"Bronx, NY",1497,1224,2927,3.0,7/28/2009,I have been here twice in the past two years.  It is way up in White Plains but if you are in the area I definitely recommend a visit.  I ordered some really cool starters like Avacado egg rolls.  I ended up with a main course (honestly I can't even remember) it was basically Asian General Tso (themed) dish.  Just breaded asian themed chicken that was really good with white rice and alot of veggies.  I honestly didn't event eat the cheesecake. I didn't have room. The rest of my party did indulge and loved the desserts.
Tracey D.,"Naugatuck, CT",1,4,,5.0,2/16/2010,"My friend and I went to the cheesecake factory last night in White Plains,  we had a great time. The food was delicious and the drinks from the bar were great!! The wait was long, but once we were seated our food came quickly. And, of course the cheesecake I ordered...  red velvet.... Ummm sooooo good!! I loved it!!"
Melissa M.,"Chicago, IL",89,334,1,4.0,2/14/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is pretty reliable, and by reliable I mean delicious. I just can't help loving my chain restaurants, especially when they are so consistently high-quality like Cheesecake and ::ahem:: PF Changs. By high quality I mean you walk in and your food tastes delicious. So calm down, foodie douchebags. Although they put the calories of each dish on the menu... wow. That will just make you want to slit your wrists right then and there. I almost always get the Chinese Chicken salad... I've been ordering this bad boy since I first started going to the CF in 4th grade when it opened at the John Hancock Center and read about it in the Chicago Tribune and made my mom take me (I was a weird child). It is always amazing, huge and even tastes good the next day. And even though I don't like white chocolate... the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is the BEST one on the menu. Seriously... I have tried a lot of them. I am GLAD we don't have a CF in NYC because I would spend way too much time and money there (for real, the wait on Saturday night was literally 2 hours long....and worth every minute)."
Sara B.,"Woodcliff Lake, NJ",15,149,,3.0,11/24/2008,"As much as i hate to admit it, since i hate how crowded and chain-y this restaurant is, i crave the BBQ Ranch salad just about every week. I cant really deal with eating there so i've started doing take out, but even this can turn into a half hour ordeal so be prepared or go at 4pm! The brown bread is also sooo good, if you ask the waitress nicely they will make your sandwich on this bread instead of the bread its normally paired with! The cheesecakes are of course great too, if you dont mind eating over a days worth of calories in one dessert!!"
Allyson R.,"Alpharetta, GA",210,601,434,4.0,11/6/2007,"I love cheesecake factory.  No matter where I go, what I want, I can find it there.  Yes, there is often a wait, but I think it is worth it.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are huge.  The cocktails are also good!  Definitely don't go here is you are indecisive because their menu is like 20 pages long!"
Kathleen Y.,"Astoria, NY",43,388,6,2.0,8/14/2007,"I went for the first time with my friends and to be honest with you, I just don't understand the hype.  Every single Cheesecake factory seems to have ridiculously long lines, but for what?  The food is okay, but not great and the prices are high.  The inside of the restaurant looks nice, but from what I've seen, it looks like every other Cheesecake Factory, so that's not really all that impressive.  I do like some of their desserts, but I'm a sucker for anything sugary."
Alexandra E.,"White Plains, NY",2,19,4,4.0,8/30/2010,this is one the best restaurants it has everything on the menu and the prices are not bad for the amount of food you get... the wait could be very long during peak hours and especially since they dont accept reservations and you have to pay for parking which is a bummer
Maria K.,"Scarsdale, NY",16,12,1,5.0,8/8/2009,"Me and my husband have been coming here religiously for about 4 years now and with no exaggeration it has yet to disappoint. The only bad thing that we can come up with is that they do not take reservations- because they don't have to, so be prepared to wait during anytime of the day or night. We return to this place again and again, not only for its large selection of food, drink and dessert but most importantly for its consistency of serving good, fresh food.  I like to eat healthy and my husband does not, so we have eaten a variety of items on the menu. None of them have let us down. Most of the time I get the French Country Salad- mixed greens, beets, candied walnuts, asparagus and goat cheese and I top it with a piece of grilled salmon which is always a large piece that is perfectly cooked.  My husband gets the Factory Burrito (huge!), Asian Shrimp Bistro- creamy and fresh or the Angus cheeseburger. Which are always so good and satisfying."
Annie Y.,"Bronx, NY",62,182,23,3.0,6/6/2007,"I usually eat here a lot just b/cof their vast menu and enjoyed it.  I had a late lunch today around 3:30 PM.  We were seated immediately which was great b/c I know around 6 pm, the wait could be 1.5 to 2 hrs.  I ordered the avocado egg rolls, it was good.  My thai bang bang chicken and shrimp (love the name btw) lack taste for some reason and I was a littel disappointed.  For dessert, we had the mud pie.  Looked great but I felt the cake was dry and maybe even stale.  I dunno what is going on with the food today.  Never was disappointed before.  At least the service was fast and the waitress Jimella was great."
Adam R.,"Philadelphia, PA",69,20,8,3.0,1/19/2009,"My sister wasn't married to the idea of going but I hadn't been there in awhile and was looking to turn my luck around with chain restaurants in White Plains, so I said let's go. We got there and the wait was 15 to 20 minutes. There were so many people waiting that the front of the place was packed standing room only. This I didn't like. There were children running around and everyone kept on bumping into my girlfriend. After 20 minutes we finally got sat and our server was there right away. He took our drink orders and was back within 3 minutes even though the place was really busy. We placed our order and sat and talked for awhile. Our app came out (nachos with chicken) and it was beautifully presented, the chips were not piled high and, the cheese was not burnt, there was adequete chicken for everyone, and it tasted great too. The entrees came and we devoured them. The items that were fried tasted great, no mixture of the flavors of everything put in the fryalator. The rest was great. the cheesecake was okay. Juniors has better, but for what its worth I will be going back."
