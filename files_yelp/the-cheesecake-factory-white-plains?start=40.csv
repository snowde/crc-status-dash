Evan P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,266,2,3.0,6/6/2016,Good all around. 3+ Cheesecake Factory does meals as well as cheesecake. They have a wide selection and even go out of their way to over low calorie option which I really liked. Get a big salad - the dinner portions are huge. Will not leave you feeling guilty when you get that slice of cheesecake after though. ;)
Nicole Z.,"White Plains, NY",0,17,2,3.0,7/15/2017,Food was as expected- when trying to check out cheesecake the counter was swamped and we waited 30 minutes without being acknowledged! Can go somewhere else for better service with the hefty bill.
D C.,"White Plains, NY",1,21,108,2.0,1/15/2017,"Me and 5 of my friends visited this location for Brunch today. I expected a long wait to be seated however, our waitress, Alyssa was rude. She went to seat us at a booth although I asked for a regular seating  - many people are claustrophic and do not like booths. She said ""no, there is no other seating"" clearly a lie since the tables across from us were all open and filled up shortly agter we were seated!!! We also asked if there was a place to put our coats - ""No, we don't have anywhere for them"". After finally taking our order it took almost an hour before we got our food! Alyssa's attitude was hurried and almost as though she wanted little to do with our table. We needed ketchup, that took forever to get it. One would imagine that would come automatically with the meal! Another friend waited and waited for her sour cream....long wait. When my plate was served, I'd ordered 2 sunny side up eggs with side of bacon. I am not a farm girl who is used to ever seeing this and it completely grossed me out when I saw my two eggs, one had two yolks in it - a twin! Really!? How/why would they serve a double yolk egg!? I did not return it since the food took an hour to get to our table - Lord only knows how long it's be before I got a replacement. Naturally, I was turned off by the appearamce and did not eat it. Also, my bacon was purchased as a ""side"" I would like bacon and not strips of mostly fat! I posted pics above. Really terrible the lack of flow of things and the less than interested server."
E K.,"San Diego, CA",6,85,35,3.0,9/20/2016,"My husband loves this place and every so often I agree to eat here with him. It's really not terrible, but not my favorite restaurant by any means. First, I believe it is Cheesecake Factory policy that at least 70% of the tables have large families with 2-4 young children. Honestly, I have never seen so many kids in a restaurant and it's like this every time. This makes for a noisy meal. The food is not bad. I always order from the ""skinny"" menu because I have a silly rule that a single meal should contain fewer than 1300 calories. I know this isn't a place for the dieter, but come on--the caloric value on these meals is suitable for nothing less than bears preparing for hibernation! This brings me to their famous dessert: the cheesecake. The one time I actually ordered a slice it arrived totally covered in whipped cream. For some, this is a fantastic surprise. I don't like whipped cream, so for me It was upsetting. When I scrapped it off the top I couldn't help but also take off the topping I was looking forward to enjoying. You live and you learn. If you want to drink (I know I need to the moment I see all those kids) I suggest beer or wine. The margarita I ordered was no bueno. Service is usually pretty descent."
Roshan S.,"New Rochelle, NY",6,19,37,4.0,7/5/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory chain is always adequate. I've been coming to this particular franchise for several years and it's been pretty great. The servers are helpful, the food is prepared quickly and cleanly.  However, there are two side to every coin.  One of these coins is a server who takes half an hour to show up and forgets to submit the order (I'm writing this on a Wednesday btw). But one sour experience shouldn't defame a whole restaurant. This franchise has a history or great service and if you encounter any problem the manager will take do their best to make amends. This is a great place,  for a chill date, a nice family dinner or brunch."
Gerry M.,"White Plains, NY",113,5,,2.0,7/29/2017,I like the cheescake factory and the food is always good there.  Its pretty much a standard at all of them.  The only compliant is the service.  I was in the service industry and the last 3 times i went there it was sub par.  the first and second time i went there I had to ask for water 3 times and didnt come out until after the appetizers.   My meal was wrong and they never checked on me until after i was done and then tried to charge me even though i didnt even touch it.  The last time was a little better but the wait was long and service was extremely slow.  The food is always good though.
Rob R.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",1,62,71,5.0,1/1/2017,I had the bacon cheeseburger and it was spectacular.  Truthfully probably the best burger I have ever had.  I wish there was a Che cake factory where I live.  On second thought maybe not.  This could be addicting.
Janice L.,"Roselle Park, NJ",607,884,123,3.0,2/17/2016,"The food is good as is with any Cheesecake Factory. Came on a week night where there were not many clients.  However, the wait took forever to get a check or to get our food out, which is surprising. This only made us late for our show we had to go to so that was disappointing."
Gabriella M.,"White Plains, NY",0,36,2,2.0,9/17/2017,"I've been here 2 times in 2 months and it seems like the service is the slowest of all cheese cake factories I have been too. Good vibes and friendly employees but god awful service. Be prepared to kill time here, and then everything is fine- if you're coming with the intention to leave under 2 hours, don't."
Deborah B.,"Bronx, NY",7,9,7,4.0,5/26/2016,"Hello People, The place looks so pretty.The food was good. We ordered a lot of food celebrating my graduation. Our waitress was nice! Parking next door was cheap next to whole foods market we only paid $3. We were in the restaurant for like 3 hours. We also left with goodie bags & stop at the dessert store. The cheesecake was OK not the bomb. That being said the food was good y'all! Sum all up 4 people 3 appetizers plus 3 boozy drinks & 1 virgin! $162. Was it worth it every penny Yes."
Gianluca I.,"Larchmont, NY",5,24,3,4.0,2/13/2016,"The Cheesecake factory is a great place to cheat on your diet. Despite the name, they have all kind of american food, so I suggest you starve for a day prior, and then have a complete meal.  Obviously they have great cheesecakes (34 different kinds) so please don't skip dessert. I am in the process of trying them all, and so far the best and most decadent ones are: the Reese's Cheesecake if you love peanut butter, the Oreo's Cheesecake if you are in love with Oreos, the Salted Caramel Cheesecake if you love caramel, the Hershey's Cheesecake if you are crazy for chocolate, the 30th anniversary if you want the right balance of chocolate and cheesecake, and Chris' outrageous Cheesecake if you like coconut.  I guess I'll try more and I'll update my review!!!!"
Matt H.,"Tuckahoe, NY",0,5,,5.0,3/17/2017,Very surprised this location doesn't have a better rating. Been here upwards of 10 times and never had an issue. Once in a while they'll be a wait (like anywhere) but the service and food has always been great and reliable. A+
Joyce C.,"Mount Vernon, NY",0,1,,5.0,5/30/2017,I ordered spicy chicken with cashews. The right amount of spicy. Excellent dish. Banana cheese cake fabulous.
Alison C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,3.0,6/16/2017,Been to cheesecake many times the servers and the food is always great. Only problem I've encountered is being poorly greeted by the Asian host upon arrival. Didn't give a warm welcome and was very rude to me when I asked her where I could pick up my food . Bad first impression!
Aylee N.,"Palmetto, FL",0,3,2,1.0,12/28/2016,"We waited 1 hour & 20 mins for a table when we were told there would be no more than a 30 min wait. When our buzzer rang they had us standing and waiting for our table to be cleaned for another 10 minutes, even though they were well aware that we had my 85 year old, physically disable, grandmother with us. We they waited another 15 mins for water and bread as the tables around us all got served. I was given the wrong meal that had to be taken back, and the waitress barely made an effort, probably because she realized we had a horrible experience before we ever got to her and assumed we wouldn't tip (we still tipped because we're decent people). The manager was nice but didn't try very hard to make it up to us."
Brian S.,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",94,385,264,4.0,1/13/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is really quite good, especially considering it's a nationwide chain. The service is above average, the food menu is unbelievably large, and the portions likewise. We visited this branch several times from Stamford, and have not been let down. Food is served quite quickly (it probably takes longer to decide what to have due to the sheer amount of choice!) and the staff are always walking around if you need help. We even went once on my birthday, and they put a candle in my cheesecake and sang to me! Top class."
Doug C.,"Stamford, CT",44,16,5,1.0,12/26/2016,"After 45 mins at the table, server no where to be found, and with soooooo much attitude floating around, they brought 1 of 2 appetizers, cold. Took another 5 mins to even get a manager. We left, only after being further insulted by the managers, and offered a free piece of cheesecake. Never again."
Frank P.,"Bronx, NY",99,3,1,2.0,6/8/2016,"My wife and I visited this Cheesecake Factory location and we were shown to a table we didn't like very much, it was very dark. We saw another table available near a window and asked the hostess if we could sit there instead. She told us no because that waitress had her hands full, and so we understood that.  The problem is that the very next person the same hostess showed to their seat (less than 5 minutes later) was to the same table she said we could not have. We found this to be disrespectful.  We are not the type to complain but no one had left that area and it happened so quickly after we were told no, it's hard not to take offense.   Our server and food were fine."
Joey B.,"White Plains, NY",8,8,,1.0,12/26/2016,"Service is absolutely horrendous.  1. We were sat at a dirty table. The host had it cleaned, and I noticed that the bill from the last group was still there. I told the host who said said ""dont worry your server will take that"". Wtf? 2. Took forever for server to come. Finally took our orders. App came out quick, drink refill took about 15 minutes. 3. From the time we ordered our food it was over 45 minutes before anyone even said anything to us. Our server was nowhere to be found, so we complained to two other servers. A manager finally came over and apologized, but the food still took over an hour. 4. My wife asked for ketchup as soon as her food came out, the manager who brought our food out never brought it! We had to ask someone else, and we were almost done with our food by the time we got it. 5. Asked to speak to a manager when we asked for the check because something had to be done. Got the check, manager never came.  Will never be back"
Phil S.,"Springfield Township, NJ",19,3,,3.0,3/6/2017,"Took the family here for an afternoon Sunday dinner.  The location was busy.  We were seated in 25 mins.  My wife and I ordered a couple of Bloody Marys, but there was no taste of alcohol in the drinks.  They must've been ""virgin"".  Waiter took awhile to take our order, and food took awhile longer.  The food was good, though, and the portions were large.  Desserts were excellent.  Not my favorite type of restaurant, but it is appealing to the kids."
