Heather R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,,3.0,4/5/2017,"Service is beyond horrible!  My friend and I never received any of our food after waiting 45 minutes!  Not even our salad!  When 20 minutes had gone by after we ordered and no food came, we realized something had to be wrong, so we looked for the server, who was no where to be found.  When we finally saw her, we motioned for her to come over and she asked, ""Is there something you need?"" Apparently, she was unaware that customers sitting at an empty table need food.  We asked her where our food was and she mumbled something and walked away.  After more time passed and still no food, I got up to speak to the manager, who couldn't have cared less that we had been kept waiting for food for over a half hour. He never said he would try to get us our food and never apologized for the unreasonable delay.  We waited several more minutes, but after waiting 45 minutes and never receiving our orders, we left.  We were hungry when we arrived, starving and disappointed when we left, but could not tolerate being treated so poorly.  We had no idea if or when we would ever receive any food.    We have been to the Cheesecake Factory at various locations and never waited very long for the food, especially for the starter salad.  There was obviously some sort of problem, or several problems at this White Plains location.  The manager does not belong in the job and has no idea how to treat or speak to customers or how to run a restaurant properly.  My friend and I both got a weird feeling from the server, who never said hello and never introduced herself.  She never came over to check on our table after we ordered.  She never even noticed that we had never been served any food, and was rude and strange when we stopped her to ask her where our food was.  Clearly, the incompetent, rude manager hires incompetent, rude servers.  This was one of the worst experiences that my friend and I have had in any restaurant. That said, I have eaten in this restaurant on prior occasions, and had found it to be standard Cheesecake Factory food, with large portions and decent food that is a few steps up from diner food."

Mr M.,"White Plains, NY",0,14,2,1.0,2/14/2017,"All I wanted was a 6 inch strawberry cheesecake to go. I understand that getting a full cheesecake is fresh and frozen. But I do not understand is why the server chose not fully prepare the dessert. When she brought the cheesecake over to the counter she ALREADY had the strawberries to go, in a container.  She explained her methods which involved not putting strawberries on the cheesecake because it was frozen.  And I would have to guess that was ALSO the reason why there was no cream on the cheesecake - just plain. Should I have ordered a room temperature strawberry cheesecake? This way it would have been fully prepared?  I would like to add your restaurant was not busy last night - no line and no one waiting.  It took over 25 mins to have a plain cheesecake, no cream and strawberries on the side to be brought to the counter?....? The server explained that this is how she always does it and I find it hard to believe a manager would not know about this.  So I chose to address this matter by giving this review.  I hope to hear from corporate about this."
Daniel G.,"Jersey City, NJ",79,45,10,4.0,1/15/2017,Location brings back memories. Always a good place to hang out with family and friends - the proximity of the restaurant to shopping is very convenient. I typically order the fried mac-n-cheese appetizer with a pasta (change it up from alfredo to scampi). Favorite cheesecake is definitely the dulce de leche!
David S.,"Garfield, NJ",68,113,32,3.0,5/24/2016,"Alright, so it's been a couple of years since I visited a Cheesecake Factory so I thought I would review this chain as my perspective has changed this time around. This will be a review of the chain as well as this location.  Alright, so we got there and they told us it would be a 15 min wait and they would call our name. In the White Plains location, they do not carry those buzzers other locations give to let you know that they are ready to take you in, so you must be on premise for them to call you. I don't even think it took 15 minutes to call us (party of five) so that was good. We were given a choice of indoors vs outdoors and we chose indoors. Outdoors looked nice, as we sat in a booth to a window that faced the outdoor seating area.  The food was pretty good - I got the chicken and shrimp gumbo with brown rice. Our cheesecake selections (banana cream, mango key lime, and original cheesecake) were divine! We ordered the porkchop and that tasted great. We ordered the Jamaican pepper shrimp n chicken and we did like it. We also ordered the salmon and potatoes and we loved it- very buttery. We also ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with a side salad...  And here is where I segway to the cons of our experience. So we ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with the side salad and ended up with a fried chicken sandwich with french fries! Lol I mean we ended up not saying anything about it because we sort of forgot! Luckily the sandwich was tasty and filling! Lol A couple of the utensils were not their cleanest and the pork chop didn't come with a steak knife. You try cutting a two inch thick porkchop with a dull butter knife and let me know how you fare. The bread was not unlimited prior to ordering our entrees like it used to be. They have this CakePay app, but the server does not market it at all! We could have saved our time with the checkout had anyone explained how to use the app.  Finally, we get to the menu. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of things on that menu that taste pretty good but it seems as though about 85-90% of that menu had at least one of the four following items - chicken, shrimp, pasta and spiciness. I didn't notice too much in other kinds of seafood (clams, mussels, lobster, multiple kinds of fish, etc.) nor did I notice much in beef. I ended up having a pretty hard time to make up my mind. If the dinner menu was as diverse as the cheesecake menu, then they would be onto something really grand. But that's just my perspective.  So to wrap things up, Cheesecake Factory is one of the better chains out there in terms of quality of food. However, between the somewhat false perception of variety in their menu coupled with some minor issues experienced in this location, it brings my rating down a bit. I don't think I will return to the chain for a long time unless it's for dessert or if I am really in the mood of a specific dish type that they have."
David L.,"New York, NY",808,1096,1003,1.0,6/8/2015,"I didn't grow up in suburbia, and I wasn't allowed to eat at chain restaurants or even have fast food, so places like this have always held a certain kind of mystique for me. Forbidden fruit: I thought it would be fun and unique to have a birthday celebration here, and, oh boy, boy oh boy, was I sure as hell, heartbreakingly and aggravatingly, wrong.  First, they don't validate parking unless you stay fewer than 60 minutes, so rather than rewarding you for staying longer they actually penalize you for attempting to enjoy yourselves. Second, when we ordered a bottle of Champagne, our waitress plopped it on the table and said ""They didn't open this for me, I don't know how to open it, so you need to."" Third, when we ordered a second bottle of Champagne, she actually plopped it on the table and asked ""Can you show me how to open it?"" which completely interfered with our conversation and meal. Fourth, she brought my friend brown rice when he asked for white rice, and our waitress was nowhere to be found so that we could not even attempt to fix her mistake. Fifth, even though they were multiple reminders that we were here to celebrate a birthday, and although we ordered two desserts, neither of them so much as got a candle in them, let alone the fact that nobody sang Happy Birthday, which was done for two other tables in the restaurant, but for some reason, not for us. Sixth, absolutely no apologies were offered and nothing was given attempting to make up for our horrible and thoughtless service.  Maybe it's just this particular location, but I can't even begin to understand why so many people are excited about The Cheesecake Factory. The food was all blah."
Krystal J.,"Bronx, NY",12,34,8,4.0,11/13/2016,"I came here last Sunday and the food was pretty good. I ordered the steak, mashed potatoes and shrimp. I will say if you like your steak done well (meaning no pink) I would suggest ordering medium no pink the steak was a little on the burnt side however it wasn't bad. The waiter was very helpful and polite. The table seating is very comfortable, your not too close to the next table. Drinks were good as well and lastly the dessert ....... I am a chessecake lover who has sadly never been to the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the red velvet cheesecake to go. Lawddd that was the best cheesecake I have ever ever ever had !please be advised the slices are huge ! I ate off of my slice of cheesecake for 3 days. I highly suggest this restaurant to everyone"
Anita S.,"Bronx, NY",0,3,1,4.0,10/2/2016,"Now I've always came here for some delicious cheesecake but I have never eaten here until now. I ordered the orange chicken with rice and asparagus on the side. I also ordered the pineapple mojito. Now the first this that came to my table was the drink. I didn't really care for the drink one bit, I mean it gave me a little buzz but it tasted like I was slurping pure mint leaves which is a no and you could barely taste the pineapple. The only reason I gave this four stars is because of the orange chicken. It tasted like I took a bite out of heaven. Now I've had orange chicken from little asain spots but it never tasted as good as it did here. The asparagus was alright. I added some salt and pepper and it tasted well."
Angela G.,"White Plains, NY",1,88,11,4.0,5/2/2016,"8pm on a Friday night, our party of 3 was told it would be a 25 minute wait. Actual wait: 18 minutes. There was no room at the bar and no room anywhere to sit, so we were thankful it went quickly.  Our server was excellent. Very attentive and pleasant and her timing with each course was perfect. No wait for drinks and we were even getting items from the bar, which could potentially slow things down.  In addition to their regular menu, which is enormous, they have skinny menu, which also has tons of options. I was actually a little skeptical of what the quality of the food would, since the menu was so large. I ordered the skinny salmon, which came with steamed carrots, string beans and asparagus. Everything was cooked to perfection! The skinny mojito was EXCELLENT! The other people in my party also enjoyed their appetizers and entrees. Portion sizes are large and there were leftovers to bring home.  Desserts are large enough to share and very good. I was happy to see the desserts and coffee come out at the same time.  The food was definitely better than what I expected from a large chain restaurant. This is a great place for really large parties and also VERY kid friendly. I wouldn't advise it for a date night or place to go catch up with a friend, as the noise level is very high."
Gerardo A.,"New York, NY",567,451,1765,4.0,3/31/2014,"#36 First time in a Cheesecake Factory but not the last one. This place have a parking lot, and is on a great location. The wait was a few minutes nothing crazy. Server: was fantastic, fast and always on top of us, very efficient, polite  and ready to server.  Me and my friends share the Fried macaroni and cheese which are macaroni and cheese balls breaded and then deep fried and served with marinara, it taste very good. entree I ordered a Steak Diane Scampi Combo and was so surprised how tasty this was. The chunks of meat were seasoned nicely with the wine sauce and the mashed potatoes were so good that I couldn't help forking small mounds into my mouth, was perfectly cooked and juicy . Scrimp was so big and well done, i just love it. One of my friends order the Crusted Chicken Romano: a Breast of Chicken Coated with a Romano-Parmesan Cheese Crust. Served with Pasta in a Light Tomato Sauce. She like very much and the portion was so big that she had it  for lunch the next day.  And my other friend had the Chicken Marsala & Mushroom: Chicken Breast Sauteed with Fresh Mushrooms in a Rich Marsala Wine Sauce. Served over Bow-Tie Pasta. He was the only one that finish his meal. but the portion was huge."
Kathleen C.,"Chicago, IL",106,1055,46,3.0,5/3/2015,"Admittedly, I hadn't been to the Cheesecake Factory in a long time, but visited twice on a recent visit to New York.  I ate in the bar area both times.  I liked how they have an update to their menu with healthier options - which I ordered from both days.   Service was friendly and efficient, though I did have to wait quite a while for the sandwich I ordered on the first visit.  However, they were very apologetic and I wasn't in a hurry, so it was ok. The food was pretty good, nothing spectacular, but tasty enough.  The atmosphere was quite bustling - it was very busy both nights - I'm not sure why, but every Cheesecake Factory I've ever been in to has always been packed.  I think it's because of the huge menu, efficient and friendly service.   In any case, this was a perfectly good spot to eat dinner while on a trip and I'd go back.  Nothing amazing, but consistent and decently priced."
Alexa P.,"Yonkers, NY",135,97,26,4.0,11/30/2016,"I came here for my 21st birthday in March with my best friends/cousins. My friends ordered the mac & cheese burger with no lettuce, tomato, pickle, etc. I ordered the factory burger and it was good. For dessert, I had the ultimate red velvet cake cheesecake. I love the texture of the cake, especially the white chocolate chunks and the cream cheese frosting. I can't wait to return again soon."
Adele L.,"Delray Beach, FL",10,7,,3.0,7/19/2017,"JUst had a luncheon there, wasn't particularly busy. MY husband's mini pizza arrived cold and he returned it.   Six of us ate and his pizza still wasn't returned so he finally went to look for our waitress who told him, oh we are making you a new one. Half an hour later he was still waiting - so he cancelled his order. They didn't even have the decency to offer him something else or offer a free dessert.   Not impressed with service one bit."
Michelle W.,"Harrison, NY",122,35,1,4.0,12/8/2016,"Ok, so sometimes the service is bad. But overall, love this place. The bread is to die for. I always am pleased with the bartenders and the happy hour :)"
Vera R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,6,,2.0,1/18/2017,The food here is always good. But waiters are not very friendly and the wait along with how crowded it is just is t worth it. There are too many. Enter restaurants in white plains to spend your money at. Oh and totally over priced !!!!
Yasmin B.,"Milford, CT",228,173,137,3.0,8/1/2014,"Standard, expensive chain restaurant. We went for National Cheesecake Day. My appetizer was a quesadilla, which was dry as hell! I was so hongry that I just slathered it in sour cream and salsa and proceeded to eat. Pretty small portion for the price. I get more from Denny's for $2.  For my dinner, I ordered an Asian salad, which was HUGE and covered in unnecessary, dry rice noodles. Side note: I only had a few bites at dinner, because I was saving space for dessert, but today the salad was awful. It was drowneded (for emphasis) in dressing and today I wanted to throw up it was so gross! Soggy, sweet and thoroughly disgusting.  Did I mention the poor drownded toasted sesame seeds?! BLECH!!! My kids had the sliders and the Cuban sandwich. Side bar: their kids menu is 10 and under... Why?!  Everywhere else is 12. Back to my review...Both were excellent!!! I felt cheated. My girlfriend had a chicken with garlic noodles that made me feel cheated squared :'(  The trip was worth it for the cheap cheesecake, but sadly the snickers one was dry as well :'( without the whipped cream I would have been gagging :'(  Our server was terrific! And we had a great time for the money we spent but I don't agree that it's a place I will go often."
Ron P.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",53,303,39,3.0,7/6/2015,"My first experience at a CF was in Boca whenever I went to visit the family. Maybe it was the novelty (this pre-dates this location opening) or maybe the fact I was with the fam, but my memories of the food were better than the visit here. We managed to get seated within 10 minutes, no easy feat at a CF and the table was neat and clean. Service was prompt and efficient and the food arrived without much of a delay. My salad was OK, but for $14 + it should be better than OK. Unless I have some compelling reason to go here, I think I'll pass."
Nick M.,"Fishkill, NY",0,37,11,1.0,6/21/2017,I'm sitting  here as I write this. We haven't been asked for refills on our drinks. Our food literally just came out after waiting almost an hour to point where we asked to speak to manager. We actually had some people in our party leave due to them having plans and not thinking we would be here so long. Idk how this review gets anymore stars. This place sucks. The manager seemed like a dummy. It's 2hrs since we have gotten here. We are ready leave but can't because we are still waiting on to go boxes. This place sucks. I will repeat it over and over.
Mary R.,"New Fairfield, CT",0,39,,3.0,7/11/2017,"3 stars for service only ... food for lunch was horrible really! Veggie burger with NO veggies um I think you forgot something! Watered down iced coffee . Pot stickers were just ok. The place was really dirty too, there was butter on my menu and my friends napkin was dirty, place had a bad smell like a dirty mop..Not coming back sorry ..."
Caity E.,"Yonkers, NY",2,3,2,5.0,12/14/2016,"My office hosted a holiday luncheon at The Cheesecake Factory in White Plains. The lunch couldn't have been more perfect. The GM, Maribel, reached out to me personally the week before the lunch to offer any assistance and was nice enough to make up a set menu for us. Our server, Courtney, was amazing! She was so nice, remembered every small detail, and took great care of us. Courtney and the other server (I did not get his name) were always making sure our drinks were refilled and any requests we had were met. The food was delicious and everyone of course enjoyed the great assortment of cheesecake. The staff went above and beyond for us and I just had to recognize them for their spectacular work! Thank you again!"
