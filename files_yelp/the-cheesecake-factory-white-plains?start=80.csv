Z ..,"Armonk, NY",0,42,1,3.0,7/9/2017,"I don't understand this place. Every time I go here the place is half empty yet there's still always at least a 10 minute wait. I assume it's because they shut down certain sections in the restaurant, which is very annoying. Otherwise the food is decent, fairly priced, with decent service."
J Y.,"Harrison, NY",0,1,,1.0,7/6/2017,"Wao! How different it used be.  Terrible service, long wait even off time and  only 3 to 5%   of tables occupied. (Almost no customer).  It took 30 Min. until served foods. Not only that,  Foods were cold !  not warm nor hot !    Used be very nice and good restaurant but anymore.  Never ever return !"
Susan K.,"New York, NY",43,85,20,3.0,10/17/2016,I normally am obsessed with the cheesecake factory. But this time it was a bit disappointing. This particular cheesecake factory is very loud because it's very overcrowded. I got the Asian salad which was huge and delicious but my husband got the shrimp with steak and the portion was a little small. And of course their cheesecake is to die for.
Priscilla G.,"New Rochelle, NY",16,22,,2.0,8/18/2016,"I recently had the worst restaurant experience of my life at this place. Really poor management. If you go when it's not busy, it's much better, but when they do get busy they don't navigate well the way most popular chains do. I visited recently and we had to send half our entrees back because they were cold (after we waited forever for them...I guess they were ready and no one bothered to bring out?). I barely saw the waitress and had to scream for her attention whenever see needed something. When the runners delivered the food they dropped it on the table and left without clearing the appetizer plates. And my table wasn't the only one with problems. There were actually people waiting in line to complain to the manager. The food, that wasn't cold, was really good (though it's supposed to be, that's why we all go there). We had this avocado toast from their new Super Food section that was quite good, except for the bread being a little soggy. Too bad I'll most likely never have it again since I will never ever visit this place in the future."
Beverly B.,"Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, NY",198,11,3,1.0,2/22/2017,"First, myself and a friend were seated bunch up between two families at a tiny table. We asked for a booth but was told it was for larger parties. Our waiter a larger Caucasian male proceeded to continuously ignore myself and my friend while consistently attending to the Caucasian family next to us. While me and my friend were trying to get his attention he would walk by us and say he's coming but I promise you we only saw him when it was time for our checks and to take our orders. We got better service from the food runners. We also had to WAIT OVER 15 'minutes for some FUCKING WATER. This made me obviously furious but I did not say a word because it was clear who had the power in this situation. Overall, I will tell everyone I know not to attend this establishment if you are person of color because you will not receive fair and equal treatment it seems that Trump being in power has reversed all civil rights laws. Go figure."
Nasha U.,"Hackensack, NJ",97,9,24,5.0,3/5/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is the best. This location is great, the hosts are professional and helpful, and the food is dynamic. I have no complaints."
Misha E.,"Bronx, NY",47,27,73,2.0,4/23/2016,I read the reviews and heard great things about the infamous Cheesecake Factory. I have to say I was underwhelmed. I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were just ok. I also had the passion fruit mojito. It was weak and over priced. The birthday boy had the angel hair pasta with shrimp and loved it. He ordered the reeses cheesecake which was just ok. There were so many kids and babies there I felt like I was at Chuck E Cheeses. The restaurant is very nice but overall it was an extremely underwhelming experience.
Giselle G.,"New York, NY",2,46,21,4.0,4/13/2017,"I wen to this restaurant 30 minutes before it closed, I must say I was honestly shocked with the wonderful service and food we received. When I walked into there was no hostess which was a bit confusing, but then a waiter sat us. When our waitress came her name was Tiffany and she did not rush us. She took her name with our orders and was very nice and helpful with responding to our questions and making suggestions. The food was ok I ordered the Cajun pasta and my friend ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes and as an appetizer we had the avocado toast. Everything tasted very good and fresh, the avocado was soft without being mushy and fresh and the bread was lightly toasted it was perfect. My pasta was good it was a bit spicy and it had a good amount of shrimp and chicken. My friend's food was good I really liked the mashed potatoes they were flavorful and had a great consistency. I would definitely go back."
Sabin C.,"Scarsdale, NY",69,262,273,3.0,1/13/2015,"I'm not a million calorie a day guy so generally I avoid this place. However on 1/1/15 there wasn't much open and the wife wanted to go so I took her...and I was pleasantly surprised by there NEW light menu with low cals and somewhat health oriented dishes. So if i'm arm twisted to go again I will not fight it!  I forgot the guys name but we had great service! I looked at the cake menu at the entrance and saw that some of them were up to 16,000 calories!! Eat healthy my friends..."
Leo B.,"Port Chester, NY",110,45,47,3.0,11/5/2016,"I only came to this place for a slice of cheesecake to go. Although the cheesecake itself was fantastic, the service was subpar. I had to wait about 20 minutes for one slice of the 30th anniversary cheesecake and the server didn't apologize for the unreasonable delay. When I asked about the parking stamp, she said as long as I stayed under an hour, I wouldn't have to pay for parking. However, when I pulled up to the pay booth, I found out that the server actually had to stamp my card... I could have gone back but $3 wasn't worth it in my opinion. I figured it would be better for others to know anyway."
Danielle W.,"Bronx, NY",17,3,9,4.0,5/6/2016,The service was awesome..  we went on a Saturday always busy on a Saturday but service was great and I was with my little family
Tina B.,"New York, NY",1,15,1,2.0,12/27/2016,"Terrible service, the host kept lying about the wait time, ""forgot"" to bring the high chair we requested when making the reservation and after I asked him once seated after an hour wait but it was supposed to be a 30 minute. We told the manager he did nothing and host had the audacity to take a chair from out table. They need to train the hosts and management on customer service."
Romy P.,"Harrison, NY",0,2,,1.0,1/6/2017,"I went wth my boyfriend and our couple friends. We waited 40 minutes for our food. The appetizers and one of the main courses come out at the same time. It then took at least another ten minutes for the rest of the food to come. WE WERE NOT GIVEN BREAD! Even after we asked. I didn't even get my fries, although a waiter insisted they would come out in 20 seconds. It then took another hour to get the check and leave. It was a meal of empty promises and I would not go back."
Eric R.,"High Bridge, Bronx, NY",56,16,,4.0,2/15/2016,"I have been to this restaurant many times before and always had a decent experience.  Recently I went for my Grandmothers birthday with a total of 10 people. We had to wait a while due to Valentines Day but after being seated, while very hungry, our waiter Joseph (tall, dark skinned gentleman) took very good care of us.  My mother is a stickler for customer service so she is hard to please and she had no complaints - .  He took care of us with a lot of bread. All the orders were correct and he split the bill exactly as we needed."
Michael B.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",1,75,42,4.0,4/24/2015,"Went in for lunch.... Busy, which it always seems to be, so we took a high top near the bar.... Ambiance/decor is always nice at cheesecake factory's.....  We started with chicken lettuce wraps, the Asian version... They were very good... The peanut sauce and cashew sauce were both excellent.... My only complaint - the should have been in larger pieces of lettuce.... You couldn't pick one up and eat it easily....  I then had the chicken romano lunch portion.... Excellent.... The portion was good, but I think it was only $4 or $5 less than the dinner portion, which would have yielded leftovers.... Sauce was great, chicken tasty..... I would def get this dish again.... I highly recommend!!!!"
Tina N.,"Bronx, NY",0,90,238,2.0,6/25/2016,When one of the servers spoked a cigg before giving a customer their food while holding it.
Spear S.,"Ossining, NY",0,4,,1.0,3/19/2017,"Waiting for seats for 20mins was ok but to wait 20mins more for someone to take our orders was unacceptable. My sister asked if there is anything on the menu that has fried chicken on it that the waitress can recommend. The waitress recommended a dish and my sister verified with her if it did have fried chicken, and the waitress said yes. She ended up getting sautéed fish on her plate. One of the entrees came first instead of the appetizers. The fried calamari was too salty, and the oil tasted like it's been reused too much it had a burnt taste. We didn't bother ordering dessert anymore. We asked for our bill but ended up getting someone else's bill. Good thing we checked first before paying anything. How can any restaurant experience mess up so much? That would be the last Cheesecake Factory branch that I will ever think of going to. It was a horrible Sunday dinner experience!!! There should be a zero star rating here!"
Sarah A.,"Yonkers, NY",157,51,5,4.0,9/16/2016,The food here is pretty good. The cheesecakes are AMAZING. I've had so many different types. The lighting is sort of dim like mood lighting but its great for conversations with friends and that private feel. I've gone there with large groups for graduations and one on one for dates with friends. I LOVE the avocado egg rolls. THEY ARE AMAZING.
Bob L.,"Stamford, CT",2,28,,4.0,9/14/2016,Typical cheesecake factory. Noisy and kind of dark inside. Tons of birthday celebrations there. Many kids and good for family gathering.
Jenna S.,"Yonkers, NY",424,146,,4.0,11/22/2015,"I am a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. The ambiance in here is very romantic and perfect for dating, girls night out and small family events. The decor is very interesting and beautiful. I love this location because the service is always good - even though you can expect a wait before you are seated.  Every time I come with my boyfriend we order the factory nachos with chicken. It is AMAZING.  The tortilla chips are baked, and the cheese is delicious. Overall, you can't dine here without trying the nachos. Simply delicious. Also, the stuffed mushrooms are good. Small portions with the stuffed mushrooms but they are good.  The shrimp scampi is sooo tasty. The angel hair pasta is delicious and soft. They make the scampi sauce deliciously. I get it every time and have never been disappointed. The burgers are also good. My boyfriend loves them. They are juicy and the fries are crispy.  Of course, the cheesecake is amazing! I love the banana cheesecake and my boyfriend gets the oreo. Very good!"
