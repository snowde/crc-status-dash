Mike H.,"Philadelphia, PA",22,77,53,4.0,10/3/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a place to go when you are throwing all caution to the wind about your diet ... or so I thought! I didn't want an insanely thick dinner+dessert so I opted to pick from their low-calorie menu for dinner, known as the Skinnylicious menu. I'm not going to lie, I really dislike that name - I felt really silly ordering the Skinnylicious shrimp tacos. But I was surprised at the plate when it came out, I was expecting dinky little taco shells with maybe a single shrimp in each to help keep the calories low But I was pleasantly surprised at the portion size.  Generally, the food itself was fine. Nothing bad, just nothing to write home about. The tacos were a little bland. And I've noticed that as well with other meals I've had at various Cheesecake Factory locations too, not necessarily specific to this location. I've never had a bad meal there, I just feel like in a restaurant where most everything is on its A-game, the entrees are just okay.  I got the low carb Cheesecake with strawberries. This more than makes any meal there worth it, and is what keeps us going back. It was unbelievably tasty and rich. My wife got the celebration cheesecake which had some birthday cake baked into it. We of course shared, and both were top notch.  Also, top marks go to our server Lexi. She was great. She handled her job well, but was definitely keeping us laughing and smiling every time she stopped by to check in on us. She should be commended for her great attitude and sense of humor. Whenever we go back, we will hope to be served by her every time we go.  A fun little observation: some of the decor in there reminds me of the Eye Of Sauron from the Lord Of The Rings movies. I always enjoy that each time I go."
Lisa M.,"Philadelphia, PA",61,7,1,1.0,12/12/2017,"Before I write this review, I just wanted to say that I tried to address this matter over the Cheesecake factory website but they never responded or addressed a major concern I had over my experience. I went to the Cheesecake factory on Tuesday, December 5th around 7pm. Even though it was busy, we were promptly seated at a table, no complaints there. We ordered the appetizer and it was pretty delicious (chicken samosas). Service was very slow and eventually my entree (fish and chips) finally came out. It tasted pretty good but in one of the bites I took of the battered fish, I thought I had a ""bone"" in my mouth. It was very hard and impossible to chew, and upon removing the ""bone"" from my mouth I actually saw that it was a shiny piece of metal *drum roll here*.. A STAPLE. That is right, somehow a staple ended up in my fish. I promptly told the waitress that I wouldn't be eating this any further because of my concern that possibly another staple could be in my food. I really wish I was making up this story because literally my whole night was ruined. The waitress took it away and said that my meal and any dessert I chose would be on the house. She also offered me another meal, however I declined. She said it could have been a piece of metal from the frying bin? LIKE WHY IS THE FRYING BIN FALLING APART? HOW IS THAT OK? SO there we have it, my awful experience at the Cheesecake factory. If you go, be careful and weary.  This definitely raised a huge red flag for me. I don't like to question the integrity and safety of my food so I most likely won't be returning to any of the locations.   On a side note, I had a friend that was served glass in his water at another location.  Cheers."
Elliot P.,"Philadelphia, PA",182,232,6,2.0,9/18/2017,"TCF is usually my favorite chain restaurant. But my recent experience at TCF Willow Grove was a bit...lacking. The wait wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I think their whole refusal to take reservations is a bit ridiculous, mostly because it really inhibits the ability to plan a nice evening out. Anyway, it was a bit dirty inside. We had to request the table to be wiped down. There was an odd stale smell in the air too.  Usually the bread just comes, but we were asked if we wanted it - which I thought was odd. I'm used to it just being there. We order a couple of appetizers and our meals. Then I ordered an apple cider. I got an apple juice and i was like hey I wanted a cider and our waiter was like ok that's what we call our apple juice. Nice try. Is this my first time ordering an apple cider? Am I an 8 year old? We eat the rest of the meal. It was delicious. The kitchen never disappoints. My MIL (who has quite discerning taste) was impressed.  Then the bill came and the apple juice was on it. Note it was called ""juice"" on the bill not ""cider"". Oh and speaking of the bill, they put misleading tip percentages on the bill. They are supposed to base the tip on the pre-tax amount, but they base it on the post tax amount. Shady. They took off the juice and claimed it was an accident that it was still on it in the first place. Shady. I had the celebration cheesecake. I wouldn't get it again. Should have went with the 30th anniversary one instead. Oh and they need to bring back the Navajo and the apple pie cheescake."
MarkAnd S.,"Northeast Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA",136,14,36,4.0,1/8/2018,Cheese cake was really good! They have a wide variety of options and they have a skinny licious menu as well. I love the buffalo blasts and almost any dessert! I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
Tariq P.,"Philadelphia, PA",6,20,4,1.0,1/8/2018,So came to the Philly location a few weeks back. found hair fried into the calamari. The rice in my food and my friends food was old and or undercooked. Was sick for two days and they send me 50$? How about you try and pay for the whole meal not a portion? Cheap asses...  No respect for the food they serve their customers...
Ashley Y.,"Bensalem, PA",28,85,183,4.0,11/16/2017,Came for a birthday brunch for my dad. We all had their lunch specials. The lunch specials are until 5pm everyday which is awesome. You get to save a couple bucks from their regular prices. The portion of the food are the same as regular price. Food was amazing and they had good service.
Johnny L.,"Marietta, GA",71,70,137,4.0,9/26/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been a great family restaurant and I haven't really ever had a bad experience at this chain. So most Cheesecake Factory restaurants all have pretty much the same decor and the menu is pretty standard. So my wife and I decided to come in this past weekend and as usual the service and food was excellent. We ended up ordering off the skinny menu for my wife and I are both trying to watch what we eat and ended up getting the filet steak and the chicken pasta which were both great and shared the artichoke crab dip which I must say was good but a lot smaller than I remembered. Anyhow we also ended up getting the Godiva chocolate brownie sundae which was great as well. Overall this location is usually packed, however it's service and food is the classic Cheesecake Factory signature service and quality. I had no complaints and look forward to coming back."
Kaitlyn W.,"Perkasie, PA",52,49,82,4.0,8/22/2017,"I've only been to TCF twice in all my life, the first time was at the KOP location and the second time was at the Willow Grove location.  The hostess was friendly but seemed confused and disorganized. We were sat within ten minutes of arriving. Our server was polite, funny, patient, and knew his stuff. Our drinks were always filled and our appetizers and main course arrived in a timely manner.  The food was average, very large quantity - enough for lunch, dinner, and tomorrow's lunch, but not high quality for the price."
Joe A.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,,1.0,1/7/2018,"Ok, Been here many times before. Must of ordered the HIbatchi Steak a dozen times. Usually pretty awesome. This time was Terrible. First of all it was missing the sauce that it usually comes with which I believe makes the whole dish. Second the meat was t uff and didn't have any flavor to it. The dish was over loaded with to many Onions. Needless to say we were very disappointed."
Stephanie V.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/29/2017,"The Super Antioxidant salad is anything but super. I didn't get a single leaf of spinach, not one blueberry, and almonds were no where to be found. I did find a stray pear or grape here and there, but this salad (prepared at the Willow Grove location) was mostly a pile of ""salad greens"".  Oh wait. And one tiny morsel of broccoli. It's a good thing I paid with a gift card..."
Bob H.,"Byberry, Philadelphia, PA",50,446,527,1.0,4/13/2017,"Absolutely terrible tonight! We arrived around 4:30 after doing some shopping. We waited about 10-15 minutes which isn't bad for this place. It tends to get very crowded. We were sat just outside the main restaurant. When we being sat the table was still dirty from the previous guests. It was also very loud and very cold in that section. We ordered drinks and dinner at the same time. We waited a bit for the server to greet us. This was by far the worst service we've had in a long time. The girl didn't tell us her name, she was very flat and unenthusiastic to say the least. Our daughter ordered an orange juice, literally took 25 minutes to get it. We had to ask twice, we were told it's fresh squeezed so it takes a while. We had TJ ask for bread, didn't receive lemons in water or tea (we did ask). Worst of all was the wait time for food. With no exaggeration it took an hour for our food. Tables that were sat after us were eating before us. I understand a restaurant can get busy and things happen. The main issue is the server made no attempt to inform us as to what was going on. She was honestly one of the worst servers we've ever had. She didn't seem to care a bit. The manager did bring our food out personally and apologized. She then came over again after the meal and asked how everything was. The food was good but there is no reason for 2 entrees to take an hour. She offered us free dessert and we declined. She then took of one of our meals. It was a nice gesture but it was too late. We left very unhappy. Not sure if we will return. 1 star"
Aubrey F.,"Baltimore, MD",28,188,220,1.0,10/3/2017,"Ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which is what I usually get. It is a little spicy but this time it was so spicy I had to send it back. I then ordered the Margherita Pizza and this came out way overdone. Luckily they did not charge us for either. Poor service and quality of food."
Sari Marissa G.,"Philadelphia, PA",1623,944,7715,4.0,9/21/2016,"3.5 stars Chain restaurants are my least favorite places to dine. This particular chain however does offer a lot of variety so for that, I like it. The menu, as many of you know is absolutely huge and extensive. There is something for everyone... the health-conscious and the ones who want to splurge on big giant piece of nine dollar cheesecake alike. There are also gluten-free and dairy free items clearly marked. I do love Ana greatly appreciate that all menu items are listed with their calorie content and have been way before it was trendy. I also like the option to get a lunch sized portion of any of their dinner entrees.  I've been to three different locations, center city, KOP and this one. This location is OK. They all pretty much look the same with that somewhat Tuscan decor and all locations are pretty large. I have personally never had to wait here, but I usually come during the day, during the week.  This spot makes for a good stop mid shopping spree and I think that the area and the mall alike needed something like. This Cheesecake Factory is a good option if you're looking for a sit-down meal rather than takeout from the food court while here at Willow Grove. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but for a mall day, it's a good option.  I've never had a bad meal here. My go to lately is the vegan Cobb. It's huge and tasty. It can easily be made into two meals or split amongst the entire table. Try it! Crispy and crunchy! Prices are fair, portions are hearty and service here has been pretty good each time we have visited. If you're starving fear not, they start you with delicious warm bread and creamy house butter right away!  Be a good wife and grab a slice of decadent, rich cheesecake for hubs so he won't mind how much you spent that day :)"
Dawn B.,"Warminster, PA",1,35,5,1.0,12/10/2017,Delicious filet mignon  one problem they make these unbelievable glazed carrots with Pecans and then they get rid of them and they're the best thing on the menu and every time we come in we ask the waitresses yes no problem and then the chef gives her a problem and he yells at her they need to just bring it back on The menu I get rid of stuff that actually the people like how hard is it to make They make you wait for a drink for ever.  Not happy
Ivy A.,"Philadelphia, PA",157,24,13,3.0,11/19/2017,The food was amazing but the service was average. Wish they could have given us better service but overall a good experience. I wouldnt go back on a weekend.
Kimberly H.,"Morrisville, PA",0,10,,1.0,1/1/2018,Awful. Waiter was horrible and slow. We had the onion soup and it came out cold not to mention there was a hair in mine. Bad experience in general. The floor was filthy as well. Not at all what I expected. Don't waste your time or money.
Lindsey D.,"Enfield, CT",272,45,9,3.0,11/24/2017,Always great service and extensive menu. Menu is labeled if an item has gluten in it. I love their Cobb salad! Very accommodating of my gluten allergy but they do not have gluten free bread but serve regular bread on the table before food comes - this has happened to me about 3 times now. This is frustrating for someone who has a gluten allergy!
Maria L.,"Ambler, PA",4,17,13,4.0,11/20/2017,"We went to this restaurant on a Friday night. Of course busy. We waited for about an hour before we were seated.  We met our waitress and she introduced herself. We ordered our appetizers , food and drinks at that time we were starving.  Our buffalo blast did not arrive until about an 1 hr.    And when they did arrive - the waitress immediately  came over to apologize.  She said she spoke with her manager and mentioned that we waited a long time for our appetizers. She came and sat beside me which i did appreciate. Since we waited so long, the manager said we could take the appetizers off the bill or 2 cheese cake desserts.   We chose the desserts. Our dinner did arrived shortly after.  Presentation of our food was good and the food tasted delicious.  I did order a margarita. The taste was good but sadly the glass was small and with the ice- there was not much to drink.  Once we were done - we asked for the check- and our waitress said ther the buffalo blast were taken off the bill.   It was a win win for us. Thank you cheese cake factory for being aware of your customers  I will cont to go to this restaurant.  I gave it 4 stars- we waited 1 hr  before being seated and 1 hr for our appetizers."
Ilan F.,"New York, NY",0,261,134,5.0,9/30/2017,I like the Cheesecake Factory because it has a selection of main courses and desserts.
Agnes A.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,86,47,3.0,11/10/2017,The best thing to mark this place is the variety.  Had the Ahi tuna plate.  Tasty. My husband had the meatloaf. Ordinary was the way he described it.
Kelly T.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",228,122,163,5.0,9/10/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory in specific is my go-to whenever I have no idea what I want to eat because this place has everything! It has yet to fail me.  My favorite is the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Amazing! The portions are huge, but I still finish it. I usually don't have room for cheesecake, but... I get it anyways. There's always room for dessert because dessert doesn't go to the stomach, it goes to the heart."
Ayana M.,"Oreland, PA",0,9,,1.0,12/28/2017,"I had the worst experience here. The server was great, but my order came out completely wrong. The manager Jennifer was very rude, gave me an attitude and acted like it was my fault. Will never dine here again. Especially with the current manager on staff."
April H.,"Warrington, PA",33,112,580,3.0,7/22/2016,"The decor is fun, the place is large (and loud), and the food is decent for a chain restaurant. I do not like how they pack you in like sardines at the 2 and 4 top tables. The menu is huge and somewhat overwhelming. There is a separate ""skinnylicious"" menu if you are looking for the healthier options.  There are some fabulous looking salads and, of course, an insane dessert selection, but I opted for the grilled fish tacos this time. The corn tortillas were nicely grilled and filled with slaw, grilled fish, pico de gallo and fresh avocado. The dish was accompanied by lime cilantro rice and black beans. The rice and beans were both tasty, but the rice was a bit greasy. My daughter got a chicken Caesar salad and shrimp scampi minus tomatoes. The salad was good. The dressing is garlicky but not bad for bottled Caesar. The shrimp in the scampi dish was breaded and the sauce creamy, which are atypical of traditional scampi. It was also very garlicky. Portions are huge!! I liked that the server asked if there were any food allergies (apparently they change gloves if so). I also enjoyed watching the screen with all the photos of the dishes, so I could narrow it down for next time :)"
Tee G.,"Philadelphia, PA",18,64,1,4.0,11/2/2017,"Our party of 15 arrived at this location and were seated within an hour. Our server Rebecca was amazing. She was prompt, courteous and polite. We had drinks refilled and everyone's order met expectations. We celebrated my husband's 35th Birthday, and the other servers came out and sang to him and comped his Snickers Cheesecake. The proverbial icing on the cake (no pun intended) was that Rebecca actually let us split the check. My husband I were there with 6 other couples and a single person. each married couple had their own check. Don't ask how she did it...but she did! Amazing! We'll be back."
Theresa A.,"Philadelphia, PA",36,22,20,5.0,3/19/2017,"My family I went to the Willow Grove location for brunch and arrived a little after opening. We had a vety attentive waiter, Lexi (I believe her full name on the receipt was Alexis). Lexi was very attentive and accommodating to my mother who's English isn't that great and can want things last minute. She was always at our table with a smile on her face. The food was great. I ordered the Macaroni and Cheese burger. My mom ordered the Steak Diane, and my brother ordered the fish tacos. We always underestimate the portion size of the food. You will never leave this place hungry even if you just order a regular entrée. We had a wonderful time and Lexi definitely made it special."
Dar B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,16,32,2.0,4/15/2017,"EDIT: took a star off after our last experience. Saturday is understandingly busy but tonight was outrageous. The people who run this location need more training. My date and I were escorted to a table that was already full of people and we just stood there like deer in headlights.. went back to the hostess desk and no one knew what was going on or what table was actually clear or not. Eventually they found a table for us. But that's where hell began. Why would anyone seat a quiet couple shoved in a corner next to the most obnoxious group of college freshmen laughing screaming the entire time...   can't speak for the food because I packed it to go to finish it at home in peace and quiet. And then lost my appetite all together... awful experience. No apology from the server.  I have ""Duchess"" status at this particular location so I've been here MANY times and for the most part the food is excellent. Tonight's experience This time we were seated in the area outside the restaurant, and I don't mean the outdoor seating. But the tables that line the entrance to the mall. Yes, we were seated by the mall doors. To say this was insulting does not even begin to describe it. If I wanted to sit in a food court while listen to screaming children and other people running out of the mall shaking the ground I would have went there to eat. Instead I came to the Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night for a restaurant experience. There is no music in this section, and the servers even seem to forget there are people that need to be waited on out here."
Mone W.,"Warminster, PA",5,73,55,4.0,2/28/2017,"Went for a quick early dinner with my husband and our son. Waitress was nice and attentive. Space was very clean and well kept. We ordered drinks.. my husbands orange crush was delicious.. my blood orange frozen margarita was more like an orange slushy.. a waste if $13.00. Our buffalo blast app were delicious and very filling despite a few burnt pieces which we were given a piece a cheesecake for the trouble.. once our entrees came we were stuff but I took a couple bites of my crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp. It was great, and the same price as my drink .  Very huge portion!. My husband 4 cheese pasta was pretty mediocre but edible. Overall, our food was cooked properly and we were treated well!"
Linda F.,"Philadelphia, PA",75,51,4,4.0,8/13/2017,"Food is great. They're usually really busy so service can be a little slow, but the staff is always friendly. I had the romano crusted chicken for dinner and it was amazing. My bf had the orange chicken and he loved it. Our servings were huge so we ended up taking our meals home. Our apps, fried mac and cheese balls and fried mozzarella were delicious. Of course we each got a slice of cheesecake. I had the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake and my bf had the lemon raspberry cheesecake. Both were so good. Prices can be a little high but it's worth it."
Michelle S.,"Willow Grove, PA",9,18,4,1.0,6/19/2017,Go to another location . I had a bug in my cheesecake and when I called to complain the Manager Lakeisha I think she said her  name was had a cavalier attitude about it.
Belynda H.,"Yamato, Japan",94,162,761,4.0,11/28/2015,"CF is always the same to me. There has never been a time that I went and disliked anything. The ambiance is always nice and the smell is pleasant. I ordered the Jamaican black pepper shrimp. I at every single bit the flavor was amazing. I did not like the black beans so much but the shrimp,chicken and that tasty mango salsa  all disappeared lol.  The Georgia peach is my favorite drink there. It's a pretty fruity frozen drink. Very tasty if I must say so myself.  I've been to the Cheesecake Factory on many occasions and I think I've actually had a cheesecake twice. They are good and really big. Two people could share one. There are so many to choose from.  Takeaways: the wait for a table is always super long. The bar area is open seating but it is usually always full but you can order the full menu there. The menu is way to long. It such a large variety of food and the menu is about 10 pages it sometimes takes me a while to order.  In my opinion the wait is worth it and the large menu gives you different things to try each time. So check it out."
Justin C.,"Philadelphia, PA",12,131,53,5.0,11/29/2016,Very nice clean location next to the mall. So you can walk off that whole cheesecake you just devoured.  The grilled chicken items are great too.
Bill D.,"Norristown, PA",2,15,,1.0,6/1/2017,"My date and I recently (5/30/17)  ate at this restaurant. We both were fans of there Shepherd's Pie - were, being the operative word. This meal was floating in grease/fat and very salty. It was a huge disappointment. Now for the service! It was equally as disappointing. Our waitress was rude - tossing dishes on the table and not once did she come back to our table, during the course of the meal to check on us. When she brought our bill she never asked if we were satisfied or enjoyed our food.  No return trips for us!!!"
Jay P.,"Hatfield, PA",0,10,,3.0,8/16/2017,"Went there for a b'day with family. Garlic bread, omlette, avocado toast was pretty good. Also, margarita and pina colada were above average. But the dessert let us down big time.  Mango key lime cheescake & lemon raspberry cheescake were disaster. It seemed they were in freeze for a months and it tasted sour. The service was pretty good."
Emo G.,"Elkins Park, PA",0,2,,2.0,8/8/2017,The hostess at the podium thought is was a good idea to remove her shoe and pick her foot right on the podium BEFORE she arranged for out table.  She was blonde and this was on Monday. I couldn't keep my mind on the food after that.  I think it was OK.  The server was OK. You guys need some staff meetings about conduct in front of public.  WE SEE
Elena F.,"MELROSE, PA",28,29,7,5.0,2/4/2017,"Nice people, great food. Highly recommended ahi tartar, really exceptional.  Actually everything what we've tried there was excellent. We are used to go to TGI Friday at the same mall, but now only here. This is the best place in Willow Grove mall."
Pourio L.,"Palo Alto, CA",29,527,37,2.0,3/11/2016,"Ok, I've never really been a fan of Cheesecake Factory (food is too salty while at the same time too bland, too greasy, etc.) and yet their cheesecake is not bad. Not amazing, but not bad either. Service is just ok. If you're looking to come here, you're either in high school looking for a nicer atmosphered place to take your date other than your local McD's or a family that wants to take their high school kids to someplace ""nice"" and keep the bill smaller based on how much they eat because the food servings here are healthy at best. I came here since my cousin (who's in high school) begged me to take him here so that he could try it out. I warned him about getting diarrhea and the food quality but he still wanted to go. After $50 (I didn't eat anything) and not finishing the food I paid for, he got diarrhea on the way home. Served him right for not listening to me. So, in short, unless your stomach is made out of steel, your taste buds are numb to salt and your heart can take an extra hard beating of fat, then by all means, come here. Otherwise, you might want to spend that money on something healthier or homemade. Parking: Large shared lot with mall Wait: Best to make reservations even though I don't know why people come here Price: $20+ per person"
Pretty S.,"Detroit, MI",3,55,104,3.0,4/23/2017,I went here with some friends after an assembly and was very disappointed in how the portion sizes changed. I usually have enough food to take home but this time the portions were so small you could finish them in one setting. I got the shrimp scampi and it was about $20 so for that price to not have left overs I was really disappointed. I hope this is not the norm for all the cf. my friends first reaction was similar. The food was good but just know you will be paying more for less food.
Liz H.,"North Wales, PA",7,87,103,2.0,8/18/2016,"I dont know how this place is always packed even on weekdays because every time I visit here, everything is below avg. This time we were there 8pm on Tuesday but still had to wait 30minutes. We finally got seated and server came after about 5 minutes. She gave us pre meal bread and took our drink order. After two minute or so, she came back with no drinks asking if we were ready to order. We were ready since we waited for so long. She took the order, didn't repeat back which caused her to make mistake. She forgot one of our two appetizer and when we asked her, she said ""oh i checked and it wasn't in. I don't know if i didn't hear you say it or if you forgot to say it. Sorry. You guys want it now?""  It sounded like she was blaming us for not ordering it and we weren't unhappy because the food already took long time to come out and wasn't tasty.  I don't know why I keep go back to this place when I can get better pasta and service at other places."
Gina Z.,"Willow Grove, PA",6,21,2,1.0,8/1/2017,"I do like the food here ...but one star because of poor management / service. I went yesterday for the National cheesecake day  ""1/2 price sale"". What a mess! The cheesecake is costly at $9.00 a slice so to get it at $4.50 ( closer to an average price ...is great) I went late around 9 pm thinking the line would be over- no luck. The cashier rang me up in about 15 minutes- I thought ok 15-20 min is about how long I thought it would take- WRONG! I was there 50 min in total. There is no reason for this. They KNEW they are having a sale and should have been ready, How hard is it to cut a piece of cake and put it in a bag? I've worked customer service and this could have been avoided- there was ONE cashier and several other workers and still they took close to an hour to serve a piece of cake? Why didn't they prep the job? 1 day before the sale- you cut up several of each kind of cheesecake put it in plastic ""to go containers "" and put them back in a circle with the flavor tag and store them in the case behind the cashier which has tons of room. You have the managers and hourly employees come in early the two days in a row to get the cakes set up- and stay late if needed and you assign a person or two to just cut and pack  on those 2 days. On top of it all the manager? behind the counter who was reading the slips and packing did not seem to follow the correct order as people after me left before me with their food WTH?! A simple way to keep order would be to number the slips 1-20 in a black sharpie when 20 is gone start again at one. They ran out of some flavors and I can understand that. But this was just so unorganized. There is no reason to wait 50 min for 2 slices of cheesecake. I could give them a ton of ways this could have been done correctly oh and it looked like there were lots of servers waiting to also get cake for the dine in customers. Are you telling me your servers can't just put a slice of cake on a plate and go--- Good Grief! Also the music was so loud it was hard to hear the names and dishes were clanging all over the place. It's a shame as I enjoy the food but figured it was too long to wait for a table and service and thought a late night treat would be fun. However I could have worked an hour overtime and paid for a whole meal with the time I wasted waiting for a take out piece of cake :( I see a lot of unhappy reviews on  here."
Marc E.,"Philadelphia, PA",70,34,8,3.0,9/24/2016,"It's been a few years since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory, and I'm very disappointed.  The portions shrunk in size -- I had a fettuccine alfredo, and my local pizza place makes a bigger and better tasting version.  We were seated quickly, and initially service was great, but as I write this, we've been waiting on dessert for at least ten minutes. They're fast on the free refills."
