Laura A.,"Jamison, PA",2,31,5,1.0,10/28/2012,"I would think based on their menu and the wait time that this place would have really great food but neither my boyfriend or I enjoyed our meals. The service was not good at all but our appetizer, the fried macaroni and cheese was awesome."
Jesse B.,"Corona, CA",58,146,166,2.0,9/1/2012,"I use to love the cheesecake factory years ago. Went to this particular franchise and it was not the best experience. Our appetizer was undercooked, the presentation of our main courses was sloppy and for what we actually ordered, the pricing was pretty high. I basically decided to never go back. Not worth the cash...."
Beth K.,"Aurora, MO",3,19,,2.0,11/24/2011,"This is likely more about Cheesecake Factory in general than about the one at Willow Grove Mall, but I was not impressed. Food was way too fancy and overpriced, and I wanted actual cheesecake which was not to be had.  There was Turtle Cheesecake and Red Velvet Cheesecake and this and that...and what I wanted was Cheesecake, just good old (New York Style?) Cheesecake without the bells and whistles.   Way too loud and way too dark, as well."
J C.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,25,,5.0,1/5/2013,"Love this place!  The service, the food, everything.  We tend to sit at the bar - the bartenders are amazing! Favorites - Sunrise Burrito, Factory Burrito, Sweet Potato Fries, Santa Fe Salad"
Small Town G.,"Raleigh, NC",11,79,1,1.0,10/12/2011,"Ordered four dishes- all were overpriced. .The herb crusted salmon was a little too mild for me. The shrimp was overcooked in the Jambalaya pasta as was the chicken. The Thai pasta was very good.  Louisiana pasta was lacking ingredients I had in the dish at other restaurants- which primarily sausage- it just had chicken.  We waited for more than an hour to get seated. A ""one and done"" establishment for me."
J E.,"San Diego, CA",2,31,,3.0,8/19/2012,"This place was amazing until the last time I went. Before, the waitresses were nice, and every dish I had in the evening was good (the thai pasta, the bang bang chicken and shrimp, the orange chicken, etc). However, the last time I was there was for lunch and the waitress was NOT friendly. barely made any eye contact. Would ask us if we wanted more stuff and then never brought them out. If it were up to me, I wouldn't have tipped her, but the people I was with were just too nice. The food they ordered was tasteless, and mine didn't taste as good as the first time I had it. Definitely not coming back if they're this inconsistent, I'd expect more from a place that charges $17 a meal..."
Gina J.,"Washington, DC",4,15,,2.0,8/12/2012,"Went for dinner, and since it is a chain, felt I would have a nice dinner with my friends.  This location was way too loud, from music to the diners yelling over it to talk. Then add the ""wandering whispering waiters"" and our dinner was not fun at all. The waiter came, we had to ask him to repeat several times (and no, we are not in need of hearing aides, yet); and then worried if he understood what we wanted. The food was good. It usually is. We said no to dessert, no prolonging this meal and skedaddled quickly.  Sad, as we have enjoyed great meals at other locations. Doubt we will be back..."
Mira V.,"King of Prussia, PA",7,27,,4.0,4/14/2010,"I always thought Cheesecake Factory was overrated, and I still do..but oh my GOD do they have a lot of food!!  I never saw a menu that came in a book of 10 pages+.   The selections are definately not for picky eatters.  I'd advise to go there if you truely want to try something different, are adventurous, or you just like & appreciate food in general.  They have tons of things from different pastas, to seafoods, burgers, steaks, low-cal food, ""small dishes"" (which are still fairly moderate sized)...Each section has it's own page or two. I can see where the pricey-ness of the food comes in.  They have decent to large sized portions and the presentation of the food is quite nice.  It's not just thrown on the plate like your food would be at an average family restaurant.  Unfortunately, I only voted 4 stars BECAUSE it's pricey, but don't rule that out as your only reason for not going.  If you got extra money to spend & want to try a new dining experience, go to Cheesecake Factory.  I think you'll be surprised with the food & the service. :)  Speaking of service, there were really REALLY nice people working there from the ushers to the waiters/waitresses.  The food & drinks were served in a timely matter, and the entire atmosphere of the place ..well it was good!  It felt open and didn't feel pinched in with the people at the next table. (FYI - I went to the one in WIllow Grove Park Mall) Oh!  And if you end up disliking the food, that's fine, but NEVER say the cheesecake is aweful!!  It's awesome!!!! Oh, also for the people that are talking about long wait times.  I don't know what the hell time of day they went, but my family & I got seated right away 'cause we went during the lunch hours (around 3pm approx.)"
Amy R.,"Langhorne, PA",14,46,15,1.0,3/22/2009,"Funny... I have yet to get to the ""cheesecake"". I went to the Cheesecake Factory today for brunch/lunch. The first thing that turned me off was the dirty knife at the table which had dried on spinach on it (or something green). While I must say the menu options are almost endless, that would only be impressive if the food was good. I ordered one of my favorite brunch items, Eggs Benedict. There is only one word to describe this... YUK!!!! The hollandaise sauce was so lemony that the ""tang"" of the sour sauce actually turned my stomach. The potatoes served with the eggs was a brown mush. I think there were supposed to be like hash browns, but the consistancy was more like mashed potatoes. To top it off, nothing on my plate was hot.  My boyfriend ordered a ""built your own omelette"" which did not come with the ingredients he requested. His meal also was room temperature. What a disappointment!!! While it is hard to find good restaurants to have brunch at, I guess I will have to keep looking."
Kendall R.,"Philadelphia, PA",22,39,2,2.0,3/11/2009,"My friends would probably disown me for only giving TCF 2 stars.  This tends to be our destination for birthday and celebratory dinners when the group of us is 10+ and includes people who aren't legal drinking age.   It's probably because every one likes cheesecake.   It is NOT because: You get sat right away.  (you don't.  ever.  expect to wait, it's unavoidable.) Their drinks are cheap.  (they're not, but it's to be expected at a chain.) The service is great. (i've only had one okay server here.) Everything on the menu is good.  (some things are delicious, but the ""hit"" percentage is really low when you take into account all of the items on their menu.) Seating is comfortable. (seating sucks.  especially for big groups.  the whole booth side/chair side thing really sucks.  especially because no one has been able to master the whole ""equal height"" thing with chairs and booths yet in the restaurant industry.) i don't hate it here, i just wouldn't choose it for myself.  i still go every time my friends do.  if you go and dare to get anything OTHER than cheesecake, i highly recommend the carrot cake.  it's probably the best thing i've had off of their menu. they don't do reservations or call ahead.  if you're planning on eating with a group of 6 or more, it's usually best to get one loser--er, volunteer--to head over at least an hour early to put your name in."
Mike W.,"Longs, SC",0,48,,3.0,9/6/2012,Went here for the first time and was very pleased. The staff was friendly and worked very hard at giving us great service. The food was very good and the deserts were wonderful. we will return again when we are in the area.
Raymond P.,"Philadelphia, PA",25,10,,4.0,3/12/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory seems to have a very... tough audience here.  The fact that there is a long wait to get seated shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that has ever seen one and so, to me, is something you accept when going there.  While I have been seated quickly once or twice, it's generally a half-hour to forty-five minute wait to be seated.  Given the selection they have it ends up being well worth the wait to me. The Cheesecake Factory is more like an upscale diner in my opinion.  Their menu is as varied as a diner and the atmosphere can be very entertaining and noisy.  The differences though come when you actually get your food.  Huge portions that have never failed to satisfy me along with a price point that won't kill your wallet.  I can safely recommend around two dozen items on the menu but, I would say the best things I've had on there are the Chicken and Biscuits along with the Double BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger.  If you're a nut that loves to indulge when it comes to eating out, grab one of those two entrées! I don't think there is a need to talk about the cheesecake here.  While I'm a fan of their cheesecakes (the Adams Peanut Butter especially), they sometimes overdo it with alternate flavors and, to be quite honest, their plain cheesecake can't top a regular slice of New York Style... and that's how you judge a cheesecake.  I find that Cheesecake Factory's plain cheesecake is a little too creamy and it doesn't have enough solidity to it. I'm a big foodie and I'm always looking for places with great food, and the reviews here make me feel kind of main stream by giving this place a 4/5... but whatever   I'm not big into standard chain restaurants such as Olive Garden, Fridays or Applebee's, but this place gets my vote.   The wait?  Get over it, you expected it!  The food?  Better then you're giving it credit for!  The atmosphere?  It's loud but its fun!  Yes, I truly love this place!"
Deana T.,"Warrington, PA",5,9,,5.0,8/5/2012,I love this place. The the service is always good and anything I've ever ordered was really good. I'm very picky about where I eat.  I'm not big on chain restaurants but love this place
Carlucci F.,"Philadelphia, PA",8,16,1,3.0,1/25/2009,"A 90-minute wait on a Saturday night. They give you a plastic device that vibrates when your table is ready. Luckily, or unfortunately, the joint is attached to the mall, allowing you to wander to Sbarro's for a quick slice to hold you over on your wait. Or, you could go to Circuit City and check out some liquidation sales. The choice is yours. We went to Ruby Tuesday's for some drinks.  The lobby outside of the Cheesecake Factory is kind've like the airport when there's a delayed flight. Bodies lying on the ground and looking around in despair, just hoping their plastic stick vibrates soon.  Once we got our table, you are treated promptly with an excitable waitstaff. We had Kevin, or Dan, or Jimmy -- I forget his name. Helluva waiter though, especially since he had to deal with my lame jokes. I can't recall the decor there, other than the lavish glass light fixtures. It's quite dark in there, but the waitstaff are all dressed in white like ghosts.  There is a miniscule bar, and if you're fortunate enough to get a spot you can chill out and watch sports in HD.  The bathrooms are delightful. Definitely try it out. They serve butter with your bread. I prefer oil, but sometimes you just have to take one for the team. I got the Thai Chicken Pasta, and even though it's not a Thai restaurant, it was surprisingly averagely decent.  The service is fast and the entrees arrive all at the same time and extremely hot. The portions are quite large. You may be walking around with a dainty doggy-bag aftewards, so be forewarned.  Loads of Cheesecake options for dessert. If you like a Snicker's bar crumpled up into a cheesecake, they got it. Oreos? No problem...Huge thick-ass slices. Long story short, if you have 3 hours to kill and like to amble about the mall aimlessly in doubt as to whether you'll actually get your table, then this is the place for you. If you want a quick bite to eat, I suggest the Food Court."
Emerson T.,"Jenkintown, PA",0,6,,5.0,10/10/2012,"This place is the BEST, simply the best!!!!  I have been here with my friends, family, for birthdays, and with my grand-mom!!! I have Been coming here ever since it opened like 6 years ago and always enjoyed the food! The Place is so well decorated and food is wonderful. I always left that place saying what a good time I had and how wonderful my food was. I would recommend this place for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!  Lets not forget the Cheesecake is the best part!"
Carol P.,"Plymouth Meeting, PA",0,5,,2.0,5/25/2014,"Usually decent service at this location but waited 25 minutes for someone to acknowledge/wait on us. It was 4:25 on a Sunday evening and not particularly busy. The thing that irked me was that I've yet to hear from management, even tho I wrote about my experience on their corporate website. Not planning on going back anytime soon."
Sandra D.,"Philadelphia, PA",21,10,,1.0,5/23/2015,"Me and good friend went to Cheese Cake factory this evening , the seating time was excellent but the service and the managers response had allot to be desired. The waitress brought things to our table a little at a time, she asked us if we wanted bread rather than just bring the bread to the table as most waitresses/waiters do.. She answered about a dish my friend had had before even knowing if the dish was available. The last straw was when we both asked for cheesecake, the carmel pecan, my friend had hers brought out to the table where I opted to take to go. My friend told me that tend to give you a larger piece of cheesecake when you order it to eat in but I didn't believe it. Well, she was right. When I asked the waitress about it, she said she would have to get her manager. It took about 10 minutes before the manager, Allie, appeared. When I told her what the problem was, at first she said she didn't the other slice of cheese cake, my friend showed it to her, then she began to say it was pre-sliced and all were the same size, which clearly you could see that wasn't true. Then to make a bad matter worst she got loud with me and said if I didn't want it they would remove it from my bill which she did. Very disappointed with the service and the manager. I will NEVER return to that Cheese Cake factory in Willow Grove again."
Stosha S.,"Jenkintown, PA",12,84,2,2.0,2/24/2009,"I'd suggest you find somewhere else to eat. If you like crowded places and cheesecake, you might be okay. The food options were great, but the food is rather bland. (The only obvious exception is the cheesecake) While their menu was worldly, their spices and cooking style were not.  I value quality over quantity, because I'd rather have a few cups full of delicious pasta rather then pounds of over cooked boring pasta. During another attempt, we called for the to-go service that brings food to your car. We arrived 15 minutes earlier than the time they said it would ready. And ended up waiting more than an hour to get our food. Eventually we went in, and the service person was no where to be found, but our bag was ready, they gave it to us COLD.  Eating in or out, it's just not a fun experience. I've given it a few good tries, so take my advice and find somewhere better."
Jeffrey F.,"Jenkintown, PA",1,47,,2.0,1/29/2012,"Don't go for brunch.  Overpriced and the quality of food was lacking.  The service was horrible, coffee luke warm and there are many other places which would be better worth your time.  We have been there for dinner many times with a different experience."
Matthew M.,"Glenside, PA",93,34,10,2.0,11/14/2008,"The food was great but the portions were HUGE. Of course, the cheesecake was amazing. The place is also huge and it is crowded and loud. The ceiling are like 30 feet high and there is tons of space but they still had the tables crammed together so they could fit even more people. My fiance and I ended up getting our dessert to go because we couldn't take the noise any more."
