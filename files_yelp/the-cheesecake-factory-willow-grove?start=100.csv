Alexis P.,"Wyncote, PA",79,121,210,1.0,12/6/2014,"If you believe in equal treatment for all persons, do not go here! They haphazardly sit all minorities in the outside terrace in the mall area behind the bushes."
Jesse K.,"Abington, PA",9,210,75,3.0,11/28/2014,"The cheesecake factory is good at cheesecake, and worth it. However, It is unlikely that a 25 page menu is all made with fresh ingredients. Like an average diner  restaurant, it has a wide menu with cake behind glass in the front."
Delvia W.,"Philadelphia, PA",7,129,20,2.0,7/22/2015,Dined here July 21. Around 6:30pm. Had salmon Alfredo. The chef used pure garlic no other seasoning. Very bland!!! Had to ask for seasoning. My friend had shrimp with the thin pasta and his noodles were stuck together!!! Clumps on his plate!!! He doesn't believe in sending back. Shaking my head service was slow. Server never really checked on us. CCF falling off. Had to take my meal home to season it up. Then I believe it gave me the bubble guts!!!!  My cheesecake was good!!!! Shaking my head. Break time. Off to Bonefish I go.
Niecy E.,"Philadelphia, PA",12,1,,1.0,3/5/2016,"Definitely overrated, waited 40 min. to be seated in a dark dinning area ordered fried shrimp they were not real shrimp some processed version of shrimp fried extra hard so basically it was like eating crust no shrimp insight salty cocktail sauce and warm fries never ever going back not a fan of cheesecake but that must be the only reason  why ppl go."
Kaylin M.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,17,12,3.0,3/7/2015,"I like the Cheesecake Factory because it has a large menu for different tastes and huge portions, however, I do not like this particular location. Me and the boyfriend go to the Cheesecake Factory strictly because we love the avocado egg rolls. The two visits we had at this location, we ordered them and then the server would come back saying that they were all out. I would understand them running out of something one time, but BOTH visits? It just leads me to believe they are doing something wrong if they can't keep a very popular item ""in stock.""  Probably won't go out of my way to return to this location since both visits were disappointing."
Veronica K.,"Feasterville, PA",249,406,221,3.0,9/29/2013,"I'd always been wary of the Cheesecake Factory, mostly due to their insanely priced cheesecakes themselves. Before my visit here, I'd only ever got cake to go from the KoP location, and despite the good quality, $8 for a slice of cheesecake seems steep. Anyway, I ended up at the Willow Grove location last night because a friend wanted to have her birthday party there. I'll start with the good; the food was (mostly) delicious. I had their loaded nachos (don't remember the menu name), which consisted of thick nachos that seemed to be fried on premises. I also had the chicken samosas, which were awesome, and while not completely authentic, they had a nice curry flavor that was palatable for American taste buds but still distinctly tasted like an Indian masala. Also, their cheesecake is obviously quite good. I had some of their new s'more edition and it lived up to the hype. Also, I tend to like the decor inside, even if it is quite dark. So here's the cons. My house salad was disgusting - the salad itself was wilted and the vinaigrette they put on it only served to make the aging leaves even more bitter. Luckily, this was the only bad item anyone got and the rest of our food was edible. Worse than this, is that the staff, particularly hostesses, are very rude. They seemed angry we had a large group, and gave us poor accommodations so that one person had to sit on a rickety chair in the middle of the aisle. Also our waitress seemed over worked and barely checked on us, so sadly I personally will refrain from ever going there on a Saturday again, as the attitude was too much. For being a chain, it's not bad. I'll come again on a week day and do an update, and see if any of my issues are resolved."
Chang L.,"Jenkintown, PA",0,18,,1.0,1/18/2016,I don't know what happen here but food has gone down the tubes. Salad was old and looked tasteless.  Kids fruit side was laced with sugar.  I plan to stop coming here and try other restaurants around here.  I love the brand but this location is sub par.
Ken L.,"North Wales, PA",12,13,,1.0,9/1/2015,This place sucks. I really wanted to like this CKF but it sucks. I have come here 5-6 times and every time I am disappointed. We go to the King of Prussia. KOP CKF is better. It might be the chef. The Chicken Madera is terrible here.  This is my favorite dish. I wish a new owner took over.
Joshua M.,"Boca Raton, FL",270,288,914,4.0,8/14/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants, plain and simple. Actually, one of my favorite restaurants period. First off, Cheesecake Factory has literally the biggest menu I've ever seen. To get to the salads, you have to go to somewhere around page 15! Normally, I'd see too menu menu options as a restaurant not knowing what it is, and just throwing everything on a page with a total disregard for quality of the product, not here. Everything I have had here has been nothing less than great. My usual order is the Crispy Chicken Costoletta which is basically a lightly breaded chicken in a lemon sauce, served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The chicken is divine, and the lemon sauce makes it perfect. Portion size is also huge, I am either beyond full if I finish it, or usually have another meal to take home. The mashed potatoes are good, but nothing to go crazy over. Recently, I've been splitting a bunch of appetizers with my friends, tapas style. For appetizers, I'd highly recommend the Tex Mex Eggrolls, Fried Macaroni and Cheese, and the Crispy Taquitos. All are phenomenal. The ones I am not the biggest fan of it the Spinach and Cheese dip (the spinach is flavorless and the cheese is just put on top), and the Quesadilla (chicken just tastes bland and processed).  The cheesecake deserves its own little section for just how good it is. Caution, the cheesecake is on the pricy side, I'd be much happier if it was a little bit cheaper. Nevertheless, they are all phenomenal. My favorite is Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, but most of the other ones I've had are equally as great. My only recommendation to Cheesecake Factory would be to setup a dessert to sample a bunch of different cheesecakes, instead of paying the price to buy a bunch of them. If this exists already, shame on me for not finding it, but if it doesn't it needs to in order to taste the bliss of all these cheesecakes at once! Atmosphere here is always very nice, and plenty of room in the booths. Service wise, it really can be a bit of hit or miss. Most times my servers have been excellent, but I've had a few that were a little slow with things like getting us water, etc. Pricing is also pretty decent, it's a little bit on the more expensive side, but still worth it for what you are getting. Chain restaurants usually have a stigma attached to them, but Cheesecake Factory delivers on every aspect. This is basically my go to place anytime I'm hungry and want great food."
Grace P.,"Willingboro, NJ",56,18,6,1.0,8/21/2016,"I use to love this place, and I haven't been in a while. We decided to go for my daughters birthday, her choice. It was 9 of us, in the party plus 2 babies.  It took them almost  20 minutes just to bring our drinks out, and most of the beverages ordered were water, and coffee.  I ordered an appetizer and a salad with the dressing on the side.  After waiting almost 40 minutes for our food, it finally comes out and my appetizer came out with my entrée, and my salad came out fully dressed.  My sons kids meal which was just chicken fingers and fries came out maybe 10 minutes after mine with no fries.  I had to call the waitress over, and tell her about my food coming incorrectly, and the fries, and her attitude was basically oh well.  She went to get the fries for my son, and than we never saw her again until it was time for the check.  She never even asked if we wanted dessert, I mean it is the cheesecake factory! We had to ask her.  The service was so bad, the food wasn't good, the only thing that saved the day was the cheesecake.  I will not be returning at all!!"
Connie J.,"Warrington, PA",10,51,36,4.0,7/23/2014,"So I visited this Cheesecake Factory numerous times, but yesterday was the best visit I had by far.  I went with my friend who just loves eating. We got seated quickly and our waitress was highly attentitive. Not only that, my friend accidently poured the entire bottle of ground black pepper into her dish! I'm assuming the lid was not screwed on tight. Our waitress offered to ask the chef to make a new dish for my friend, she was so nice! She even brought over a new pepper shaker!  Overall, we had such an amazing experience, all because of exceptional customer service! Although, I do recommend dining during hours that are not as busy."
Allison B.,"Carmel, IN",134,450,33,3.0,2/24/2013,"I tend to be fairly anti-Cheesecake Factory.  The portions tend to be big, caloric, and very mediocre.  I was pleasantly surprised when I stopped in for lunch the last time though -- they seem to have made some changes. You certainly can still get the ""big as your face"" type platters and their cheesecake, but if you're just in for a regular lunch and not wanting to break your diet bank for the week, they have the SkinnyLiscious menu.  I ended up getting the shrimp tacos and was very satisfied.  They were very fresh and tasty -- filled with shrimp, avocado, and slaw among other things and you get three.  I was pleasantly full at the end of the meal but felt as if I had made a healthy choice.  I opted not to eat the huge side of rice.  I had one bite, but it wasn't really good enough to be worth it. I also loved their mint iced tea.  I think I drank three when all was said and done.  Unsweetened but perfectly brewed and flavorful.   Our waitress was outstanding as well -- friendly and attentive.  I'd definitely think about going back now that they've add this menu!"
Dave D.,"North Wales, PA",31,7,,1.0,5/8/2016,"Beware! The Cheesecake Factory in Willow Grove PA has HORRENDOUS customer service. I ordered our meal to go. The server took the order properly, but the kitchen skipped one of the meals. When I picked up the order, the clerk at the register said it was never given and that I could order it then and pay for it so that I wouldn't have to wait in line again. When I pointed out that the meal was written on the order, she did nothing to rectify the situation other than to want me to pay for it now so I could leave sooner when it was ready. I asked for the manager and explained the situation to him, and he was just as apathetic. Since I already had the other meals, why would I want to wait while they cooked the missing meal and have the other meals get cold? His reply was a shrug of the shoulders. The manager didn't care that I would end up with either 3 hot meals and a missing meal, or three cold meals and one hot meal. He made no offer to alleviate the situation by offering a gift certificate for a later use to try to keep my business. I will not be back, as this isn't the first time we have run into problems at this location."
John M.,"Southampton, PA",1,34,1,1.0,8/23/2015,"Went here today after church hoping for a delicious meal that Cheesecake Factory usually provides. I recently visited Cheesecake Factory in lawrenceville NJ and it was a very bad experience. I decided to go to the one in cherry hill nj and it was worse. First the meals took very long to come out and it was only chicken and shrimp that me and my family ordered. Second there were flies all over the restaurant constantly landing on my food and on our drinks. The floors,table and silverware were extremely dirty. I'm totally giving up on a great dining experience because these restaurants just don't care anymore."
Cynthia F.,"Philadelphia, PA",57,348,34,4.0,8/7/2015,I went here with my mother in law for lunch a few weeks ago. The first thing I noticed was the beautiful high ceilings. It really makes the restaurant look bigger. We were seated at a table fairly quickly as they were not busy at all. I didn't like how close together the tables were. It didn't allow for any personal space. The other downside is that they placed people on either side of us making us feel cramped. This was unnecessary as like I said the place wasn't busy and there was empty tables all over the restaurant. Other than that it was pleasant. Our waiter was phenomenal. I had my daughter with me and he stopped and talked to her and asked me questions about her. The food was great. I was very happy with everything I got and the food was brought out quick.
Evan W.,"Chalfont, PA",0,7,1,4.0,1/10/2016,Place is empty.....waiting now 30 mins for breakfast.  Manager was very accommodating and made good on the services
Ling C.,"Philadelphia, PA",14,90,171,4.0,6/6/2015,What do they put in their food that makes you so full?! Food comes out great depending on what you get. Staff is amazing. Wait is FOREVER!
Karla O.,"Hatboro, PA",11,12,3,4.0,12/28/2015,"I love this place, the steaks are always perfect, every time I ask for a different meal I never get dissapointed, the service is amazing always and also the cheescakes of course. Also the prices are good. The only reason about the 4 stars it's because they didn't have spanish menu like in other restaurants and because the sangrias are kind of bad."
Esther Y.,"Diamond Bar, CA",6,3,1,5.0,7/18/2015,"The address showed on yelp is wrong but good taste! So enjoy! I order the old fashion burger, taste so gooood（＾＾）"
Felicia C.,"Philadelphia, PA",84,271,16,5.0,8/25/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat. The menu is enormous - I don't think I've ever seen a bigger one - so you have a lot to choose from. The food is all delicious, and of course there are about a hundred different desserts. They also have a full bar and lots of specialty cocktails. I like the outdoor seating, and the place is open really late! They don't close until 12:30 am on weekends and 11 pm on Sundays and during the week!"
