Tara C.,"Elkins Park, PA",362,28,,5.0,7/30/2015,"This is our favorite go to restaurant for the abundance of great food and, of course, the cheesecake. But this review is about Betsy, our server today. She was excellent! On one of the busiest of days, it's National Cheesecake Day, she took the time to explain some Factory business (Happy Hour!) which saved us a few dollars that we promptly spent on food and tip. The service is usually good, but today was exceptional and we will be back more often."
Sharon B.,"Glenside, PA",271,36,48,5.0,8/22/2013,"Love Cheesecake Factory. Not only is their cheesecake awesome (duh) but the food is really good. Zucchini fries are a favorite of mine. I am also a big fan of the Chicken Romano, aka parm. The menu is huge so there is something for everyone.  And I was even able to shop in the mall at a nearby store or two while waiting on more than one occasion. Just had to run in and grab something but 2 birds 1 stone. That makes it all the more better!"
Steven Z.,"Langhorne, PA",0,17,,5.0,7/8/2015,Aside from all the fancy dishes I just always get a ribeye steak medium well... it's awsum and then Linda's fudge cake just fyi your not gonna find a better steak and cake in the same place ever  service could be better but come in its always a full house there
Catherine F.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,4,1,3.0,1/7/2016,"We went on a quiet Tuesday afternoon. The hostess didn't say one word just grabbed the menus and started walking. We said thank you and nothing.  At our table there was food and silver wear all over the the ground. I wanted to leave but I was hoping for better wait service. Waitress was nice enough but nothing special. She screamed everything and rolled her eyes at every word we said. Also a group got sat right next to us when there was a 100 free tables. It made no sense. The food was the only saving grace, everything was delicious. Next time I'll just do takeout so I don't have to tip rude people."
Felisa B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,7,2,3.0,11/4/2015,"Calamari and crab wontons were very delicious and remains consistent. My husband had grilled fish tacos, beans and rice. The beans and fish were well seasoned,  but the rice had too much cilantro. I had the teriyaki chicken with brown rice. Chicken was very dry. Our drinks hisbiscus martini and Long Island tea was well made and very refreshing."
Bob L.,"King of Prussia, PA",0,31,4,2.0,8/15/2015,Meh.  Table of four on a Saturday night at 7pm. One has to wonder how well this location is doing when the wait at this day/time is only 20 minutes. Crab wontons not fried correctly with partially burnt and partially undercooked. The kids cheesesteaks came out on rolls so hard they just ate the meat. Gumbo had tough shrimp and gristly chicken. Ucckk!  Serviced mixed. Some follow up but simple things like water never refreshed. The brand itself has really just become stagnant and this location shows it
Rachel C.,"Washington D.C., DC",65,199,23,2.0,2/1/2014,"Let me keep this short. At the risk of sounding like a dick, it's a popular suburban restaurant with all of the issues that might suggest. We had a 1 hour wait before we were seated, which was much longer than promised. But, ok, it was a Friday night. Apparently 5 large tables had been there for over 2 hours. So not really their fault. But we were all very, very hungry. Bland food, sans the fried macaroni and cheese. That was awesome. The guacamole needed salt, and my eggplant sandwich was pretty gross.  The cheesecake slices (cookie dough and s'mores) that my table of 7 split were good.  I have eaten at a few of these locations, and it was all pretty normal, but the reason I'm bothering to review this one is because my friend got food poisoning from her orange chicken and found a large shard of glass in her leftovers. So 2 stars it is."
Greg P.,"Furlong, PA",1,13,,1.0,4/26/2015,- wife received nuts in Greek salad and is severely allergic.  - service slow  - food downhill  - hostesses are miserable  Manager spoke with us about nuts in salad.  You'd think however that They would do more than just take salad of check when my wife could have died from their mistake.  The experience at willow grove has worsened over the years and attention to detail is not good.  Lost my love for Cheesecake Factory.
Dena B.,"Oreland, PA",14,15,,2.0,3/10/2015,"Honestly, it's never my first choice... It's always just so so and the service is hit or miss. I only go again because my 10 year old loves the strawberry shortcake dessert they offer. I did however have bad service the last time I was there which is unfortunate because now I don't think I'll return:("
Hope R.,"Philadelphia, PA",24,43,852,3.0,1/13/2014,"Went on Monday evening and got seated right away. Our waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable. We ordered 4 small plates. Crab cakes, ahi tuna salad, chicken potstickers and endive salad with blue cheese. My entree was soft shell shrimp taco and my hubby ordered a veggie burger. I don't care too much for the endive salad because the blue cheese and the endive was too bitter for me. Crab cake was good but theres no lump of crabmeat thou. Ahi salad was very tasty with the lime, avocado and cilantro. My only problem with the place was that it's extremely dark. I also notice that my spoon was extremely dirty, luckily I didn't need to use a spoon for my meal. Overall it's a nice place but I'm not dying to go back thou."
J S.,"Willow Grove, PA",23,11,,4.0,8/9/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has a large menu, I have barely scratched the surface.  I can't say anything bad about this place. Obviously, their cheesecakes are great too!"
Candace J.,"Somerton, Philadelphia, PA",42,23,85,5.0,4/24/2014,Great food nice sandwiches with changeable side options great pasta tacos enchilladas I love the shrimp scampi and steak Madeira nice drinks the appetizers are the best egg rolls crab cakes and fire cracker salmon
Brooke C.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,12,3,4.0,5/10/2014,The Cheesecake Factory is always good but I'm compelled to write this review in order to praise the accommodating service. At other brunch places I have been asked to finish my Starbucks before being seated but the hostess laughed and assured me that I was fine to keep my iced coffee with me. Thanks Cheesecake staff!
Mark C.,"Philadelphia, PA",6,4,,1.0,11/27/2014,"Very disappointing overall experience. The server, Christine, took our order and we never saw her again after that until she brought over the check.  I ordered the famous factory meatloaf which was okay but overly salty. I needed 3 glasses of water after eating it. (My water, since the server never came by to refill our glasses). I can't understand how a place like this stays in business with such horrible service when the restaurant business is so competitive, When we complained to the manager, she stated that ""we don't get too many complaints here"". What kind of an answer is that? I don't care about what happened in the past, the bad service is happening now. I'd pass on this one. Visit one of the better locally owned establishments instead."
Jackie O.,"Souderton, PA",3,8,,4.0,6/1/2015,Most bartenders here are awesome.. Some however are not!!!!! Love the Mai tais and got two from a female bartender who filled it completely with juices! 10.75 a drink... Waste of money!!!! So upset because we always come here for the mai tais and can only drink 2-3 tops!! Had two she made and felt like I drank no alcohol! Ordered two more from another bartender and they rocked !!
Irina K.,"Philadelphia, PA",155,200,262,4.0,12/4/2014,"Its as good as any other Cheesecake Factory is! I love cheesecake factory. Large portions, good prices, great food. I mean its nothing spectacular or amazing, just decent food. Especially for lunch or a large party. This one is no exception."
Cas M.,"Chalfont, PA",162,120,52,3.0,12/18/2013,"Cheesecake choices galore. Their portions are big enough for a family of four. That wasn't supposed to rhyme.  Yummy treat and even an impressive dinner menu, but too many choices for someone who is easily overwhelmed (me)."
Evelyn D.,"Philadelphia, PA",70,168,113,4.0,12/22/2013,"Friday nite dinner celebration birthday with 12 people. They only said they could split party and couldn't seat everyone together, but saw them set up to tables for 12....I had the lemon butter chicken..with asparagus and mashed potatoes...very delicious - asked for a generous amount of the lemon butter sauce...table said BBQ salmon and herbed salmon was good.  Pasta with shrimp was dry and shrimp overcooked. Tablemate didn't enjoy it."
Yoo S.,"Jenkintown, PA",1,23,6,4.0,11/12/2014,"I was very pleased with my waitress. She was so friendly and came often to see if everything was okay. The food was delicious! We shared the avocado egg roll which was 3 nice sized rolls cut in half so total of 6 pieces. It was very tasty and warm. I got the bang bang chicken and shrimp which was also very delicious but there was not enough ""sauce"" to go with the gigantic scoop of white rice. And my sister ordered the bistro shrimp pasta which was soooo flavorful!!!! I kept eating hers!! I think next time I will just order carryout because there was about 1 hour wait and it was very crowded. And it's always too loud in there for me. But other than that, everything was great!"
Lauren K.,"Upper Black Eddy, PA",0,7,3,3.0,5/21/2015,My boyfriend and I went here for dinner last night. It was good and I enjoyed that they had a large menu. One thing that really disappointed us was how close the tables were together. If you want to go here don't bring a date cause you can't really talk; you are not even 2 feet from another table. The food was good but not excellent. The only thing that was excellent was the waitress and the cheesecake.
