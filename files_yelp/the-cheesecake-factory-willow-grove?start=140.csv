Jamie M.,"Conshohocken, PA",629,859,708,5.0,4/9/2011,"Wow, this is way better than the KOP location. We came here last night for dinner (and granted it was like 4) and there was no wait. The whole restaurant has a really nice ambiance with the details on the ceiling and dim lighting. Our waitress was pretty cool too. We got everything in a timely manner and she was pretty good with refills on our drinks too. Plus the portions were very generous. I had the lunch menu portion of the margherita pizza and salad and wasn't able to finish it!"
Mustapha J.,"Upper Bavaria, Germany",9,14,,1.0,8/29/2015,"Worst service and experience ever, manager didn't care server either, we are 5 people they bring the food one by one, said have a mix up in the kitchen, waitress very slow. When we got the food my steak was red I guess they rushed. We called for the manager and sounded like he didn't care ."
Jennifer P.,"Bethlehem, PA",67,140,186,4.0,10/16/2011,Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo - creamy goodness mhmm. I love it soo much. I've only gotten that. The last time I was able to order a smaller portion. I love having that option!  My friend got a pomegranate martini - she seemed to love it. And we both got a piece of red velvet cheesecake. OMG! Why does it have to be so good! I wish there was a location closer to my hometown of Bethlehem. I gotta try something different the next time but I just love the chicken Alfredo so much. I'm hesitant to try something new! We spent $30 each - only b/c I was being greedy and bough an EXTRA piece of cheesecake to take home.
Gary S.,"Willow Grove, PA",6,15,2,5.0,8/12/2015,"Wow, what a great time and awesome food. The staff was really top notch. They were friendly and helpful. They made suggestions so that my wife could choose her meal. The food was to die for. I would totally recommend this place to anyone. We will be back."
TeaYana W.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,2,,1.0,2/24/2016,"First and last time dining at this restaurant.  On February 10th I treated my mother,  my sister, my aunt, my 2 year old niece and my daughter to celebrate my mother's  43rd birthday. We had two servers one had to leave due it being the end of his shift. I believe his name was Tommy or Tim. He gave a wonderful recommendation for a bourbon inspired drink, which was awesome. We ordered the calamari and the spinach and cheese dip.  The calamari was gummy the spinach dip was cold.  After that was fixed we all ordered. My niece and daughter shared a children's pizza. My mother, sister  and aunt ordered steaks. I ordered a pasta and shrimp dish.  So,  two of of three steaks were cold.  The sauce for my dish was bland and mainly butter. My niece vomitted twice, we ended up cleaning it up no one from the waitstaff helped out.  Or replacement server was in a few words lacked quality as well as did not do the proper steps of service.  Table never got prebussed in between the appetizers and entrée portion. There wasn't a two minute bite check, no water refills,  and whenever she was needed we had to flag her down. I only tipped due to me being in the restaurant business. Our server name was Sherri R."
Rachel B.,"Souderton, PA",0,13,,3.0,2/12/2016,"I don't ever choose to come here, but my friend wanted to celebrate her birthday here. The vegan cobb salad was pretty darn yummy. I was happy to find something filling and fairly delicious at a chain restaurant that hardly caters to vegans while celebrating a friend's birthday."
Deborah L.,"Warminster, PA",6,22,2,4.0,3/11/2015,"I don't know why I look at the menu; I always order the chicken and shrimp spicy jambalaya.  It's fantastic.  Of course the cheesecakes are all amazing.  The lemon torte is also just too delicious.  I'm not usually a huge fan of chains, but I do like this one.  The only downside is that some of the tables are placed way too close together."
Dominique N.,"Willingboro Township, NJ",49,2,94,1.0,5/5/2014,"I love the location, but it was toooooo dark. I didn't realize that  an awful waitress could mess up the whole ambience of a great meal. I am just sorry I tipped her. She had an aweful attitude. The bang bang shrimp & chicken was great. I also enjoyed my Morrocon mint tea."
Mina E.,"Warminster, PA",5,2,,5.0,1/6/2015,"Amazing food, amazing drinks, friendly and helpful staff what more can you ask for. Best lemon drop martinis."
Megan K.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,18,1,4.0,2/19/2015,"Always a plus when we finish our day at The Cheesecake! The menu is very accommodating to the whole family's taste buds. Don't come often; quite expensive! Nice for birthdays, especially when they sing to the little ones!"
P. M. W.,"Ambler, PA",26,215,,4.0,7/21/2013,"Doesn't matter lunch or dinner, we always get great food here. Knowledgable, friendly service in a clean environment. It is a bit loud, and there can be a long wait for a table, but it's worth it for the consistent pleasure of dining there.  Substitutions don't bother them.  We have ordered from all over the menu.  Great appetizers, burgers, pasta and chicken dishes.  Large portions.  Amazing desserts as to be expected.   Only gripe is that the children's menu food is pretty bad.  The chicken tenders are too peppery, the mac-n-cheese is too salty."
Jessica T.,"Lansdale, PA",24,11,8,1.0,12/22/2014,"I live in between KOP and Willow Grove's location so to avoid the long wait I used go for this location. I usually grab take out a lot of the time and every time I attempt to place an order over the phone I'm put on the phone for nearly 10 min. Obviously, I'm already on my way and of course waiting for my food is the icing to the cake waiting and additional 15-20 min. Server or the manager didn't even seem apologetic when I asked to speak to management."
M B.,"Chesterbrook, PA",6,56,6,4.0,9/8/2014,Gigantic establishment. Despite how busy they are - you still get a decent family friendly meal. And the cheesecake is swanky. Anne got the chicken and biscuits - it was awesome. Maura didn't care for the corn dogs; not sweet enough for a youngling.
Alison K.,"Market East, Philadelphia, PA",132,199,12,3.0,7/16/2012,"Let's be honest, you only ever go here with cheesecake in mind. That said, I had a burger which was good, not great but not terrible. It's pretty loud and cramped because they try to put as many tables as humanly possible (plus about 12 more) in the space, probably to account for the huge demand. Speaking of, we waited 1.5 hours to get a table for two. Not really worth it. What is worth it is the cheesecake menu. The slices are huge, though, so if you can agree on one flavor, just get one and share. Alternatively, take some home to eat while watching wedding shows on TLC on Friday nights. Or whatever it is you do--I don't judge."
Melissa K.,"Perkasie, PA",35,44,9,4.0,5/5/2013,"I have been to this location a couple times and I think it is time I gave it a review.  Usually I come with my Nan, but this time it was my boyfriend's first time at a Cheesecake Factory. We had to wait 15 minutes before being seated, however, they did accommodate my request for a booth, and so it was worth the wait.  The overall appearance of this location is very spacious and airy.  The outside dining was open, but it was a little too cold for outside still.  The color scheme is warm and friendly and the bathrooms were clean.      We grabbed a drink from the bar while we waited; I had a Caribbean cooler and my other half had a glass of Shiraz.  We were acknowledged within a minute of arriving to the bar and they offered a drink menu, which was helpful, but it took too long to get our drinks and to cash out.  The bar is small but nice, but waiting to order a drink and to cash out while standing- made the experience at the bar unpleasant and not one I would return to anytime soon.  I would not order the Caribbean Cooler again because it tasted like an expensive Slurpee with fresh fruit- I could barely taste the rum, but I will take the fresh pineapple, lime and strawberry.  Also, when the sunset it was nice to have that curtain drawn down so it was not in our eyes.  When we were seated, the waitress greeted us promptly and got us water and bread quickly, which was appreciative.   The bread was warm and tasty, but the butter is always too cold and hard to spread. Her service was timely and she did not make us wait.  Food: I had the four cheese pasta with chicken and an order Edamame as my vegetable.   The Edamame is always tasty and crisp.  The only thing I wish they had was sea salt to sprinkle on it.   The four cheese pasta dish was HUGE and tasty; chicken was tender and juicy.  I liked how they brought the dish right when it was ready rather than wait for my boyfriend's dish because pasta gets cold and 'funky' quick.  I do wish there was more of a sauce on the pasta rather than it being dry.  My boyfriend got the combination of Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane.  As a first timer to the factory, he loved the food- both from the land and the sea.  He ordered the mash potatoes as his vegetable and he greatly enjoyed them too.  He also ordered a side dish of sautéed spinach, and he was not impressed with that.  I tasted it and it was very bland and some of the spinach was not completely sautéed.  Some looked like fresh leaves tossed into the dish in the last 20 seconds of sautéing.   We ordered a cup of coffee, which was from a fresh pot, and it was good.  I always get my Dulce de Leche Carmel Cheesecake, which is always amazing!  (EVERY calorie of 1000+ :-P)  He got the Raspberry Chocolate Truffle and he loved it!  I taste it, and for not a chocolate cheesecake or cake fan- the raspberry was AMAZING!  It tasted amazing with a sip of his Shiraz.   The prices are a little high, especially when it came to the sautéed spinach and Edamame.  We will eventually visit again, but not anytime soon due to the geographic location and prices."
N V.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,5,,1.0,12/18/2015,Worst omelette ever.  Food is bland and overpriced.  Go to the west ave grill in jenkintown if you want a good omelette.  $3.95 for a glass of lemonade.
Lisa A.,"ELKINS PARK, PA",111,10,,1.0,10/3/2012,"I have been going to this restaurant since the 90's (starting with the one in DC/Maryland area when I was in college). It has always been a favorite, BUT I just recently went to the one in Willow Grove Mall on 10/2/12 around 1pm so not too busy and had the calamari appetizer and a seared ahi tuna salad.  The calamari had two onion rings and a piece of chicken all fried in the same batter in the order. It's like some onions and chicken from another order fell into the batter and they just threw it all on the same plate. Disgusting? Then (and I can't make this stuff up) my salad had a piece of thin turkey meat in it that the waitress said that they use for a different order.  Disgusting! I had the manager come over both times and he took both the calamari and the salad off of my bill. He was very pleasant about it and apologetic, but having said that I don't think I will be going back because there is clearly something very wrong in their kitchen.  No attention to detail. Reckless plating.  Perhaps too busy Maybe I'll try the new restaurant Bravo! next door."
Stephanie G.,"Schnecksville, PA",1,49,,2.0,6/27/2012,"Only go here for dessert.  The Lemoncello cream cake is amazing!!!  However......  When this place first opened it was very good. I've had some awesome food here.  But a few years have gone by and now the place is terrible.   I was here a few weeks ago with my parents and items we had ordered before were simply bad this time.   I got chicken tacos and I have to say they were the most tasteless things I've ever ordered at a restaurant.  No flavor whatsoever, not even salt!  My mom got the southwest eggrolls which looked like someone hopped over to the nearest grocery store and picked up a pack of TGI Fridays frozen ones and popped them in the micro for a few minutes too long.  They were dried out, greasy little things and so spicy hot we couldn't even eat them.   Not a good experience.  I probably won't be back"
Jay B.,"Ambler, PA",1,49,,1.0,9/5/2015,"Definitely NOT worth the hour plus wait.  Food is below average.  Service is average at best.  There's no atmosphere.  And the prices are high.  Save yourself and your wallet - eat dinner somewhere else, and buy a slice of cheesecake to go if you must."
Helen C.,"Torrance, CA",36,505,126,3.0,1/4/2013,We ordered: THE LUAU SALAD: not so good. really lacked flavor. The wontons part was a little undercooked. THE JAMAICAN SHRIMP: this was actually pretty good SEAFOOD GUMBO: this was just ok.. was a little too creamy
