Sam D.,"Byberry, Philadelphia, PA",8,34,31,3.0,7/14/2014,"Food was ok. Ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp and wasn't impressed at all. The rice was dry, and the dish barely had any sauce. It was covered with coconut and peanuts, so the little sauce it had was covered with dry toppings which made it worse. The buffalo blast appetizer was very good. And I got the red velvet cheesecake. The red velvet cake was good, didn't like the cheesecake or the cream cheese frosting on it. The waitress was nice and very friendly. I'll give it another try. But maybe go for the salmon or a burger."
Senoj M.,"Philadelphia, PA",183,19,147,5.0,12/10/2011,I mean its the Cheesecake Factory! Delicious food! Huge Portions! Great Prices! Enough said!
Paul L.,"Jamison, PA",1,86,68,3.0,7/30/2015,"This place is a zoo!  Especially last night because of the half priced cheesecake.  The reason i find this place annoying is the reservation system. They ask for a cell number and text you when your table is ready.  However, after putting in my request and standing around for 20 minutes there were couples that came in after me and gave a name.  These people were seated 10 minutes before me.  It is a bad system.  On top of that i ordered cheesecake to go.  They put the wrong cheesecake in the bag.  That was very disappointing.  How hard is it to pack up the correct cake?  I would go back but would try for an off peak time"
Tatiana T.,"Horsham, PA",141,18,4,5.0,1/6/2014,"Love the Cheesecake Factory! Everything on the menu is delicious, I got the chicken Bellagio and I loved every bit of it. I usually get Chicken Fettuccine with sun dried tomatoes. Awesome service and even better cheesecakes!"
Chuck B.,"Center Valley, PA",4,22,9,2.0,10/15/2012,"Food was good. Portions were large and flavor was good. Consistent with most Cheesecake Factory restaurants. It is a chain restaurant so you know what you get and you get what you pay for. Service was below par hence the two stars. Didn't have any dessert since the waiter seemed like he wanted to rush us out. It was early evening on a weekday with plenty of tables so not sure what his rush was. Better for me since I missed the 1500 calorie slice of carrot cake. Based on other reviews and my experience, seems like poor service is a theme at this restaurant."
Nora O.,"MELROSE, PA",0,4,,1.0,12/26/2014,"This was my second time to visit the Cheesecake Factory.  My first was a few years ago and I was unhappy then, but I had received a gift card now so we decided to revisit.  We were very disappointed.  From my hibiscus martini that was so sweet it was barely drinkable to our dinners of shrimp scampi, we were sorely disappointed.  The only bright spot was the shared pot sticker appetizer.  It was delicious. The shrimp in the shrimp scampi dish ( we both ordered the same entree) was breaded.  Breaded shrimp scamp?  Unheard of!  The only clue that it was shrimp is that it looked like shrimp because there was no shrimp taste.  Absolutely awful.  I've learned my lesson- don't come back, ever"
Andrew S.,"Mt Vernon, WA",42,49,2,3.0,9/13/2012,"Went here for dinner on a Wednesday night (9/12/2012).   Wasn't terribly busy, but my waitress was obviously very busy.   Went simple and had a Cobb salad and an iced tea.  The salad was probably the biggest I've seen in my life - absolutely huge, easily serves 3 people for a meal.  Seriously.  Taste was alright - nothing to rave about, nothing specific to complain about.   Picked up a slice of Oreo cheesecake to go - definitely tasty."
Pinkjadez Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",62,72,48,4.0,7/9/2011,"Ahh the cheesecake factory...whats not to like about the expansive menu to choose from... there is something for everyone...the key is to either order something to share with another member of your party or order from the small plates and snacks section which is like tapa style dishes... planning ahead my friend, will allow for adequate space in your belly for some yummy dessert. These are my absolute favorites...  1. Reeses Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake 2. Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake 3. White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake I'm a huge fan of left overs... so the larger portions are not an issue for me :)"
Jamie B.,"Fort Washington, PA",0,8,,1.0,12/4/2011,"In high school, my school had an exchange program with a school in England. We decided to take our British exchange students here. We thought they'd genuinely enjoy the food here. Instead, they spent the entire time taking pictures of everything like the portions at the Cheesecake Factory were some sort of American landmark like the Liberty Bell or the Statue of Liberty. They didn't actually realize that Americans genuinely eat at the Cheesecake Factory, accept that the portions are ridiculous,  and it's not really a novelty.  But really, if you want gigantic portions of reheated, bland food that's about 4,000 calories a serving, without having to wait 45 minutes for a table, maybe try sticking a few sticks of butter in the microwave for a few seconds. It's basically the equivalent of the food at the Cheesecake Factory."
Sean W.,"Warrington, PA",6,2,,1.0,3/29/2011,"Let me first say that the food was tasty and prepared as we ordered it;  however that is where it ends.   The table was cramped, we might as well have been seated with the 4-top next to us.  It was so tight that orders had to be passed to my date that was sitting in the booth part of the 2 person table.  The server had to take our order from behind me because she couldn't get between the tables to properly speak to us, which lead to the major issue.  Since the server couldn't get between the tables to properly deliver the food to the table, she had to hand a extremely hot plate to my date, which was so hot it burned her fingers.  In an instance the plate was dropped onto the table breaking the drink glass, and spiling all over her and the table.  What a mess!  Now I understand accidents happen, but to barely get an apology was a little disappointing.  The way it was nonchalantly handled I was actually surprised they even took the cost of the replacement drink from the bill.  It was like nothing happened.  I highly doubt that I will be back there, because no matter the quality of the food, service is paramount and that was severely lacking."
Michelle J.,"Philadelphia, PA",17,65,78,4.0,2/5/2012,"The waitresses were very attentive and friendly, the service was speedy, and the food was great. Do not leave this place without trying one of their cheesecakes! Their Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake really hit the spot - yum~"
Federico M.,"Philadelphia, PA",221,27,31,4.0,12/27/2013,"I got the grilled shrimp blt and it was really good. I think everything on the menu here is really good, tho. I think it's pretty safe to say there are no bad dishes at The Cheesecake Factory. If there is something wrong, it's not a problem to exchange it for something else either."
Chris M.,"Philadelphia, PA",65,10,,5.0,5/1/2013,"When I first came to the Cheesecake Factory in willow grove mall I was very Impressed from the moment I walked in the Restaurant looked fantastic, the servers Were all smiles and polite and very nice to be around they make you want to stay longer, and the food was Superb I ordered the fried macaroni and cheese (which is my favorite Appetizer to order there I order it all the time) and I also ordered the fried macaroni and cheese burger and it all was cooked to perfection I wish I could have ordered it four or five more time it was so good. To anyone who reads my review you need to go to the Cheesecake Factory in willow grove it's the best!!!!!!"
L. J.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,38,,1.0,3/10/2015,"Review solely based on this restaurant's reservation policies. Tried to make a reservation for a group of 12 and was refused. Arrived at the restaurant and was told it was a 2 hour wait. Received a text 3 hours later that our table was now ready - after our group had ate, drank, and paid a $900 bill elsewhere. Never going back even if it was free."
Andrew S.,"Randolph, NJ",85,105,12,4.0,8/8/2013,"When I was going to Arcadia U. I would frequent this location often with my girlfriend. The staff was always attentive and the food was rich and flavorful. If you are into chain restaurants, this is one of the best."
David N.,"Warrington, PA",1,37,1,2.0,11/2/2013,"Generally like Cheesecake Factory and have been to this one and several others many times.  Came in after the crowd was thinning, around 9 PM.  Seated within a few minutes.  Having seen a friend order the fries well done, I did the same.  Ordered the cheeseburger medium rare.  When the food was delivered, the sogs were not cooked well and were soggy, so I sent them back.  As soon as the server left, I cut the burger and it was raw, so it went back.  (Meanwhile, the waiter comes over to ask how our food was and I told him both items on my plate were prepared wrong.)  My wife always has the Santa Fe Chicken Salad, but tonight it was sub-par as well -- not enough dressing, corn or avocado.  Well, the fries came back and were golden and crisp -- also nice and warm.  About 20 minutes later (and the waiter saying he had checked on it), the burger came back and it was cooked to perfection as well.  Had to ask to get a refill on my iced tea, which is very unusual for Cheesecake Factory.   No real apology from the waiter and no visit from a manager.  Not offered anything off the check or even a piece of cheesecake.  In fact, I think the waiter was ready for us to leave, since he did not even offer dessert when I asked for the check.   Next time at the mall, plan to try Bravo next door."
Sandy P.,"Glastonbury, CT",126,281,91,4.0,12/31/2010,"I'm a big fan of the Cheesecake factory. The food is always good and I've never had a bad meal there. The con is there is always a wait, but I believe it is worth it. While we were waiting, we had tropical martinis at the bar and they are my favorite!  We were a group of three and ordered the following: Appetizer - Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes - one of my faves!  Barbeque Burger - cooked well done but was still juicy and delicious. Chicken Enchiladas - pretty good. large portion and took over half of it home. Sauce was good but rice didn't taste like spanish rice to me. Tasted more like a garlic & herb rice mix. Not a fan of the rice. Order this dish and ask for double beans instead. Crusted Chicken Romano - chicken cooked very good and was tender. Potatoes were tasty.  Dessert - Reeses Peanut Butter Chocolate Cheesecake. I usually like my cheesecake plain, but I was out-voted that night. It was really good and the chocolate cake part of the cheesecake was very moist. Everything tasted fresh. Our waiter was excellent and super attentive. Had a nice personality and had fun with us. I think his name was Andy but I'm not sure. The cheesecake factory is a good place if you are looking for something familiar to eat with consistency. We were traveling from out of town and happy to see that they had a Cheesecake Factory there."
Ciara S.,"Philadelphia, PA",243,268,208,4.0,10/24/2010,"Willow Grove Cheesecake Factory was excellent. The food, service, and the atmosphere was great.  I got the fried mac n cheese. And I got the Pasta Carbona it was great.. Def wasnt a fan of $4.50 strawberyy lemonade which sends you into a sugar coma I had to dilute with water but it was good despite it  Also carrot cake cheesecake is the BEST"
Gina M.,"Philadelphia, PA",205,323,13,4.0,1/26/2013,"When we first walked in, i fell in love with the high ceilings and architecture.  The dim lighting and beautiful colors were perfect.   The 45 minute wait, however, was not.  But, I am glad we did.  The food was amazing.   When the hostess sat us, i automatically wanted to leave- they cram you in there so close to other people that you can literally hear every word of the other peoples conversation.  (The couple next to us was fighting because she didnt want to go there and he should have known that!). But again, we dealt with it.  We ordered the chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps which were delicious an a great portion for $5.95.  After ordering our meals, the waitress came over to say she had a family emergency and she needed to leave but someone else would be taking over.  It was a nice and smooth transition.  Nothing went wrong.   I got the Steak Diane and Herb crusted salmon combination and dear lord, it was amazing.  That salmon was mouth watering.  My boyfriend got the pasta an chicken carbonara and loved it.  We were so full and wound up taking alot home. We still got dessert though!   I just got a bowl of chocolate ice cream- cant really mess that up.  My boyfriend got red velvet cheesecake and said the red velvet cake overpowered the cheesecake s bit but it was still good. I cant wait to go back."
Tom D.,"North Wales, PA",72,307,2,3.0,12/27/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory in the Willow Grove Mall is good for a chain restaurant. It is a solid representation of the chain.  The restaurant is clean, the food is well cooked, the waitstaff is friendly.  Most of the menu choices that I have tried have been pretty good, although nothing has been great. My favorites are the Cajun Chicken Pasta and the Cuban sandwich. The wait time for a table here can be rediculous however and I don't think the food is necessarily worth the wait.  If you're looking for a decent meal, it's a safe choice."
