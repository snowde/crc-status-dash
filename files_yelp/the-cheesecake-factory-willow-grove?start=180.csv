SL. R.,"Wyncote, PA",0,5,,5.0,2/8/2015,Food is great! You get sooo much! I always have to take home some. The drinks are great as well. The staff is always friendly and fast. If you go I recommend a booth or ask to sit in their outdoor area. I don't like to rub elbows with a stranger while I eat. Great place to eat!
Chris U.,"Elkins Park, PA",29,33,27,3.0,5/19/2011,"Reliable, not too-over the top (maybe on desserts...) place for dinner. Good for kids as the noise level is pretty high, decent service, and a nice bar. If going with a group, I'd recommend ordering lots of appetizers, eat that, and then decide to order dinner plates. It's easy to fill up fast."
Harvey G.,"ELKINS PARK, PA",0,3,,2.0,1/30/2015,"The food is always good as is the service, but... the manager can learn a thing or two. The place is usually busy, with long waits, so I called about ten minutes before arriving and asked about the wait. The young lady on the phone said ""No wait, come right over."" Upon arrival, I noticed throngs of people standing and waiting for tables. I waited my turn and asked about the length of the wait. I was told less than 30 minutes by the hostess at the desk. I explained about my calling earlier and how i was told that there was no wait. She insisted, it was not possible and that was mistaken. I showed her their phone number on my phone to document that I called. Forty-five minutes later, still no table. I asked to see the manager and explained what happened. I said that his staff should not tell people, that call, that there is no wait, when they call in advance. I also explained that I was told, upon arrival, that the wait would be thiry minutes and that it was now over forty-five minutes. The Manager applogized. That was it! He didn't offer to seat us or look into it. Just an appology and a blank stare. Unacceptable! At least offer to look into what happened, offer us a glass of wine, a complimentary appetizer or a free dessert. Perhaps, the Cheesecake Factory, and its Management, should consider how it handles dissatisfied customers. There are plenty of other good restaurants in the neighborhood. I intend on taking my business to somewhere that appreciates it. Signed, A Miffed Customer"
Rich P.,"Bordentown, NJ",18,6,6,5.0,9/5/2011,"This is a highly reliable place to eat almost any meal. First time trying the brunch, the Monte Cristo is excellent. I would normally rate The Cheesecake Factory a solid 4 stars but the service was top notch, the brunch divine and it simply qualifies for the ""upgrade"" to 5!"
Eva C.,"Langhorne, PA",0,47,7,3.0,11/1/2014,"About a 20 minute wait at about 2pm. The fried shrimp with fries dish was good (kind of hard to mess that up) with Crunchy, well seasoned shrimp. The Cajun chicken over pasta was tasty, but the ""Thai""bang bang chicken and shrimp was not good at all. It lacked seasoning..and was sweet, not spicy at all as I expected. The sauce had carrots, eggplant and squash and a ton of something which I think was toasted shaved coconut was all over the top...just don't order this dish. The greeters were very pleasant and professional, even though the place was packed and some of the guests were annoying everyone else with their nonsense ""you mean no one left since we've been here? I can't believe we still don't have a table..oh you texted us? We don't have a text, we didn't know you were going to text us"" OH K...so you provided your phone number, they no longer provide pagers and you thought they'd inform you when your table was ready how?? Anyway...back to the review ..the waitress was fine in terms of bringing everything we asked for, but we only knew her name because we overheard her telling the customers next to us..and she'd ask one of our party if they wanted water or wanted a take away container and then dash away before the others could ask for water or a container too..The drinks were very good. Especially the passion fruit magaritas."
Valentino G.,"Philadelphia, PA",126,158,205,4.0,5/18/2013,"Came here last night for my girlfriend and I's anniversary. As always the Cheesecake Factory was packed, but we were seated in a timely manner. We walked in gave a name and waited for about 5 minutes. After we were seated and browsed the menu for a minute, we were greeted by our waitress who was very nice and had a good knowledge of the menu, but was a tad slow, we started off with two drinks the Georgia Peach and Caribbean Cooler. Both drinks were very appetizing, but they could have been just a little stronger. We started off with two appetizers the Spicy Ahi Tuna Roll and the Avocado Egg rolls, which were very delicious. For entrees my girlfriend had the Chicken Madeira and I had the Bang-bang  Chicken and Shrimp, we both tasted each others dishes and they were fabulous. The portions were huge, my dish tasted so amazing with the coconut and curry flavors and my girlfriends chicken was very tasty and bursting with flavor. For dessert we took home the OREO Dream Extreme Cheesecake, that was just to die for! All in all our experience was good service was good, but somewhat slow, the drinks could have been stronger, and the food was very tasty with enough for take home boxes."
KJ S.,"Philadelphia, PA",7,244,12,4.0,5/6/2013,"I went on a weeknight, and it might have been the first time I ever went to a Cheesecake Factory and didn't have to wait for a table. The server was very attentive and the food was good and plentiful as usual."
Shell S.,"Willow Grove, PA",29,82,,4.0,7/20/2013,"The food can be hit or miss sometimes, but the appetizers are usually always good.  The fried mac and cheese is the best, a must get.  The mint iced tea is very good also.  The service is usually always good, even when they are busy."
James B.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,10,3,5.0,12/21/2013,Delicious food and wonderful service. I had the crazy carrot cheesecake and I can't wait till I go back for more.
Lauren P.,"Philadelphia, PA",100,34,,2.0,5/21/2011,"A resounding ""Meh."" The wait was crazy, but this was expected.  The food was pretty good, but not anything to write home about. While our waitress was very good, she seemed overworked. The seats felt very mess-hallish and cramped together.  Decent, but way overpriced for what we got and not a very comfortable dining experience."
Robert B.,"Abington, PA",198,272,1,3.0,5/17/2010,"Do you go here for anything other than the Cheesecake?  That is why you go. I've been to this location many times. It is close and unlike a lot of Cheesecake factories, it does not always have a super long waiting list/line.  The menu is way too large, including the drink selection menu.  The food, you have to spend a lot of time reading through unless you know what you want other than cheesecake.  The location can be loud like most cheesecake factories I've been at. So do not expect a quiet evening if you come here.  The setting is contemporary and clean.  And make sure you do not eat too much. The Cheesecake is worth it."
Enjella L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2647,698,5441,4.0,4/8/2008,"I'm giving this location 4 stars because of its location. Afterall, everything is about location, location, location. Plus, it's new.  It's new - It's spacious for the most part. The ""feng shui"" of it is a little off. It's like some weird geometric shape - you feel like you are in huge corridors (kinda like a V shape) instead of one big room. The service is okay. They seem a little bit flustered when taking your order - and I've gone more than a handful of times.   Bring a coat - it's freeeezing. I went in the fall & winter of 2007. They apparently don't turn on their heat - I was shivering every single time I went.  Parking is great.  Whenever I go to Cheesecake Factory - I always order the Corncake Tamales appetizer. This location's presentation was ehhh..and the cakes were loose (still yummers though). Peep the pix."
JW S.,"OGONTZ CAMPUS, PA",0,29,,2.0,11/4/2014,"For the third time The Cheesecake Factory in Willow Grove got my takeout order wrong. The expensive entree my daughter ordered came without 2 items and the seasonings. I picked up the phone and reported the problem to Joe (the evening manager responsible) and after reviewing the facts and confirming the order and the fact it was the third time Joe said he would send me out a 25$ gift card. I even reminded Joe "" to not forget me after we hang up the phone"" He assured me he would not but guess what? Yep after 2 weeks no gift card. Again I let the other two errors go but when a third happens I expect the responsible management follows through on their commitments. Should I bother getting take-out anymore much less eat in the Resturant. Word to the wise check your take out orders closely. C'mon Joe follow through!"
Teri M.,"Rockledge, PA",116,100,105,3.0,5/24/2010,"I used to rave about this place back when you couldn't ever find it. There was one in King of Prussia and one in South Jersey and I would be excited to go when I got the chance. Sure the cheesecake is the thing to get, but I am not the biggest cheesecake eater so it's not that big of a deal to me. Besides, if you eat dinner here, sometimes it's impossible to stuff anything else in your stomach once it's time for dessert. When I used to go, we would get the buffalo bites...they are great. They had some cold spring rolls that were pretty good too. The last time I went to one, it was this Willow Grove Mall location. one day I went in just for cheesecake with a girlfriend and our kids during off-peak after lunch hours. It was fine. Then I went for dinner with my husband and the kids and I was disappointed with the kids' food. The mac & cheese was like macaroni noodles coated with butter...where was the cheese? The kids were being picky and didn't even want the grilled chicken. What is irritating is I had to order the kids' chicken w/ broccoli and the macaroni separate...why can't mac & cheese be a side? It was a HUGE bowl of oily/buttery mac & cheese. I guess it tasted alright but I find it disgusting to serve all of that as a meal. My fish tacos were pretty good, I was happy with them. The beans were a bit overspiced, I like heat and all, but the fish tacos were spicy as it was, then the beans but the killer was the spanish rice. I hated the rice...my mouth was already on fire and here the rice was spicy too and they put peas and carrots and corn in it. I could understand a little corn for a southwest touch but peas and carrots in spanish rice? Gross. As far as the spice goes, they could have at least put some sour cream on the plate. Even the guacamole was spicy. And I never got a refill on my water....huge pet peeve. Good thing I had a beer with my water. My husband didn't really like what he ordered. I can't even remember what it was now....guess it was forgettable. I don't know if it's related or not, but my kids got a stomach bug a day or so after we ate there and it was not pretty. I hope there wasn't any bacteria from the restaurant's handling or food prep, but I have no way to decipher how my kids got sick, but they don't go to school and didn't get out much that week. What a shame...usually I liked the place, but we didn't have kids with us and we ordered appetizers before. I remember that the Italian and pasta dishes were pretty good though."
Chris D.,"Ocean View, NJ",14,113,254,4.0,11/13/2010,"I usually stay clear of chains, and ate here reluctantly the first time, but really like this particular cheese cake factory.  My wife and I have eaten here about a half dozen times over the last few years and every time has been excellent.  My wife usually gets the fish and chips and I usually get a pasta dish. Today I had pasta with grilled chicken, tomato, fresh mozzarella and pesto.  wow, was it good."
Tracy A.,"Cypress, TX",9,2,,4.0,3/6/2013,The service was okay. I'm not a really cheesecake fan but I really liked it.  The food is in big portions and I was unsure about how the Orange Chicken would taste but it was really good.
S A.,"Abington, PA",0,12,,3.0,7/5/2013,This place has great food and clean ambiance.  The possible problems come from how super busy it always seems to be!  It's often loud (especially if you aren't in a booth).  The staff try very hard to be attentive but seem really overworked.  The wait time is often close to 45minutes.  And the price is somewhat up there.  But the food is worth all of this! And that's why we keep coming back.
Shannon Y.,"Philadelphia, PA",16,84,,3.0,10/13/2012,"Eh.  I'm torn.  I've been here a few times, and returned just for the portobello mushroom sandwich.  Service has always been good, and I really love the Godiva cheesecake.  However, my most recent visit was pretty horrible.  To begin with, our server was really rushed and kind of snide when we asked about gluten free selections (the boyfriend is gluten intolerant to the point of breaking out) and seemed to care a lot more about the table of drinkers next to us.  Then my beloved sandwich was no longer on the menu.  I ordered a chicken sandwich instead and it came out a little pink.  I ended up eating just the fries and the complimentary bread.  My boyfriend had the Sheppard's pie and reported that the sauce was ""weird"" and ""tangy"" but that it was an ok dish.  Our service throughout the meal was perfunctory, and our check was slow to arrive.  We opted to get takeout cheesecake for an event tomorrow night and the take out woman was very friendly and efficient.   Bottom line: Mediocre dinner/excellent desert for too much money."
Pat O.,"Jenkintown, PA",0,19,2,4.0,1/4/2011,Great place Great service we love Fried Mac & Cheese my son was like the sauce more that fried mac & cheese ball. I order the Bistro Shrimp Pasta if you don't like a small shrimp don't order that because I didn't know that their will give me a small size of shrimp but it was great though my pasta was so sour but I think that is the taste for that place. Anyway everything was great last night. Next time I'll order something else to try.
Renee K.,"Byberry, Philadelphia, PA",1,4,,4.0,6/16/2013,The Cheesecake Factory is very good. The portions are incredibly large but I don't mind packing up the leftovers and eating them the following day. As with any restaurant some of the servers are better than others.  The Godiva brownie sundae is delicious and also huge! Great for sharing!
