Sarah K.,"Lancaster, PA",3,119,372,4.0,1/5/2015,"First time at The Cheesecake Factory. Waited about an hour when we came in at 8:45 pm. Bad thing is that they don't take reservations, good thing is that you can walk around the mall to pass time. For anyone who plans to eat here, do come an hour early to get your name on the list. Once seated, the fresh bread the server gives you will be heaven in your mouth. Especially the wheat bread. Now upon looking at the menu, it is a large selection and all the food choices looks good. Even for those who want a healthy/low cal meal can have enjoy this place. The size of the entrees are huge but also that the prices are higher so this is a good deal. Don't order too much apps because you must save room for their delish cheesecake. You have to try one at least when you are here because this place is known for their cheesecakes. So overall, this place is good for large groups on special occusions because the wait time will be long."
Tracy D.,"Robesonia, PA",21,67,91,3.0,3/8/2011,The Cheesecake Factory is a good place to go if you are meeting a group of people.  There is something on the menu for everyone.  I highly recommend the fried mac and cheese appetizer.  It was amazing.  Of course the cheesecake is always good too.  Definitely be prepared to wait for a table.  Cheesecake Factories are pretty much always busy.
Darcy G.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,170,20,4.0,2/21/2011,"This place is always packed no matter what time of the day.  I got their carrot-cake cheesecake.  Oh well, that is so good.  $7 a slice is a lot, but it is so worth it, plus the whipped cream doesn't come from a can."
Eric D.,"Warminster, PA",2,122,105,4.0,3/22/2011,For a typical food chain the restaurant is very well run and clean. Service is on the ball. I like the outdoor area during the summer time.
A S.,"Jenkintown, PA",4,73,,3.0,9/7/2010,"Pretty good.  I went with my girlfriend and her family to this location only.  I've never been to any others.  The mushroom soup was good and the salad was Ok for me.  My sandwich was standard fare.  Our non-alcoholic drinks were fine as well.   Overall, decent experience but we were too full to eat cheesecake so we ordered a couple of slices to take home.  Could have been a little cleaner but the service was good so no complaints here.  Would go back for just the cheesecake maybe in the future."
sherri s.,"Newtown, PA",29,261,24,5.0,1/30/2011,"Great value for the money. Service is always dependable, food is always fresh, portions are plentiful, restaurant is high energy, other than the long wait (wish they did call ahead seating or reservations)...I always look forward to dining here! My favorite is the mac & cheese balls. (not to be confused with the fried cheese).  Variety of menu choices and prices could fit in any budget."
Zahir C.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",81,29,2,5.0,3/11/2013,"This rating is primarily for the service at the Willow Grove Cheesecake Factory. I was there for my aunt's bday party with my  last Friday night which is typically an extremely busy night for any restaurant. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful to our party. I will start by saying that my aunt is bound to a wheel chair, they were helpful in making sure our family was seated in area with enough space for her and her wheelchair, moving tables and chairs to do so. Our party was also pretty large, about 15 ppl, and they were extremely helpful and accommodating with that as well. One of my cousins brought along her 2 toddler age children, who broke a plate halfway through dinner and made a mess. The staff cleaned the mess up quickly and with no attitude and were so nice to the kids during the process. Any requests that we made were quickly and accurately fulfilled for us! I don't usually write yelp reviews but felt extremely inclined to do so after this fantastic service that helped to make my aunts birthday extra special! I have a very big and loud family that can usually find a reason to complain about any and everything but there were no complaints about the service this night. Thank you for the wonderful dining experience!"
Theresa G.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,40,,4.0,9/21/2007,"I was fortunate to get a complimentary ticket to a private seating at the new Cheesecake Factory that is opening in the Willow Grove Mall.   My review is as follows: Cold - Service in getting food was slow - Our waitress was very nice and on top of things (acknowledged & apologized for the delay) - Food was EXCELLENT. So if you have to go, wear layers ... don't be in a hurry to get in and get out ... enjoy the meal when it finally arrives!"
Stella H.,"Hatboro, PA",0,166,,2.0,3/11/2013,"Been awhile since my last visit, so stopped in over the weekend for a mid-day lunch while shopping.   It's never NOT crowded, but since there were only two of us, we were seated immediately.  The word ""Factory"" is exactly what this felt like -- get 'em in feed 'em quick, and get 'em out so that we can turn tables over.  Our server was harried from the moment she took our drink order (took her a good 10 minutes to even acknowledge us!), there was positively no eye contact during the entire visit, and absolutely no warm and fuzzy coming from her.  I did like their expanded ""skinny"" menu (which is what I ordered from, as did my dining companion).  I had the chicken salad sandwich, which was OK.  My companion had a salad, which was also just OK.  Between the noise level, the hustle and bustle, the impersonalization of our server, coupled with the fact that they clearly want you in and out as quickly as possible, I think they hit it right on the nose with ""Factory.""  Oh, we did not have cheesecake at this particular visit - maybe I would have left in a better state of mind??  Hmmmm....."
Lillian C.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,8,6,2.0,9/27/2009,"Well well well, I finally made it to the CCF in willow grove. Heard a lot of good things about this place so i decided to pick this one tonight for our outing with family and friends 8 of us and 1 infant. OK, let's start with the wait! My daughter goes to the desk and tells the lady that we have a party of eight and a baby. She gave her this gadget that would notify us when our table would be available. She told us about 45 minutes and that we should venture the mall and wait on the page from them, here's the problem, I came to eat tonight! Not to go shopping or browsing! I was hungry! The plan was a night out for dinner. Neither the less, my husband whine up in Macy's and come out with a bag! Wow! A new jacket. Now, 2 hours later we finally get a page! Thank you! Somebody heard my stomach! So we all gather at the desk waiting to be escorted to our table. Guest what? That took another 15 minutes! Go figure! So now about the service, which I would give 3 stars to because we had to ask the waiter to remove our dishes after the appetizers. We where so crammed at our table we just didn't feel comfortable, too tight. For starters we ordered hand battered onion rings, which I've had better, the buffalo chicken wings where spicy hot at first bite but, after a few more bites you become use to it.not bad though, had better wings at Bennie the bums in the northeast. The crispy crab bites where pretty good i would definitely order them again.Now for the main course my husband and I ordered the beef ribs which came with skinny crispy onion rings and French fries which was surprisingly good! The meat on those ribs where falling off the bone! Very good taste too. Our other guest ordered fettuccine Alfredo chicken which was to bland for my taste. The Kobe burger looked overcooked, dry. The barbecue salmon was ok, but I don't think we would order that again. The bang bang chicken and shrimp was just as bad! I see we will have to choose from the menu more wisely. The chicken Bellagio was tolerable. But let me add this one last thing, the 35th anniversary cheese cake was to die for! Man I would ride all the way back here just for a slice of that cheesecake! Will we go back? Yes, will we order the same thing, uh, no. Except for them darn ribs! Boy they where good!  Enough said."
Matthew R.,"Huntingdon Valley, PA",0,2,,3.0,7/7/2010,"Went to cheesecake factory, had great lettuce raps and satisfactory nachos. Services was spotty at best, but I got to sit down at the first come first serve bar tables so I was happy. Overall pretty good."
SC W.,"Philadelphia, PA",109,94,7,4.0,8/14/2012,"So glad I don't have to drive of King of Prussia to have their delicious food, 4 star cause I can't say their food is outstanding but it's good, otherwise than that no complaints about this place, it's right next to willow grove mall, so very convenient"
Ilya H.,"Philadelphia, PA",52,23,2,4.0,9/19/2009,"Went there for lunch.  The menu is insane there is about 30 things to choose from. Ended up with the biggest burger I've seen (it had steak strips and bacon on top..ridiculous) my date had the Navajo Chicken sandwich. My burger was great, her sandwich was ok. Drinks are good. Great chain not too expensive, beats Applebee's  or Chili's any day of the week."
M. C.,"Willow Grove, PA",0,29,,4.0,2/24/2010,"I was really surprised to read so many negative reviews. While this is not my favorite restaurant around, I like it a lot. I guess I'm not a real adventurous eater but I always get their chicken Caesar salad. The bad part of that is that it is way too large to eat in one sitting. Even their ""small"" is too large to eat. But it is delicious. The dressing is very tangy. I also sometimes get a side of mac 'n' cheese. If I recall correctly, it is penne pasta. I like it although it's not as good as the homemade baked kind. Many times I was too full for dessert but I did manage to try the dessert a couple times. I think I had the Snickers at least once. I am a cheesecake fan and a Snickers fan so it worked for me. The menu is huge and can be overwhelming. The jewelry ads and whatnot are kind of strange in the middle of the menu, but whatever. The menu is immense so there should be something for everyone. The service has always been decent for me. I love the location and that I don't have to go to King of Prussia anymore. I've experienced the long wait many other reviewers referred to but I've always been in there and seated fairly promptly, at less busy times I guess. So I say give it a try."
Joe J.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,5,,5.0,12/6/2012,"my rating is solely for the cheesecake.  ****do not come here for the food*****  the food is terrible.   well not terrible but really not that good.  i would give the food a 5/10.  i get a different entree every time i go and consistently they have all been lackluster. the cheesecake however............INSANE!!!!!!!!!!!!  the best dessert to ever hit my tongue.  i try a new cheesecake everytime i come.  this is gonna be the best cheesecake of your life.   The cheesecakes ive tried according to greatness and favoriteness in decending order: caramel pecan turtle, white chocolate macadamia nut, red velvet, white chocolate raspberry truffle, 30th anniversary, cookie dough.  Even though some are at the bottom, they are all INCREDIBLE."
Jamie M.,"Furlong, PA",0,4,,4.0,12/12/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurant. My husband and I often come here when we decide to dine out. The food is good, my favorite is chicken and sausage gumbo, very tasty. I would recommend to direct order if you want to taste the cheesecake, which is the best place to get. At our first time, we ordered appetizer and entrees for each and ended up take out the cheesecake for dessert at home. If you come here on a warm day, don't forget to order a glass of pina colada, it is wonderful. The servers are nice and helpful. The only thing is that they do not take reservation on weekend, which make us to come very early for dinner to avoid the wait. Never ever come around 7 pm or you have to wait 90 mins at the mall next door. Hope you all enjoy the place."
DJ M.,"Feasterville-Trevose, PA",453,794,3722,2.0,2/19/2009,"First Impressions:  Note this was my first and last visit to the Cheesecake Factory.  When you first pull up to this Cheesecake Factory you are greeted by an enormous gold stucco building with a lot of windows. It over shadowed the Ruby Tuesday's a few doors down. There is a nice sized patio with heat lamps and street lamp lighting. Upon walking through the doors you first notice the high vaulted ceilings. It took everything I had not to scream Hello, just so I could hear my echo. One reviewer said they were 30 feet high. The next claimed them to be 40 feet high. I am going to jump out on a limb and say they were 52 and 1/2 feet high.  The floors are of limestone and the upholstered cherry wood high booths claim some privacy. The lighting is very contemporary with amber shades on the walls and tapestry skylights. Huge columns are scattered about with amber shades of light glowing.  To the right is a massive sized, glass encased counter with more cheesecake than one could ever dream about. Straight in front of you is the hostess desk. To your left is the large open dining room and the very small, yet decorative bar. Get there early to secure a stool. The lounge area has high top tables with stools.  A little Cheesecake Factory History:  There are over 161 Restaurants with over 50 kinds of cheesecakes. The Grand Lux Cafe is a subsidiary of theirs. The CCF was the first restaurant chain to reach a billion dollars in revenues with fewer than 100 restaurants in operation. The first CCF was opened in Beverly Hills, Ca. in 1978. Evelyn Overton sold her first Cheesecake in 1949. She baked them in her basement for restaurants and her husband Oscar handled the sales. They then opened a small shop in their home town of Detroit, Michigan. After her children were grown and gone, she and her husband moved to Los Angeles. The rest is history.  Our Experience: BYOF  Our server was very friendly and informative and greeted us almost immediately. Since there are over 200 items on this menu, It was like reading a textbook. She was patient with my needing to read every item. With all to choose from, we probably ordered all wrong. I started with the Baked Potato Soup. It was loaded with veggies, cheese and bacon. It was on the brownish side and tasted old and burned. We shared Fried Zucchini as an appetizer. They were your typical frozen and fried zucchini, nothing special. The ranch dressing that was served with it was unbelievably sweet. It did not compliment the zucchini at all. Hubby had a Cheese Burger, $10.95 and said wow when he first got it. He was not thrilled once he started eating it. The patties were preformed and frozen prior to cooking. With the burger came a large amount of ice cold shoestring fries. I ordered a MR Filet.  It took so long, I knew it would be over cooked and hubby and I both think the server knew too. I cut into it and it was MW. Goofy looking Filet too, flat and almost as big as the plate?! She took it back and brought me the MR. I must say it was flavorful and tender. I opted for Mac & Cheese as my side. I know, I am so silly. The Mac & Cheese was one step up from Kraft. When she presented the check, she had taken the Filet off. Portions are large, prices are as high as their ceiling. The Filet was $34.95 and I am not at Ruths' Chris! We took our piece of Key Lime Cheesecake and Carrot Cake home. The desserts are very good and I would consider using take out for desserts only. They also ship Cheesecakes via Federal Express. Three managers sat together at a high top table in the Lounge.  One young attractive server entertained them the entire time of our visit.  Not once did I see a manager get up to greet or check on a table.  All three were very young and I am sure there for the easy paycheck.   If and when I ever receive $50.00 in Gift Cards for the CCF again, I will order Cheesecakes to go. That is how they started. That is what they specialize in and they do know how to do it right.  As for the 200 menu items, it is a chain, what did you expect? Come on Toni, come and say "" I told you so! ""  ;+} My Dipping sauce for Fried Zucchini, Onion Rings, Fried Mushrooms: 1 part mayo, to 1 part sour cream, to 1/2 part horse-radish."
George A.,"Easton, PA",0,2,,4.0,7/21/2010,"The first time I ever visited a cheesecake factory was in Miami and I became an instant fan, and WWillow Grove did not disappoint.  The food was as I rememberd it excellent, and our server (Stephenie K) did not disappoint she was attentive and very friendly.   We enjoyed our time and we will return in the near future."
Nicole W.,"Haverhill, MA",157,228,256,5.0,2/13/2011,"I love this Cheesecake Factory!!!! I was a bit afraid since I experienced a total let down at my first Cheesecake Factory experience in Chicago- but this place was fantastic. Because my party was large we did have to wait a while but the food made it worth the wait. I also ordered a strawberry daquiri at the bar and it was nicely mixed if not a bit pricey. My mother had a couple of long islands and appeared to really enjoy them. The food was all around delicious. I stole food from all my family members plates and was very happy. The steaks sometimes aren't made the way I and my father prefer them (rare to medium rare) but I can get over that if they are seasoned nicely, which they were. The mashed potatoes were scrumptious and most other sides were tasty as well. The cheesecakes were, of course, utterly delicious. Pricey but delicious non the less. This place will take a pretty penny out of your wallet but it's one of the best chain restaurants to go to."
DaFree R.,"HUNTINGDON VY, PA",0,18,,4.0,5/1/2011,"I can't believe I am writing this, but I like it.  We didn't have any cheesecakes (it's like 1600 calories for one slice - crazy!), but the rest of the food is very good.  Every time we go there, we get good food.  So, don't snob them.  They are a chain, but at least this location is pretty decent."
