Ryan C.,"Philadelphia, PA",26,75,4,4.0,9/3/2008,"This is not a 5 star restaurant, but it deserves 5 stars for the something-for-everyone menu.  If you can't find something to eat here, then apparently you solely enjoy eating dirtballs.  What restaurant can you find nachos, pasta, pad thai and chicken dumpings all on the same menu?  Seriously...you can right here at the Factory.  It's VERY busy.  Expect to get a 'pager' and shop for a bit.  If you leave here without getting cheesecake, you will be sadly mistaken."
Michael C.,"Abington, PA",31,36,2,3.0,4/15/2008,"took my family to the cheesecake factory in the willow grove mall. Had heard wonderful things. But wasn't totally impressed. The foot doors and the 40 foot ceilings are a way out of control. Why would you want to do this to a restaurant? This is more like a dance club.  The service was pretty good. The place wasn't crowded, but was active. The prices were pretty high, but the amount of food they give you is beyond eatable in one sitting. Not sure if eatable is a word, but I think you get my meaning.  Seems weird, but the menus were very difficult to read. Not the print or design, but the advertisements and order. Every time you turned a page, you saw a listing of food and a full page add for something. Jewelry, cars, whatever. I found that tacky. Combined with the overdone decor, It wasn't my favorite atmosphere. But no big, to food was good. Except for the burger. My daughter ordered the Fun burger, which sounded fun. Actually, it's just a big mac, but looked really good. Unfortunately, they didn't cook it enough, and my stomach was turning all night. Yeah, I eat off everyones plate. mmmm. Anyway, if you go, make sure to order your burger well, be ready for a big tab, and a big meal."
