Sandra S.,"Tucson, AZ",4,17,,4.0,9/17/2017,Seated within 5 minutes on Sunday evening. Waitress came by several times until we were ready to order. Drinks within 5 minutes of order with free refills done without us asking. Food generous portions with prices in line with similar establishments.
carrie c.,"Horsham, PA",45,4,,2.0,9/26/2017,"The hostess on Saturday night, 9/23/17, was atrocious. My husband and I stood there for a good 30 minutes observing how she treated the customers approaching the podium. She never once greeted them. She stated ""name?"" And then proceeded to hand them a buzzer. She looked as if she just woke up- hair was everywhere- just a complete mess. After one polite man walked away she mumbled ""I should have went to church tonight."" Maybe if the owner would work on hiring professional and polite front staff, their ratings on Yelp would improve. I was embarrassed for her to be completely honest."
Candace S.,"Lansdale, PA",0,2,,1.0,8/4/2017,"Not that great at all!   The place was not full at all and we were seated next to a wall!   Our food was only mediocre, but the worst part was the cheesecake counter!!!   Could not even get a slice of cheesecake in a reasonable amount of time!   Left without it and bought it somewhere else that was even better than I can get there!    This was my 3rd attempt to eat at this 'upscale' place hoping to love it and disappointed every time.   The service was not good other times.    There are too many good places around to even consider going back!"
David W.,"Philadelphia, PA",54,198,619,2.0,7/1/2016,"This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory location. Very convenient for shopping at the Willow Grove Mall, but if I were in the Mall, I'd probably opt for one of the other places in the food court. Our server, Amanda, was great. Very attentive and friendly. Arriving in the early afternoon, we were seated immediately in the patio, at our request. Because of the brutal Mall landscaping (""keep it visible, and they will come""), there are of course no trees around the Mall. Ironic, given the history of Willow Grove Park. So the table umbrellas provide limited shade, and the metal table top - oh my, they can get hot in the sun. We had to move to another table where some shade was available, and Amanda nicely facilitated that. But my complaint is with the restaurant's pricing. For example, I thought the $3.00 coffee was not a good value for the quality, not that it was bad - but it wasn't really great either. The same applies to the other items we ordered. The Caesar Salad with chicken ($17) was very large, but reportedly had really dry chicken. The kids Mac n Cheese ($7) gives you a sense of the pricing range. Pricey - about 25% above comparable dining experiences, but without any distinguishing qualities justifying the pricing. There is an extensive menu, and the interior decoration of the restaurant itself looked spectacular, in a kind of touristy way, if you go for that sort of thing."
Amber M.,"Glendale, CA",0,9,,1.0,5/2/2017,"I went here with my mom last month and I am so disappointed. I wasn't expecting Michelin Star food but something decent and flavorful... I got the Jambalaya which is my go to... This time food was awful service was questionable and when I made mention of it to the server he(Hugo) didn't care and the manager was ""unavailable"". Definitely will not go back to this location. Oh and the drinks were watered down. If the food is going to suck at least make me a little tipsy so I won't care as much :/"
Chrissy M.,"Voorhees, NJ",15,5,4,5.0,3/23/2017,"The bartenders rock. Kevin and Kristen in particular. Every drink is made to perfection, just as your order it. The food is always amazing and comes out very quickly! We love it there! The avocado eggs rolls are our favorite, any pasta dish, or the BBQ chicken salad are my go to's. And of course the cheesecake is delish!"
David S.,"Furlong, PA",54,21,2,3.0,3/19/2017,Awesome menu. Been going there so many times. One major flaw? They don't take reservations. No matter how good you are as a customer. I wish they would accept reservations.
Steve k.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,6,1,2.0,1/2/2017,"Probably deserves a 2.5 because the food was pretty good, but no 1/2 stars on Yelp. Anyway, had a few problems with this visit. 1st the check in hostess seemed a bit short. Sort of odd to assign a person not all that friendly to that position. Aside from that, we experienced multiple errors with our order & if felt like the wait staff is over worked. (Too many tables per waiter/waitress) This is the 2nd time we've had a less than ideal experience at this location. If you are dead set on eating at the CF ... I'd suggest hopping the bridge and going to the Cherry Hill NJ location."
Amanda N.,"Morrisville, PA",1,32,,2.0,1/28/2017,"My review on The Cheesecake Factory would get an A++ when it came to the service I received while dining last night.  The waitress was extremely nice and attentive.  But, alas, my review is 2 stars because of the food. Before I was a vegetarian, I really enjoyed the CF.  The chicken and dumplings were de-licious.  Last night my friend and I were meeting at a local Vietnamese restaurant, but they happened to be closed for the Chinese New Year (sad face).  So we opted to go here instead.  I thought to myself 'I just saw someone on youtube raving about their veggie burger - I have to try it!!' No.  No, no, no.  It was not de-licious.  It was probably the worst veggie burger I've had.  I'm not sure why restaurants feel like people who don't eat meat want a mushed together patty of rice and some other vegetables I couldn't even tell you were in their based on taste.  That doesn't replicate a burger at all.  I sadly would have been happier going to Red Robin.  So there's the lesson you can take away from this review - if you are a veghead and want a burger you are going to enjoy - skip the Cheesecake Factory and head directly to the nearest Red Robin and order their Boca burger!"
Alex H.,"Narberth, PA",96,431,86,2.0,12/2/2015,"Wasn't that thrilled with last nights dinner. The service was ok but nothing special. Hostess staff was very friendly upon arrival and also when we left.  This dinner was just bleh. The kids pasta was dry and really lacking sauce as was my wife's chicken Romano dinner. She liked the chicken but really didn't touch the noodles. We took them with us so we could add sauce at home for leftovers. My burger topped with fontina cheese and Caramelized onions and mushrooms was cooked medium as requested but it was dry too. No burger juice! The side salad was fresh and properly dressed. My moms spicy chili salmon was good all around, maybe a bit too much cabbage on the side but otherwise very good.  We didn't do dessert as our little boy needed to get home to sleep but boy did all of those choices look good! With so many options to try we will be back but we will stay away from the pasta and burger dishes."
Justine H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,1,5.0,8/9/2017,"Food was awesome. I placed a an order for pickup. It ended up sitting for a while due to traffic. It was well over 30mins by the time i got home. I was too hungry to reheat it and it was still great. I would bet it would be even better fresh and hot. The strawberry cheesecake was great! Most places serve dry crumbly new york style, which i hate, theirs is the direct opposite"
Samuel L.,"North Wales, PA",6,51,14,1.0,6/4/2016,"Sorely disappointed.  Each time I come back to this location the service seems to get worse. The saving grace was that the food was good, well seasoned, carefully presented. This time service was typical, typically bad. OK, not unexpected. The food was warm, always a plus, I've been served ice cold frozen food at a restaurant before. But that's food prep basics. I ordered fish and chips.  The pros: the fish and fries were crispy and warm. The cons: Salty, greasy, yet magically flavorless. Cole slaw was not cold. It was julienned veggies that weren't even properly cut. No acid in the slaw at all. Tasted like it was tossed in mayo, no salt, no vinegar, no citrus, just mayo. I tried one of my kid's chicken strip. A more appropriate name would have been deep fried chicken jerky. Salty and nasty. Maybe the person in charge of the Fryolater was having a horrid day. Whatever the cause it was a bad meal."
Sue N.,"Buckingham, PA",0,4,1,3.0,3/1/2017,Now that they have every item calorically rate it spoils the whole experience! And who would eat the cheesecake st a whopping 1400 calories?  Terrible.
Peter N.,"Willow Grove, PA",123,207,1116,3.0,9/23/2014,"I like the Cheesecake Factory - large menu, big space, and pretty big portions. Growing up, I used to think it was the best restaurant ever.  2 hour wait? Sure ill stand by. But those times have changed.  The above are all still true, but man, it is pricey.  Now that I've gone out and tasted the world, I recognized that the Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant that is trying to charge fine dining prices.  $13 for a burrito?? No thanks.  I still thoroughly enjoy their Cobb salad, my go to entree.  Portion is huge and the dispersement of dressing is perfect.  Their lunch specials are a pretty good deal as well and a decent size.   My wife got a vegetable pasta for $15 and wow. It's literally just thin spaghetti, creamy garlic sauce, and a few vegetables.  Pretty overpriced.  She ordered it without Parmesan, but it was brought out with it.  She already took a bite. Waitress said she'll have another sent out and we kept the cheesy one.  We ultimately were charged for both, but it doesn't matter - we did eat them both (shared amongst table). As for appetizers, the avocado eggs rolls are a must -  I have never seen this anywhere else.  6 halves for $12 is a bit steep, but worth it. The wait staff was extremely friendly and attentive.  Came back numerous times to check on the table.  So that is definitely a plus. I go here regularly because I really do enjoy the salad, staff and convenience.  But forget about a Friday/Saturday night - the wait can be long.  I'd recommend this place for casual or even group dining, which is the only time I really go.  Decent food, but not spectacular. If looking for an authentic and romantic atmosphere, seek else wh"
Ana W.,"Hatboro, PA",55,37,15,2.0,3/19/2016,"Went here with my best friend on a sunday night. We waited almost one hour to be seated, and people that came in before us were seated first, mind you we were only a party of two. When I asked the hostess about it, she told me I was wrong and that we would be called when its our turn. The service was very unprofessional and the prices were outrageous for the portion size and the quality of food. You can tell everything is pre made, nothing fresh and probably nothing prepared on premise. The cheesecake was a small portion, and especially for almost 8 dollars, I want my money's worth.  The drink menu was  overpriced, and there were no prices on the actual cocktail section I actually had to ask my server, who didn't even have a clue. The food was soggy and had way too much sodium in it. The bread that was served to us was hard as a rock, and I actually CUT the top of my mouths' gum open trying to eat it, it was that hard. And the bread was tasteless. Overall, my best friend and I agreed, there are better places around in Willow Grove to go to. This was not worth the price, and I would not go back."
Elyse B.,"Philadelphia, PA",133,57,3,4.0,8/22/2016,"We don't typically visit many chain restaurants, but my in-laws like this place so we went with them. The food was fine, definitely nothing outstanding but fine.  We were in a party of 11, and either the restaurant or our specific server didn't use seating numbers when entering in the order, so that they had to ""raffle off"" the food when it came. Seeing as Cheesecake Factory is such a large company, I would have thought they'd use seating numbers to distribute the food instead of interrupting everyone to ask who had ordered what. So much more enjoyable for the patrons and much easier for their staff. I did like that they had a decent selection of gluten-free options, which was appreciated. The atmosphere is enjoyable, and everyone in the family seemed to have a nice time."
Sandy H.,"New York, NY",0,7,,4.0,1/16/2017,Everytime I come here with great expectation! I love pasta and hibachi steak :) they also have great salted caramel cheesecake !!
Jennifer K.,"Jamison, PA",105,80,665,3.0,5/14/2016,"Their lunch menu includes a wide variety of food to choose from. My to-go to meal is Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta. It is always delicious. The problem with this restaurant is that your experience really depends on which waitor/waitress you end up with. You can end up with one who doesn't care about you and whether or not you enjoy your food or not. There is no consistency with the staff members. The other problem is that they got me cold, hard bread before. I complained and they told me that it will take me 20 minutes to give me fresh bread. I was disappointed with my meal that day."
Precious D.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,19,4,1.0,10/9/2016,I enjoy one thing at the reataurant and that's the red velvet cheesecake however once I saw the calorie and fat count I don't bother going there at all
Syreeta B.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,31,73,4.0,7/2/2016,I came here with family. We all ordered from the regular menu. The portions are huge. The food was fresh and did not take that long. The server was very nice. The music was kind of loud but I guess that may be because it is not that crowded. My sandwich was okay but may have been a little better if the shrimp were not slightly over cooked. I also got the banana cream cheese cake. It was very good and not overly sweet.
