Shardai G.,"Philadelphia, PA",75,169,169,1.0,4/9/2016,"The service is subpar, and equally the food. I have visited numerous times and each time the experience has been substandard (not insane, just have been invited for gatherings). The waiters are not equally attentive and the food is overcooked with little flavor. The prices aren't justified considering quality of food. I will staunchly avoid going to this restaurant and will not suggest others to dine here. Not only had I had bad experiences but others had grievances as well."
Ravindran C.,"Willow Grove, PA",3,29,7,4.0,5/15/2016,"Well.. the first thing is - for whatever rhyme or reasons, this turns out to be a hangout spot whenever my friends come visiting in to my place. And so far, it has not been a disappointing experience any time. This place is pretty crowded for the most part of the time - regardless of the day of the week you walk into. And the not so nice part is that they don't take in reservations. So, you are definitely getting a raw deal if you are not able to plan much for a free form dining. The ambience of the place in itself is pretty good - and also, appears to be kind of standardized all over. I have not seen a different ambience at different Cheesecake factory outlets so far. As for the parking - you definitely get the parking space from the mall :) You do have a deal of outdoor dining in an explicit fashion for the summers and there is also an ""outdoosy"" feel from the mini out door setup within the mall side of the area that is OUTSIDE of the restaurant area itself :D   Moving out to the food portion of it - I must admit that though I have been here multiple times with multiple people, I haven't quite tried a lot of stuff myself. So, some of the review here should be a combination of what I have eaten plus what my friends had along with me. The freshly squeezed orange juice - it is a class apart. You don't get to have automatic refills. But I can safely bet you would only be asking for more when you have a sip of it. Chicken di pana - thin slices of breaded chicken cooked to perfection in a white wine sauce. The serving size is pretty generous and therefore, you might even be left wondering how you would be able to complete the accompanying broccoli and mashed potatoes Veggie Burger - This is par excellence. Neatly done patties that seem to be quite freshly made from a combination of rice and beans. Brought in with sliced onions, lettuce, tomatoes and jalapenos. The patty is topped with a cheese - and I believe you can let them know your choice of it.  They have a very extensive menu and I am not hoping to try out everything even with all combinations of folks eating out with me! However, I promise to edit and repost as and when I keep trying newer items"
Daniel A.,"Abington, PA",0,53,17,3.0,10/25/2016,"We've been here enough times as it is local to have tried a good variety of their menu.  First, the menu is huge and should accommodate anyone.  Food prices are fair but the beer is too expensive. I believe they charged $7 for a bottle of yeungling lager. I rarely drink but the Diet Coke I ordered was no good (tasted old) so I decided to send it back and get the beer.  Like most people, we eat quickly so we can get to the dessert. The cakes are all amazing. I would usually get the ""low carb"" cheesecake and it is always good. We came for our sons bday recently and shared the ""tuxedo"" cheesecake. It was phenomenal."
Robert G.,"North Wales, PA",1,71,314,4.0,2/12/2015,"This place rarely disappoints. They have a huge menu that varies from Chinese to Thai to Italian to American cuisine. Everything under one roof. You pretty much can point to anything on their menu and it will come out very delicious. Highly recommend; (apps) Avocado Eggrolls, Thai Chicken lettuce wraps, Ceasar Salad, BBQ Chicken Ranch Salad. For main dish, can't go wrong with; Chicken Madeira, Orange Chicken, Chicken Marsala and Hibachi Steak (one of my favs). Their portion size is a bit intimidating, we always end up having leftovers the next day.  Only one tip, definitely come here before the dinner crowd or you''l be waiting from 45 minutes to over an hour for a table. And save room for dessert, they have some amazing assortments of cheesecakes."
Mary J.,"Blue Bell, PA",63,115,3,3.0,8/4/2016,"this place is okay, we got in on a Monday which was great because we had no line etc. The food is kind of expensive for what it is, and the desert ins't that great at all. i think i enjoyed the food more then the desert."
Kay W.,"Abington, PA",15,52,8,4.0,4/7/2017,Sunday brunch the best! Clean  get the waffles/ ask for buffalo strips (dry)  chicken and waffles the best!
Nina D.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,16,,5.0,4/30/2016,"I LOVE LOVE this place,,,, cheesecake selection  OMG ,,,,, this place has the best cheesecake EVER!!!!!! I have been to many different different locations but this one is my favorite."
G W.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,6,,2.0,8/8/2015,"This review pertains to the takeout ONLY. My avocado eggrolls looked like an experiment gone wrong. In addition, they were soggy, not crispy. The bed of rice noodles were extra stale. I feel like I got the reject batch that the cook screwed up on and couldn't serve to the guests because they could actually see their food and complain about it before paying for it, whereas I could not. Typically the food does not disappoint.....but whoever was responsible for cooking tonight (around 8pm) needs to be re-evaluated. Currently not too thrilled to re-order."
C C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",8,225,281,3.0,9/15/2015,"I stopped by for lunch on a weekday. They weren't very busy, and we were quickly seated. Our server was nice, and the service was timely. We were served bread first, and it was delicious. Warm and soft, it tasted like it was fresh out of the oven. There were two kinds, one brown and one white. Both were good, but I liked the brown better. It was a little sweet. I did enjoy the crisper crust of the white bread, though. I ordered the Thai lettuce wraps. My sister had a kale and quinoa salad, and my mom ordered a turkey sandwich off the ""skinny menu."" I was pretty happy with my choice; as a shareable appetizer, it was actually a lot for one person. The three sauces were delicious and so flavorful. The vegetables were fresh, and the red cabbage was particularly delicious since it's usually so tough in texture. Unfortunately, the texture of the noodles was not good--they weren't chewy at all. It tasted like they'd been refrigerated to cool down quickly. The salad was good, but the dressing made it a little too salty. My mom enjoyed her burger, but I guess there was a caloric price to pay because it looked really small and sad on a large plate. I don't think she was full, either. So bottom line for the entrées of the day is, yummy with some drawbacks. And of course we had to get dessert. This is the only restaurant we ever get dessert. And on those rare occasions in other restaurants when we get dessert, we always get one to share. But at the Cheesecake Factory, each person gets his or her own cheesecake slice. My sister got the strawberry, my mom got caramel du leche, and I ordered the 30th anniversary one, which is cheesecake layered with chocolate cake. The crust is made of chocolate in various forms. It was so rich, I couldn't get in more than a few bites. But for the next few days, I had a delicious treat in the fridge! Everyone else enjoyed their cheesecake, too. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other cheesecakes! The rest of the meal seems only a formality for me."
Jackie P.,"Bensalem, PA",0,2,,1.0,6/2/2016,"Did not enjoy it at all.  We went for our anniversary dinner and they sat us in the mall seating?  Who does that?  They did move us when i complained.  If I wanted to eat in a food court I would not have gone to a restaurant.  Had the appetizers and they were good then ordered the steak medium.  Steak came out rare and was very tough. Could not cut it at all. I mean you would have needed a saw to cut through this thing.  I was really looking forward to having dinner here paid over the top money for dinner and did not enjoy it at all.  They did not charge me for my steak dinner and did comp my desert, which ended up upsetting my stomach.  Needless to say  I would never ever go there again.  I've had better steak at Applebee's in Bensalem for much less money and much better seating and have never left feeling sick."
Brandy N.,"Niagara Falls, Canada",0,36,8,5.0,8/27/2016,"We enjoy our meals every visit! Most of the time I go with the eggroll sampler, which I have cravings for often. Another fave is the miso salmon, sauce is incredible! Hubby tries something different almost every visit, and is always satisfied with his food. Warm buttered wheat bread is also great!.. We never eat the white bread, just ask to substitute for extra wheat.  Cheesecake is good, I have tried others here, but classic strawberry is my fave. Generous size, after dinner one slice is enough to share.. I was a bit disappointed to find out from a worker that the cheesecake is not made fresh there, it is delivered frozen. Considering it is the ""Cheesecake Factory"".. But I guess that's expected considering they are a chain.  Ambience is nice, soft lighting and nice music. Although always super noisy and packed whenever we go. Our first visit we were seated at one of those tightly packed tables, very uncomfortable sitting so close to people on both sides, too intimate. We could hear the whole conversation of both parties. Now we always wait for booth seating even if it takes an extra few minutes. And if it's a nice day out, outdoor seating is also much quieter, and you rarely have to wait to be seated.  Food is reasonably priced and portions are generous."
Saemyi J.,"Philadelphia, PA",342,56,96,5.0,10/2/2015,There aren't that many decent brunch place in the suburbs so cheesecake factory is my spot on sunday! It has the BEST sunday brunch menu!! I highly recommend the Monte Cristo.... enough said (fyu brunch is only served on Sundays)
Nary K.,"Philadelphia, PA",47,36,81,3.0,5/9/2016,"Came here for Mother's Day brunch. The wait wasn't too long, appx 10 minutes. I would've rather waited longer at a better restaurant. I usually have a good experience here but this time, something was not quite right with the food. I ordered a brunch special- chicken and waffles with eggs Benedict. Sounds delicious right? Nope! The waffles were ok. The chicken was moist but was smothered in the hollandaise sauce so I couldn't taste the flavor of the chicken. I don't understand the little potatoes they give you as a side  why not regular size potatoes or hash browns? Anyway, my husband ordered a breakfast combo, pancakes, eggs and bacon. Nothing spectacular. The best part of my meal was the carrot cake I ordered to go. Despite the less than mediocre food, I'd still go back b/c their menu is so extensive that I could try something different each time and hope it tastes good. *the waitress was very nice and attentive."
Frank P.,"Warrington, PA",0,54,18,3.0,6/26/2016,"Nice place, service was very good too. Food was good although we just had burgers. Had 1 adult beverage and it was well made, daughter had the strawberry lemonade for $5 which was too sweet for me. All in all I liked the place but dinged it for the prices. In my opinion $110 for a family of 5 (3 adults, 2 kids) was a bit much."
Sd P.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,29,,3.0,6/25/2016,"I been going to Cheesecake Factory for years, so I took few friends who never been there before the experience this time was definitely not 4 stars it was More like 2. First of all, our waiter was so in rush he didn't show much interest until it was check time, very disappointed with service today. First 20 minutes we waited for bread and butter to show up!! Even that I had to ask him:( he was stopping at the table for split second and run to the next one!! He became all nice and sweet at the end, my friends were not amazed with either service or food. Cheesecake Factory used to be really good not sure what happened. I won't be going to Cheesecake Factory near future."
Sharia W.,"Philadelphia, PA",26,49,272,5.0,6/9/2015,"Its the Cheesecake factory, what could I really say? I love it and I will continue to go here every chance I get. I pretty much had everything on the menu here as well as the drinks. The service for the most part is pretty good even when its busy."
Emily S.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,24,4,4.0,11/22/2015,"Although it's a chain, I wanted to comment on this. The wait is always very long but that is so be expected. However, when you are seated you will not be disappointed. The menu is huge and the food is amazing! We had a great waitress on our latest visit.  Being such a high volume restaurant, they really do accommodate guests!"
Patricia B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,,1.0,7/22/2016,"Beyond disappointing!! If I could give no stars...I would. It was the worst expensive lunch we ever had. The service was horrblie...we were forgotten and ignored. Food took over 45 minutes to come out and they were not even busy.  I highly suggest that you ask the price of their alcoholic drinks before ordering. A 5 oz. daquiri should not cost $8.95 and could not taste any alcohol in it. And my watered-down-all- ice (even though I specifically told the waitress very little ice) sangria was $10.25!!!  I think I may have gotten about 3 oz.of drink, if that .And the six small pieces of cheese bread costs no where near to $8.95 - and charging $3 for seltzer water with lemon is outrageous.  The portions were average to very little. The Asian Lettuce Wraps was bascially lettuce filled with rice noodles - the piece of chicken was literally 2 bites. The Chicken & Biscuits was served with burnt bottoms (biscuits).  I know we could have complained to the wiatress but she was no where and I mean no where to be found the entire time we were eating.  We had to wave her down as she passed by to get our check.  She never came back for payment so I went to the hostess to pay - was informed she can not take payment and must pay the waitress. I explained we had been waiting for her to come back to our table for over 10 minutes. The hostess did not ask who our waitress was or offer to get her for us.  I took the opprotunity to air all of my complaints to the hostess. And, all we got was ""Oh, I'm sorry.""  Really??  The manager was standing behind her as I voiced my complaints and did not say or do anything just ignored me - not even help with finding our waitress to pay our bill.   So, I actually had to track our waitress down in  the restaurant to pay the check.  Definitely not ever going back!!!!!"
Rachel Minhua W.,"Philadelphia, PA",37,66,14,1.0,2/23/2015,"Wow. This place sure knows how to disappoint. The food is so bland. My boyfriend and I ordered 2 apps, 1 entree each, a root beer, and a mai tai.  The apps were decent, I guess. We got the calamari and the portabella mushroom, avocado and zucchini fries. Both were breaded in the same fashion and both of them has a rather smoky (not in a good way but like they re-used the oil a few times too many) flavor.  My boyfriend got a kobe burger and it was big but bland. No flavor. He asked for a medium rare and it came out rare. He would've ordered a steak if he wanted rare. The fries were also terrible. How do you mess up on french fries? I got a dish that is supposedly ""shepherd's pie"" but it was definitely not. It was just patty meat chopped up in gravy with mash on top. Disappointing.  The only reason why I even gave a star was because the waitress was so sweet. But I came here for food not to make a friend.  I will not be coming back unless if I'm there to pick up some dessert. You'll probably find me at the food court because at least I know what I'm getting and that it'll actually have some flavor."
Vy D.,"Philadelphia, PA",397,123,361,4.0,1/27/2014,"Moral of the story: Haters gonna hate Story: My lovely mother decided to finally eat at a place that does not serve Vietnamese food for once in celebration of her birthday. Excitedly, I asked which cuisine she had decided on for me to take her to. In her cute Vietnamese accent, ""CHEESECAKE!,"" she announced. In my head, I cringed. Aside from their cheesecakes, I have not eaten here for a long time. So I then silently chanted these thoughts during our car ride: +Ridiculous long lines +Horrible service +Fusion food gone wrong +Uneatable humongous portions  On this particular night, all of my preconceived notions about CF were defied. We arrived on a weekday's night and were seated immediately much to my amazement. We avoided the usual hordes of hungry patrons holding their buzzers standing around the entrance and exit on any given weekend's night.  The quality of food was well-executed. I ordered the bang-bang chicken and shrimp served with brown rice, chile, curry, coconut, and sautéed vegetables. It was very flavorful. I finished it all! Also ordered the vegetarian burger and salads and enjoyed every bite. Washed it all down with a glass of delicious red wine sangria. We then finished off with a heavenly slice of dulce de leche caramel cheesecake.  Our server, Olena, was extraordinary. Her genuine friendliness and helpfulness was truly appreciated. She paid attention to the small details of our dining experience. It was truly exceptional service for any restaurant, especially a chain.  Lesson learned- so whatever mom wants she gets. And moms are usually right."
