Jordan G.,"Huntingdon Valley, PA",29,26,5,4.0,10/28/2015,"They deal with their customers perfectly.  The food may be on the expensive side but it is well above worth it.  Although it's called ""The Cheesecake Factory"" their deserts consist too much of the normal desert items on the menu or any other resteraunt of it's type.  I believe if they add more specialty desert and dinner items, they will bring in more customers as well as myself more often."
Edward P.,"West Chester, PA",5,92,18,1.0,4/11/2015,"My wife and I go to cheesecake factory at least 2 times a month. It was quite disappointing after our last experience there. My wife and I ordered the nachos as an appetizer. As we were finishing them up, we then ordered our entrées. Unfortunately my wife started getting a little queasy and sick and requested our meals to go. When we got home we both felt very sick to the point where we spent the remainder if the night in the bathroom. The two meals we brought home (Chicken Bellagio) went to waste since we didnt want to take any chances the next day eating them. I called and spoke to the manager Allie and explained what had happened. Unfortunately she did nothing to rectify the situation. Over all, we are quite dissatisfied and will never return again to any Cheesecake Factory establishment."
Tori S.,"Glenside, PA",15,49,20,4.0,2/16/2015,"Maybe it's just because I moved from hicksville and we didn't have anywhere to eat except for the Olive Garden, but I love Cheesecake Factory. Huge menu and nice, attentive waitstaff. Especially love the mac and cheese burger + sweet potato fries. We always take a slice of cheesecake to go and split at home because we leave way too stuffed."
Will D.,"Philadelphia, PA",262,5,,2.0,6/20/2016,"Service - bad service, took 30 min to get our bread, had to reach for another plate at a different table, waitress spilled steak plate sauce on my white ultraboost shoes and didn't even notice.   Food -  It was good but it was not what I asked for.  I Ordered the steak Diane medium rare but received it medium well. It took 1 hour to receive our meals for a table of 5.  By the time the food came,  my dad had already fallen asleep.  Experience - I didn't have a good time eating at this cheese cake factory."
Rose F.,"Horsham, PA",12,3,,1.0,6/12/2016,Arrived at 5:20 with a party of 6 adults and 3 children under 3 advised 30 to 45 minute wait.  Waited 90 minutes after checking a couple times for updates.   Seated I two separate tables just so the children could eat.  Service was POOR start to finish.
Nichole G.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",30,20,24,4.0,7/4/2015,"I love this place! No matter what CCF I go to the staff is always nice and friendly. Plus, I am addicted the Chris Outrageous Cheese cake"

john b.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,37,1,1.0,5/1/2016,What can be said about Cheesecake Factory that isn't already known. The food is overpriced and bland. The service is slow and terrible. The wait is obscene. Waited for an hour at 12:30 on a Sunday afternoon despite originally being told there would be little to no wait. How does this place even stay in business?
Jennifer S.,"Perkasie, PA",6,18,5,3.0,9/25/2016,"Our large party was excited to sit outside on a perfect fall day, but we had to move inside due to the stench of the sewer nearby. However, the staff quickly moved us inside. The food was delicious, except for the over-priced and tasteless grilled artichoke. $11.50 for perhaps a tablespoon of artichoke!  Our server was quite cocky and gave us our desserts in takeout containers since he said we'd probably only eat half. This was true, but it felt like a picnic, eating our desserts out of to-go containers WITH PLASTIC FORKS."
N M.,"Elkins Park, PA",0,1,,1.0,8/6/2016,"As much as I like their cakes and especially the strawberry shortcake, I don't think I will ever be going back there. After having lunch one day, my husband and I decided to get some cake to go on the way out. Well, there was a man behind the counter and he was cleaning up and then tying a trash bag. He had gloves on--great! Except then, after another person took our order, the first man took out a to go box with the same gloves that he used to clean and tie the trash bag and picked up a slice of cake, (with those same gloves!) and put it in that box. Personally, I think that is unacceptable.  Several months later, we came back hoping things have changed for the better. Did they? Only in my dreams, unfortunately. My husband came to pick up a to-go order of strawberry shortcake. The lady behind the counter didn't know how to make it so she asked her co-worker; fine. However, there was about 1tbsp of strawberries left in their container so she poured it all out into the little box. My husband mentioned that it probably won't be enough. She said, ""this is how much we give everyone"" after just minutes earlier saying that she didn't know how to make it. AND, we've gotten strawberry shortcake before and it certainly comes with more than just 1 cut-up strawberry! The manager happened to walk by; she whispered something into his ear, he gave my husband a dirty look and walked off. Another man, who was cleaning the counters,  chopped up 2 more strawberries (without changing gloves or washing his hands) and added them to what was already in the container. Yuck. Then, he went, took orders, came back and with the same gloves, continued to put cakes for people; obviously he touched the cakes.  I don't know about anyone else, but personally, I don't find it very sanitary to ties garbage bags, wash counters and then use the same gloves to touch people's food. I mean, they're gloves! You're not even washing your hands, just changing them! Is it really that big of a deal?!  I know some of you may think I'm making more of this than I should and maybe I'm a little too much of a germaphobe, but personally, when I see hygiene complaints on reviews, I avoid places because really, it's unacceptable."
Chris K.,"Philadelphia, PA",287,5,,1.0,3/22/2015,"Still at the restaurant here for dinner on a Sunday night. This review is not relevant to the quality of the food, but the quality of the service. We arrived at 7pm with a party of 8 and were told that our wait would be 20 minutes. We checked in with the hostess about 2-3 times over the next half hour, and was told each time that our table was almost ready. It wasn't until 8pm that we were finally seated. Service was fine getting our drinks out in a timely manner. However, when the bread and butter was brought out, we still had no silverware at our table. After waiting a few minutes unnoticed, we pulled a waitress aside and asked for silverware/table settings. No one had even noticed that we were without table settings. 5 minutes later, a waiter/busboy(?), came out and plopped two napkins full of silverware at one end of the table and left. No settings were placed, an no one followed up with us.  I have never felt so disrespected at a restaurant. Honestly, Chick Fil-A gives me better service than this. It is now 8:42pm and our entrees have just come out. Maybe if the service through the rest of the night improves I will consider changing this review or writing a new review."
Jamie C.,"Vancouver, Canada",23,60,138,4.0,12/2/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is our go to restaurant when shopping at the Willow Grove Mall. My mom and I like to go on Sundays when they offer the extended breakfast/brunch menu.  Recently we went in and they offered a free cheesecake slice gift card for purchasing a $25+ gift card.  We ran into this deal a few times in the past holiday seasons so I bought a gift card and was able to use the gift card right away, but the cheesecake voucher cannot be used the same day.  Which is fine with me, I can wait till later to use it! My favorites from the ""Brunch"" menu which is offered only on Sundays until 3pm are the Bruleed French Toast, Lemon-Ricotta Pancake, and the Baja Chicken Hash. The Bruleed French Toast is humongous... well, most of their dishes are, but I've never finished the french toast in one sitting.  It's not an overpowering creme brulee flavor, but just the right amount.   Same goes for the Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes.  It has a faint lemon and ricotta taste.  I love lemon flavors in pastries and breakfast items so this is definitely one of my favorites!  It's usually topped with sliced strawberries but I've seen people ask for different fruit toppings and they weren't charged extra for the replacement. For both the sweet brunch dishes, you don't get any savory sides with them, but you can order meat or a breakfast side if you'd like.  I think the french toast actually does apprear again on the menu with a side included, but I've never ordered it that way. If I'm not in the mood for something sweet, I always get the Baja Chicken Hash for brunch.  It's a generous portion with two large crisp tortillas topped with veggies, chicken, beans, and poached eggs.  So delicious! Aside from the brunch menu, Cheesecake Factory has so many different options on their menu... it'll take you a while to look through everything if it's your first time, but everything is really pretty tasty :)  My favorites on regular menu: Miso Salmon Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta Chicken Bellagio Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club Sandwich Enjoy!"
Joe A.,"Philadelphia, PA",7,16,,4.0,7/9/2015,"Went on Friday at 3 Seated right away, Drink;s right away,  Wife wanted a few more minutes to order, and the waitress was by a few times. Sheperds pie was real good, and the wife's Beef Medalions  were excellent in her word's The waitress was a doll. Haven't been to a cheesecake factory in quite a few year;s, as we used to go to the Inner Harbour one in Baltimore, which was always good. Still consistently good food, and good service"
Rachel S.,"Warminster, PA",4,33,3,3.0,5/14/2015,The cheesecake that I have tasted which was the banana cream was amazing! I had my first slice almost 3 summers ago and still remember it. I go back everyone few months and recently I have only had meals and a few drinks.  The drinks they serve are amazing and dinner was good. On holidays like today they are incredibly busy which put a damper on the experience. The woman upfront at the cheesecake part of the restaurant was unfriendly and had very few words. Maybe it's because it was so busy but shouldn't she have expected that on a holiday?
Natalie S.,"Philadelphia, PA",20,123,467,3.0,3/28/2015,The food was ok today. I wasn't wowed. The service was very slow. My favorite thing to eat here today was the fried mac and cheese balls. The cheesecakes were very good though as usual. Marshmallow meringue cheesecake and caramel apple streusel cheesecake. Very good.
Carolyn T.,"Cheltenham, PA",3,3,1,1.0,8/11/2015,"I just had one of my worst dining experiences at this restaurant. My boyfriend and I had a table outside and waited for almost an hour for our food. I ordered the tomato basil pasta and he had the Steak Diane and salmon. When the food finally arrived, both our dishes were slightly cold and his steak was over-cooked. We told the waitress who took his dish back to the kitchen. The pasta wasn't too bad so we kept it. Until I noticed there was a stray spaghetti noodle in the penne. We called the waitress over who had a long explanation of how it ""happens all the time."" Finally, my boyfriend's dish was replaced. The steak was not flavorful at all and not worth the money we paid for it. We finished our meals and left incredibly dissatisfied. We forgot about the whole experience until, a few hours later, my boyfriend began to experience a stomach ache and eventually developed nausea. Over the course of the next 10 hours, he has had intense stomach pain and threw up five times. He didn't eat anything the entire day besides the steak dish which led to one conclusion: he got food poisoning from the Cheesecake Factory. If you're in the market for food poisoning and a horrible dining experience, then I'd recommend this location. Meanwhile, I am in the process of filing a report with the local health department."
Claude H.,"Anchorage, AK",50,131,47,3.0,9/1/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is a chain - and honestly, feels like one to the core.  This particular one doesn't stand out for me - lacks the ""feel"" of the one I grew most familiar with in Miami - and has a certain ""roughness"" around the edges.  Sitting us outside the restaurant not in ""outside seating"" but actually ""in the mall"" didn't really do it for me. The food is ""okay"".  Cheesecake standard stuff - honestly, the menu is pretty much ""to large"" for many groups.  And I've had inconsistent results.  Nothing that stood out as especially 'bad', but likewise - nothing that makes it a memorable visit either.   i go here mostly for folks that are visiting and have never been to a Cheesecake Factory.  Most of them really seem to love the Cheesecake, so I guess that is a good thing with the name. I think overall - my tone of dissatisfaction is with the Price vs. value.  They attempt to market themselves as something .. elegant, etc. But while the environment is generally nice, the food just isn't worth it.   And perhaps I'm not the standard customer - but atmosphere without taste and food isn't going to win me over.  Not for a restaurant."
Jeff A.,"Southampton, PA",19,40,7,5.0,8/11/2015,Very diversified menu. Excellent service. Leave room for dessert. Margot was our waitress and she treated us extra special as we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary.
Christina V.,"Philadelphia, PA",264,158,120,2.0,7/24/2014,"Came here with my boyfriend on a whim because we couldn't figure out what we wanted to eat.  I normally dislike chain restaurants but this place is the exception.  We had appetizers for dinner and it was the perfect choice.  We got the fried mozzerlla, tex mex spring rolls and fried chicken sliders.  All were great.  Service was fast and friendly, food came out quickly and everything was flavorful.  Unfortunately when we left, about 15 staff members decided it was more important to gather behind the restaurant near the dumpsters and fight WWE style (all while recording video on their phones) instead of do dishes/cook food/or serve patrons.  Um what? Yes. 15 of them, all dressed in white, out back, during a work shift, rolling around on the ground - fighting.  The only reason this is getting 2 stars is because the chicken sliders were the bomb and our server was great. The highschool fightclub going on out back? ""Eek! Methinks not."" Honestly, had it not been for wrestlemania, this place would get 3 stars."
Steve D.,"Hatboro, PA",151,244,230,3.0,8/11/2015,Cheesecake factory is extremely consistent as far as I'm concered. They also make a great burger for a reasonable price . Solid all around. Great service too.
