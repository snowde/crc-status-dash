Priya M.,"Orlando, FL",125,91,800,4.0,12/20/2017,"So I know CF is a chain but it is one that the hubs and I love. I am kind of surprised at all the bad reviews as we've had nothing but pleasant experiences each time we've visited. This last visit was a Friday night and we were told there was a 45 minute wait (not horrible).  So we broke our evening down like this, and it worked out perfectly: We made our way to the bar and while waiting for a drink 2 people left and we were able to take their seats, score! While sipping on some wine we decided we were a little hungry and ordered 2 small plates, the dynamite shrimp and crab cake bites. Both were delicious and perfect size for just us two! Shortly after finishing our appetizers our buzzer went off and our table was ready! Our waitress was sweet and attentive. My husband ordered the pasta Alfredo with chicken on the side (he's just picky like that) and I ordered the crispy chicken costoletta with sautéed spinach and mashed potatoes. We didn't really need to but who can resist their delicious bread?? By the time we finished our entrees came out. My husband loved his pasta! I was amazed that my dish came with 3 pieces of chicken -- holy leftovers! The lemon butter sauce was delicious so of course I had to ask for more to accompany my chicken (as well as to take home).  So by this time you're probably thinking how could we eat any more?? But yes we had to share a slice of cheesecake. Now remember, their small plates aren't that heavy so you can get that, eat 1/4-1/2 of your dinner, and still get dessert (shoot I had a couple bites and had to take the rest home). They were running a little low on choices however they had their Celebration cheesecake which was PERFECT for me! It had just the right amount of cheesecake, vanilla cake, and mousse in it. So yummy!  We will definitely be back to visit!"
Jorge Q.,"Deltona, FL",33,4,20,3.0,12/22/2017,"So for my girlfriend's cousin's birthday we decided to visit the cheesecake factory and I have to be honest with my review as much as I've had good experiences before with them. So we get there and there was already a long line of guests waiting to be attended and seated which is usually expected because of this location's popularity. We checked in and waited easily over an hour to be seated and attended to which is not great when it's a birthday party situation. Even when we were finally seated the timing of the service was off. That would be the main and most important issue with this visit especially since we saved our appetite for this place. I had the macaroni with cheese and it lacked cheese and flavor, everyone else at the table liked their dish for the most part. On the bright side everything was fresh. In conclusion the only bad thing I can say was the waiting time on every aspect of the experience, other than that everything else was ok."
Alison B.,"Orlando, FL",101,103,7,3.0,12/8/2017,"Any visit to The Cheesecake Factory is a good one. I'm not big on chain restaurants but I love this one, it is truly in a league of its own. I don't know, the ridiculously complex menu, the faux-Egyptian decor, the bread basket (#brownbread4lyfe)...the whole experience is slightly surreal and makes me ridiculously happy! Going to The Cheesecake Factory isn't just a meal, it's an event! Anyway, my love for TCF aside I am sad to report that this location isn't the best. It's definitely less crowded than other outposts (particularly the one at Millennia which is just bonkers 24/7), so that's a plus. Staff is generally nice, but the attention to detail just isn't there. Part of the charm(?) of TCF is that the food should be consistent and pretty high quality every time, but it seems like orders always come out slightly off: cold fries, forgot the cheese, gave my friend's steak to someone else. Once we asked for the bread basket to be all brown bread and they brought us all sourdough. I mean, they could have just said ""no"".... I will always love and adore The Cheesecake Factory and will surely be back here, but it's hard to deny there is some room for improvement. Curbside pick up is a nice option for takeout, but definitely check your order before you speed off!"
Rachel H.,"Orlando, FL",161,73,135,5.0,11/28/2017,"Trying to understand why they seem to have such bad reviews on here ?? I come to this Cheesecake for many special occasions and random dinners and never have had a bad experience. Although I did have one time our waiter never gave us bread until we asked 2x and we may have gotten emotional after that...  They have quick sit down service unless you choose to get in sooner and sit at the high tops or bar area, woo!!! Secret secret ?? Those are always sit down anywhere you like and gives you better and faster service. The last time I came here we had excellent service, and even had our waiter bring us two breads instead of the normal one basket because he knew we were 'bout thaaaat bread life.  We got our food and drinks at a quick pace even though there seemed to be at least 7 parties of maaanyyyy people throughout the restaurant. Food came out perfectly hot and d e l i c i o u s as heck per usual. Please refer to my perfect photo of chicken Parmesan pizza WITH PASTA ON TOP. I see where you're going Cheesecake Factory.... And I love it #carbLife There is never a bad food item on their menu, please order 6 of everything.  Top picks: buff chicken wrapped in dough Fried Korean cauliflower  Mac and cheese balls  Top entrees: any pasta dishes  Chicken dishes  Can't even think of any now because I'm getting super hungry just writing this review  You can generally modify any menu item so just ask!!"
Chris A.,"Orlando, FL",219,197,561,4.0,10/16/2017,"So we had some time to kill before a movie, and we saw that the Cheesecake Factory has a decent happy hour menu, so we decide to check it out. We get there, sit in the bar area, and are greeted by our server. I get a Coke Zero because I was dragging and needed caffeine. My girlfriend gets a fancy drink. I forget which one, but she said it was good.  We think that ordering three appetizers to split between the two of us was going to be fine, and it was fine, but it was more than fine. Meaning, these $6 appetizers were actually much, much larger than we expected them to be. It was a pleasant surprise, don't get me wrong. We just had to scarf it all down, because we didn't want to leave leftovers in the car during the movie. More of a me problem. Let's get to the food. From worst to first. When I say worst, nothing was actually bad here. It was all pretty great. Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip (A Delicious Blend of Crab, Artichokes and Cheese. Served Warn with Grilled Bread). Wow. This was so crabby. They didn't skimp on it in this dish. Every bite was super flavorful and creamy. I have a tip, though. Save some of that complimentary bread from the beginning of your meal, because they definitely don't give you enough grilled bread to make the dip last. Then, the ""Happy Hour Burger"" (Double Patties, Double Cheese, Grilled Onions and Special Sauce on a Toasted Brioche Bun). This thing was shockingly large. This is a burger I would pay $12 for at Burger U. Here, it was $6. Crazy. It was actually cooked nicely, too. Not dry or anything. I didn't notice anything truly special about the sauce. Also, the bun is brioche, so it might be a little oily for some people's tastes, but I didn't mind.  The best thing that we ate, hands down, was the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders (Crispy Fried Chicken Breast on Mini-Buns. Served with Lettuce, Tomato and Pickles). The sides are served on the side, so you get to build your own sliders. It also comes with two sauces, a tangy thousand island-type sauce and mayo. The chicken was cooked so well. SO well. It was nice and crispy on the outside, and there was actually enough meat on the insider for me to tell that it was nice and juicy. That's not something I'm used to from chicken sliders.  Overall, this was a great meal for an even better price. I know this place has a reputation for being overpriced and overly unhealthy, but gosh darn it, I enjoyed myself, and I will be back, for happy hour."
Hurriyat G.,"London, KY",1,42,83,2.0,11/30/2017,"Went to this branch for the first time last night. It was bustling at 8pm on a weeknight. I was with a group so we ordered a lot of appetizers, with the entree being a ribeye (it was good) and spicy cashew chicken for me. I was highly disappointed with it! Instead of spicy, it was actually sweet with most of my chicken pieces burnt!!!! The kale salad looked good on paper but was soso as it was full of kale and nothing much! Sweet tamale cakes were great, we were the Thai wraps. Baked Mac n cheese was ok.  Overall, the service was great but the food was disappointing."
Michelle A.,"Columbus, GA",64,5,8,5.0,12/29/2017,The food at this location was delicious & the service was even better!  Our waiter was extremely attentive to our tables needs! I will definitely be back when I am in town!
Rachael H.,"Sanford, FL",222,91,450,3.0,7/25/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a great place to visit if you are looking for all American Fare and drinks :-)  And YESSS on a good day their service is great and you will have your food in a timely manner and have a great experience! Unfortunately, The Cheesecake Factory is a nationwide restaurant and the service can be hit or miss. At this location it has also been a hit or miss.  The hostesses are usually very nice and I have had an array of different servers. This time we had Christina and she was marvelous! They give you delicious bread, white and a the sweet brown bread which is my favorite!  Usually when you go at night time within two hours of closing I notice the service to be less than par and it is super packed! They also do not take reservations so you can be waiting for over an hour.  I recommend going for lunch time. The staff is more lively and and the food seems more fresh. The prices are reasonable for a date night or going out with your friends. The dress is casual or dressy casual.  I order the same meal everytime I go the ""Crusted Chicken Romano"" and I LOVE IT  and it is consistently good everytime. Try the mango strawberry drink, I forgot what it's called but it is sooo good and taste just like mango! And of course I have to talk about the cheesecake! Yes it is amazing and delicious goodness! My favorites are the strawberry, banana cream and Oreo. There are so many flavors and they are huge servings. Their whipped cream is the best I've ever had.  All in all, yes I do recommend The Cheesecake Factory. The service is not 100% but the food is good, nothing too fancy but good and the cheesecake is a must have!"
Shelley H.,"Orlando, FL",780,225,1091,4.0,6/30/2017,"Skinnylicious menu is PERFECT for folks who want a low calorie high flavor option.  I had the Asian salad from this menu and it was only 550 calories and VERY filling.  I also had their signature pineapple Mule which was so amazing because it wasn't sweet and was extremely refreshing.   We are in the bar at a tabletop and had the most hospitable server, Louis, who was charming and helpful and attentive without being a pest.   My friends had the omelette and the vegetarian salad both of which were cooked and/ or prepared to perfection.  My only complaint was the host's lack of enthusiasm in greeting us and the length of time it took him to look up and acknowledge us when we approached the host desk.  Tacky."
Daris G.,"Deltona, FL",124,92,628,4.0,12/3/2017,"Second time visiting The Cheesecake Factory and I will definitely come back. We were a party of 12 the wait time was 90 mins, too much in my opinion, but i wasn't the bday girl so we waited. No reservations taken after 5 I think. We finally got seated after almost 2 hr wait. Our waiter (Jennifer) came to our table got our drinks, appetizers and dinner because we already knew what we wanted. She came with 5 baskets of bread (delicious bread) and she also brought the whole table cups of waters. The appetizers came in (fried Mac n cheese) (guacamole egrolls) and ( chips with guacamole) my favorite was the fried Mac n cheese it was just like WOW delicious a must try. I had the veggie burger which was ok I will definitely try something different next time I go. Overall they have a very good menu covering vegetarians as well as meat eaters. Good size portions and of course extensive cheesecake menu and 'take home bags with forks and napkins' to ensure that no matter how full you are, you will still take a cheesecake portion with you. Like I said before I will definitely come back here. Thanks Jennifer for your great service."
Chrissie B.,"Winter Park, FL",18,127,227,5.0,8/3/2017,Mmm...cheesecake factory! So many options. So many cheesecakes. How can one not like this place? I went for lunch today with work colleagues. I was able go get a table quickly. The waiter was attentive and helpful. I had the Louisiana Chicken pasta which was delicious. I have probably had all of their pastas in my lifetime. Certainly recommend the Crusted Chicken Romano as one of my favorites. I love the complementary bread also. My favorite cheesecake is probably the 30th anniversary. But i love all the chocolate ones. This location gets crazy packed on the weekends so be prepared for that. I have heard that evenings are also very busy. There is a lot of parking but even with that it is often difficult to find a parking spot. It is certainly worth it though. A great place for a celebration!
Elise C.,"Oviedo, FL",105,119,236,4.0,12/10/2016,"This is a hit-or-miss place, but I did get a hit this time! I ordered the Monte Cristo Sandwich from the brunch menu. Having only had a Monte Cristo once before (no idea when or where) and recalling that I liked it, my fingers were crossed. It was awesome. And filling: between the french toast, the eggs, the meats, and the cheeses (forget the potatoes, I took those home for later), I was quite literally stuffed. I usually don't like sweet/savory combos, but this sandwich is one for which my tongue does cartwheels of excitement. The powdered sugar and strawberry preserves top it all off beautifully. For others at my table, food was so-so, and I have had that experience myself a few times; combined with the highish-but-normal-for-this-type-of-place prices, the Factory is an infrequent place on my list. The ambiance is fun, though--I feel like I'm at a fancy Disney restaurant because of the size and the themed styling."
David M.,"Colonialtown North, Orlando, FL",17,1,,2.0,1/5/2018,"Absolute disappointment. I've eaten at many Cheesecake Factories, but I have never had such an awful experience as I had at this location. My entree, which was a chicken dish, was poorly prepared and undercooked. How is it possible that a restaurant chain known for their quality and standardization can mess up a chicken dish? I found myself spitting bits of chicken out because they were so disgusting. To top things off, the bathroom was absolutely abominable. The sink was overflowing and dripping water onto both my fur coat and the floor. What an incredible disappointment. Both the head chef and the store manager should be ashamed of themselves for such poor quality. The only redeeming part of my dining experience (and the only reason I am giving two stars) was that the server was lovely--proving old adage that Cheesecake Factory hires (and underpays for that matter) fantastic front-facing employees. I will never return to this location, and I hope you won't make the same mistake I did. Truly, a dismal restaurant."
Matthew F.,"Orlando, FL",356,83,426,2.0,11/28/2016,"I've been here a few times through the years and have never been that impressed with the food. The last time I went we had the lettuce wraps, filet mignon (medium rare) and the garlic noodle with shrimp. The lettuce wraps were decent, but the filet mignon came out more of a well done - didn't bother sending it back as it took so long getting out. Also, the green beans side was extremely salty and difficult to eat by itself. Finally, the garlic noodles with shrimp would have been great except for that fact that the shrimp was overcooked. Won't be back unless someone decides to have their birthday there and I have no choice.  On a side note, the lights in there look like the Eye of Sauron."
Casey B.,"DeLand, FL",0,22,10,1.0,8/27/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants and we always make it a point to stop in when we are nearby. My wife and I visited this location for the first time on Saturday.  The facility was clean and in a newer shopping area.   When we got our appetizer the avocados were not ripe at all and the dipping sauce was extremely watered down.  The salt shakers at all the tables nearby were completely clogged, which they said they knew it was humidity and never brought us a new one.   My wife's lettuce wraps were made with aging vegetables.  The lettuce and bean sprouts were turning brown.  The cucumbers were almost translucent and wilted .  It would have been edible, but clearly not what you would expect to be served at an upscale restaurant.  She asked it be returned and just have something else. I ordered the classic cheeseburger and my lettuce was more cabbage than lettuce, so I asked the waiter about it and had they include cabbage in the lettuce blend.  Instead of offering to get me lettuce he argued with me about and walked away rolling his eyes.  Seriously though who wants raw cabbage on your cheeseburger.  Since I still had the menu it said it comes with lettuce, not a lettuce ""blend.""  I basically didn't eat my burger because it was so greasy. The manager came to our table since we had returned a dish out of what felt like obligation.  I explained we had come here for our anniversary and were overall disappointed in our experience.  He gave lip service and then disappeared.   I paid my bill (no discounts) and did not order dessert, which was the main reason we had come.  I would never eat at this branch again and I would advise anyone reading this to do the same.  There is a better branch not much farther away."
Edmond L.,"Orlando, FL",23,180,373,3.0,1/9/2017,"Orlando has been hit with some cold weather lately, 30's overnight and high in the 40's or low 50's during the day.  That means it's okay for businesses to taper down the AC on when weather turns like that. It was not okay for Cheesecake Factory last night. It was cold in there.  Only difference between being there and being outside was the windchill.  Other diners were cold judging by the number of people who had left their jackets on.  I left my jacket on, we put her jacket back on our daughter.  This made for a less than stellar dining experience.  Told our server, she said she didn't feel cold as she was always on the move.  That does not help the situation your diners are in at all.  No offer to let management know or do anything about the cold dining room. Before we ordered, our server scored some solid points by bringing out a separate bread and banana dish for our 1.5 year old.  We didn't ask, she just did it.  In speaking with her, she said she had a couple of young children herself and though that might be a way to have the child enjoy the dining experience.  It did help a lot. I ordered the meatloaf and my wife ordered a chicken pasta dish.  Plates came out in about 15 minutes, not too long of a wait, they were somewhat busy last night.  We waited for our table for about 15 minutes or so. I enjoyed my meatloaf with mashed potatoes and corn succotash.  The gravy is a brown gravy instead of a tomato based sauce.  It's one of my favorite meals from Cheesecake Factory. Wife enjoyed her dish as well but the portions were a bit small.  My portion was quite large, so large in fact that I had about 1/4 of the meatloaf left which I brought home. We finished our meal off with strawberry topped cheesecake, it's our favorite and I believe one of their best sellers.  The server brought some ice cream with chocolate syrup and sprinkles for our little one.  Again, we didn't ask, it's just something she did and it was greatly appreciated. To summarize, we wish something was done about the temperature.  The actions of our server boosted the rating to 3 stars.  Otherwise it would've been 2 stars.  5 stars is reserved for the places with a combination of incredible food, incredible service and an incredible atmosphere.  This place has potential but it didn't meet it this time."
Tom C.,"Maitland, FL",2,113,15,2.0,6/8/2017,"I've been to Cheesecake restaurants all over the country, and they are fairly consistent in their decor and food quality.  So for the most part, there were no surprises.  Friends wanted to take me to the Winter Park restaurant location for my birthday.  Since I was the guest, I humbly agreed. I ordered the daily special.  It was ""wild"" farmed salmon.  Let's face it, either something is wild or it is farmed, it can't be both.  The salmon was ok.  It was prepared with mushrooms and capers and accompanied by the largest scoop of mashed potatoes I've ever seen on a plate.  I figured the reason for the large quantity of potatoes was so the plate wouldn't look empty.  I had substituted my broccoli for a side salad which came on a separate plate.  All the food was ok, nothing special. My one friend ordered shrimp scampi.  I think the picture speaks for itself. Another friend ordered a hamburger.  While the meal was good, it arrived at te table a full 5 minutes after everyone else was served their meals.  Poor timing. The restaurant was clean enough.  The servers were polite and pleasant.  And ... it was a minor miracle that we didn't have to wait 20 to 30 minutes to be seated.  Since I've been going to Cheesecake I've never been seated immediately even when the place was empty!  We arrived about 4:30pm."
Aleema R.,"Orlando, FL",569,107,328,4.0,4/13/2017,"After a great Thai dinner, I wanted cheesecake so came by for dessert. The wait was about 15 minutes and was seated in a booth. I informed my server I was only having dessert so she didn't have to worry to much as she had other tables. The server was very nice unfortunately I didn't catch her    name but she took my order and brought waters immediately. I love their cheesecake so I got fresh strawberry cheesecake and chocolate mousse cheesecake. The ""fresh strawberry"" cheesecake did not have fresh strawberry so that was a let down, however, my favorite was the chocolate mousse which was delicious! I also ordered a few other cheesecake and within an hour I was out with a overstuffed tummy. Always my go to for cheesecake!"
Lenny S.,"Orlando, FL",2,48,,4.0,9/8/2017,Incredibly this was my first visit though my wife has been several times. We went for her birthday.   Service was good and both meals were really good. Of course desert was expectedly nice. Neither of us had any drinks so can't comment on the bar service.  Bread was awesome.
Chantel H.,"Eustis, FL",109,133,65,4.0,5/9/2017,"The service here can be spotty... I've had it happen twice where the initial server has shuffled my party off to another server which I find to be incredibly rude.  I've been coming to this location for years and only recently found out about the 4-6pm 1/2 off happy hour appetizers and drinks! Awesome deal for appetizers, drinks are still like $5something which isn't terrible, but also not necessarily great in my opinion. I've ordered the tamales the past two times and they've come out on a piping hot plate and then are just room temperature when you bite into them...do they bake the plate and not the food? Next time they will be sent back fo sho.  To be real, the only thing that makes this any better than Olive Garden is that it's a little (ok, a lot) more classy as far as ambiance goes."
Tanice E.,"Tampa, FL",97,1,,4.0,12/17/2017,"This is probably my 4th time having brunch here & I decided to look for more poultry products , but they didn't have those on the menu . I'd like to see more choices for people who don't eat pork"
J Matt S.,"Tavares, FL",5,89,4,4.0,12/6/2017,"We returned here for the first time in several years. We got 3 giant slices of cheesecake to-go. The three slices we chose were: original with cherries, Oreo dream extreme, and caramel pecan. I would rank the Oreo as the best (wish I had chosen this as mine instead of caramel pecan), the original with cherries second (can't go wrong with cherry cheesecake), and caramel pecan a distant third. The caramel pecan wasn't bad, but I would suggest they tweak the way they prepare it to make it even better. (Maybe use whole pecans instead of tiny bits, add more caramel and maybe some chocolate chips). The cheesecake counter is right near the entrance, so you can get in and get out quickly. We will definitely return again when we are in the area and craving something sweet."
Harper T.,"Melbourne, FL",9,10,19,5.0,10/5/2017,"Amazing food like usual, however, service takes a while so plan your day right. I always get the chicken piccata, delicious as always."
Zaid N.,"Orlando, FL",95,81,101,2.0,4/9/2017,"First experience here. I've heard so many good things about their food and cheesecakes, so decided to check It out for my friend's birthday. The food was pretty okay nothing special the cheesecakes are pretty good ones to die for are the red velvet and smores one! For entrees if you're coming to eat come and eat the burrito! Huge dish, Shepards pie good but salty, steak Diane looked amazing and finally highly recommend the bang bang steak and chicken....  the food gets three stars, the service though gets negative points to be honest. Extremely slow service, beyond extremely slow service actually, I think we waited 15 minutes for the server to come back to us. For food sure nice atmosphere for celebrations, but for service be prepared to sit in a Disney ride line!"
Elena S.,"Winter Park, FL",235,97,79,4.0,4/28/2017,"Went to have lunch here with my colleagues. Cheesecake factory is the ""go to"" for large groups because there is something for everyone. For appetizers, I ordered the Fried Mac and Cheese balls and WOW, they were SO Yummy. It had a nice outer fried layer, not too thick, not too thin. You can still taste the mac and cheese and it came with a nice pairing of marinara sauce. For my entree, I ordered the Skinnylicous Angel hair and pasta dish. It had about 6-7 pieces of shrimp, about 2 cups of angel hair, and a nice pesto sauce. This dish was satisfying without feeling too gluttonous. However, since I wanted to feel gluttonous, I ordered a to-go box of the Snickers Cheesecake. NOW we are talking! I ate it too fast to take a picture, which is a good thing of course.   The waiter was prompt and friendly and managed our group of 13 very well. We rarely waited for refills and was able to answer the multiple questions asked by the group.  Overall, great experience. I am taking away 1 star because they posted the calories next to the menu items. I dont need that kind of negativity in my life =P"
Angie S.,"Miami Beach, FL",183,56,1241,5.0,8/9/2017,"I love CF! It's so delicious and even though the menu is like a text book, there is always something for everyone! I got my all time favorite pasta dish, Pasta Da Vinci omgggg like wow the sauce is sweet and creamy and just pure amazingness."
Ana S.,"Orlando, FL",0,3,7,4.0,10/12/2017,"This is our favorite place for happy hour2 or 3 times/month, good drinks and delicious appetizers for a good $ and always our cheesecake! Just some time the service from some waiters could be better!"
Jessenia J.,"Orlando, FL",225,215,673,4.0,8/4/2016,"I've been wanting to visit this place for a long time. Finally, my sister and I decided to have lunch (made it after lunch time) there to celebrate the ending of the semester.    The location in very nice, the place itself and the area it is located. We were quickly seated and our waiter came to greet us and took our drink orders. After he came back with the drinks he brought out the bread basket with butter. There were two types of bread and one had oatmeal, they were both soooo good; crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.   For our entries we ordered a pasta dishes and a chicken dish which I can't seem to remember the name. The pasta dishes was extremely good, we both lived it. The chicken dish was okay, chicken was a bit under season for my taste but it was moist.   For dessert we ordered 2 cheesecakes CHRIS' OUTRAGEOUS CHEESECAKE and the Tiramisu cheesecake, they were both very good and definitely the best cheesecakes I've taste. Would love to go back and taste more of their selection. I took a Kahlua cheesecake for my husband and he loved it.   Overall, the prices are a bit high and honestly I did not find the portions to be very big. However, I would definitely be back."
Andrew P.,"San Pedro, CA",48,57,26,2.0,3/23/2017,"I wish I could give this location more stars... I asked my 9yo daughter where she wanted to have her birthday dinner, and Cheesecake Factory is what she wanted.  Service was average, long waits between server checking in on us.  I made sure to tell our hostess and our server that it was my daughters birthday dinner.  Quite a few birthday dinners throughout the restaurant as we heard singing and candlelit deserts walking passed us while we ate.  My kid commented that she was looking forward to a little birthday celebration as well and I told her it would come after dinner.  Portions are huge here, and we were stuffed so when the server asked us, we kindly declined.  At this point, we kinda expected them to at least bring something for the birthday girl, but we were wrong and instead just received the bill.  Her mother then slipped away from the table to ask about why our kid didn't get the same birthday treatment as everyone else, and the response was ""the other patrons bought and paid for dessert"".  I guess our drinks and dinner ($125 bill) wasn't enough for them.  He then proceeded to say ""we can do it right now if you want?"", but by then it had already gotten awkward.  I didn't feel the answer was legit so I went to their website to learned that in fact she WAS supposed to get a sundae with a candle at the least...I wonder why we were treated so differently?  Only been to the Cheesecake maybe 10x, but this was for sure the last.  Had I known, I would have bought my kid the dang dessert so she didn't feel left out...on her birthday.  I mean cmon Cheesecake Factory, that's how you want kids to feel?  1 dessert for 3 drinks/4 entrees and repeat business?  Not a smart business decision. I did reach out to the manager and he stated that it was not handled correctly.  They are sending out a gift card for a future visit as an apology as the manager can only do so much being after the fact.  But I can truly say I would have rather my kid got the birthday celebration, especially at her age."
Terri C.,"Orlando, FL",91,66,216,5.0,8/5/2016,Dined at this Cheesecake Factory at approximately 9:45pm on a Friday night.  We were seated within 2-3 minutes.  Our waitress was prompt and attentive (I only wish I could remember her name!) I ordered the orange chicken and my husband ordered the chicken and shrimp gumbo. Both of our meals had an excellent presentation and it didn't take too long for it to be bought out too us.  I asked for additional sauce for the orange chicken as the rice was dry but it helped tremendously.   Restaurant was dimly lit and was quaint for our date night out.  Parking was a challenge as we had to circle 3 times before we found a spot.  They do have valet parking available but we just chose to look for ourself.
Nancy M.,"Orlando, FL",98,145,441,4.0,12/18/2016,"This was my 2nd time here and it despite all the other reviews I read, I had a really good experience. Granted it was Sunday evening, we only had a 10 minute wait.  We ordered the calamari and the Chicken Samosa's for apps. The calamari was lightly fried and crispy. It wasn't greasy and had a good flavor. It came with cocktail and tartar sauce. The Samosa's were fried triangle pieces of well spiced chicken. It came with a cilantro sauce that was good. We ordered tempura battered fish tacos, the bacon bacon burger, the mac and cheese burger, and the Chinese chicken chopped salad. The tempura fish taco's were crisp and the fish was a good size. The order came with 3. The bacon bacon burger was huge, & had a good flavor. The mac and cheese burger seemed smaller than the bun sized bacon burger and the mac and cheese comes in a 'ball' form on top of the burger. It was alright. Again, the burger itself had a good flame grilled flavor. My Chinese chopped chicken salad was enormous and I'm not quite sure I can believe that massive bowl of yum came in at advertised 'under  590' calories. It had chopped lettuce, sesame seeds, crispy wonton, cilantro, chicken and a yummy sesame dressing.  And of course, we can't forget the cheesecake. We had vanilla bean and caramel both were good....uh it better be.  We had an engaging yet not overbearing server so that was a plus as well :)"

Ron M.,"Deltona, FL",71,35,49,2.0,8/13/2017,"Updated 8/13/17 decided to come back and try again. Took over 10 minutes for a server to greet us and get our drinks. Ended up having to go back to the host stand to find out wth was going on. Server finally came by and the service just got worse from there. I don't know why I try with this place.  --------- You would think that curbside takeout would be a no brainer. Never again, was put on hold for 10 minutes was told 25 minutes. Took over an hour and a half, then they bring me food in random containers not even in a bag. The manager ended up comping my meal but the aggravation was not worth it. I went inside to talk to somebody and most of the restaurant was not full, I can understand if they were packed."
Lisa N.,"Orlando, FL",152,316,1241,3.0,5/23/2016,"After my boyfriend and I watched a movie at Regal Cinemas, we were trying to decide where to have a late dinner. Strangely, I was in the mood for pasta. Normally I wouldn't dine at The Cheesecake Factory, but it was right there and an easy choice. I don't dislike The Cheesecake Factory - it's been decent the few times I've been. But I'm basically a food snob who doesn't like going to national chain restaurants. We asked for a table outside and were seated right away. There were actually several things on the menu that caught my eye, but I decided to stick with pasta. I ordered the pasta with shrimp and sausage. While the menu does mention ""mildly spicy peppers"", the dish was much spicier than I expected. I would not describe it as mildly spicy. Despite the heat, I enjoyed the flavor so I just kept eating and didn't feel a need to send it back, although I did also think the pasta wasn't quite al dente enough. The portion size was decent. At first it seemed a bit less than what I expected for $17.95, but I did have enough leftover to make a small meal the next day. My boyfriend had the crispy Cuban rolls, and of course I got to try a bite. The wrapper was nice and crisp and overall it was a unique and tasty twist on an egg roll. He purposely ordered just an appetizer in order to save room for some cheesecake. He chose the Oreo dream extreme cheesecake. The cheesecake was not as heavy and dense as I expected, but I was still satisfied with just a bite. Service started out pretty well. The server even asked if we wanted another bread basket. But toward the end of the meal the server kind of disappeared. I think he was more focused on prep work for the next day, than checking on his customers. Despite the service, I left with a more positive impression of The Cheesecake Factory than when I went in. I wouldn't make a trip to Winter Park Village just to go there, but I'm open to going back if we're already in the area."
Jeff B.,"Longwood, FL",0,7,,1.0,8/27/2017,"Haven't been to this location in a couple of years. What was once a quality restaurant has certainly gone down hill.  Went today for lunch. Let me say I understand Sunday afternoon lunch will be busy and there will be delays and my wife and I were prepared for that. Now that said we were not prepared for the substandard service and food.  While there was almost an hour wait at 12:30 we decided to sit in the bar area. After sitting for almost 15 mins I had to flag someone down to get our waiter.  Ordered iced tea and before I could include an appetizer our server was gone. 10 minutes later iced tea shows up and before we could order our server was off to another table. 12 minutes later ( yes by this point I was timing things ) our waiter comes back and ask if we have any questions to which I answered ""we've been here over 30 minutes and except for iced tea no one has stopped by, dropped bread off or anything so we are ready to order"" We ordered an appetizer and I ordered the Chinese chicken salad without the rice noodles on top. I also asked for some bread. 12 minutes later our server walks by with 3 baskets of bread and i thought for sure one was ours but boy was i wrong. 8 minutes later I had to yell at our server to get his attention and ask for bread which showed up 5 minutes later. If you are keeping score that's 62 minutes before we even got bread.  Our meals showed up 17 minutes later. Never saw the appetizer and the server and helpers looked confused. My salad had a big pile of rice noodles but no wonton noodles. Sent it back and when it came back the rice noodles were gone but the wonton noodles were still missing. I didnt dare ask for it to be fixed.  No one seemed to care. Not the server, helper or manager.  Don't know that we are going back and that's a disappointment because we used to lover the place."
Lori J.,"Oviedo, FL",0,14,,2.0,12/17/2017,"2 only because last time we visited we had Rob for a server and he was absolutely amazing, just typical food but good presentation. NOW on to our most recent visit based on our previous experience we decided to have a birthday Sunday brunch what a mistake. The server had no business at an establishment of this caliber or any for that matter. FOOD -1  star rating, let's say Coney Island could have done better. Poached eggs where very runny no whites and in bowl of water, not just one order but both. Hair in the French toast which they quickly replaced with an order half the size and just kinda thrown on the plate. Had to continually ask the server for water, not attentive at all and it was 11:00 am so not busy yet. Waited years to see what all the buzz was regarding cheese cake factory, I found out way over rated for the $$. To many other good restaurants to be back here"
Felicia M.,"Gainesville, FL",52,20,28,5.0,8/18/2017,This is my favorite restaurant! The food is always delicious and there are hundreds of entrees to choose from--something for everyone! We got the orange chicken and lettuce wraps this time. So good and filling! Entrees are large enough to share. The cheesecake is amazing and there are so many flavors!
Andrew S.,"Orlando, FL",94,25,31,4.0,11/3/2016,"Decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory in Winter Park to get some good food and we wanted to try to catch game 7 of the World Series if possible. Luckily there was one table left in the bar area by the tv showing the game. We sat down and Nicholas, our server, greeted us and took our bar order. After returning with some waters to hold us over, we ordered two appetizers; the fried macaroni and cheese and the tex mex egg rolls. Nicholas suggested the egg roll sampler but my girlfriend isn't a huge fan of salmon so we stuck with our original order.  The appetizers took a little bit to arrive but the restaurant was quite busy so that wasn't much of a surprise. Let me just say that the appetizers were DELICIOUS! The streets of heaven have to be paved with fried macaroni and cheese from the Cheesecake Factory. Its ridiculous how great they tasted. Our dinners arrived in good time and were also delicious. I tried the Chicken Madeira and my girlfriend ordered the Chicken Romano Pasta with alfredo sauce instead of tomato sauce. We had to order our cheesecake to go since we were already stuffed and as always that never disappoints.  Overall, our experience went very well. We will definitely be back soon!"
John J.,"Orlando, FL",270,30,11,2.0,6/19/2017,"I really really used to love cheesecake factory I guess they fell off. I purchased a Cobb salad with no chicken and extra avocado it came out to almost $20 for one salad. It's made of lettuce predominately, some egg , cheese & not even half a tomato goes into this salad. I don't think it's worth twenty dollars at all it certainly doesn't taste like twenty dollars.This is by no means a twenty dollar salad. If you gonna charge me $20 for a salad you might as well add some ""truffle oil"" my goodness. It's not even that I won't pay $20 for a salad there wasn't even any protein in the salad I replaced  the chicken with one other serving of avocado. This is a salad I usually get when I'm trying to be conservative about money and it's a little too much for this quality of food. Did you add gold leaf or something?  because I sure don't taste it."
Samantha B.,"Orlando, FL",109,1,1,1.0,7/14/2017,"I visited The Cheesecake Factory today and ordered the Beef Pit Dip. When the sandwich arrived at my table it was extremely soggy and held together with toothpicks. I shrugged it off and took a bite and realized it was extremely chewy. I assumed I had a piece of fat in my mouth until the next bite was just as chewy with an odd taste. Because of the dark lighting in the restaurant I wasn't able to see that the beef on my sandwich was almost entirely raw. I literally took out my phone to shine a light on it and was disgusted by what I saw. I cannot believe that someone put that meat on a bun and sent it out to be eaten. I was refunded when my waitress saw the raw meat, which I do appreciate, but I have been nauseous ever since I left the restaurant early this afternoon which is why I am writing this review. So, to anyone who orders it in the future, check your bun before taking a bite!"
