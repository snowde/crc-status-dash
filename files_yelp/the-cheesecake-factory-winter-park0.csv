Tom B.,"Orlando, FL",313,404,8,2.0,11/11/2010,"My dozen co-workers and I have a long-standing tradition of going out for birthday lunches.  It seems that invariably at least once a year the birthday boy or girl chooses the Cheesecake Factory.  You couldn't drag me into the place otherwise.   So it happened again last week.  I can't for the life of me understand the appeal of this place.  On this occasion, I'll admit I did have a better than usual dish of chicken and pasta, but in typical CC Factory form, the entree was enough for three.  Why they serve such giant portions is something I'll never understand. Plenty of people love it, but I just get a feeling of trepidation upon the mere mention of this restaurant.  And, do they really need to place advertising throughout the menu?"
William L.,"Orlando, FL",0,32,,5.0,3/15/2014,"Went there for dinner a couple weeks ago and wow --the food was great.  I had one of their pastas and it came out hot and tasted great!  The drink I had was excellent and the server we had -Clay, was very attentive and made sure our table was always tended too.  The desert I had -- Oreo Cheesecake--WOW!  Was great!  Will definitely be back."
Jennifer P.,"Apopka, FL",0,1,,2.0,3/7/2014,Busy night slow service it was like they forgot our food....so much for a nice birthday dinner would not recommend not go back.waitress could not even refill water.
Chelsea W.,"Nashville, TN",83,228,16,2.0,6/15/2013,"This review is specifically for this location as i've had different experiences at different Cheesecake Factories around town.  The food is fine, the menu is pretty extensive but its a chain so its all the same from place to place and personally i think its way overpriced.  The service at this location has been horrible! Whenever we sit outside we are forgotten about and all the different waiters/waitresses we have had act like they are hungover or just hate having to walk outside to take care of us.  Not a fan of this location at all and I dont recommend it unless you are getting JUST cheesecake to go!"
Oscar L.,"Winter Park, FL",0,14,8,5.0,1/7/2011,"I love this place. They have a huge menu, and the servings are quite large.  If you don't like anything from the menu, tell them what you want. They will make it for you.  I've tried all the cheesecakes and I must say my favorite one is the Red Velvet cheesecake.  Good food, Friendly staff, great atmosphere. . . what else do you want?"
Nicole F.,"Tampa, FL",119,367,1161,4.0,10/26/2010,"Great eats! They have a great menu selection. Their desserts are to die for if you like cheesecake. Yum yum yum! If you happen to go there on a Tuesday or Wednesday, they have their wild mushroom soup available which is so delicious. The chicken avocado sandwich is my favorite along with their mango/coconut cheesecake:-)"
Donald D.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",55,26,,4.0,9/25/2011,"Went mid afternoon, so there was not the usual crazy crowd waiting to be seated.  Even though we were the only one in the lobby, still took about 5 minutes to be seated.  Service was very good, which I think is normally the case.  They have added a new low-calorie menu, which, when you think of the normal size of their menu, is a bit crazy.  The huge size of their menu always annoys me, because I can never make up my mind with all the choices.  I will admit that is more a reflection of me.  I ordered the Mexican taco salad, and it was pretty good.  A huge portion, mostly make up of those little crispy tortilla strips.  The avacado dressing was very tasty.  Could have used more chicken.  For dessert, had the red velvet cheese cake.  Was really really good.  About as rich as you can imagine.   I am not normally a big fan of the Factory, but this was a good visit."
Autumn S.,"Coral Springs, FL",20,155,5,3.0,5/11/2013,This is a typical cheesecake factory.  My friends and I come here a lot because it is great for vegetarians. They have a great variety of foods.  The service is only good sporadically and they are not will to adjust menu items for allergies or food restrictions as much of it is pre-made.
Zack B.,"Orlando, FL",105,46,2,4.0,4/14/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory located in Winter Park Village is a great option for a casual lunch/dinner, or a nice date night with someone special. As usual, the restaurant was hopping (with quite a crowd waiting to be seated). But the staff at this location has this down to a science, keeping the flow of hungry food-seekers moving at a reasonable pace. The service was great, the food was delicious, and although the prices are a bit above average, it's well worth it!"
Catherine M.,"De Bary, FL",17,34,,4.0,4/15/2013,"What's not to Yum About? After a long hot day at Disney World, we left and wanted a restaurant that we knew would not cost us a small fortune with consistently good food. So, we decided to visit the Cheesecake Factory in Winter Park. And we were not disappointed. The four of us had a wonderful meal making our experience an A-1 day. Our server brought some tasty homemade bread that came directly from the oven. As others have mentioned, the menu is extensive with so many choices. It took us a while to make a decision.  I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp (note although the menu says spicy; it was not) and the rest of the family ordered the Chicken Di Pano, the Skinnylicious Spicy Chicken salad and the New Orleans Shrimp. Each meal was delicious and portions sizable, with the exception of the New Orleans Shrimp. The New Orleans Shrimp portion was much smaller than all the other dinners. We were all satisfied. I am not sure if it possible to come to this restaurant and not order cheesecake, is it? We ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet cheesecake and the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cheesecake. I am not much of a sweets person, but I did taste each. I first tried the Ultimate. It was yummy with a cream cheese frosting and shaved white chocolate covering the sides. However, the Reese's cheesecake was no doubt the best dessert I have ever had. OMG! If you like chocolate and peanut butter, this is a MUST try. Our server was great and friendly. The only criticism I have is the floors were very slick. It was raining that day. Their shiny tile floors and rain do not really work well together. All in all, we all agreed that the food was delicious and was a nice topper to the family day at Disney World."

Kelley I.,"Winter Park, FL",31,105,,3.0,12/12/2010,"My favorite thing about Cheesecake Factory is the variety on their menu. If you go here with friends you're sure to find something that everyone likes from Asian (Chicken Thai Pasta is awesome) to Italian (Eggplant Parm) to American (Crispy Chicken Sandwich and Burgers). If you go during prime dining time, especially on the weekends, it's going to be REALLY busy.  They serve everything in HUGE portions so come hungry. Another thing I REALLY love is the brown bread they bring before the meal. I can't comment on the cheesecake because I'm one of those strange people who doesn't like cheesecake. All of my friends have loved the different varieties they've tried. Is it my favorite restaurant? No but it's a good one to go to with people who have varied tastes because there's something for everyone."
Rob W.,"Orlando, FL",1578,2197,8,3.0,9/11/2010,They do everything very well here. The buliding is beautiful. The servers are friendly and efficient and the menu has something for every one. In fact it is so extensive it is hard to decide what to order. We like going here for birthdays so everyone can order their own cheesecake slice for dessert.
Chance S.,"Orlando, FL",10,96,2,5.0,11/1/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory has been my favorite restaurant for many years. Whenever I travel to different cities, I always check to see if they have this restaurant. The food is great, the menu selection is enormous, the portions are large, the cheesecakes are good with about 30 kinds to choose from, the mojitos are Miami quality. I can not say much about how the service is at the tables because I always go to the bar. But I do get good service at the bar. Some people might complain about the prices especially if they are trying to feed a big family. They probably should go to Applebee's. I am a loyal customer here."
Joe F.,"Orlando, FL",0,1,1,1.0,3/9/2014,"The only reason why we came here was because we had a gift certificate. My girlfriend ordered the Baja chicken hash from the brunch menu on our server's recommendation and I ordered the veggie burger which server said was new and improved. The food took an exceptionally long time to arrive which doesn't really bother us when you know it's being cooked to order. My girlfriend's meal was sitting in a pool of grease and drenched with so much hollandaise that you couldn't see what it was underneath. The veggie burger was essentially a flavorless ball of farro. When asked my girlfriend told our server that she never would have ordered the Baja chicken hash if she knew it was going to be that greasy. She barely ate any of it. Server said something about the heat or the sun ""breaking the sauce"" (we were sitting outside in the shade) with no offer to make the situation better. Also never refilled our water. We know better than to come here and won't be back."
Michael W.,"Miami, FL",531,393,312,5.0,6/2/2012,The cheesecake factory is a great chain that has an extremely large menu (it's literally a book) and wonderful cheesecakes and desserts!  They also have the best mojito I have ever had.  Very well run chain restaurant with reasonable prices and big portions.  I indulged on a Kahlua cheesecake and it was fantastic!  Highly recommended!  I also like their hot fudge brownie cheesecake!  They also have a great happy hour M-F 4-6.
Christopher H.,"Orlando, FL",0,4,,4.0,9/22/2014,"Super fast and friendly service, even on a Saturday night! I had the southwestern chicken sandwich and I found it wholly satisfying and flavorful."
Ron P.,"Orlando, FL",170,85,1,4.0,9/12/2010,"Ok, so I had an adult beverage this visit.... so this was an experience to remember.  I had the meat loaf, mashed potatoes and corn. It was to die for. I know, why have meat loaf at a Cheesecake Factory? Because it was doh-licious! It was more than I could eat.  Then to end the night with Red Velvet Cheesecake. ahhhhh- Heaven!"
Jennifer H.,"Tampa, FL",66,275,395,3.0,6/4/2006,"I've been here for several business lunches, and I will say that this location has always been able to accommodate a group of five or more at lunch - without reservations. I have had ""the Navajo"" a couple of times, and I keep forgetting to ask them to NOT grease the bread before they make the sandwich.  Oily bread is sure hard to hold onto. I don't understand why this restaurant has such a following - I've haven't been bowled over by anything on their menu.  When I tried to order a cookie dough cheesecake slice, they didn't have any more.  I ordered the carrot cake instead.  It was good, but I can't say that I've ever had a bad piece of carrot cake. BTW: the inside of the place reminds me a lot of the Mythos restaurant from Islands of Adventure, so maybe I was put off from the start."
Vince Z.,"Orlando, FL",0,7,,4.0,9/10/2014,"This place has always been a favorite of mine for minor celebrations or just an indulging treat.  Though it is cavernous and somewhat noisy, opt for a intimate booth if you plan on conversing.  There is something for everyone on the menu satisfying even the pickiest diner.  Though a little pricey food portions are huge.  They recently added small plate and skinny selections for those that like to mix and match.  I recently had the four cheese pasta in marinara and a side of meatballs.  Very tasty, but adding the meatballs raised the price to almost $23, for pasta!  My companion had the breaded chicken costellano.  Tender abundant thin boneless cutlets in lemon butter sauce, mashed potatoes and asparagas.  Around $16 bucks, it's a tasty signiture dish.  Drinks are oversized too as the prices.  I had a glass of pinot and she had lemonade.  The pineapple cheesecake desert we had was to die for!  Total bill including gratuity for two, came to $82.00.  Enjoyable, a bit pricey perhaps.  Hey!  You can't take it with you.  :o)"
