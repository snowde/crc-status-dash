Dustin B.,"Orlando, FL",288,4,,5.0,1/9/2016,"This place is really the go to for a solid, consistent dinner. I am so sick and tired of people giving 3 stars because ""they don't come here often"" or 1 star because ""it was busy"". WAKE UP PEOPLE! If the restaurant is busy its POPULAR and that is a good sign. I really wish half of these reviewers with nothing better to do (literally) than write reviews all day would learn to make a reservation; or also alot that time to exercise and stop crying that your rice wasn't salty enough...its rice...its supposed to taste like rice, idiot. I won't call you out, but you're all below me :/ This place rocks, healthy choices if you want; or indulge if you want. Eat here and go see a movie afterwords, unless of course you need to alot that time to write a useless review."
Tom K.,"Titusville, FL",64,27,47,4.0,2/19/2016,"Expect a 30 minute wait minimum any time you visit here. The parking at this location is a nightmare. Service is normally far above average.  Food comes out quickly even during busy dinner hours. Warm bread with butter served before entrees. Large portion sizes. Minimum $15 per person. The food prep quality here is pretty much standard if you've been to another Cheesecake Factory. Pasta dishes, burgers, tacos, fried appetizers, it's all good. Nothing mind-blowing or particularly unique. But the formula is appreciated. If you're with a group, I'd recommend sharing the Cuban egg rolls or buffalo blasts. I have not had a bad entree from their menu."
Liz M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",96,126,164,4.0,1/12/2015,"I always love the food at cheesecake factory. For a place that has a menu as long as the declaration of independence they pretty much do all their food justice. It's just hard to make a decision of what you want if you come in without an idea...so perhaps dp not bring an indecisive date here haha. From pizzas to salads to seafood to steak to chicken to pasta to cheescake, there is something for everyone craving FOOD in general.  My husband got a personal pizza and salad ($13 lunch special) and I got their spicy chicken chipotle pasta ($16 for the dinner portion). I love how they give you the option to pay a little bit less for a lunch sized portion, but I usually order the dinner size and take the rest to go for another meal later because I love leftovers. Honestly...most times at the cheesecake factory, I never order cheesecake because it's a little pricey for just one slice, but I'm sure it's very gpod. I wanted to today, but was so full after the food because of the big portions that I couldn't even imagine eating anything else. We opted for drinks with our lunches instead of an appetizer and the hubby ordered a Caribbean Cooler and I ordered the Flying Gorilla (under blended drinks section). No price on the drinks...but be aware they ran $11 a pop. Don't feel the price was worth it for my husband's drink because it was small, but I love the flying gorrilla which was dark chocolate liquer and banana...so delicious and they give you lots!"

Lesley O.,"East Meadow, NY",1442,604,1483,4.0,7/10/2015,"The ambiance at The Cheesecake Factory is lovely & the restaurant runs like a well oiled machine. At this particular location, it was not busy when we arrived at about 6pm but by the time we left at 7:30, there was probably a 10-20 minute wait. All of the bussers, servers, & food runners  truly worked as a team & that was nice to see. The bussers help the servers pre-bus the table & when a table got up, the bussers were there to clear the table, clean it, & set it immediately. The server we had, Will, was very personable & took great care of my grandfather & myself. I ordered the Miso Salmon & got macaroni & cheese instead of white rice because it was a cheat day!! The fish was cooked perfectly & the macaroni & cheese was sooo good because it's the perfect combination of cheesy & had a great crust on top. The sauce for the fish which is sake butter & miso glaze was definitely not the flavor profile it should've been though & it tasted completely off. My grandfather ordered the Fried Catfish & it was served with mashed potatoes, green beans, & giblets of corn. The sauce it came with was a spicy tartar, perhaps some type remounted even & it was nice but too spicy for my grad father but he loved the fish & the mashed potatoes. My grandfather always goes out to eat & orders a dry Rob Roy with a twist of lemon & it's pretty much NEVER accurate, but by some miracle...it was perfect!!! We were too full for dessert so we didn't order any, but I have had every single cheesecake over the years & I have many that I love but I'd say my top 5 are: Chocolate Tuxedo Cream, White Chocolate Raspberry (I don't even like white chocolate & it's that good), Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Cup Ripple, Godiva, & Lemon Raspberry Cream. Don't get me wrong though, the Dulce de Leche with bits of almond toffee  on the whipped cream, Banana Cream, & Pumpkin when it's in season are damn good! If you're not a cheesecake fan & want another dessert, I highly recommend the Linda's Fudge Cake if you're a chocolate lover, the Tiramisu if you love coffee, & the Strawberry Shortcake if you want something a little lighter but absolute perfection!!"
Brian M.,"Apopka, FL",211,360,93,3.0,12/10/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is the epitome  of ""safe choice"" to me.  You know going in that the food will be on the better side of average, the restaurant will be clean, and typically the service is good.  I have my favorites here (chicken madeira, lettuce wraps), but most anything I have tried on the menu is good.  The bread at the beginning is a nice touch as well.  I can't really vouch for the cheesecake, as I don't like cheesecake, but I always here it is great from my wife.  I love that they are so clean, something basic a restaurant can do to really ensure that the diners have a good experience.   The plus and the minus here really revolves around menu size.  I can see the benefits of choice, but that menu is just way too big.  You really get the sense that they could elevate their food if they were to shave off some of the excess that is in that menu.  The other thing I would love to see would be a bit more separation in the seating areas.  At times, you can feel like you are almost dining with your neighbor. Overall, a solid place to eat when in the Winter Park Village, as you typically won't walk away disappointed."
Lori T.,"Oviedo, FL",31,177,33,4.0,6/15/2016,"I like Cheesecake Factory, but don't frequent it a lot since it's always busy, not cheap, and a drive, but we went to celebrate my husband's birthday.  Food has always been ok to good, but let's be honest. . . we go for the cheesecake even though we're often to full to order/eat any.  Since they don't take reservations or call ahead seating, my party of 7 had to wait, but only about 8 minutes which I thought was good for showing up at 12:15 on a Sunday.  Our server was very nice and efficient.  My table had Shepard's Pie, the 'healthy' enchiladas, burger, fish and chips, the crab cake 'balls' appetizer, and I had the Ahi Tuna TarTar appetizer.  Everyone was very happy with their meals as was I with the Ahi Tuna TarTar - it was VERY good.  Unlike are normal meals there, nothing was left over to take home - all the plates were cleaned.  We had 2 pieces of cheesecake and, shockingly enough, they were finished by the two who ordered them.  I was very pleased and impressed and will definitely not wait so long to return."
Justin S.,"Winter Park, FL",287,18,5,2.0,8/2/2016,I didint like the service in this particular branch. The one by Millenia is so much better. The waiters are not that polite and the food was ok. I expected more from Cheesecake Factory since they're known for good food and service.
Leon M.,"Ocoee, FL",0,3,,1.0,2/19/2017,"Oh my, what a disappointing experience. I thought the reviews that described poor service were an aberration. Not so. Service was simply terrible. Our Sunday lunch for 4 people took nearly 2 hours, and we did not have an appetizer or dessert. The meals came out one at a time, with the last one coming nearly 45 minutes after we were seated. To her credit, the server checked several times and told us it was coming out soon, but then came to tell us that apparently it was sent to another table. The food was OK, but we will not be back. There are too many other dining options out there that are just a better value for the money when you take into account the cost, time invested, and overall experience."
Thysis R.,"Orlando, FL",182,237,724,4.0,5/25/2014,We visited this location to celebrate my Goddaughters graduation. We had a party of 12 and had to wait for about an hour and a half. Reason being is because they weren't accepting reservations.  We were finally seated and greeted by our waiter who appeared to have a lot of enthusiasm. He quickly took our drink orders and asked if we wanted appetizers. We declined appetizers but asked for a couple of bread baskets. I have to say that their honey wheat bread seemed to be the favorite for everyone.  I ended up getting a blueberry Mojito which was quite tasty. I will say I'm usually not a fan of Cheesecake Factory because I feel totally overwhelmed with their menu but they make a great Mojito. I ended up ordering the fried MacNCheese balls with marinara sauce. I only wanted something small at this point since we were seated a little late in the evening.  My order came out and it was 4 perfectly fried balls of MacNCheese. They were so good! The inside was creamy and not too overpowering. I have to say it was a really nice combination of cheeses that went very well with the marinara sauce. I was only able to eat 2 of them as I was pretty full.  I opted out on the best part...cheesecake but one of my friends got the cherry cheesecake. Yes I did take a bite and it was delicious. All I needed was just a couple of bites and I was happy. This visit was one of the better visits that I have had at this location.
Jon G.,"Clermont, FL",1,39,,4.0,1/10/2017,Visited on 1/17 and was very pleased. Food and service was spot on. The only thing that would have made it perfect is a little more of a beer variety. I will return and recommend this particular location over others I have gone to.
R S.,"Maitland, FL",1,18,,1.0,4/11/2016,I went yesterday for lunch and my sister had the shrimp angel hair which was dried out when it was delivered to the table. We sent it back for a new one. My salad had the wrong dressing with peanuts in it. My husbands burger was super greasy. There were no plates for bread. All in all was a bad experience. Normally we celebrate birthdays there but I won't be back.
James J.,"Orlando, FL",23,28,68,5.0,4/30/2015,"We eat out two or more times a week. This past month several of the restaurants have either given poor service or poor service and ill prepared food or just completely forgotten our table all together.  Not so at the Cheesecake Factory.  Even though it was Sunday the staff was efficient and courteous.  Clay our waiter was very knowledgeable and cheerful. The food came quickly and every possible need and request met with a fluid efficiency one seldom sees anymore.  The food came to our table freshly plated hot and attractively arranged. I feel the presentation just as important as the taste, and both were excellent.  My husband is retired from Restaurant Management and both he and I were impressed.   I'm certainly going to return soon."
Alan W.,"Atlanta, GA",175,373,63,4.0,4/13/2016,"When the group decided on Cheesecake Factory, my stomach already started to feel the pain of ginormous portion sizes. Variety pack of egg rolls with a sauce for every flavor was so much fun. Chicken Di Pana was life-changing, smashed flat, breaded and covering a gorgeous sea of white sauce. Magnifico!!! Green beans were awesome, maybe a quick shallow fry in the oil, yum! Sweet potato fries were nicely arranged, but were too sweet for my tastes. They add confectioner sugar and the fries have a subtle taste of honey. Sweet potato fries at Cheesecake factory are sweet, not salty, be prepared my minions."
Olivia P.,"Denver, CO",30,117,142,4.0,7/26/2015,Okay so everyone loves The Cheesecake Factory but his location is amazing. My boyfriend and I went here to eat and were actually able to find parking which was a miracle and their was no wait! We got lucky. For dinner I got the Whisky drink and it was amazing along with the 4 cheese pasta as appetizers we got the crab dip which was also so good. For dessert we got the Reese's cheesecake that was recommended by our waitress
Erica S.,"Orlando, FL",112,6,7,3.0,11/7/2015,"We were seated immediately which was great, the waiter was very polite and helpful. The fried Mac & cheese was good, spaghetti and meatball not so much. The sauce was just lacking even with parm cheese and salt added. The cheesecake was also okay. Don't know if I would return but at least we tried it."
Josh Z.,"Lake Mary, FL",0,11,8,5.0,10/17/2015,"This is me and my Ladies favorite restaurant by far. ""Excellent Service"", ask for Kim or Adam, the husband and wife team who work here and are amazing servers. They never let us down. The clam chowder is the best I've ever had.. Its only available on Friday nights though :(.   My wife loves the Asian Lettuce Wrap appetizer( because I make each wrap for her)... and I love the southwestern Egg Rolls. CHICKEN BELLAGIO.. get it, love it.. (I have them remove the proscuitto... I have never liked proscuitto. My wife only gets one thing ever.. The Miso Salmon. Of course the desserts are AMAZING."
Raye R.,"Winter Park, FL",9,7,,2.0,2/20/2016,"Winter Parkers beware: If you are a local and particularily if you are looking for a bite after a movie avoid Cheesecake. First off, it looked like tour buses dropped off their passengers. The crowds were, well, crowded into the lobby and all over the outside. The next part was good, though, we got a bar table. The following is what gave TCF two stars=their awful boneless chicken wings. When we pointed it out to the server he showed the lump in my bowl to his manager...answer, ""sometimes they don't shake the wings when they come out of the fryer"". Yes we paid for them; no we did't want a box. No, we'll not return,"
Brittney J.,"Winter Park, FL",224,3,,1.0,9/8/2015,"The food was great, as it usually is at any Cheesecake Factory, but the service was HORRIBLE. We waited 30 minutes after sitting down to just have our drink order, and then waited another 30 just to get 4 drinks and another 15 afterwards we got the last 3 drinks we needed. This is also at 9pm on a Tuesday night... Then they came back twice to ask about our food and retaking our orders and still didn't bring us what we asked for over an hour later. The food was cold at this point. At fist we thought maybe they were just understaffed but the fact that everyone was just standing around chit chatting and got annoyed when we asked for help. We had to get the manager 3 times and still had crappy service. Never will recommend someone to come to this location"
Chris D.,"Ocoee, FL",0,4,,1.0,8/6/2016,"What a complete ripoff.  $14 for a tiny bowl of chili that wouldn't fit in a cup.or be sold for more than $6 at most restaurants in the area.  On top of that, it was greasy and overly salty.  $9 for a well cocktail.  Complete disappointment and will never EVER go to one of these places again.  Do yourself a favor and go to ANY of the other restaurants in the area...you'll get a better meal for half the price of this place."
