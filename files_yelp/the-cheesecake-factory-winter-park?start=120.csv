JoAnn E.,"Orlando, FL",40,1,,1.0,1/3/2016,"We came during dinner, knowing it would be busy...waited OVER an hour...party of 8 and we were squeezed into a both designed for 6....HORRIBLE!!!!!"
Stew M.,"Maitland, FL",291,47,125,2.0,3/6/2015,"I'm not a fan, but the wife and her crew love this place. Menu is too long for me and they don't truly specialize in anything except for cheesecake, which I don't really vibe sweets. But they are always packed, so someone must like it"
Nicole H.,"Deltona, FL",72,8,,5.0,2/25/2016,I haven't been back since my last review but I did want to say after contacting the company about my experience the store manager was very nice about everything. He reassured me that things should not be handled the way they were which gave me hope that maybe I will go back someday & have the experience I'm used to having. Good to see that at least the higher up still values customer service!
Chris C.,"Orlando, FL",0,11,,2.0,10/8/2016,"Loud, slow service, pricey , too many kids! Felt like I was at overpriced chuckie cheese"
Jackie S.,"Daytona Beach, FL",28,325,329,2.0,5/12/2013,"Oh Cheesecake Factory - what are you doing and why are you doing it wrong?! It was my in-laws anniversary and my mother in law decided, lets go to the Cheesecake Factory. We arrived at around 6pm and the wait time was 40 minutes, which, I'm sure is reasonable for a Saturday night. With only having 4 people in our party, we were unable to make a reservation, which, is okay too.  When we got seated we were promptly greeted by our server, Cesar, who started out great but then as the evening progressed, he became evenless attentive, making the first experience of my father in law, not so great. Issue 1 - my father in law ordered the Herb Encrusted Filet of Salmon. The menu is not lying - the salmon is encrusted in so much parsley that you can't see a hint of pink only green. He compared the salmon to a field of grass that needed to be mowed. He said that the mashed potatoes were very sweet and the asparagus was not cooked thoroughly (still tough and not tender). The salmon is served on top of a lemon sauce which soaked into the mashed potatoes and turned them into soup.  Issue was rectified by him ordering a boring Club sandwich. Issue 2 - my hubs ordered the Grilled Pork Chop which was accompanied with mashed potatoes, broccoli, and apple sauce, along with an unknown gravy that was poured over everything. The apple sauce wasn't strained prior to being placed on the plate and the excess juice from the apple sauce mixed into the mashed potatoes making them overly sweet. He was able to pour the water/sauce/gravy into the dish that they brought us the butter in.  Issue was rectified by him ordering the tried and true, Louisiana Chicken pasta. We each ordered a Caesar side salad which was delicious. My mother in law ordered the Fettucini with Chicken and Sundried Tomatoes (the only dish she's willing to try) and I ordered my usual (Louisiana Chicken Pasta).  For dessert, I ordered the Lemon Raspberry cheesecake which was amazing (nuff said). It had the perfect blend of being sweet yet tangy at the same time. Its a combination of cheesecake with lady fingers, mousse, and cake.  FYI - the later in the evening, the dimmer the lighting in the dining areas. So, if you have a hard time seeing, try to go before 7:30pm."
Domino M.,"Winter Park, Orlando, FL",61,40,62,5.0,2/11/2016,"The atmosphere is very upscale and makes u feel important! Kind of like a celebrity! Our server  Rachael was very a tentative and helped us through the large menu that was more like a book than n e thing! We started out with some small snacks of dyno shrimp and stuffed mushrooms and a strawberry and a cucumber lemonade which I must say was real very refreshing! She checked on us a lot which was really nice! She refilled our drinks just as quick as we finished them! The free bread and butter was an added bonus! We also ordered a Cuban sandwich and fries to shared! The appetizers filled us up to the point, that we wouldn't have been able to do sigh a whole meal out selves! The Cuban is to die for! And for real if u come here ask for Rachael! She is such a sweet lady! The only part that didn't agree with me was the bill! But u really get what u pay for! Some time we will have to come back for dessert! Thanks for great service!"
Evan M.,"West Bridgewater, MA",11,313,49,3.0,10/14/2014,"Meh.  The kitchen is putting out so much food that the quality suffers.  And the prices are higher than the quality warrants.   I ordered a medium-well burger.  It was served raw, essentially mooing.  It was cold to the touch.  I sent it back, and they literally pulled it off the bun, cheese and all, and threw it back on the grill.  Then put it back on the same bun.  When I got it back, it was still red and cold.   Oh well.  Tip was reflective.  I can already hear the grumbling.  Yes, I know it was the kitchen's fault.  But the server should have looked at it before he brought it to me the second time."
Christine F.,"Winter Park, FL",0,3,,1.0,5/1/2016,"I just want to get it out there that if you want to make a reservation here, even though they are open until 11:00 PM, they stop taking reservations at 5:00 PM. That is very unfortunate for me, and them, as I was bringing 15 hungry people at 6:30PM....yes, the very late hour of 6:30PM"
Anastasia M.,"Orlando, FL",57,74,35,4.0,9/28/2015,"I adore this chain! Portions are huge and the food is well prepared, to say nothing of all the fantastic dessert options (duh, it is the CHEESECAKE factory). I'm giving this 4 stars because our server wasn't very attentive. Overall good experiences here though"
The Shadow K.,"Orlando, FL",0,13,,3.0,2/18/2017,"I think you have to know what to order here to have a great experience.  The decor and ambiance are nice.  We ate outside because it was so cold in the restaurant.  I was annoyed that upon walking in the hostess saw me and immediately left the front desk to do something else for a few minutes.  While waiting to order our server provided us with two bread loaf halves.  I immediately went for the white bread and was dismayed to find it almost inedibly hard.  I hate to break it apart and peel a very tiny amount of (still hard) bread out of the middle.  At the end of the meal I happened to poke the pumpernickel bread and realized it was appropriately soft.  Wished I had gone for that one, instead.  We ordered hamburger sliders as an appetizer, which were excellent and came out quickly.  The fries that came with the sliders were also good.  My husband ordered some kind of steak with mashed potatoes.  He said his steak was good. Potatoes were almost cold.  I ordered chicken fettuccine Alfredo, which, according to the menu, has a creamy sauce.  I was unfortunately very disappointed with this dish.  I would prefer Fazoli's fettuccine Alfredo over this.  I had to add salt to it twice because it had no flavor at all, and the sauce was anything but creamy, it was barely there.  I felt like I paid $19 for some plain boiled noodles.  I had the same dish at Bella Italia last night, and Cheesecake Factory should go try their Alfredo to learn what the word ""creamy"" means.  I didn't bother sending the dish back or complaining about it.  It was at least edible once I salted it, I didn't know if I might get something worse picking from other dishes on the menu, and I didn't want to wait again for a new dish.  I would still try this restaurant again, but I'd like some suggestions as to what's good, so I know what to get and what to avoid."
Erick M.,"Miami, FL",0,5,,3.0,3/28/2015,My visit: My party of 13 was in line for about two hours. The funny part was that they let in two groups of 8 so I would give them a 2 out of 5 for their organization and planning skills. The food was amazing and came out in a reasonable amount of time so they clearly deserve a 4 out of 5.  The waiter was really funny and was very charismatic. So service was a solid 4 out of 5. Love the food here but waiting times are ridiculous.
Allison S.,"Memphis, TN",48,40,18,4.0,11/22/2014,First time coming here & the food was delicious.  The waiting time for a table is ridiculous but the staff is friendly. Plus the food is a little pricey but well worth it...
Melly M.,"Orlando, FL",148,431,615,5.0,1/8/2011,"Cheesecake factory has everything you want to eat! Massive menu and everything looks so yummy. I got mahi mahi and it was flavorful indeed. Meals at cheesecake factory aren't completed without a slice of cheesecake. So hard to decide which to get. I eventually went wig turtle one. Yummy! Just have to get that place early or late, otherwise you can wait an hour for seats."
Michael H.,"Orlando, FL",20,27,15,3.0,6/7/2014,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory recently as a last minute option (after discovering that a nearby restaurant had recently closed).  It was a Friday evening around 7:45 p.m. I expected the place to be packed, and while it was crowded, our wait for a table of two was only about 5 minutes. Our table was tight. We were sandwiched between two other tables (very European bistro style). It was a little uncomfortable. The main dining room (there's another space off to the side) was very noisy and dim - a double whammy. I couldn't see to read the voluminous menu, and couldn't hear my dining companion tell me what was on it. Speaking of the menu, for the few who haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory before, the menu is the length of a small book. They serve a variety of cuisine (Italian, Mexican, Chinese, American, etc.) in jumbo-sized portions. The food is good, for large chain fare. We had two different pasta dishes, both were fine. No dessert, as we were in a rush to catch a movie. A note on the service: Excellent from start to finish."
Michaela G.,"Houston, TX",4,16,8,5.0,12/24/2015,"Came here for happy hour on Christmas Eve. Sat at the bar an had Will as the bartender. He was fantastic, no complaints at all. Drinks were great an his hospitality was great. Would come back because of him!"
Kathy D.,"Oviedo, FL",299,419,1421,4.0,1/10/2011,"I absolutely love the cheesecake factory, with endless amount of dishes, its so hard to decide what you want to eat. On my last visit over the weekend with my boyfriend, it was extremely busy on a Saturday night around 5:30pm!! I thought it was crazy because its practically the time when senior citizens come out for dinner and wouldn't be as packed, but I was wrong.  We ordered the fried calamari, (which is always a fav) and ordered the Wasabi Crusted Tuna and the Chicken Bellagio as our entrees.  I absolutely loved my bf's dish with the Chicken Bellagio as it has some fried chicken with shaved ham and cheese on a bed basil pasta. Completely refreshing and light meal. My dish on the other hand was the Wasabi Crusted Tuna on a bed of white rice with miso sauce. It sounded good.. and I was trying to steer away from getting what I have eaten before and thought this would be a perfect new dish. It wasn't what I expected. Its pretty huge and the I think it was over crusted and overly cooked as the server said it was cooked to rare, but I think it was practically medium-rare by the time it came out and didn't taste how I imagine it would be, but I give it an OK. Obviously too full from our meal we didn't get our usual dessert, but you guys must try the Strawberry Shortcake! It's amazing!! I know.. its not the usual cheesecake as the restaurant is known for, but the strawberry shortcake will surprise you!!"
David K.,"Casselberry, FL",4,9,,1.0,12/2/2015,"No way!  Was celebrating my sons birthday and the service was poor.  Drinks took 10 minutes to arrive, water was never refilled, and I never received the coffee I ordered after the meal.  The food was tasteless and the Hibachi Steak my son order was drowned in teriyaki and unpalatable.  Sent it back and ordered another meal.  No manager ever stopped to apologize.  Over all a huge disappointment and will not make that mistake again.  For the price there are many better options."
Michell F.,"Winter Park, FL",4,7,,2.0,10/23/2015,"The menu leaves nothing out.  Lots of options.  Just don't try to make any changes.  They do not do well with changes.  Service at this particular location has been going downhill.  Ordered cocktails before we ordered dinner.  Got cocktails about 10 minutes AFTER dinner was delivered. Had cocktails for dessert instead of cheesecake.  Not the plan, but finding that they don't really care about customer service.  Unfortunate."
John J.,"Lake Mary, FL",0,16,1,5.0,12/27/2015,This is the best restaurant in existence. It's is literally a place of gods. If I had the choice between this once or every five-star restaurant in the world I would pick this. My waiter looked like Shia Labeouf and that greatly increased the quality of my experience. The Louisiana chicken pasta was great. The only problem was that a fly got in my piece of cheesecake but that happened all the time when I lived in Zimbabwe so it was no big deal. Great meal.
John S.,"Erie, PA",84,67,353,1.0,2/14/2015,Luis thinks he runs the place and gets to decide when and where customers sit. Even if they've been waiting for a seat for 40 minutes. Never coming here again. Customer service is horrible.
