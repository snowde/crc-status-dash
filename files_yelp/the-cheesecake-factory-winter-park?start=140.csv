Colby M.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",61,73,93,5.0,1/2/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat. They started strong by not having us wait too long but when we get to the table, we are missing silverware. I had to ask the managers walking by to bring me some. Dinner was a lot better. The food was outstanding ...really delicious and the server Michelle was really good as well.  She brought us drinks when needed them. You should eat here but make a reservation first."
Digital B.,"Longwood, FL",17,351,62,1.0,1/1/2014,"I used to love eating here until I had one of my supervisors bring me back a meal to the office for me. I was working late and they got me a chicken dish with potatoes and some other veggies. While I was eating I crunched down on to something hard. When I pulled it out of my mouth it looked like a small pebble or a broken chunk of glass (tempered). I checked my tooth, which was hurting really bad, and it had chipped (yes, I later went to the dentist, but that wasn't the issue really - see below). I called my boss in and showed him but he just shrugged his shoulders and told me to call the company. I called them that evening and I spoke to the manager who directed me to a number in California. This was my first sign that there was a problem because the manager should have just offered me a gift card or a free meal but it only made things worse. I called the number given to me the next day and got some ""high as a kite"" executive who was literally driving down the California coast in a convertible. I could hardly hear her but she insisted that she would help me and that I needed to send the ""pebble"" to her. I took down her address and she said that she would send me a couple of coupons for me and my family. She told me that it wasn't unheard of to have a potato grow around a pebble (???). I never heard of this and I must say in all the years of eating potatoes I've never had this issue. Needless to say I sent off the pebble and never heard back from her. I tried to call the same number several times but with caller ID she was obviously screening her calls. Good for her. She did her job for the corporation, but lost an entire family of previous followers. To be honest, it was the way I was treated which pissed me off. Their food is fine and of course their deserts are awesome, but I can't support a company which mistreats their customers."
Taylor O.,"Winter Park, FL",57,108,92,4.0,6/29/2015,"A few days ago my fiancé and I came in to have a nice lunch. To start it took a moment for us to be seated, however there was only one host for seating tables and such. I understand this completely so we waited a few moments and when she arrived back to the stand she was very nice and got us seated immediately in a booth. For an appetizer we ordered some type of garlic bread. My fiancé ordered a chicken Alfredo pasta, which he said had a hint of ham in it, but it tasted fine to me. I ordered Rene's special and it was, as usual, fantastic. I was thrown slightly over the soup of the day which was some kind of vegetable tortilla soup or something of the sort and it was actually fantastic. The turkey sandwich was wonderfull. The ceasar salad was also very good. Not too heavy on the dressing. My fiancé ordered a coors light beer and I had ordered the Georgia peach cocktail which was phenomenal !! We would definitely be back again. OH and I mustn't forget, our server, Micah, was absolutely perfect. Very attentive and very patient with us. Definitely a place we'd like to visit again :)"
Nadoona L.,"Winter Garden, FL",46,10,9,1.0,8/21/2015,"Worst service and customer service I have ever received in my entire life. We ordered the teriyaki chicken which literally came with a cup of crunchy uncooked rice and a 3 oz of chicken. The plan was to split the meal between my sister and I, we split the meal regardless of the small portion, on the first bite we realized the rice was literally uncooked. We waited and waited and waited for the waiter to come, nothing. My sister took 2 bites of her chicken waiting because we were starving. Finally we flag down the waiter and tell him, he goes to grab a manager and she comes and rudely says that she'll bring rice. I commented that at this point my chicken is ice cold and id like a new meal. She rudely exclaimed that she couldn't do that because my sister ate her chicken. Then I said ok can you remove the meal from the check and she again rudely exclaimed that the only thing she could do is bring rice or compensate with a cheesecake. Hands down the absolute worse experience I've ever had at a Resteraunt. $18 for a cup of uncooked rice,a tiny piece of cold chicken, and a rude manager is what you'll get here. I really hope headquarters office compensates with something when I contact them tomorrow."
Gisela N.,"Orlando, FL",9,2,,1.0,5/13/2015,"Horrible service last night at the Winter Park location! Sister in law made reservations for 7pm to celebrate her birthday and they finally sat us down around 8:15pm after continuously telling us we would get seated in a few minutes. Yes, we were a party about 15, however, the location was not that busy and they had the whole private area in the back that was empty and available. After waiting for an hour an a half for our food to come out, a manager finally comes to our table to apologize and offers to give us the cake we brought in for the birthday girl for free (they normally charge a $1 per person to cut it up when you bring your own cake). Some of the guests had burnt, over cooked steaks and pastas. Horrible service. Won't be going to this location or any other Cheesecake Factory for that matter!"
Jessica J.,"Daytona Beach, FL",359,431,570,4.0,3/7/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory will always be on my list of favorites!  If you've never been, the menu may seem overwhelming to you!  There is definitely plenty of variety and there is something to suit everyone's palates.  If you find something you don't like, try again another time.  You will definitely find something you love.  They also serve brunch!  The portions are large, so be smart and ""get a box"".  You don't have to clean your plate!   Believe it or not, I'm not the biggest fan of their cheesecake!  There it is!  I've said it!  But this place is still a winner in my book!  By the way, parking can be a bit tricky but there is valet."
David M.,"Orlando, FL",41,42,,2.0,1/31/2015,"I'm not sure why people seem to like this place so much. When you look at the gargantuan menu it becomes pretty apparent that there's no way anything is prepared fresh. My burger was decent, a bit overseasoned but not bad, honestly nothing special. I'm not sure what was up with my mojito (which cost like $15, by the way), but it was way too sweet. I'm pretty sure it was made with Sprite, which is no-fucking-bueno. The palatial interior is gaudy as hell. People, support independent local restaurants and make this city a better place. Unless you're a girl celebrating her 14th birthday, a gift card recipient, or some fannie pack wearing snowbird, there's no excuse to eat here"
Eric R.,"Longwood, FL",197,165,119,1.0,9/28/2013,"Over an hour wait, loud, food below average. I won't come back unless I have a gun to my head."
Scott H.,"Minneapolis, MN",99,294,32,2.0,6/8/2013,"Oh God, this is pure torture. If you like a massive menu that is impossible to navigate full of frozen foods this may be the place for you. If you enjoy paying $11 for a poorly made drink, this place may be for you. Do you enjoy hearing 'happy birthday' sung in unison an average of  12 times per hour? Then you will love it here. I, however, detest all those things. If there is a Hell, it is a Cheesecake Factory. I shall not return."
Rhonda W.,"Orlando, FL",0,4,5,5.0,7/27/2014,They have a big gluten free menu for adults and it has a kids section.  The food was delicious!
Alexandria S.,"Orlando, FL",4,45,1,1.0,10/20/2013,"I really don't like writing negative reviews, I really don't, but I'm sorry I just can't say anything good about my experience here. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory and have been coming here for years, but my mother and I went to this location today and were not happy at all. First of all, we made a reservation and when we got to the restaurant, the people at the front did not have the reservation and claims we never made one when we had called an hour prior to our arrival. Whatever. We were seated and our waiter seemed to be nice, we got our drinks, our bread, and we placed our order; I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with a slice of swiss cheese on the top with a side salad and my mom got eggs, bacon, potatoes...it was like an omelette sort of thing.  Our food came out and my order was wrong. The waiter brought out a grilled cheese sandwich with chicken cut up in it and tried to convince me that it was what I had ordered, but I told him no and sent it back. I ate the salad though and the lettuce left a very bitter taste in my mouth...blech, was not good. My moms omelette literally had almost a whole onion in it and the potatoes were burnt to a crisp.  When my sandwich finally came out, it was fine, but it was literally covered in cheese--I just wanted one slice and my sandwich was drenched in it. It tasted fine, but ugh once again, left a BAD aftertaste. My mother could hardly eat her meal, too many onions and burnt food. Needless to say, we paid, and got the hell out. On our way home we actually had to stop at a gas station and get water because we both had horrible tastes in our mouths. I still love TCF, but definitely will never come back to this one again. Horrible."
John L.,"Winter Park, FL",3,6,,1.0,12/12/2014,The absolute worst service I have ever experienced. Wrong food for everyone at the table and when it did come out it was cold and dry. Server made inappropriate comments and jokes in front of the child at the table all night. Will NEVER go back!
Jason M.,"Orlando, FL",1,3,,1.0,5/12/2015,"While the good is good I've never had good service with this franchise. This most recent time takes the cake, so to speak. Reservations for 7:30, arrive early at 7 and sat at 8:15. Finally served our meal at 9:30 which is pretty horrible service. They offer to us to serve us our own cake free, yay, and that's it. Would definitely not recommend and don't come here hungry as waiting two hours for food is rather unpleasant."
Don L.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",450,210,13,4.0,10/19/2013,Pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed our meal here since we are not that into chain restaurants.  Wife got the tex-mex rolls and they really tasted fresh with the perfect level of spice.  The avocado dip was excellent.  I tried a burger and was shocked to get a nice fresh patty cooked perfectly and super-juicy! Service was excellent - thank you Matt.  Overall we left very satisfied!  Planning a return trip with friends.
Janene H.,"Apopka, FL",771,1351,2078,3.0,6/26/2011,"I've always thought the menu at Cheesecake factory is too big and too varied. The food is mediocre. Not bad, but nothing that wows me either. We dined here for dinner prior to a movie and decided to go with several small plates. We tried the ahi tuna, margarita pizza, crab and artichoke dip, fried artichoke hearts and fried potstickers. I think the favorite was the ahi, believe it or not. It was a nice cool app with a blend of ahi and avocado that went nicely with the accompanying crunchy pita wedges.  Service was good and our server was efficient and had a relaxed, friendly manner. Drinks were pretty weak. My blueberry mojito gets points for having real blueberries in it but was not only weak but was filled to the brim with ice. I also tried the strawberry martini which was good but not strong like promised. (I wasn't trying to get blitzed but I couldn't taste alcohol in either drink!) Usually when we eat here we get the same cheesecake, the white chocolate raspberry truffle. But this time we were swayed into getting the red velvet. Although it was good (what cheesecake here isn't??) I wish we'd gotten the raspberry truffle. The raspberry truffle just has the perfect blend of creamy cheesecake, chocolate and fruit that the red velvet lacked. Stick with what ya know, I guess!"
Nestor M.,"Miami Beach, FL",55,30,14,2.0,1/29/2015,Food was good. The problem was poor service. Drinks took too long to come out. Waitress had too many tables and couldn't keep up. I do t blame her. Just seems that they were way understaffed!!
Bill T.,"Orlando, FL",81,231,9,4.0,12/14/2014,"Okay, I figure it is about time I updated this one. Again, we have been here a few times since my last review and most of the food and service has been consistently good. This time I tried a couple of newer items. We had the cuban egg rolls for an appetizer. They were okay, there wasn't a lot of the pork in them and they were a little greasy, the dipping sauce was just okay and kind of non descript. My wife had the shepherd's pie which was okay. with decent flavor, but the pieces of beef were kind of tough and slightly overcooked. I tried the stuffed tamales which were kind of cold with slightly overcooked chicken and too sweet black beans and too sweet corn cakes. So, overall, the food quality has kind of gone down a little, unless it was just the choices we happened to make. Service was pretty good even though they were pretty busy. The banana cream cheesecake was very tasty, if not quite as creamy as I remembered. I would recommend the cheesecake factory with reservations. Try and go during an off time when it is not quite so busy and stick with the Italian or Asian style dishes."
Travis B.,"Orlando, FL",60,49,,1.0,3/25/2013,"I don't think they'll ever be seeing my face again!  I went with a group of 20 and we had reservations for 6:00 PM.  We didn't get seated until 8:00 PM.  On top of that, when someone from our group asked how much longer the wait would be after we'd been already been waiting for an hour, they told us if we asked again, they'd make us leave.  They'd only asked one time.  That was very rude.  I was about ready to leave at that point. If that's not bad enough, we had to wait another hour to get our food.  We didn't get out of there until almost 11:00 PM.   I emailed their headquarters about my experience, and they sent me a gift card for $10.  Yeah, like I can really buy anything from The Cheesecake Factory with $10.  What, a slice of cheesecake or a drink?  I want an actual meal. Like I said, I don't think I'll be back.  Not to this location, anyway.  I've heard the Mall at Millenia location isn't any better when it comes to waiting."
Pam A.,"Winter Park, Orlando, FL",16,9,19,4.0,2/4/2015,"Great restaurant with happy hour from 4-6pm. Well drinks, wines, and beers at $5 along with $5 appetizers. Love the service, Jaime was awesome and attentive. Only thing to change is the lighting is very dark after 6 in the bar area, otherwise great experience!"
Sydney K.,"Orlando, FL",112,293,43,3.0,4/2/2013,"So, it's your standard Cheesecake Factory. My experiences here have overall been positive, but when it's bad, it's bad. So, I'm not really sure how to review the Cheesecake Factory, but what I can say is it's what you'd expect from this establishment. Long waits for dinner, especially on Friday or Saturday nights, decor that seems like a Rococo mess, and tasty food that may or may not be a heart attack waiting to happen. The good: Overall my experiences with the employees here have been positive. There was this one woman who didn't like the fact that my group was there for dessert only and proceeded to almost attack one of our party with the cheesecake (it had a rough landing), but I don't think she's there anymore. I like the lighter choices menu because you still get tasty food but at a lesser cost to your health. I really love the beet and goat cheese salad, but recently there has been less deliciousness on the plate. I also like the blue cheese flatbread and the turkey burger, but it seems that most things on that menu are a good choice. The cheesecake is pretty good, though I'm a bit of a purist with my cheesecake tastes. It can also be pretty pricey as a slice goes for $7-8. Still, one slice is enough for 3 or 4 people to split if you're feeling thrifty. They also don't make their cheesecake there from what I understand, so I'm disappointed in that. The bad: The calorie counts can be absurd. I know this can be true anywhere, but how do you fit 2000 calories into a shrimp sandwich?! I definitely recommend checking the nutrition info before you go, or at least try to order off the lighter menu if you're trying to be health conscious. The wait can easily hit an hour at peak times, which I know isn't a lot compared to some places. Still, I feel like that's a long time to wait for the Cheesecake Factory. Once you're seated the lights are usually quite dim and the noise can be quite loud. Not exactly my type of place (I like to see my food and dining companions personally), but that in and of itself isn't a bad thing. Long story short, it's Cheesecake Factory, you get what you know you're getting. I prefer patronizing local businesses when I can, but there's nothing wrong with this place."
