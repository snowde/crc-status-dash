Dru M.,"San Francisco, CA",986,473,9,3.0,10/17/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is known for a few things...HUGE menu and cheesecake. Now I am impressed with both...I just wish the regular food was just as good. Instead of giving me an enormous portion...I'd take a bit higher quality instead. This last visit was with my mother and niece. We ordered a few appetizers and entrees and everything was just ok. The lettuce wraps, which I was very excited about, left me wanting more. Service was really nice, but pretty slow. Especially when the restaurant was almost empty.  My favorite part of this Cheesecake Factory is the location...super close to shops and the movie theater. Also free parking.  Overall...standard menu, prices and food. If you're in the mood for variety and cheesecake in Winter Park...this is the place for you."
Elifelet B.,"Deltona, FL",27,14,,4.0,1/4/2015,Like everybody knows their food is amazing but their wait is ridiculous. I went 2 days ago and I waited just over an hour for our table and then an hour for our food which at that point I was no longer hungry and had to take my food to go. I have no problems waiting but why they wouldnt take reservations is also a negative in my book. For the flavor and customer service I would gladly recommend BUT if you dont feel like waiting a long time for you food or have other place to go after dinner then you should skip this restaurant.
Po T.,"Taipei, Taiwan",26,63,91,4.0,11/20/2010,"We went there tonight for wife's birthday dinner and we have not been here for a while but not much has changed. Still lots of people were waiting at the lobby for tables. I like their food, lots of selections with their advertisement laced menu, and the large selections of cheesecakes.  I noticed the snack section of the menu of smaller portion appetizers. I picked out Ahi Tartar and Vietnamese Tacos. The tuna tartar portion was small but tasted good with the sauce on top and the avocado at the bottom. Even my wife liked it more than our favorite Tuna Roll which we also got as well.  Vietnamese Tacos reminded me of the Taiwanese Tacos of similar steamed white buns with roasted pork in the middle.  It came with 3 on the plate and I ate them mostly myself (yum), no one dared to try except my brave and thankfully wide taste-buds daughter (only 7). Don't forget about the free breads they offered which we liked. Two different breads (sourdough and wheat I think) in the basket with the spreadable butter made it a tasty treats before meals even without any appetizers. I had the grilled pork chops and it tasted good with the fresh baked spinach and extremely large portion of the mashed potato turret which was also good. In the past I always ordered something with seafood but I'll eat just about anything.  Wife had her usual fav Chicken Marsala and my sister in-law had the Bam Bam chicken and shrimps which was only okay for her (I tried it and it tasted like curry with coconut shaving on top, pretty good for me).  We were so stuffed and had to get the cheesecakes to go. Overall it's a great restaurant with great food of large portion (always bring home leftovers) and great atmosphere for special occasions.   Valet parking is available but the parking lot next to it has plenty of parking if you have the patience to wait just a bit. Then go for the movie afterward at the theater just right in front of it and end the night in this Winter Park Village shopping center."
Ali H.,"Orlando, FL",78,112,43,4.0,11/15/2014,"Food snobs are going to bash this place endlessly, but to be fair, there aren't very many places that can beat CF for desserts. If you have picky eaters or want a variety of food options, CF is also a good choice. The food is very tasty overall, but it's all overpriced. I do appreciate the new ""Skinnylicious"" menu with tons of options under 500 calories.  I always do the small plate and try new things.  Sadly, this particular locale caters to a younger crowd, 20-sonethings with daddy's money, and parking can be a real hassle during peak hours.  It's very loud so it's not a ""date night"" type of place. They do have a nice happy hour, but I wish they'd do at least some kind of special drink offerings on the weekends, when most of us actually DRINK. I will say that the staff is very nice and surprisingly efficient given the size of this place. It's worth it for the cheesecake alone!"
Nashadyr S.,"Winter Garden, FL",1,16,6,3.0,2/26/2014,"This 3 stars is just for the food because my husband And i went a location in Miami And we chose 2 different pastas And they were really good but the service was just really bad it was a busy night but there was 2 different servers debating who was going to take our table And then after one of them introduced herself to us never brought us the bread to our table until the other server noticed it and had to do it herself and she was taking care of a big party next to us and still took care of us more than our designated server. I would have prefered to have her but oh well another thing I wanted to get a type of pasta but it didn't have shrimps on it it had chicken and I wanted to replace it, and she told me I couldn't do that because ordering the shrimps was going to be like 10 dollars more that should be a star less because costumers always have the reason and they have to work it out for us as much as possible so I'm very disappointed that she was pressuring us to get out the restaurant fast it was my first time ever eating at cheese cake factory and the experience wasn't good at all I hope dining at the one in orlando changes the concept I have of this place otherwise you will be seeing another not so nice review and remember the good can be good as heck but if service is bad it all goes down the hill."
SandJ K.,"Orlando, FL",15,160,10,4.0,10/29/2014,"I will qualify this review with the time and day of the week we went: 7:00p on a Tuesday.  BIG difference in what you experience when it's quiet vs. when there are herds of people waiting/being served.  The hostess, person who seats you and server were friendly, nice people who were polite, cheerful and helpful.  The food was terrific and as it should have been (we've been to Cheese Cake before) and we were able to sit outside on a simply beautiful evening.  If you can go here when it's not packed, it's virtually a different place.  We will not go back any other time than this (and frankly had been avoiding going for some time).  That said, good value and nice drinks and food and obviously delicious cheesecake.  Worth a try when they're not packed"
Chad P.,"Casselberry, FL",7,7,,5.0,12/31/2014,First time i had been here in years...adam m. was our server the wait was long bc of  it being new years eve...i usually hate to wait but it was absolutely worth it....adam was the best server i have ever had in any retaurant ever....

Russ F.,"Oviedo, FL",24,105,8,3.0,5/6/2013,"Everything is ok here. Nothing stands out for me except of course the cheese cake. Little bit of everything. It's funny how the first couple of times I eat here I thought this place was the greatest. A nice place to go for a casual dinner with friends. Last time I went my girlfriend got a martini, made on the strong side, it was so good she got another one, but I had to finish it for her. The server was nice and told us her favorites and made some suggestions. Food came out hot and tasted good, an ok experience."
Larry C.,"Miami, FL",74,153,81,5.0,8/31/2014,"I don't frequent as much to the Cheesecake Factory just because it is not in my diet, but whenever you feel like cheating and it's late at night you're out with some friends and you know Orlando, everything closes early especially fine dining, but if it's around 10pm and you still want to get great food and better yet friendly service at that time of the night? visit this location because you will definitely get it. The food is also really good really fresh and our waitress was top notch really attentive and took care of us quick. Plus i have to say valet was even so awesome because he told us im not parking any more cars but here i will give you one of the tix and you can park right at front of the restaurant SWEET !!! - really great night, with some great friends and delicious food."
Asma A.,"Orlando, FL",0,8,2,1.0,1/8/2016,"I had a really bad experience, we ordered appetizers that took too long to come and one of them , they gave it to the wrong person, they apologized and offered it for free but still it was so late and was not ready until we finished our main course which was not satisfying as well since my burger was not cooked as I wanted ! However the first appetizer which was the slider was perfect."
Mary D.,"Orlando, FL",38,81,90,3.0,7/18/2014,"Cheesecake Factory has been my favorite restaurant for years, and this is the location I normally go to. My last two experiences have not been very good, though. I worry that this location is going downhill. Came with my boyfriend a couple weeks ago. We were tucked away in a weird area if the restaurant, but we didn't complain. Waitress was not very attentive. Maybe because we were seated in such a weird area she just forgot about us. Took her a long time to take our order and bring us bread. I got a skinny flatbread which was very good. Boyfriend got chicken and biscuits, which is normally one of our favorites. They were out of mashed potatoes so he agreed to breakfast potatoes, which were literally the worst breakfast potatoes either of us have ever had. Dry, way way oversalted, and not hot. Seemed like he got the dredges leftover from brunch. There was a large party seated at the table next to us, and we noticed it took them forever to get their food as well. I'm sure I'll be back here because I love CF so much, but I'm hoping they manage to turn things around and get their service and food quality back to where it should be. The Cheesecake Factory I know provides nothing but excellent service and perfect food, but that has not been my experience on the last two trips."
Todd S.,"Deltona, FL",0,28,3,5.0,12/22/2015,"Others have posted negatives, I must have come in at a perfect night! They were busy, some had to wait, but the food was good, service top-notch, great atmosphere!"
Becky F.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",65,159,262,1.0,7/30/2014,"Went with a group weren't sat until all members showed up. After waiting we still had to sit in different locations. not only slow service tonight,  but they couldn't keep track with orders, tabs.  only a couple of people ordered cheesecake and this was received after the bill was finally paid. The dessert was presented in a plastic container. This isn't fast food. You could definitely tell by the extreme wait and rude ending of our group outing. The plan was to go see a movie afterwards. well no one at all made it to a show. This is the last time I am coming to this problematic store. maybe if they had a drive thru they could keep up with volume of customers."
Mallory H.,"Orlando, FL",0,18,10,2.0,12/7/2014,I do not get why people like this place so much - aside from the cheesecake. We made a reservation for a large group and waited 30 minutes to get sat into FIVE different tables. The service was great though; very friendly and attentive. The food portions are out of control. I split and entree and still had food leftover. It was overly salted. No craft beer and the drinks were 8$. So many better places to go. And parking is a joke.
Valerie R.,"Breinigsville, PA",12,42,56,1.0,2/14/2015,"So much for a special Valentines Day dinner. Loved the Cheesecake Factory in the past and we were excited to return, but after our experience tonight I am done! So the wait was more than an hour and a half which I expected for Valentines Day, but then I inquired about the bar tables. The  server said we could eat at the high top tables on a first come first serve basis. Everyone ahead of us was very respectful and as tables became available, we sat in the order in which we arrived, but then a young family decided they were going to sit at the next table ahead of those that had been waiting. Needless to say there was a verbal altercation. What was very disappointing, was that the waiter, Louis, got involved and stated ""I get to choose who sits where"" and accommodated the rude couple ahead of those of us who were waiting. Thank goodness the manager stepped in and straightened things out. From there, the visit went down hill. The food was mediocre and our waiter was rude! His name was Tony. Truly a disappointing visit. I'm never going back!"
Allison M.,"Manila, Philippines",87,216,283,3.0,10/15/2012,"While the size of the menu at The Cheesecake Factory is impressive, what's less impressive is the food itself.  Everything we tried - aside from the cheesecake - was over salted, and otherwise bland, my pasta especially. It's sad that the only spice some restaurants seem to know how to use is salt. There's so many other flavors out there! They don't skimp on the portions either, and the cheesecake was no exception. The one slice we shared looked as large as my face, and so sweet that neither of us could finish it. That being said, the service was quick and nice. There's just plenty of better restaurants around Winter Park."
Sarah R.,"Erie, PA",189,96,437,1.0,2/14/2015,"I will start off by saying that the manager was absolutely wonderful and accommodating. After getting a rough start to our Valentine's Day dinner he made sure to try his best to turn it around. That being said our waiter, Tony, is probably the most arrogant person I have ever had wait on me. My Cheesecake Factory experience has been completely ruined by him. Not only did I receive a few eye rolls but also some serious attitude just from asking a few simple questions. But hey he's obviously trying to work towards a zero dollar tip. He has completely ruined my families Valentine's Day dinner and if I was management I would get rid of this employee asap because he's pushing away paying customers. Thank you Tony for being such a pleasure, if it's not in your best interest to work hard for your tips, then you're in the wrong business. Steer clear of this place unless you want to be treated like dirt."
Ruth B.,"Hutchinson Island, FL",171,55,13,5.0,3/6/2012,"This place has an atmosphere that is amazing!!!!!!  Good food, but a bit pricey and just like everyone else says...waaay too many choices to choose from...it takes you forever to decide! However...the Avocado Egg-rolls are to die for, as are the crispy crab wontons! Our waitress, Arielle, is the friendliest waitress EVER! You should definitely give this place a try if you haven't already, but be prepared to be there awhile reading the vast menu!  Definitely not a place to go too often as it is quite pricey...but it makes for a great date spot!  Don't forget to try the Avocado Egg-rolls!  :)"
Lisa A.,"Orlando, FL",121,215,199,3.0,7/6/2014,"Yes the cheesecake here is fantastic...it's in the name, it better be! Food was tasty and the portion was definitely huge! But $11 for an ice filled glass of Sangria...really Cheesecake Factory?? Really?? No wonder they don't put the prices on the drink menu! I'll probably stick with the ToGo Cheesecake and avoid eating here in the future!"
Janel G.,"Cerritos, CA",484,352,935,2.0,7/3/2012,"I can see why I read an article stating that stock in The Cheesecake Factory is going down...  Man, they are not what they used to be.  The food is still pretty good.  But the service BLOWS!! I've gone to this location about 5-6 times in less than a year.  And it's definitely not for the experience.  Thank goodness their cheesecake is consistently yummy. There's 1 particular server I avoid because we've had him twice and he's a total jerk off!?!  He rolls his eyes and makes faces like we're annoying him!  Sorry.  You work in a service industry.  You're here to serve us.  duh. The last time we went, thankfully it was just me and my honey.  No kids.  No grandparents.  So, we weren't too pressed for time.  Maybe they could sense that because they took FOR-EVER.  And when they did bring our food out, mine was wrong.  So, my honey ate all his food while I waited another eternity for my order...  and then it came out cold.  and still a little wrong.  they brought me regular fries instead of sweet potatoe fries.  He quickly took away the regular ones and eventually brought out the right ones.  Geez...  as much waiting as I had to do, the least he could've done was left me something to snack on while i waited, right?? Anyhoo...  I might just buy a whole Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake from Costco instead.  skip all the nonsense  :-)"
