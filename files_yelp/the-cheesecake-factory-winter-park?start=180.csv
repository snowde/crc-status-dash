Roni E.,"Maitland, FL",8,18,,4.0,7/4/2014,Usually dine via their curbside. They can mixup the order sometimes but staff is friendly and food is good.   Overall they do a good job and not cheap by the way.
Rhea P.,"Orlando, FL",2497,2036,2171,4.0,3/3/2010,"You know what, I could just come here and hang out.  The smooth jazz music, lighting and ceiling art is enough to make me happy. Throw in a great garlic entree, seasoned just right, with Parmesan and I'm good to go! I'm looking forward to a return visit just to try other options.  Great place for a date (if you have have time to wait for a table)!"
Justin P.,"Orlando, FL",0,12,1,3.0,10/9/2015,"I recently went to this location with my family to celebrate my becoming a Registered Nurse. The service we received from our waiter (Nicholas) was excellent. He made sure to check in on our table multiple times while we were there to make sure our glasses were never empty. He also was very friendly and always had a smile on his face. However our food was a different story, my 2 younger children both ordered Mac and cheese. Both there orders we delivered with under cooked macaroni, I also received the wrong item. Nicholas was very apologetic about the mistake and the raw macaroni, he told me that he would have the manager come to talk to me. This however never happened, you would expect that the manager of such a nice restaurant would have come to apologize for the mistakes the kitchen has made. I have been to cheaper restaurants before and the manager would come rushing if something was wrong. I did not request any consolation for the mistakes with our order but I did expect at least the manager to show concern. I paid over $120.00 for dinner and my entire order wasn't even what I expected from such a restaurant. If it wasn't for our server Nicholas being so friendly I probably would not return to this restaurant."
Kimberly S.,"Winter Park, FL",11,38,15,4.0,1/23/2014,Love the food! Wide variety. My friend ordered the Strawberry Shortcake which I never would have ordered at Cheesecake Factory but it was the bomb!
Alyssa T.,"Orlando, FL",12,31,9,4.0,9/4/2014,"Went here last night with the fiance, I loved it. I got Thai lettuce wraps, pasta do Vinci, and a side Caesar salad. Everything tasted wonderful, but was very pricey. My fiance got a burrito and said it was very bland and had a lot of uncooked rice though. Other than him not liking his meal, it was great!"
Natalia H.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",18,43,12,4.0,5/2/2014,"I love their soups of the day. Their lunch options are good for a good price. The Miso salmon is delishis , however their signature drinks are only an OK, better go with a beer :-)"
Jason G.,"Greencastle, PA",8,184,,4.0,6/8/2014,"While this place is chain, its a very good chain. The menu is super extensive, the prices are reasonable, the staff was good. We also had two young children in our party and when the food came out the waitress placed the hot plates away from the children. Nice touch! Otherwise you know what you are going to get. Just get there early, the wait can be insane!!"
Chad G.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",0,13,25,4.0,5/5/2013,"Cheesecake factory, how could you go wrong?! My personal fav. chain... For the portions they give you, its double than your chili's or TGIF. As far as there apps go I'd get there buffalo blast or mac n' cheese balls. As far as entrees go. Can't go wrong with there Farfalle pasta, chicken Romano, burrito grade, or teriyaki chicken. There cheesecake beats anyone else, that's why we all come here, right!? ADAMS PEANUT BUTTER!!!"
Gus F.,"Hutchinson Island, FL",170,187,60,3.0,12/26/2011,"I've eaten here many times and I am just now getting around to reviewing TCF. Great decor and good service here. I agree with everyone else, their menu is way too big. You spend most of your time trying to figure out what to order.  The worst meal I've ever had there was the Fettucini Alfredo. It was so ""garlicky"" that I couldn't finish it.(And I finish everything, because as I've said many times, I eat like a pig) Their steaks are OK but expensive and you can definitely get a better steak for that price somewhere else. I simply don't know why, but every morning after I eat there I feel like s*** and I  really don't know why? Regardless, for me....that ain't good. I have never tried their cheesecake and intend to do so. However, when I'm in that area again, I intend to take Megan B.'s advice and try Mitchell's Seafood. Then head over to The CHEESECAKE Factory for CHEESECAKE."
Elaine B.,"Apopka, FL",0,36,21,3.0,4/20/2014,"The meat loaf listed on the menu is missing a couple of ingredients. It should say ""green pepper meat loaf with mushroom gravy""."
Joe K.,"Orlando, FL",170,104,23,4.0,6/16/2011,"Who doesn't love TCF? I mean they have an ever-expanding menu littered with tasty choices of plates plus a vast selection of VERY tasty desserts! I will say that it's rare I ever want to order dessert at a restaurant but TCF always seems to have a draw for people to be baited by that scrumptious Vanilla Bean Cheesecake! The food can be decent to fantastic at times. I've always stuck with what I love and have never been disappointed. For parties looking for a vast array of entrees ranging from Cajun to Asian TCF will not disappoint. Granted all entrees here will have an ""americanized"" taste to it the taste factor has never disappointed. I will say upon my more recent visits the bread brought out as an appetizer has been hit or miss. Sometimes the breads will be warm and others well I've eaten bricks softer than them. The entree's are definitely on the pricier side of the wallet but it's not overtly pricey where I just feel terrible. I will say that for my parents who are hardly ever restaurant goers they sure are a fan of this place! They are always asking when the next holiday will be just so they will have an excuse to dine out at The Cheesecake Factory. A definite favorite chain for sure."
Rob R.,"Norfolk, CT",0,15,,1.0,11/20/2012,"Went for lunch at the weekend. Although the place was not busy 5 of us were sat at a 4 seat table with a tiny almost childs seat at one end.  Food was ok except when my daughter mentioned to the waitress that the bacon in her carbonara was burnt (it was), there was no apology of any kind. I would probably try again but the place is really on it's last chance with me!!"
Heidi B.,"Orlando, FL",74,160,24,5.0,2/1/2012,"Alright so I have to preface this review by stating that I love The Cheesecake Factory as a chain, regardless of the location or size of the restaurant itself.  Having said that, I really do enjoy the Winter Park Village Cheesecake Factory. I first started frequenting this Cheesecake when I moved to Orlando to go to school at UCF, and even though it was a little bit of a trek to get there, I always had a fun time going whether it was for a birthday dinner, date, or girls' night out. The ambiance of this restaurant is great--dim lighting, high ceilings, with plenty of indoor seating, some outdoor seating, a full bar, and even a bakery area for those who just want to order cheesecake or other delectable desserts.  As far as the service goes, I have actually never experienced an issue at this particular Cheesecake Factory. I unfortunately can't say the same about my old hometown Cheesecake in Fort Lauderdale, but I have also come to realize that if you go to any restaurant often enough you're likely to encounter a problem at some point.  One thing I do love at Cheesecake Factory is the bread basket. Another is the strawberry lemonade--worth a try if you've never had it anymore and enjoy sweet beverages. I would also recommend any of their salads, keeping in mind that their salads are HUGE (the good thing is they do sell half-salad portions). And of course if you've never had it, you need to try a slice of cheesecake--even if you have to share it across the table!"
Jim S.,"Oviedo, Orlando, FL",0,2,,1.0,6/7/2015,"Terrible food and terrible service.  Not crowded on a Sunday evening and it took over an hour for the food to arrive.  My wife ordered a bacon cheeseburger, the burger came out with burnt bacon and no top bun.  I will not be returning!"
Nic W.,"Sarasota, FL",87,71,133,4.0,7/24/2011,I love cheesecake so it makes it easy to want to go here. My favorite is the White Chocolate Macadamia Cheesecake. That alone is worth 5 stars.  My only drawback with TCF is that there menu is too large...to the point that I havent found anything that I love there. This last trip i had my best meal yet but still nothing I will crave to want to make me go back.  As far as sides...the mash-potatoes are always good and this trip we tried the sweet potato fries...they were great. :) Overall I like the place and hope to find a meal I love there one day.
Ashley H.,"Orlando, FL",228,378,23,3.0,10/27/2013,"If you've ever been to The Cheesecake Factory, you pretty much know what you're getting into. Huge restaurant, even bigger menu, and usually (if you're like me) you don't have room for actual cheesecake.  My favorite dish is the Tuna Tataki Salad. Pricy, yes, but it's a large salad with seared ahi tuna slices, avocado, tomato, greens, and a delicious soy-based dressing to go with it. A really healthy and yummy option. I also love the chicken pot stickers, although they have definitely gone up in price in the last year! My fiance loves the chicken parmesan sandwich and orders it every time we go.  The reason I couldn't rate this higher is because of the service. I go here by myself a lot, and the service can be spotty. If I'm alone, a lot of people choose to ignore me and focus on other people. However, last time we were here, I had the worst possible service. We ordered everything right away, from drinks to appetizers.  It took about 15 minutes to get any kind of drink on the table. Closer to 25 for the appetizer. But the entree? We waited over an hour to receive our food. At first we were nice about it and asked our server a few times. She kept saying it was ""coming out in a few minutes"". At one point she finally admitted that she put the food in late. She told us the food would come ""in two minutes"". Two minutes became 20. We politely asked to speak with a manager. When no one came, my fiance had to actually get up from the table and find her himself. Our food came as the manager arrived, and we explained our situation. I was really polite about the whole thing and just explained why we weren't happy.  At first she tried to excuse the situation by saying that the server was ""pacing our food"". I wasn't buying that, because no one paces out food for this long of a meal. Other patrons had already come and gone by the time we received our food. She looked at me and said, ""What do you want me to do?"" Like I was a nuisance to her. I asked her what she would normally do in this situation, and she said, ""Well, do you want to eat it or not?"" She was so charming, let me tell you. She walked away to let us decide whether we wanted to eat our food or not. We did, and asked for the check. They took off our entrees, which I felt was appropriate but never would have asked for.  The manager's response was so awful that I honestly feel like I would drive to the Millennia location before I'd come back to this one."
Sarah P.,"Ormond Beach, FL",0,7,,2.0,2/22/2016,"Almost every single time I come here my order is wrong. (There's been only two that the order has been right). All I want is the ""Crispy Spicy Chicken Sandwich"" without the spicy sauce. It should NOT be that hard to ring in the sandwich with no sauce!  It has been wrong at LEAST 6 times I've been there. Usually the servers admit that they misunderstood which is fine, but tonight the server said she ""went ahead and got me the regular chicken sandwich"" which is a different cut of chicken, on a different type of bread, with a whole bunch of stuff on it and it was grilled instead of fried. She even asked when I ordered if I wanted chipotle or buffalo sauce when I ordered the spicy crispy chicken. There's no way she misunderstood me that much. You don't just change someone's orders. It's unacceptable. Cheesecake Factory, if you're going to have a huge menu, you need to spend way more time training your servers. And when they mess up, they need to go straight to the kitchen and call for the food, then immediately get a manger. Instead our server went to the computer to ring it in the second time. I don't think she got a manager since no one came to our table while I waited for the second (still wrong) sandwich. I walked out of there tonight still hungry and ended up getting something to eat at Steak 'n Shake."
Eric K.,"Orlando, FL",0,16,,1.0,3/29/2015,Tried to call in my to go order but was left on hold. Went in to restaurant to place order. Had to wait 35 minutes when told wait would be 20-25 min. Made a simple request for 2 sides of ranch. Order came up. No ranch. Had to wait an additional 10 minutes as the lady working the counter left and came back with 1 side of ranch She had to call kitchen AGAIN. Finally they brought me the second container but it was the wrong size. All while what I assumed to be some type of manager was standing there arguing with the lady about something she was looking for. Line behind me was 6 people deep. Tired of waiting I just left. Food was bland and cold.
Sherry m.,"Winter Springs, FL",56,37,9,5.0,12/31/2010,"I LOVE the cheesecake factory. They have every kind of food you can imagine and everything is actually cooked well. I get the chicken picana (2 fried breaded chicken breasts with a white wine butter sauce and mashed potatoes) and it is wonderful. Try not to be guilted into not sharing here. Everything is massive and one dish is perfect for 2 people and if you share than you can afford to eat cheesecake too! My recommendation: Eat the brown bread mmmmmm, share chicken picana, and share a slice of chocolate tuxedo cheesecake (or lemon raspberry if you are not a chocolate person). all for less than $30"
Billy C.,"Orlando, FL",62,31,2,2.0,10/12/2013,"I got cheesesteak sandwich, and it was good not the best but good. The service was horrible. waiter didn't give us stuff when we ask for it. wrong orders, mix up orders. one of our friends didnt even receive there food until we ask them and by that time they didnt even start cooking it, must have forgotten. Had to ask for limes/lemons like 5 times. Rude tone. just bad experience."
