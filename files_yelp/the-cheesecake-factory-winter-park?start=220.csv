Lisa G.,"Winter Springs, FL",1,33,,4.0,2/15/2010,"I was surprised to read some of the negative ratings of this place, because I absolutely adore CheeseCake Factory.   Although, I will admit I've been to better CCF's in other locations that I would have to rate higher.  Still, it is a CCF and it is amazing.  It's a great place for getting together with friends, family, or even a date night.  The decor is classy, but still a place you could wear jeans and chill.  The lighting sets the mood for sure.   Plan to spend 20 minutes just reading over their menu because it's HUGE.  Almost like a book.  If you have picky eaters in your family, they surely will find something they like in this bible of a menu.  The service at this particular restaurant is...eh...ok.  What you would expect for this type of joint.  The portions are LARGE so if you are expecting to also have cheesecake...you may want to make that a seperate trip :) Also, they have FABULOUS drinks from their bar.  A great place for a date if you ask me."
Ed M.,"Deltona, FL",71,69,95,5.0,9/9/2012,I've been eating here since it opened at this location. Always top-notch service and great food. Today was no exception. Much better than the location at the Mall at Millennia.
Megan B.,"St. Cloud, FL",62,257,,2.0,11/1/2011,"This place is got to be the most overrated place I've ever been to. I've never been ""blown away"" by my high priced entrees, There's a resturaunt across the street (Mitchells Seafood) that is 100x better, and chances are-not as crowded. I've been to The Cheesecake Factory three times. One was for a date, I'll admit, it's a very pretty place for a nice date, but the food is a let down, I think Olive Garden makes better Pasta. The other times were for work get togethers. Even if you go for a peice of the cheaper cheesecake and get a fountain drink it's gonna be about 12.00-15.00. If you are gonna throw down some money for a good meal, there are tons of other better selections in that area."
Bruce C.,"Independence, MO",4,48,29,2.0,6/16/2010,"I too can not understand the draw of this establishment. The food is ok, nothing special. The prices are high, but right for the majority of clientele. Atmosphere is nice but loud and the service is lacking. Other choices in the same plaza should be experience first. You can find much better cheesecake at ""Andrea Quality Cheesecake"" on Edgewater Drive."
Paulette G.,"Largo, FL",357,45,147,5.0,4/7/2012,Love this place its food is Yummy perfect place for a date. Ok prices ...only thing is sometimes its a wee bit to dark
Rashmi P.,"Orlando, FL",270,185,325,4.0,1/18/2012,"Consistent flavors, fresh ingredients, well executed dishes including the international flavors, and the extensive menu has turned me into their loyal customer for life."
Doug G.,"Maitland, FL",1,7,,2.0,5/3/2011,"Why does everyone love cheesecake factory so much?  They have expensive drinks and their food is always so heavy and buttery.  I feel like I need to run 10 miles after eating here and if I am going to pig out and spend a bunch of money I want to really enjoy it.  Some dishes are, admittedly, tasty (i.e. the avocado egg roles) but overall this is never my first pick.  And am I the only one who finds the decor cheesy?"
Jeff C.,"Beaverton, OR",78,35,1,3.0,4/30/2012,"Overpriced normal food. Large food sizes and fresh vegs. Of course the cheesecake is great with tons of selections. I would say if you want cheesecake , eat somewhere else and eat desert there...save some money."
Sam B.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,85,26,5.0,1/3/2012,"Love the desert selection.  Red velvet, upside down pineapple cheesecake, and coconut what's there to dislike?"
Julianne E.,"Orlando, FL",125,215,48,5.0,3/11/2011,"Wow I had never been there before.  What a selection they had!  I got the lunch portion pizza and salad.  I could have fed an army with just the lunch portion it was huge!  I forgot the name of the pizza, but it had goat cheese, kalamata olives, arthichoke, eggplant, and whatever else. It was by far the best tasting pizza i ever had!  There was a different flavor in every bite.   I had to grab a piece of cheescake for the road.  Even though i was full, i still managed to shovel it in when i got back to work...  Yum!"
Amanda C.,"Orlando, FL",0,19,31,3.0,5/1/2009,"My mother and I went here for a birthday party last night. We had a nice spacious table for a large group with a few extra seats. My Mom and I ordered the calamari appetizer to share, it was a few dollars more than other restaurants but tasted the same as other places (EXACTLY THE SAME) and was the same portion size. We also ordered drinks which were good, however I noticed a man down the table and I both ordered pina coladas, but he had a larger glass and strawberry, cherry, and pineapple around his cup whereas they gave me a smaller glass with only cherry and pineapple even though we were presumably paying the same price. I did not appreciate the inconsistency. I also noticed that they didn't ID me, something every other restaurant has done, thanks for saving me the inconvenience of pulling out my ID, but I guess it's on them if I'm underage (I'm not).  Moving on to the main course, chicken madeira. It was delicious and for $15.95 it was a large portion size. I ordered mashed potatoes with mine. I had an issue with the MASHED potatoes because they weren't really MASHED. There was large chunks of potato inside the mashed potatoes and they were really thick. They had good flavor though. After dinner, we ordered a delicious and fair priced key lime cheesecake to share. It was really nice and the key lime covered up the sweetness of the cheesecake. Our service was okay, however being a large group we had two servers. When we got our bill they had already added in the 18% tip which we felt was unfair because none of the servers deserved an 18% tip in our opinion and we didn't really even know who we were tipping. That brought our bill up to $96.00 for appetizers, drinks, dinner, and dessert. Oh yeah, and the restaurant was extremely cold. Like, hospital cold."
Cheryl S.,"Orlando, FL",1,15,,5.0,3/18/2011,"One of my favorite places to dine with friends.  Great food, huge menu, delicious cheesecake....the food is always top quality and served fast.  Love it!"
Tedd S.,"Leesburg, FL",52,193,34,5.0,8/22/2010,"I can't think of another chain restaurant that does it as good as CCF.  Who could duplicate the absolutely massive menu and combine it with nearly perfect customer care?  I am impressed with the professionalism of the entire staff...you know, it's refreshingly-badass!  Perhaps there's a lesson to be learned here for ALL chain restaurants?!  I had ""Sheila's"" salad for lunch today and it had 1/2 a flock of roasted chicken in it and what seemed like 2 handfuls of cashews ($11.95).  Had to have cheescake and ordered the fresh banana cream cheescake...HELLO, are freekin kidding me...I thought I was swinging from a banana tree branch eating a banana from my hairy hand!  CCF rocks, no doubt about it."
Mr M.,"Maitland, FL",2,34,,4.0,5/27/2011,"Great food, but this has to be one loudest places to eat at. Service was okay. A large high school seniors group was across the room and I have a stong feeling that hey were demanding a lot of attention and made it louder then normal in the place. Again great food, the cheesecakes are wonderful, I am betting this is why they named the place after cheesecake lol."
Nathan B.,"Maitland, FL",1,37,6,3.0,8/19/2011,"It's the cheesecake factory. If you've been here you know the deal if you haven't get ready for MASSIVE portions of desserts and any other dish. My favorites lately have been salads and if you go at lunch the ""lunch portion"" is still massive. I guess they serve giants here because really who doesn't leave with a take out bag. Really take a look when you arrive."
Anna C.,"Orlando, FL",0,48,4,5.0,3/13/2011,"Amazing food, lovely atmosphere. 5 stars for the BEST waiter I've ever had!!!"
Antonio E.,"Orlando, FL",368,89,15,2.0,2/5/2010,"Had to rate this specific restaurant a two star because our silverware had RICE on them. They were not clean and had a manager swap them out for new ones. They didnt even apologize or offer us ANYTHING; they said we could make a complaint to corporate if we wanted to. Cheesecake Factory indeed has good food, however the service here was not so great. You would think because its in Winter Park and its Cheesecake Factory there would be higher expectations...but apparently not."
John L.,"Miami Springs, FL",25,182,1095,3.0,7/8/2008,"The Winter Park location is nice,decorated with some art deco style.we had to wait a little bit to be seated....but the place wasn't even busy and many of the waiters were just hanging around here and there and the hostess was not useful,finally we got a  table and the waitress( I think her name was Sarah) was really nice and friendly and she suggested some of her favorite cheesecakes. my friends and i tried just cheesecakes, the first one was the original strawberry chesecake, i had tiramisu cheesecake and  the other one tried macadamia caramel cheesecake wich was really good,the place is a little bit pricey"
Bernadette M.,"Grand Junction, CO",23,20,,1.0,6/9/2006,"I do not understand the fascination with this restaurant. I have been here on a number of occasions, as well as their location in Milena and I simply do not understand it. It takes forever to be seated and ten another eon for wait staff to come to your table, they take your drink order and then vanish for at least 20 minutes--without even setting the party up with water glasses.  The atmosphere is dim and cozy--if only their menu and service were as well done.  Service here is by far the worst I have ever had. Slow is an understatement. It took 30 minutes for me (out of a table of four) to get a drink from a racist waitress (it was noted by everyone at the table, two of which were also African American), and another 15 after she finally had someone else bring it out because she screwed up an order for a Pepsi w/o ice. At the end of the meal our server had the audacity to blame her one other table because it was a large party--as if handling two tables was too much for her to handle.  The food is mediocre at best and definitely not worth the prices they charge. Quite honestly, I've had better pasta at Olive Garden and out of my own kitchen. Their steak dishes are decent but again overpriced. They give you enough food for a small army so beware if you're trying to monitor portions--you can always leave with a doggie bag...too bad the food is even worse reheated.  Their drinks are sub par, though I have friends who love their specialties. Personally, the strawberry daiquiris are FAR better at TGI Friday's.  Overall the only good thing about the place is Cheesecake. I say that only because I hate cheesecake but a couple of their many varieties actually appealed to me to try and I actually liked it. Not enough to become a lover of the desert, but they were good. However, I can't see paying that much and waiting that long for a desert."
John W.,"Orlando, FL",49,8,10,4.0,3/11/2010,I had the privilege of meeting my wife at The Cheesecake Factory for a weekday lunch. We were seated quickly and were able to place an order right away. Food was served quick and was delicious. We had the lunch-sized pizza and salad. I chose the Roasted Vegetables and Goat Cheese Pizza with a garden salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette. My lovely partner selected the white pizza and Caesar salad. The food exceeded our expectations and the service was friendly and professional.
