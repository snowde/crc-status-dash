Cody B.,"Orlando, FL",0,17,,4.0,5/4/2011,"Not the best service here, but oh how I do love fried mac and cheese balls. Also the ribeye was $30 but cooked perfectly and well seasoned. Can't forget the peanut butter cheesecake!"
H W.,"Hendersonville, NC",2,224,187,5.0,9/7/2009,"Can't ever say anything bad about Cheesecake Factory. Always good service, great menu, great food. And of course awesome cheescake."
Cookin S.,"Lake Wales, FL",0,19,3,4.0,6/23/2011,"Couldn't see why anyone would eat here a few years back. My ""main squeeze"" said after our movie..""let's give Cheesecake another shot"". So we did, and boy...what a shocker. Loved their new menu. Even though it was a Saturday and right at dinner time, we were lucky to get seated fast at a nice bar table. Waiter was ""Mr. Johnny On The Spot"". He knew where we were coming from with our loony ultra-low carb diet (no bread, no carby potatoes or veggies..ok..did do ""Jack and club soda"" gotta live a bit I say). Anyway, pork chops were deelish, my loveys steak was superb and cooked the way he liked it, salads were great...But no simple vinegar and oil. They only had Balsamic (too carby). Our waiter brought us a vinegar that ""he found"" which tasted funny to me and ""main squeeze"". We both survived the night so I guess it did the trick...I tell ya folks at Cheesecake Factory in Winter Park, FL I am sure glad I came back...you finally did it right..almost. About time I say..4 stars..would have been 5 but waiter doesn't like pork and told me so when I was eating it and the worm joke put a damper on it a bit. Vinegar creeped me out too. Also, need more items for low carby folks. Cheesecake is fine, but don't do that anymore. Yeah, you're wondering ""why is this gal eating at cheesecake?"". Duh, I dunno. Peace outta here."
andrea c.,"Manhattan, NY",2,35,4,1.0,2/28/2011,"Its way too overpriced for a cafeteria experience.  What a rip-off.  I used to love Cheesecake Factory, stopped going when I moved out of the area and have been back to this location twice in the last year. The first visit was for a day-time lunch and it was fine, nothing special, but its just a chain restaurant.  The last time I went on a Friday night.  The service was terrible from the get-go.  I'm not sure if we arrived at the time when lunch turned to dinner - but they wouldn't seat anybody for at least 20 minutes despite the fact that the dining room was practically empty.  Then, they seated us all at once.  We had told them we were a party of 3 and when the girl called us, she said party of 4.  I corrected her, to make sure we weren't taking somebody else's table and she got very upset and told us that we would have to be taken off the list and put back on at the end if we were going to change our minds.  Then another girl quickly came over and took care of the situation, but it was just the beginning of the bad service. When were finally seated, the seats and tables are so close together that without trying you're completely aware of the people next to you, what they're ordering, everything the server says to them, how there meal is.. its cramped quarters unless you get a booth - but they won't give booths to parties of less than 4 people.   I ordered the gluten-free beer that was on the menu - but when the server  came back, they were out and she didn't think they were re-stocking.  So beware, its on the menu and online, but they don't have it.  I ordered the only VEGAN item on the menu  - a salad and when I didn't want to add chicken or shrimp the girl rolled her eyes at me.  Its pretty typical to get bad service when you ask a lot of questions about the food.   When the salad came out it was missing 3-4 key ingredients.  I received a giant bowl of torn iceburg (not romaine people) iceburg with a chopped tomato and shredded carrots.  I had to ask her for the other ingredients that were listed in the menu (I'm forgetting the specifics now).  She said that nobody ordered this ""cheap salad"" so it wasn't their fault that they forgot.  By the time our 3 party was out of there the bill was almost $80.  Thank goodness one of us had a gift certificate.   Its way too overpriced for a cafeteria experience."
Brandi B.,"Sanford, FL",231,267,74,5.0,9/21/2008,"CCF has an awesome lil' bar menu from 4p-6p prices are all around $5 or less. My personal faves include: Thai lettuce wraps, Cuban sliders, cobb salad, and the deep fried tempura sushi that was very tasty. =)"
Jamie K.,"Lake Dallas, TX",997,757,160,3.0,7/8/2008,"This place is okay. It's not better or worse than the other locations. There are much better options within walking distance, so I don't eat here often. They do serve this chicken biscuit on a mountain of mash potatoes that is pretty damn yummy. My kids love it. Plus the portions are so huge you can feed the whole tribe. My only complaint is they don't take reservations. We had a party of 8 for Sunday brunch and they wouldn't take a reservation for parties less than 10 or 20."
Monico S.,"San Jose, CA",78,6,,2.0,2/25/2011,"you know the saying ""you get what you paid for""? when you spend 20 or so bucks, you expect the food to be at least as good as that. which isn't the case here. but if you're a fan of over price mediocre food, then by all means head to the cheesecake factory. the food wasn't at all terrible. but i can say one thing good about the cheesecake factory, is that the cheesecakes are actually worth their price. go for the cheesecakes but not the food."
Sandy H.,"Orlando, FL",0,33,,3.0,1/24/2012,"We are long time patrons of all Cheesecake Factories. Love their food, their unbelievable selection of menu items and of course, their scrumptious cheesecakes! 9 out of 10 visits are very good for the most part. At this location, however, on a recent visit, I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (one of my favorites). When it arrived at our table, the dish was 1/2 the size it normally is ($16.95) for this dish. I was with several clients, so I did not want to make a scene, but I was shocked to say the least. I thought maybe they had mistakenly given me a lunch size portion of this meal and would have charged me accordingly, but that was not the case. I was still charged the $16.95 price. Normally, I would eat 1/2 of this meal and take the other half home, acceptable solution for the high priced meal. Not on this occasion. I ate the entire 1/2 portion that was served to me. I left very disappointed. Not only was the portion 1/2 it's normal size, but the chicken in this dish was grizzly, someone forgot to trim the fat off the chicken! I contacted CCF through their website the next day and also called management at the CCF store to tell them what happened. No response from their website. No return call from management either."
Dany C.,"Winter Park, FL",6,33,2,5.0,7/18/2010,"Service was great! This locale has both inside and patio dining. We decided to go for the patio dining. Our wait for a table wasn't long (about 5 minutes) and the host/greeter was very nice. The server was also very nice and the food was flavorful. We began with the Spinach and Cheese artichoke Dip, which was accompanied by chips, diced tomatoes, and sour cream. It was very good! For my main course I had a medium Filet Mignon, which was very tender and cooked exactly as I expected. For dessert I chose the Apple Caramel strudel Cheesecake, which was the topping to an amazing meal. The restaurant is very nice and clean. I wouldn't recommend this locale for an intimate or romantic dinner as the inside dining can get a bit loud. You could try the patio dining but it still may not be the best for that special date or anniversary if you're looking for something a bit more private. All in all I love this restaurant and would recommend it if your looking for a great meal and variety of food."
Lonna G.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,52,3,3.0,3/14/2009,"the menu is huge here, never a shortage of choices, thats a plus.  the food is tasty but nothing spectacular, just average american style food.  the pecan crusted fish was nice and as always i'm a huge fan of their Vanilla Bean Cheesecake its like a dream in your mouth, if that makes any sense at all.."
