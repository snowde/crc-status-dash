RH ..,"Orlando, FL",0,4,,1.0,1/2/2018,this used to be so good and they changed everything. it tastes plain and bland. also they only came by one time and i went most of my meal without a drink. it was also a very tight space  this is a very terrible restaurant
Phylicia K.,"Hollywood, FL",258,547,771,5.0,1/17/2017,"This location will always have a special place in my heart! It was the place I went on my first date with my fiancee!  The location is great, very cute plaza next to a movie theater and the twinkle lights around the plaza make it nice for after dinner walks (especially when you stuff your face here at CF). The weekends tend to get busy but I feel like CF has a pretty good handle on turning tables around and seating quicker than expected. The menu is massive. MASSIVE. While I do try to be adventurous my go to has always been the bang bang chicken. The flavors in the chicken and sauce are soooo good! Portions are just as large as the menu! I always have leftovers, which is perfect since I end of craving the meal for days! Served over a bed of rice this is very filling! If you want to stay lighter, they have some great salad options. Again - massive salads! The spicy chicken is a favorite of mine as is the mexican with corn and beans. So many greens, lots of protein and very tasty dressing options.  if you are with a group don't skip out on apps to share! The bite sized burgers are great but my all time favorite are the avocado eggrolls. That tamarind cashew dipping sauce is amazing! Also make sure to not skip on dessert, it is the Cheesecake Factory after all! Classic is great but oreo is my go to! They have so many flavors, there is something for everyone! The ambiance is great here, service is awesome and if it's busy just make sure they stock you up on bread to hold you over - trust me the bread is great there too!"
Kyle R.,"Orlando, FL",14,80,183,4.0,5/13/2017,"Last time I went here I had a bad experience and wrote this place off because I figured it was a over priced dennys. I came this time because my wife got a gift card and if it was not for that I would never come back, to my surprise the menu changed since the last time I was here and they actually have vegan options and tons of options on the menu for different taste. The vegan cob salad was great and is listed under the superfoods section. The thing that threw me off is my waitress when I ordered a vegan menu option asked if I would like to add ""chicken"". ??????????!??!?? I told her well I ordered a vegan dish why would I want chicken on it? That is the reason for 4 stars on this round."
Jose A.,"Orlando, FL",277,73,735,4.0,3/26/2016,"Cheesecake Factory, what can I say. This place has been so good to me that I'm surprised it only has 3 stars on yelp. The times I've come here the service has been superb, everyone is so nice the drinks are very good and the food OMG nothing I've had here has been disappointing. My first time here I ordered the crab and artichoke dip this was so delicious, I also tried the chicken samosas OMG these are amazing a must get!  I came back another time cause this place is so nice, I got the sweet corn tamale cakes man these things are so awesome! You have to try them, I also got the famous factory meatloaf get ready cause this is a beast it's huge can feed a family of 3 lol but it has so much flavor! I got the buffalo wings to go not that great but looked much better if you get them there, next the stuffed mushrooms were really good loved them.  Just to let you know I saved the best my fav apps for last, I ordered the famous Fried macaroni and cheese, I don't even like Mac and cheese and I love this app the best thing here! I then ordered the Buffalo blasts! OMG this was so amazing I will get this again and again. All in all this place is great and I always look forward to coming here!"
Britt M.,"Sanford, FL",4,34,,3.0,9/4/2017,"Always very crowded (even on weeknights the wait is sometimes 45 minutes at 8pm), and food quality is inconsistent. For $15-$20 per entree, poor quality isn't acceptable."
Yesenia P.,"Orlando, FL",66,89,202,4.0,8/27/2016,Anything you order off the menu will be delicious! Perfect spot for that special celebration or date night. My favorite meal is the Chicken Madeira but I've tried other entrees that are all very good. If you come here you must save room for cheesecake. The cheesecake menu is long so it might take you about an hour to make a decision. You can't go wrong with either one you choose.
Lauran M.,"Winter Park, FL",0,28,107,1.0,4/19/2017,"I had the Garlic Chicken Farfalle which was pretty good but at about four hours later I began experiencing extreme abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and chills. My symptoms continued the next day but along with the symptoms described came the headache and body-aches. This continued for the last few days and am now finally recovering.  This meal is/was one of my favorites in the menu-I am sad to say that I will not be returning to Cheesecake Factory for a long time because of this."
Sarah M.,"Orlando, FL",0,6,3,3.0,8/30/2017,"Got there around 3:15 on a Thursday afternoon, after watching a movie. Was informed that Happy Hour started at 4, so we could wait or order from the regular menu. Ordered the Truffle Cheese Sticks assuming they were going to be like cheese sticks you dip with marinara but instead got cheese paninis with bacon? Also ordered the Mini Crab Bites(6) and 2 slices of cheesecake. We got the Oreo Dream Cheesecake and the Chris's Cheesecake. Loved the crushed Oreos with the Oreo cheesecake, and the Chris's Cheesecake tasted exactly like an Almond Joy! The cheesecakes overall were good for the price, you can easily split 1 slice between 2-3 people. However, this is a 3-star review due lack of cleanliness. When I sat down, I noticed that my spoon and one of my forks were dirty. There was a large reddish/brown stain that clearly didn't get cleaned off the spoon, and white spots all over my fork. It looked like someone had just eaten from the spoon and it was put back on the table. The server exchanged my silverware for a new set, but my appetite was kind of ruined for the rest of the meal. The service was good though, she made sure to keep refilling our waters and make sure we needed anything."
Sara F.,"Winter Park, FL",11,9,2,5.0,4/14/2017,Love love love this place!  The Godiva Chocolate cheesecake is the BEST!  Akways have a great experience when we eat here.
Judy C.,"Apopka, FL",0,5,1,5.0,11/1/2017,"I can never go wrong, at The Cheesecake Factory. After about 6 visits, living in the area, and recently relocated to The Villages, I will travel the distance, anytime, to The Cheesecake Factory. Today, I took my 95 yr old mom, and an 85 yr old friend, for a late lunch. Ava, was our wonderful server. We had delicious lunch portion, pasta with shrimp and sausage. Simply delicious. Topped everything off, with of course, cake. Fantastic! Thank You Ava, for being so attentive, and friendly. My guests, had a great day."
Sreelal S.,"Kissimmee, FL",7,24,30,5.0,10/25/2016,"Awesome food and personalized service  We ordered calamari as appetizer ,it was just awesome and mouth watering I love the garlic sauce  And grilled salmon and Shrimp pasta with Alfredo sauce for main course  Everything was so tasty Will be back"
Andrew P.,"Orlando, FL",1,1,,2.0,8/11/2017,Waited for 15 mins when half the dining room was empty to be seated. Service was very slow. Food was subpar and came out cold. Ate half of it and sent it back. Manager was unapologetic and short with us.
Ivy A.,"Orlando, FL",10,29,32,5.0,2/22/2017,This place is haven! I always go home happy and satisfied with both the services and the food.
Paul R.,"Clermont, FL",1,38,243,4.0,2/12/2017,OK we got a gift card for Christmas. After a fifteen minute wait we were stuck behind the server station in the side room. Ordered the fried zucchini and was very pleased. Ordered the Combo platter of Steak Diane and Chicken Madeira to find flavors very rich and wonderful. HOWEVER the steak was cold. A cappuccino and strawberry shortcake later we had a five star meal with a cold steak and no view. For the bucks a Hillstone visit would have been more satisfying.
Kristy S.,"Winter Park, FL",83,100,134,3.0,12/11/2015,"Haven't been here in a couple years. It's always packed for lunch and especially dinner. There's a lot to choose from on the menu, especially cheesecakes. The food is good. We order the Tuna Tatare. My daughter was in the mood for sushi and this is the closest they have to it. It was yummy. It was served on top of avocado and crispy wontons. We also order the avocado eggrolls. As soon as I mentioned it, the server said ""good choice."" I ordered the grilled salmon medium rare and it came out perfectly. I wasn't trying to make it come out like sushi, but usually when I order salmon from a restaurant it comes out overlooked. My husband ordered the Louisiana Chicken pasta. He wasn't impressed much, but he ate most of it. We skipped the cheesecake this time as we had to be somewhere immediately after. The server was attentive and friendly. She made sure to check on us enough times. It was a good lunch. We just don't come here too often."
Eric T.,"Casselberry, Orlando, FL",60,39,34,4.0,8/4/2016,"My waitress Kayla was totally a ten. She was very attentive and very nice. I had the miso salmon with a side salad with 4 tomato wedges. No riceAsk for tomatoes or they will give u one wedge. I paired this with the chicken samosa's. It was very good. 5 stars if I didn't have to ask for tomatoes. Thanks cheesecake for the great meal, best salmon ever. Isaiah 40: 31."
Louisa R.,"Longwood, FL",0,11,39,4.0,8/4/2016,"Lunch at Cheesecake Factory the advacado rolls  excellent veggie burger a bit on the dry side and crumbly You can't go wrong with the orange chicken lunch portion is enough for two  Tried the new hazelnut cheesecake amazing a  small amount of chocolate sauce on the top simply Delish  Decor as standard , waiter very knowledgable on the extensive menu"
Robyn S.,"Sanford, FL",0,37,6,5.0,6/26/2017,Great food selection. Great small plate choices. The regular entrees are huge and you can share easily. The cheesecake is always delicious. We always get it to go and have dessert at least twice from each slice.  The only downfall is that there are some seasonal selections that may not be available.
greg w.,"New York, NY",15,370,1,2.0,7/9/2017,Don't ever do curbside!  What a joke this is... I waited forever and they didn't appear to be that busy.  The food wasn't warm which tells me it was sitting on the counter waiting.  The fries were super old and hard.   Very disappointing... Never again!
Mark P.,"Orlando, FL",4676,363,1000,3.0,2/20/2016,"I can't believe we used to wait more than two hours for a table at this place when they were the newest hottest thing in Orlando so many years ago.  Sure, it's a beautiful space, reminds me of a cruise ship, but I've never had anything from their overpriced encyclopedic menu that was anything more than average - EXCEPT the cheesecake :) My tip is to go for coffee and cheesecake.  Sure, your waitstaff will expletive hate you, but so what, that's how you make the best out of this place in my opinion.  Or, you can go to TGI Friday's where you can get the same.  Jyep, you can get cheesecake factory cheesecake at TGI Friday's too.  They may not tell you that, but that's what it is.  :)"
