Shilley T.,"Casselberry, FL",257,241,1040,2.0,3/23/2015,It has been years since I have eaten at the Cheesecake factory. I won't make my review long. I ordered the chicken teriyaki which comes with your choice of brown rice/white rice. The only good thing in this dish was the chicken. The rice had no taste/flavor it was pretty much bland. The other positive thing is that the portions are big. You can't go to the cheesecake factory without having dessert. I picked the Lemon meringue cheesecake. It was delicious. The service was not that great either. It was not that busy. Half of our table got their drinks while the other half was waiting on water..(yes water). All in all the dessert made it worthwhile for me. I will stick to local non chains restaurants.
Asmaa H.,"Oakville, Canada",5,97,20,3.0,5/19/2017,"As per usual, it was too busy and food was just okay - just an overpriced chain restaurant. Their saving grace are the vast options, massive portions and ability to modify most items on the menu. Their Jamaican black pepper chicken and shrimp are always phenomenal."
Ta'shja T.,"Orlando, FL",50,20,32,3.0,6/22/2017,"We went to celebrate my Uncle for Fathers Day and of course, it was packed. Our wait time was about 40 mins and we had a table of 7, our server was super nice and took our drink orders. Came back a few minutes later and took our regular orders. The bread came to our table hot and ready and so did our appetizers but then we waited for a good hour before our actual meals came out - it was Father's Day though. Our waitress comes out asking if she can get us soups or salads for free because the kitchen was super behind and it was probably going to be another 25-30 mins before our food got to us. Everyone was getting antsy at this point but we appreciated the soup and side salad. Finally, our food came and 3/7 meals were cold. We called a manager and told her everything that was going on, she handled it with such professionalism and FIXED everything for us right away. Overall it was a good dinner but we waited a very long time for our food."
Elisa R.,"Orlando, FL",240,140,172,2.0,9/4/2016,"Never again!!!!! Not only was the food awful, but it took forever to come. I ordered the chicken waffle and Benedict from their brunch menu. I never thought you could mess something up so simple like a waffle, but oh they did. It was super soggy by the time I got the dish and the taste was nothing like a waffle but rather a donut taste. It was way too sweet for the overall meal. Then the chicken! No not your delicious fried chicken that you normally get with waffle and chickens, instead it was chicken strips with breading that once again was soggy, not crispy at all and tasted like a frozen chicken strip you buy from the frozen section at publix. The hollandaise sauce on the poached eggs was equally awful. Overall do not recommend this dish to anyone- even though when I ordered it my waiter said ""oh that's a great choice""- not sure why he would need to lie. My husband had the beef tip sandwich and didn't even finish it. When my husband leaves food on a plate, that's an immediate sign that the food is not worth it since he normally eats anything and always has a huge appetite. I think I am starting to realize that my palate has changed and it can immediately detect frozen already prepared meals compared to the fresh, scratch meals I'm used to from all the amazing mom and pop restaurants in the area. Oh and on top of all this our bill was $50, two meals, one appetizer, all three equally bad tasting. Never again!!"
Jamie M.,"Miami, FL",174,46,67,5.0,4/25/2016,"Waited about 2 minutes to be seated... Our server Luis was amazing!! Very attentive and kind. The Calamari was crispy and flavorful, our dishes were huge and also very good, as always... But having a great server puts the cherry on top of a great meal.  I ordered meatballs and pasta with ALOT of grated cheese, my boyfriend also ordered pasta but with breaded chicken, I forget the name. My dish had a lot of meatballs that were juicy and the pasta was cooked perfectly. My boyfriends dish... He had no complaints!  Also, it was my birthday a few days ago, my boyfriend told him of course so around 12:20 (they were closed) he still came out with a fully decorated Birthday slice of cheesecake and candle. Although the staff was too busy cleaning and didn't want to sing to me (no big deal lol) he told me Happy Birthday and apologized that no one wanted to sing lol I really liked the location, we sat outside and overall it was a very enjoyable dinner."
Chuck F.,"Melbourne, FL",156,115,314,3.0,8/6/2016,"OK, no one else is saying it,  so I will. What is the deal with this place? It's got Greek decor, Beverly Hills pricing, and a menu from Mexico to Asia to Italy. Honestly, Cheesecake Factory is like a glorified and overpriced diner. They must be doing something right because there's always a line of people throwing money at them. Service is average, and the food is, well, like you'd find at a Greek diner. I took a chance and ordered cashew chicken, an Asian-inspired dish. It was alright, a little dry, but flavorful. I've never had a bad or an exceptional dining experience at any CF nationwide. Guess I'm not sure why all these people are here. Going to Ruth's Chris for dessert :)"
Sherry B.,"Oviedo, Orlando, FL",103,174,147,3.0,9/21/2016,"I'm going to go ahead and crown Cheesecake Factory as the best of the more upscale casual dining chains. Their food is good, and quality and service are consistent. Obviously, this is not the place to eat if you are trying to stay healthy, but they have added a lot of ""skinnylicious"" options which are not bad at all. When it's time to take my mom out to eat and the kiddos must come with, this is our go-to place."
Estefanía L.,"Orlando, FL",131,276,284,5.0,3/28/2017,"We came in on the perfect night with absolutely no wait! It was unfortunate how we ended up here but that's okay. We had tickets for a movie screening and when we arrived the line to redeem them was outrageous, more than we had ever experienced before. So hunger churned in. We stopped in and there was nobody there. Staff was super nice and eager to seat us comfortably. We all ate great meals. Mine was the Asian chicken salad. It was huge and superb! I took half home with me and it was super affordable. All in all, great experience."
Alice C.,"Ontario, CA",3,24,10,2.0,4/6/2017,"The hosts at the front is not well trained. They lack in  good customer service. As a good resturant like cheesecake, it is really disappointing to be mistreated."
Lloyd R.,"Roslyn, NY",181,20,16,3.0,10/12/2016,"Came here for lunch on business trip with travel buddy.  Food was to be expected and very delicious as usual. Always love the lunch portions as the regular sizes are HUGE and they come at the right price to boot! (Page 8 on the menu).  Service was great. Refills on drinks, water and bread were constant. However, it took forever to get our food. Definitely not the location to hit up if you are trying to squeeze a lunch in relatively quickly. But if you have the time to leisurely sit for 1.5-2 hours during lunch, then enjoy.  There are lots of options in the shopping center they are in as it is huge and beautiful. While the brand keeps people coming in, the pace of food will definitely not have me coming back to this location."
Andrew B.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",80,70,45,2.0,2/10/2017,"Meh....basic stuff, nothing great, service is always slow and i cannot stand that even when they are empty the hostess wont seat you ""until the entire party has arrived."" Is this Ruth Chris or Flemmings? Come on now, I am staring at 20 open tables and would like to sit, maybe have an appetizer while we wait another 10 minutes for our friends to show up. Not a fan, even when I saw our friends car drive by and told the hostess she said "" when they get her you can be seated."" Menu is too big to decide quickly when ylu are hungry and the food is just meh, drinks and bread took about 25 minutes to show up, food was okay, veggie burget, cuban spring rolls and shrimp tempura, good sizew but just okay. We had a 25 gift certificate to use so thats the only reason we went. Now we remember why we dont go there in the first place, bill was still $68 for a few apps, burger and a piece of cheese cake. Wold have rather gone to Flemmings or Ruth Chris Happy Hour for that $$$."
Tamara F.,"Sanford, FL",0,16,19,1.0,4/14/2017,"I loved Cheesecake Factory until I went to this location in Winter Park. The service is horrific and the food is less than par. I've had one too many experiences where I waited 15 minutes just for non alcoholic drinks, another 20-30 minutes for appetizers, only to get cold or horribly plated food. It's a shame because I love their Seared Ahi Tuna and Fried Macaroni and Cheese. I don't feel I will ever return."
BJ W.,"Asheville, NC",0,20,44,1.0,4/10/2017,and see what I mean I put right in the review I talk to the manager and now cheesecake factory tell me next time talk to the manager talking to the manager didn't do any good please read my review next time before putting a canned response in there from corporate
George L.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,29,,5.0,4/2/2017,"Had a Great time w/Family  Celebrated my Dads birthday today even though we had to wait 1/2 hr to be seated,nonetheless it was nice,enjoyable and very filling meals all around. Daniel our server was Top notch,he was Very attentive and considerate. We have enjoyed our time at your restaurant. Will definitely come back and ask for Daniel."
Jennifer R.,"Orlando, FL",143,524,67,4.0,5/10/2016,"I don't think I can write anything people haven't already covered here. This location is on par with the other locations. Good staff, easy to be seated most days/times, and good food. I've never had a poor experience here."
Nicole D.,"Orlando, FL",156,163,15,5.0,11/1/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is simply the best!  I have never been to this location without a 30-60 minute wait, but I wait every time because it's so delicious! It's also very clean.  The menu can be intimidating for anyone who's never been. There's a lot to read through as they have pages on pages of things to order. No one can leave without having something they like. And if you need help, the wait staff always suggests something good!  The buffalo blasts or pot stickers are two great appetizers. My favorite entree is the Chicken Madeira, but I've also heard great things about the Mac and Cheese burger. You can't go wrong with any of the cheesecakes (you probably won't have enough room to eat it at the restaurant so take it to go) but the Oreo, red velvet, banana, and tiramisu cheesecakes are great!"
Barbara E.,"Orlando, FL",8,13,,5.0,2/3/2017,The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat. They not only have a wide variety of cheesecakes but also a very large menu to suit any taste. They are also very accommodating for any food allergies you may have.
Cecille R.,"Apopka, FL",537,960,3424,3.0,6/12/2014,"This place is usually at the bottom of my list of places to eat. With all of the great local restaurants in Orlando, why would someone eat here?  I understand the excitement created by the name but at the end of the day, who has any room in their stomach for cheesecake after the ginormous meals their serve here?!  However, my hubby requested it for lunch so I was willing to go and give it a chance yet again. The theme here seems to be ""bigger is better.""  The menu is ridiculously overwhelming and there is really no organization as the lunch specials are towards the end. And I think the ads in the menu are super duper tacky!  Food was ok. We were brought out a complimentary basket of bread and butter. Our tex mex eggrolls were good. I enjoyed the pico de gallo that I used as a topping to give it that ""kick"" it needed. My chicken salad sandwich was insanely huge. And I was let down that it was more of a pressed sandwich on Texas type toast . Blergh. I probably ate a few bites of one HALF before giving up. The buttered toast with the creaminess of the chicken salad was just too rich and it was too much all at once.  My husband had the California cheesesteak and it was smaller than my entire meal! I did enjoy his Flying Gorilla cocktail. If you are going to drink your calories, this is a good way to start. Think chocolate, banana, whipped cream, alcohol. Yumm! Service was good. Our server was attentive and did his duties but more in a robotic way. He had no personality ,which in this establishment is what sets you apart.  It was definitely all business.  In a nutshell, I wouldn't discourage anyone from coming here. It's not the worst place in the world but just not where I would choose to spend my hard earned $$. Yes the portions are huge but doesn't matter if they're not good. Soo many better restaurants in the area with more personality without having to flip through a 20 page menu(insert sarcasm).   Maybe just stop by and pick up cheesecake to go?"
Kevin H.,"Winter Park, FL",0,11,,2.0,10/25/2017,"Well, what can I say? After stopping in for a birthday dinner, on a Wednesday night, we waited an hour and a half. It was to late to go somewhere else so we stuck it out. Granted, we had a large group, seven adults and two children. I will say though, there was zero attempt to create a secondary space for us to eat. It was this table, or nothing. We were even told that the party in table was getting their dinner so it would be a little longer. Once we were sat, service was prompt to the table and drinks were ordered. Then, more waiting. I finished my drink and ordered another. Out server did mention that it was in fact a double as I had ordered, it was just in a small glass. As if I drank too much. Then, guess what? More waiting. Food was delivered in waves. Two plates came, about thirty minutes after ordering and more filtered out. They are still arriving as I type this. What food that is here, looks good. Mine is still somewhere out there. Well, that's about all I can say. Gonna try the food, I don't have to be at work until tomorrow, so we might get dessert. UPDATE: my pasta was ill described on the menu, it was not really what I expected. It also seemed to have sat in the window for quite some time. UPDATE II : The wait continues!! Ordered dessert (TO GO ) the checks have not come and neither have our deserts. I may be able to catch Kimmel if I hit the red lights just perfect. Hopefully this is that last update. I wish Yelp had a YelpLive option. This is getting morbidly comical."
Desiree A.,"Winter Park, FL",132,199,353,3.0,10/12/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants to dine at, but during my last visit, the food was not up to par.  First of all, my friend's salad came out wilted and it was warm (it was supposed to be a cold salad with no warm elements).  Also, the bread that came out prior to the meal was so hard, it hurt the roof of my mouth.  My main course (garlic noodles with chicken added) was flavorful, but the asparagus was not fully cooked and was therefore, hard to chew.  On a positive note, our server was great - attentive, friendly, respectful.  Also the atmosphere was its usual fabulousness - great decor and lighting and very clean.  I still love the Cheesecake Factory and I won't let this experience prevent me from returning."
