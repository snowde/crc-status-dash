Michelle M.,"Orlando, FL",31,273,810,4.0,5/21/2016,"Alejandro is my new favorite waiter!  We arrived on a busy Saturday afternoon when a party of two can expect to wait about 10 minutes to be seated.  Once we were seated, the service was excellent and very fast.  I am a convert to the Skinnylicious menu - I appreciate having ""lighter"" options.  My niece and I enjoyed the steak medallions with grape tomatoes, mushrooms, asparagus and a bit of mashed potatoes.  We decided to pair this with the avocado egg rolls.  Finally, we decided to be naughty anyway and get the loaded tater tots with cheese, bacon, and sour cream.  Lol!  The two of us shared all of this and were in and out in less than 45 minutes.  The steak medallions were delicious and my niece really enjoyed the sauce that came with the egg rolls - sweet and delicious.  Put it this way; we left WITHOUT cheesecake and were okay with that.  It's nice to have many options and it's even better when so many of them were so good."
RV S.,"Orlando, FL",1,15,,5.0,1/7/2017,"We had one of the best dining experience ever in this restaurant. It was as all due to our server Katie.  The restaurant is beautiful as most of the cheesecake factories are but this server made us feel as if we were the only ones in the venue. The food was perfect for us and the timing of the food was right on the money. This is not always the case in most corporate restaurants. Too many choices on the menu but, it helped us to plan our next visit.   We sat in the bar as we did not have to wait for the 30 mins we were told we have to wait for a table.   And the cheesecake is always good. This venue did not disappoint."
Travis Y.,"Winter Park, FL",0,4,,1.0,1/29/2017,"Don't come here if it's cold out!  They don't turn on the heat and you and your food will be ice cold and they won't care.  Awful experience and they don't care!   I hope this is ""the new"" Cheesecake now."
Mike N.,"Ormond Beach, FL",105,337,372,3.0,4/14/2016,"Meh, the service was great as was the food.  The venue was exceptional.  However I'm not a fan of corporate chains.  I only went because we had a gift card and my wife and daughter like cheesecake."
Rita O.,"Orlando, FL",0,15,5,2.0,6/18/2017,"There was an influx of gnats all over our table and section of the restaurant. One of the meals came out cold and the meat was overcooked. This was expressed to the server, but unfortunately, no Manager presence during the whole 3hrs of our dining experience. The server was very nice, but definitely not the best experience at Cheesecake Factory. Sad to see that the QUALITY of The Cheesecake Factory is not up to par any more."
Melissa N.,"Orlando, FL",2394,466,1774,1.0,2/20/2016,"The wait is unbearable,  the parking was so-so, the menu was huge I didn't know if I had a menu in my hands or a library book I needed to check out. With such an extensive menu,  it's impossible to be good at any of these dishes . After such a long wait, we threw in the towel and went somewhere else."
Surge K.,"Orlando, FL",0,6,,1.0,7/9/2017,If ordering cheesecake to go it takes 20 minutes waiting in the lobby to get one. Sooner to bake one from scratch?
Naomi J.,"Venice, FL",0,23,3,2.0,7/4/2016,"Boyfriend took me to Cheesecake Factory for a nice dinner and a special night because he gave me a promise ring . The mood was great and romantic, until I received my food and A GIANT black hair was in my salad. It was about 20 inches long . I had to pull it out of my throat .  BUT!!!!! The waiter was nice and gave me a free cheesecake . He offered another salad but my appetite was shot ."
Armando G.,"Winter Garden, FL",68,215,461,4.0,7/26/2015,"I love The Cheesecake Factory.  We've dined at this location a few times and we haven't been disappointed. Just like other locations, they have (free) tasty bread, great appetizers, great entrees, delicious cheesecake and good service. Our favorite appetizers would be their Tex Mex Eggrolls, Avocado Eggrolls, Fried Mac & Cheese, Buffalo Blasts, Thai Lettuce Wraps and Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. However, last night we tried their Buffalo Chicken Meatballs and they were awesome. They were scoops of chopped buffalo-chicken which were battered, fried and served with a blue cheese dip; they were addictive.  Our favorite entrees are their Chicken Di Pana, Caramel Chicken, Orange Chicken, Spicy Cashew Chicken and the Monte Cristo Sandwich. Last night I ordered their Chicken Di Pana (tasty and large as always). We ordered their Crispy Spicy Chicken Sandwich (perfectly fried breast, pepper jack cheese topped off with buffalo sauce served on a brioche bun) with a side of blue cheese and a green salad. They absolutely know how to cook chicken; it was a perfect sandwich. We did have to ask for an extra order of buffalo sauce, but only because we like our food on the spicy side.  Dessert: Any and all cheesecakes! To be more specific, we ordered the Oreo Cheesecake last night.  It was perfect.  Our server Christina was great as well. I will continue to prefer this location over their location at Millenia Mall because that is the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to in Florida."
Nicole S.,"Longwood, FL",67,111,249,4.0,5/13/2015,"The food was amazing, as usual. However, the service was a little slow today.  We started off with the crab wontons. They are filled with creamy crab and cream cheese mixture. Comes with a light dipping sauce. Each wonton has a nice crunch. So good.  I split two meals with my mom: Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and the Jamaican Black Pepper Chicken and Shrimp. They were good to get together because the Jamaican dish is very spicy and the Bang bang dish has a cooling effect. So much flavor in both of them. Bang bang is served with rice and veggies mixed in. The Jamaican is served with rice and beans and fried plantains. Don't think the Bang bang chicken and shrimp is like Bonefish...it's totally different and has coconut. Large portions, packed with flavor. You can't go wrong with either."
Chweetu C.,"Winter Park, FL",0,3,1,1.0,12/26/2016,I had very bad experience going here thought I made a mistake. Firstly when I asked waiter about pasta he said its $13 for meal later when I got my check I was charged for $16 when I asked him he said I was charged for sauce I didn't get his point pasta comes with sauce he said no. I was wondering who can someone can eat just a pasta without anything for sauce he charged me $3 instead I would have make pasta at home in $3 dollars just manipulating the customers
Dori M.,"Rockledge, FL",77,37,10,5.0,11/12/2016,The Alfredo was really out of this world! Egg roll sampler as well. The salmon egg rolls were the best out of the 4. Had a delicious lemon drop martini but shocked at the $12.50 price tag one we got the check. Will certainly be back.... just not for cocktails
Siriluk M.,"Commerce City, CO",23,8,3,2.0,5/14/2017,"After waiting 1.5 hours for a table our buzzer buzzed.   The hostess seated me but I told her baby and mommy were standing under a tree because not enough room in lobby.   Told her we needed to wait a minute while I sent text....was told ""we don't save tables"" I was like what??? Not even for a minute...well any the food was ok but I love the cake."
Jay M.,"Orlando, FL",0,32,,4.0,12/8/2016,"Service at bar, outstanding. Didn't drink, but sat at the bar, was by myself.  The food was above average and came out very timely."
Joshua C.,"Pasadena, CA",7,6,,1.0,2/18/2016,"Frozen chicken, over cooked breads, vegetables soggy. Folks, if there could be a restaurant chain in need of some serious rehab, its this. The menu is so large its silly, the cooks are obviously over worked, the staff undertrained, and the bartender a novice. It proves yet again that corporate control over chef control is a horrible idea that needs to die.  Saddest part of the huge menu, if I could read it in the dark, is that our waiter was so slow that within that 30 minute window we had our meal choices ready. You have taken what at its core could be fine dining and chucked it in the bin. Don't lie and charge your customers for fresh food, when it clearly is not. Don't lie to your customers and blame it on corporate when Chefs and kitchen staff can strike for better control.  Wrangle a better menu down, stop abusing your kitchen staff, and update your restaurant looks. Won't be back till ya do."
Go G.,"Clermont, FL",0,69,57,1.0,1/3/2015,"Awful all around. This is the reason I try to stick to independent restaurants. Service was so bad. The guy was making us feel bad and would express his thoughts out loud - like he complained that he had to start the ticket all over because I ordered for my husband in the wrong order. He forgot our fries, didn't bring dressing for salad, complained about previous guests, didn't refill our drinks. He complained that he was the only server at the time ( he was all over the place) not a good multi tasker) the food was not good either. My ribeye was so salty. The manager NEVER once came to our table. After we paid, I said something to the manager and he had absolutely no apology or reaction. We won't be back there EVER."
Brian S.,"Orlando, FL",0,5,4,1.0,1/31/2016,Just waited 4 Cashew Chicken w Roasted Cashews. Not a single cashew in it and it tasted like orange chicken and was not spicy. Waiter said they just forgot to put in cashews. I just forgot to pay for the junk. Will not return.
Fanita J.,"Longwood, FL",164,2,,1.0,4/16/2017,"I don't even want to give them 1 star for the horrible costumer service and all around bad management during Easter dinner with the family. The simplest meal to make..calamari with a side of spinach and they NEVER brought it out. 3 of the other meals were sent back and the manager came out to take one dish away and NEVER returned. For a family that spent almost 400.00 for 14 people, you just lost a WHOLE lot of business!!!"
Gean M.,"Winter Park, FL",7,1,,3.0,5/5/2017,"I came in the restaurant and there was no wait but once we sat down at the table I felt rushed. The server touched my plate while I was not even done eating, asking if I was done. I left no tip because I didn't even spend 30 minutes in there.. sure the food and cheesecake is always great but I didn't like the service at all!"
Randolph Z.,"Orlando, FL",101,553,43,2.0,12/17/2014,"Like an idiot, I ate here again, exactly a year since the last experience at Cheesecake Factory. The office made me.  I rarely eat at Macaroni Grill. In fact, this was my first time. I had to go for an office gathering. The food here at Bennigan's was almost tasty. Hard to complain when everything is marinated in butter. Maybe it seems like I want to complain. I do. Chain restaurants displease me for all their sterile homogeneity. This Applebees is no different.  This Yard House seems to go for high-brow atmosphere at $$ (the high end of $$) prices. Though the decor is tacky, who the fuck really cares? TGIFridays was absolutely crawling with employees. Must have been 30 in that place for lunch. Even so, we were saying ""where's the guy"" a lot. Here at Bonefish Grill, getting drinks or dessert is a mistake at $6 apiece. If you're going with the office, nurse your Coke Zero and be glad you're getting paid to dine there. That reminds me. Besides getting paid to do it, I can't imagine wilfully dining at this or any Red Lobster. Despite all that badness, this Marie Callendar's squeaks by with 2 stars because I got out of there for less than $20 and I only feel like vomiting a little bit."
