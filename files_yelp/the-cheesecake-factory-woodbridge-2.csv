Shannon S.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,6,23,5.0,12/26/2017,"Got a gift card for Christmas and decided to use it today (what can I say, I'm impatient!)  So far we got seated right away. Parking was crowded because people are still off work and the lot is shared with the mall.  Our waitress is super nice and told me the only day they are closed during the year is Christmas day!"
J E.,"Stafford, VA",0,635,1556,4.0,12/26/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is known for their HUGE menu (as well as amazing cheesecake) and this place never seems to disappoint.  Not quite sure how they can consistently make so many items, especially of various ethnicities and get it right every time.  At least that has been our experience. Most recently we had an office holiday luncheon there and the food was outstanding.  The service was good, but not great.  The steaks we got were prepared very nicely.  All the appetizers and sides were very flavorful too. Of course the cheesecake (which they will make for you to go, if you're too full) was outstanding.  Definitely keep coming back, especially for business lunches!"
Elizabeth W.,"Fairfax, VA",53,10,9,4.0,12/22/2017,I really like the Woodbridge location. They seated us very quickly.  I had the Blood Orange Martini. It was tasty.  For an entree I had the combo of Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane. I'm always wary about combinations but it was delicious.  Our waitress Amanda was vet pleasant. Overall it was a great second try for cheesecake factory.
Carolina L.,"West Springfield, VA",348,18,3,1.0,1/9/2018,"My friend and I are sitting at the bar right now because service here lacks. We came in asking for a table for two and got seated at a table facing the bar. We waited for almost 15 minutes and no server showed up to even say hello to us or even acknowledged us. Hungry and annoyed, I got up and ask the hostess to move us to a booth. We sat at the booth and again the server doesn't acknowledge us for about 10 minutes then after that time she says, ""I'll be with you in a couple minutes""...... REALLY?! At this point we've spent 25 minutes at this restaurant and have yet to order, unbelievable. Mind you the restaurant isn't even that busy! We thought about leaving and going to Bahama Breeze at that point, but instead decide to move ourselves to the bar. So now times wasted and we are siting at the handicap section of the bar. Thankfully the bartender Michael was on his game. He was speedy and attentive! Do better Cheesecake Factory, be like Michael."
Jasmine A.,"Dale City, VA",0,2,,1.0,1/7/2018,The WORST experience I have ever had. Was told by the host that it would be an hour to hour and a half wait. After waiting more than a 1hour and a half i went up to the hoat stamd and asked how much longer. Was told they were cleaning the tables. Waited another 15 minutes and noticed they were seating others who came in an hour after i had checked in. I had said something to the host about this and he tried to argue with me and then the manager asked to talk to me off to the side and told me not to yell/argue with his employees. The manager tried to argue with me thatour table was ready but a party fecided to stay. How the hell does someone decide to stay after the table was cleaned. Instead of trying to argue own up to your mistake of having seated another party at the table.
Robyn K.,"District Heights, MD",182,58,60,5.0,5/24/2017,Great service and always great food.  We came in at lunch time on a weekday and were seated immediately. The food was exactly what I expect and timely. The cheesecake was properly thawed before serving. The only constructive criticism I would provide: give more explanation on the pay thru the app promotion they have going on.
Candice H.,"Williamsburg, VA",17,121,82,3.0,10/2/2016,"The sheer number of items available on this menu has to make this a logistical nightmare. No one can be perfect at this many items.  For that reason, I relied heavily on previous reviews and server input in making my selections. I am very happy with that decision. This would have been a four star review.  I read other reviews and that informed my choice of the chilaquile brunch and the FLYING GORILLA.  THE FLYING GORILLA was the yummiest shskebive had since my Gran used to make me shakes in elementary school. INCREDIBLE!! The carnitas in my chilaquile were very burnt, which took a star off my rating. But still a yummy brunch.  My waitress was very nice, but failed to give my companion a drink with no ice, as requested, twice."
Lhen C.,"Lorton, VA",17,13,17,1.0,10/2/2017,We went to have a late dinner last Friday. We waited for 15 minutes to be seated which is typical. The food here is usually great but I was really disappointed this time. My sister and I only order the Steak Medallions both medium it came back well done the mash potato was dry my brother in law order the Hibachi Steak well it came out medium. Our food was delivered one by one after all that I order a burger to go for my big brother. The waiter keep asking me if I got the burger yet? The the medium well burger turns out to be a well burnt burger along with the bun. I think it will take me a while to go back and visit. Do they think since it's to go you wouldn't notice they gave you the food not edible.?
Bil G.,"Dale City, VA",5,325,,1.0,10/25/2017,"Apparently the Cheesecake Factory makes noises like they are going to do something about a bad experience like the manager calling and them posting something on Yelp wanting you to contact them but even though I talked to the manager and sent the Cheesecake Factory site the information on how bad my experience was and how to contact me, they have done NOTHING to atone for my horrible experience there.  These people are first class con artists who don't deserve to be in business.  And here is my review. They hit a new low this time.  I ordered the Shepard's Pie and told the waiter that I did NOT want my Shepard's Pie with clumpy beef.  It is supposed to be ground beef, not big clumps of beef.  After over a 30 minute wait the Shepard's Pie appeared with the clumpy beef.  I sent it back and asked for the menu.  The manager appeared at this point to see what the problem was.  He went off to check and returned and said that on this day they could not make the Shepard's Pie without the clumpy beef.  So I ordered a filet Mignon cooked medium rare.  The manager said it would be complimentary.  After another long wait the filet showed up cooked medium.  I had already given up and tried to leave but the manager got the filet and almost twisted my are to eat it, again telling me it was complimentary.  He asked me how it tasted and I told him it would have been better had it been cooked properly but I ate it since he said it was free.  The mashed potatoes that accompanied the filet were so filled with potato skin that I literally couldn't eat them.  For some reason the filet came in two pieces.  Only at the Cheesecake Factory do you get a filet in two pieces.  And when I finally asked for the check to pay and leave not only was my wife's fish and chips on the bill but also the filet.  At that point I just paid and left.  Had the manager told me I was paying for the filet I would have sent it back for the fact it was in two pieces and it was over cooked.  You wonder why it is taking them so long to cook your steak and it is because they are overcooking it.  That was one of the WORST experiences I have ever had in any restaurant."
Phillip A.,"Woodbridge, VA",219,7,,1.0,1/22/2017,The curbside to go service may be the worst in the Woodbridge area. I placed an order and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. I arrived at the restaurant 18 minutes after placing the order. I called to let the restaurant know I was there for pickup. Twenty minutes pass and I called back to check on my order. Another twenty minutes pass and a waiter finally brings out my to go order. There is no excuse for a small order to take over an hour. The restaurant offered no apology for the inconvenience.  I would avoid ordering to go from this location it would be faster to dine in.  Decided to give them another try just to have the food over cooked.
Mujda F.,"Woodbridge, VA",24,17,9,5.0,8/29/2017,"I went there with family recently and was served by Elena. She was SOOO awesome. So attentive, so funny, so knowledgeable. Just so down to earth and genuinely interested in you having a great time and great food.  If you go to cheesecake, ask for Elena. You will not be disappointed."
Kendell P.,"Alexandria, VA",78,11,,5.0,9/14/2017,"I always expect any Cheesecake Factory to have heavy traffic given the popularity. That said, I don't feel like I'm ever waiting an unacceptable amount of time to get a table.  Just roll me out the door when I'm done, will you?"
Beth M.,"Midlothian, VA",23,232,371,2.0,7/28/2017,"I have been to Cheesecake Factories all over and they are usually a reliable port in a storm. This one was disappointing. The place seemed (and smelled dirty), the service was sporadic and the food was just ""alright."" Not great. Not terrible. There is a point where chains move from being fantastic to just marginal and they survive on brand alone (and seem to stop trying).This one seems to have given up caring a long time ago."
Rhys D.,"Bristow, VA",0,30,2,1.0,7/18/2017,"Walked up to the host stand, asked how many I said 2. Host proceeded to look behind me at a guest sitting down as two of her friends walked in, and said ""Oh were you guys here first"" and sat them before us...not sure but in other restaurants usually if you're AT the host stand it means your ready to be seated not standing behind the people up front. Host was rude about it as well. Update: server took 10 mins to get to us and when she did we were ready to order. She told us she wasn't ready for our food order yet! Trying to stop for a quick bite before a movie. Servers changed shifts, new server asked for our order AGAIN..."
Helena K.,"Fairfax, VA",31,111,122,3.0,11/6/2017,"Good services. Food was ok. I think I would prefer lunch than dinner. They do give good amount of food but it just boring taste. We got some bread for appetite, it was good. And salad was good for me. Cheesecake was good but to me it is not the best."
David C.,"Manassas, VA",9,240,411,2.0,5/9/2017,"Call me Ishmael; Once I was in the business of and describing in some detail all of the minutiae  of the whaling industry, while simultaneously spinning one of the great American morality fables.  Now, I write menus.Yes, menus. Somebody's gotta do it. Chilis, IHOP, TGIF, I write 'em all. My masterpiece, though, is the menu of The Cheesecake Factory. Behold its heft, its density! Marvel at all the ways in which you can stuff your piehole! This is my new morality fable, America; a tale of gluttony and avarice. If you can't see my moral, you ain't reading between the lines.  Don't get me wrong, I love food, I love dining out. But do you really think a place that gives you so many choices is going to do any of them really well?   Upon my soul, I had much better chowder at the boarding house on Nantucket, but that was all the good lady Hussey offered! More choices does not mean better quality.   Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a boat to catch.  ""Then all collapsed, and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago."" Two stars for the drinks."
James F.,"Stafford, VA",2,19,6,4.0,10/29/2017,Very tasty experience.  Prices were good and the cheesecake was out of sight....enjoy with a martini on the front end.
Martina M.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,2,,1.0,10/28/2017,Been here for 3 hours already and still not seated. Frustrated.  Defenetly not coming back anytime soon.:-(
Priyanka P.,"Arlington, VA",0,6,,1.0,5/5/2017,"The one star is for the outdoor seating area, and the friendly staff.  The drinks and food were not even edible.  The arugula in the salad was actually wilted and yellow! The pasta was under cooked and dry! The beans and veggies reeked of frozen re-heated smell.  This is a place I am crossing off my list and will not be visiting again for dinner."
R G.,"Alexandria, VA",52,30,73,4.0,6/17/2017,"Came here after HORRIBLE experience at nearby Red Robin. Have always had good experiences at Cheesecake Factory!  No exception here, BUT I give 4 stars instead of 5 due to the oh-so-high calorie count on all dishes!  Most dishes are near the 2000 calorie mark which is supposed to be the average daily intake!!!  Whew!  Will be staying away from Cheesecake Factory for the most part!"
Bertha C.,"Fredericksburg, VA",3,56,135,1.0,10/10/2016,"The reason for the one star  is the condition of the bathroom. The hand dryer looks as though mold is growing on it. So gross, just causes loss of appetite.  The fixtures in the restaurant was extremely dusty, to the point dust was flying in the air.  They really need ti clean the place up.  The food was mediocre."
Humberto A.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,2,,5.0,10/20/2017,"Had a great time last night with my wife, our waitress Elaina (if im not mistaken) was absolutely wonderful with us. First time at this location but definitely will not be the last!"
Scott S.,"Dumfries, VA",40,12,,1.0,2/12/2017,"If I could have given no stars I would have!  But, sadly, in order to have this posted, you have to give give at least one star. Absolutely the worst service of any cheesecake factory that I've been to the United States.  Came on Sunday morning for their brunch; we ordered the huevos rancheros and the crab hash.  Coffee came out fairly quickly and hot. Took 20+ minutes for entrees. Asked waitress for some hot sauce. Huevos rancheros was warm  (could have been hotter) and eggs over easy (the way they're supposed to be).  Crab hash was as cold as the freshly sliced tomatoes on the side. After waiting for over five minutes for the hot sauce, had to get up and go see the maître d' to ask where our waitress was. General manager came to our table and we explained that the crab hash came out cold and the Huevos rancheros was now cold while waiting for the hot sauce.  Sent both plates back to be completely redone. Waited over 30 minutes for the new entrées to arrive (our order had obviously gone to the back of the line). The crab hash was now barely warm and the eggs were hard-boiled. The huevos rancheros was now cool and the eggs were over done to boot. Too hungry to send back the crab hash, so I ate it. The huevos rancheros were too cold and overdone to eat and sent that back.  Bottom line, after sitting in the restaurant for over an hour and a half we had one edible meal. The general manager never returned to see how our meal was going.  We will definitely not return to the cheesecake factory brunch."
Shari A.,"Brandywine, MD",2,20,3,4.0,6/21/2017,"We went Father's Day and I must say we had a pleasurable experience. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait but our buzzer went off after 15 minutes.  Good seating and our waitress was friendly and attentive.  Only downside was the menu.  How can one choose from 20+entrees???  On top of that, the calorie count of the entrees are gigantic!  To be fair, there is a ""skinny"" menu which was appreciated.  Other than that, the meal was delicious and the presentation was out of sight."
Claudia M.,"Woodbridge, VA",67,2,1,5.0,4/11/2017,Brian best bartender!!!! He soooo friendly and makes the best drinks specially mojitos
Charlie C.,"Charlottesville County, VA",0,5,,1.0,8/8/2017,Wow since Cheesecake Factory has open I can count on one hand how many times my wife and I have attended this restaurant and each time they don't fail the food is terrible never fresh and this is our last time attending!!!!
Victor J.,"Stafford, VA",0,3,,5.0,11/30/2017,Had a great dinner at this Cheesacake Factory. Food was excellent and our server-Carolyn G- was very friendly and made this a pleasant dining experience. Great Job!!!
Tasha N.,"Manassas, VA",40,55,31,4.0,1/19/2017,Went here for a simple date night. Wait time for a table was quick. Didn't like we were seated by the window then they squeezed another couple right next to us so if felt a little uncomfortable. It wasn't even crowed at all it was a Wednesday night. We had to wait a bit for the waiter(Melissa) to arrive but she apologized and was very nice and took our orders quickly. I ordered the steak Diane with shrimp scampi and mash potatoes and it was delicious! For dessert I ordered my fav the Godiva cheesecake to go. We will definitely come back just hoping we won't get seated by the window lol.
Slater E.,"Diamond Bar, CA",22,18,2,5.0,9/2/2017,"Oh. My. Goodness. Came here on an obnoxiously crowded Saturday evening. With the in law's, wife, and 1 year old in tow. Chris kicked so much ass serving us. Odd requests, loud baby, prompt alcohol for dad. He made tonight so smooth and easy even with a busy child all over the table and silverware. Based solely on his performance I would gladly recommend this to family and friends. I would wholeheartedly come back again. Kudos to him."
Michelle C.,"Washington, DC",112,259,148,3.0,8/6/2016,"We came here for a family brunch during the middle of the week and this was a great place to eat before shopping. The food was great, the portions were generous, but the wait. The wait, you guys. It took a whopping 40 minutes to get our food. During lunch hour. During the week!!!! I can only imagine what its like a dinner time or over the weekend.  That long wait time probably disqualifies it for me from getting a second chance. I would much rather have just gone somewhere else since there are plenty of restaurants to choose from at Potomac Mills. Pluses: - The restaurant is quite spacious with plenty of seating. It looks like literally every other cheesecake factor - The food was good. The salad is huge, so I'm not actually sure if its any healthier for you because you're eating so much of it - The pasta on the lunch special menu was also yummy Minuses: - Some of the bread they give you is hard. Beware. - Our waitress seemed to be annoyed that we were annoyed that we had waited 40 minutes for our food. Not the best customer service - Also I'm gonna go there and say it, but their food is so terrible for you. One slice of cheesecake has over 1,000 calories. It breaks my heart, but yeah, it wouldn't be wise to dine here regularly unless you have a Michael Phelps-type metabolism, or just give zero cares about your health"
Yaprak D.,"Washington, DC",40,3,34,1.0,8/13/2017,This place has an awful service! I order something and they brought me other dish and we're waiting a while. I gave to second chance to them but I won't give one more chance.. don't go to there for dining... there is a just good thing they have good cheesecakes..
Jazmyn D.,"Richmond, VA",0,1,,1.0,12/23/2017,"Being in the service industry myself I usually have so much patience for lackluster service just because i know someone might have an off day, as I do myself sometimes. But I honestly can't shake this burning desire to right a review myself about the experience I had late last night at this location. Last night I decided to stop into cheesecake factory  after deciding not to go to bar louie nearby (BAD IDEA) my boyfriend and I saw online that you all were open til 12:30 so we decided that popping in around 9:50 was feasible. We opted for the bar area for the simple fact that it was late enough already. I sat at the table and was greeted by our server (William) who instantly seemed annoyed that he had to deal with another table. Maybe he was about to be cut and my party was another hinderance to his friday night plans? Not sure. Either way, I started with two waters and waited on my boyfriend to get back to the table so we could decide on a more exciting beverage. 10 minutes later waters and bread arrived. No bread plates we on the table so 5 minutes later he comes back and we ask for bread plates and he looked at us and said ""yeah i'm not used to being on the bar area so i'm not used to having to bring plates."" ok... so he brings plates and and at that point we're ready to order apps and drinks. William asked and we put in an order for two pineapple moscow mules and before we could even tell him the apps we decided on he rushed off and put our drinks in. It to have been another 10 minutes until those arrived which I get it specialty cocktails take time to make but it wasn't because the bar was busy I saw them sitting at the service well for quite some time....william no where to be found. He then comes over to tell us drinks were on the way...and we go ahead and put our apps and entrees in because at this point I figured we might be there until close because of how delayed the service was becoming. Drinks and apps finally arrived (both delicious btw the only reason this review got one star, that and the fact that none was an option.) We finish up with our drinks and were ready for another and when I tell you we didn't see William for another 15 minutes I wish I was lying. We finally decided that we should get up and order drinks from the bar and when he noticed THEN he decided to ask if we needed another drink. Annoyed and quite frankly ready to leave, we got our drinks and settled up with the bar. The most annoying part of the experience was that we had an amazing server that had both tables next to us which only made me yearn that we were seated in his section. Food arrived and I just asked for the check and boxes because I wasn't trying to have to hunt down William to check out come the end of the meal. The check came and ran a mere $90 and this was the first time in my life where I didn't want to leave 20% where as i'd usually tip more than that. It took everything in me to leave the $18 that he clearly didn't work for. I don't know if this was an off day for him or if this is just the Cheesecake Factory standard but it was by far the absolute worst service i've ever had. I will not be returning. Thank goodness I do not live in the area."
Corrie S.,"Franklin Park, NJ",77,16,2,2.0,8/8/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but not this one.  A guy walked by my table with an empty glass twice and just straightened the chairs. The service was slow and the place was empty.  The other table in my area waited like 15 minutes for their drink order.  The poor waitress was by herself for the entire bar area.  And there is no Wifi- this is 2017!"
Shana S.,"Fort Belvoir, VA",55,9,16,3.0,11/5/2017,"First let me say my food was absolutely amazing. I ordered the chick parm pizza style, even with it not being your traditional chicken parm it was the best I've ever had. The service SUCKED the waiter messed up my order so I had to wait even longer after everyone else at my table were serve with no compensation, he forgot half of my friends order."
Chantha S.,"Woodbridge, VA",2,14,3,5.0,5/20/2017,"We ordered the Chicken Samosas and the Chicken Bellagio. I come here all the time and always happy. Usually we order the Fried Zucchini, mushroom and avocado appetizer but tonight we wanted to try something different. We ordered the samosas but wasnt too pleased with it. Its really salty and the cilantro dip didnt do anything to help. The Chicken Bellagio is amazing!! I love it. Our waitress Deja is sweet and on top with our water. Her eyes are beautiful too. Thank you!"
Natalie B.,"Franconia, VA",0,16,5,1.0,4/29/2017,"I ordered pickup food, the pasta alone was $20 and look HOW TINY. Like I'm a small girl, I don't eat much, but this portion was SO. TINY. I tried taking a pic but you really can't tell how MINISCULE my $20 pasta dish was without seeing it in real life. End of story, why the hell am I paying $20 for a dish smaller than my little Asian hand. And it was undercooked, thank you."
Quinton M.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,4,8,5.0,3/7/2017,"Delicious. I haven't been in awhile bc the food was so bland on our last visit. Definitely enjoyed the lunch pizza/salad. Daughter had the Miso Salmon. Awesome. Our waitress, Tracey, was the Bomb .  However, CF please lose the white cotton napkins. The lint transfer all over ur clothes. YUCK!"
James L.,"Stafford, VA",6,2,,1.0,5/17/2017,"Dinner on a Tuesday night and two hours later we were both ill. Severe gastric distress to say the least. Was contacted the following day and was offered a gift card to come back. Why would anyone want to take that chance? I declined the offer and asked for a refund, but was told it was beyond what he could do and it would be forwarded to corporate. Two weeks and nothing! Done at your own risk!"
Natalie B.,"Mesa, AZ",0,11,1,2.0,5/12/2017,"Everytime I have come to this location with friends it takes about 2hrs for the waitress to come by and take our order. Every single time .... it is like we disappear and they forget us and start taking orders and serving others that were seated after us first. Not sure what is going on.... I mean it is a busy place but that is no excuse. Food however tastes great... don't recall it being overly salty and it is definitely flavorful. When I come back to town to visit friends, I don't think I will be coming here..."
Catalina S.,"Annandale, VA",154,80,217,5.0,6/9/2017,Honestly You Can't Go Wrong With The Cheesecake Factory! I Was So Happy To Hear They Were Opening A Location @ Potomac Mills! The Wide Selection Of The Menu Never Disappoints & The Dessert Menu Is a Must!
