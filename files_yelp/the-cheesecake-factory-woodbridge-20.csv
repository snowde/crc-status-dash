Aric A.,"Fredericksburg, VA",18,11,5,5.0,3/22/2014,"Just had the avocado, zucchini, and portobello mushroom fries. OMG. My family and I could have had four more it was so hot and good. Nice job."
Jeanette P.,"Centreville, VA",13,4,2,1.0,9/7/2014,I am only giving our experience 1 star because the edamame appetizer was decent although slightly charred. The service was slow. The food was mediocre at best and we waited 40 minutes for the entrees to arrive. Save your money and eat at home! You are better off!
Terra G.,"Dale City, VA",36,255,56,3.0,4/10/2013,"They're not bad.  They didn't clean the shrimp in my friend's New Orleans shrimp and rice dish, but they cleaned the shrimp in my shrimp/bacon club sandwich (however, they were very overcooked).  My boyfriend's burger was also well-done although he ordered it med-rare.  Service was pretty good.  Overall, it's an okay restaurant, but maybe not my first choice when dining in Woodbridge.  I also am disappointed that they don't take reservations or do call-ahead seating so you'll probably want to avoid this place completely during peak-hours (like Fri/Sat nights)."
Joe S.,"Washington, DC",198,310,13,2.0,3/15/2013,"I know this food is supposed to be good but my wife and I both got sick from our dishes. Not food poisoning sick but something was going on! BTW, do not order the thai dish! it is super weird!"
Tasha J.,"Stafford, VA",36,13,2,3.0,8/24/2013,"Sadly, there was no No bang or bang in my bang bang chicken and shrimp:( It was more like leftover chicken and left over shrimp with bang bang sauce poured over it.  I've eatten here before and my food was good, and my friend, her food was fine. I just dont recommend the bang bang chicken."
C K.,"Atlanta, GA",9,155,103,4.0,12/12/2014,"Went twice in two days, sat at bar one day and table the next - service was great, the chicken sliders are addictive!  I didn't find the cheesecake to be that great, I prefer graham crust on my key lime cheesecake."
Calvin S.,"Woodbridge, VA",2,71,1,1.0,12/16/2012,"The food was OK, nothing special, but OK.  The service on the other hand was a joke.  Nobody working there was older then 21 and they all treated their jobs like a joke.  I have no idea where the manager was, but he or she has already lost total control of their staff.   My server was never around and all the other staff was just laughing and joking all loud and ghetto like.  It really seemed that they were still in high school, not at their place of business.  I had a feeling that with Woodbridge opening so many high end restaurants at one time that it was going to be hard to staff them all with capable people.  It looks like CF did the worst job of all as far as hiring competent employees.  It seems like they just got all their friends a job there and now they think they don't have to work and they can just hang out and act a fool in the middle of the Cheesecake Factory."
CrAzYcatmama M.,"King George, VA",28,47,18,4.0,1/7/2015,"Came here for a late lunch early dinner around 2:30 yesterday (1/7/15) it was only my 2nd visit ever to a Cheesecake Factory and the 1st time was in Baltimore 7 years ago and it was awful...this experience was nothing short of amazing!!  The food, the service, the atmosphere all were exceptional. Our waitress Tracy was one of the best I've had in years. Will definitely go see her again. I had the mushroom soup which was delicious and the turkey burger. Best I'd ever had. My boyfriend had the soup as well and the Monte Cristo I believe. We got our dessert to go because we were both too full. He had the pineapple upside down cheesecake and said it was fabulous. I got some sort of Lemoncello cake with mascarpone cheese and strawberries because I'm not a cheesecake fan. It was incredible as well. We got some sort of triple chocolate tower cake to take home to my daughter and she loved it. Everything was really good. My 4 stars is simply for the cost. It is very pricy. Especially if you get the dessert/cheesecake. They are all $8+ a piece. For our 2 lunches and the 3 desserts it was $61 plus $13 tip..pretty $$$$ but it was all excellent food and service."
Arlene D.,"Wake Forest, NC",0,13,,5.0,4/29/2015,"Our waitress was so very good.  She helped us with our request and was nice about it. Food was fantastic , tastes, great portions.  Her name was loyal, very nice young lady.  Can't wait to come back again with husband.  Did bring him home a slice of pie"
Lendsey C.,"Alexandria, VA",153,245,472,4.0,11/8/2012,"Ate at their mock training last night and it was amazing. Great service, even better food and a decor to die for! Great upscale addition to the Potomac Mills area. Everything came out fresh and perfectly seasoned. Will definitely return."
Jennifer L.,"Henrico, VA",2,10,,1.0,6/14/2014,Got food poisoning.  Stomach cramps and vomiting within 30 minutes of eating.  Completely disgusting.  Don't eat at this chain.  If you go to   this restaurant chain comes up repeatedly!
Billy F.,"Potomac Mills, Woodbridge, VA",102,10,3,4.0,2/8/2015,"I love the restaurant. Just be aware that thIs one is a bit small for the client base. There is often a wait of 30+ minutes. If you plan for that, you'll have a better experience."
Joel M.,"Woodbridge, VA",46,10,11,1.0,12/28/2013,"I came here to have a nice family dinner. 1 hour wait understandable,  it's Friday night. So we look at the menu and order once we are sat. Everything is fine so far. We order calamari and the Ahi Tuna appetizers.  2 kids meals for the kids and ribeye and herb crusted salmon. So good so far...appetizers come out...2 minutes later here come the entrées. The food runner nonchalantly says ""it's not my fault there's nothing I can do"" and leaves when I tell her we JUST got out appetizers. No offer to send a manager or anything. I worked as a server for 7 years so I know how it gets but this was ridiculous. And one of the managers just says ok. I'll take care of one of your appetizers. ...that's not the issue . Our night is now rushed instead of relaxing and my food is cold. I will not be back again. EVER. This is not the first time I had a bad experience here either. Done."
Spencer R.,"Devon, PA",1,72,1,5.0,1/7/2013,"We went as a party of 6 soon after they opened, and we did have to wait an hour, which we expected.  The service was quite good, especially considering they were newly opened.  Food, as always, was incredible!  Can't wait to go back! :)"
Zach J.,"Burke, VA",2,127,45,4.0,7/11/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory is very good.  Location is ideal for a day for shopping at Potomac Mills and there is more than enough parking around the restaurant.  A 3.5 star rating would be appropriate, but the service we experience was absolutely fabulous and they deserve a solid rating.  Outside seating is available and quite ample, it's just you could feel as if all those looking for parking spots for the mall are watching you eat.  Some may not enjoy that fact.  We had three children with us and the children portions are very, very big for kids.  One adult ordered the regular menu pasta and it was in the exact same plate as the kids!  This was a pleasure to see as normally kids portions are borderline snacks.  Will go back to this establishment."
Andy H.,"Clifton, VA",1,3,,2.0,3/26/2015,"We like Cheesecake Factory but only visit them occasionally.  Usually the wait is too long.  However, we had a chance to visit the one in Woodbridge last night.  15 minute wait and then we were seated.  Service started fine but the apps started being a problem.  They were out of one we ordered stating they only had 1 cuban roll left.  They said they could bring it at no cost.  No problem except it never arrived.  We did receive our other apps and the Edamame was overcooked to the point many of the beans had vanished.  The dynamite shrimp was overdone.  Another manager arrived again stating they are sorry for the first mix-up and can they bring another app.  Sure, Thai Lettuce Rolls (easy enough).  Entrees came out and were below average.  My plate was the chicken enchiladas and I was warned the plate was extremely hot.  It was beyond hot and left me puzzled why the food was basically warm.  Obviously things had been sitting for a while.  After we had all finished, guess what shows up, thai lettuce rolls!  That was 40 minutes since the manager was at our table.  Too late, we don't want them anymore.  I almost forgot the basic stuff, our plates from apps remained with us all night.  We had to stack them out of the way. Typical free cheesecake  blah blah blah.  That doesn't fix your problems.  Just dysfunctional service and kitchen.  It wasn't that busy and they had a ton of service staff.   We will stay away because it was a school night and it took forever to get in and out.  Other chains may not have the reputation but provide better service and get you in and out as fast as you want.  And based on the food quality at The Cheesecake Factory, are better in that area as well."
Hannah Y.,"Luray, VA",0,27,7,3.0,1/25/2014,"good food, but service is a little slow, and the place isn't nearly big enough for the number of people who are in and out of this place on a daily basis. Cheesecake Factory should have considered a better design so that when you eat people aren't standing on top of you waiting for a table. Also the hostesses were far from nice, I understand it can be frustrating to work around tons of people all day everyday but a pleasant attitude and a smile never killed anyone."
James M.,"Woodbridge, VA",14,69,34,5.0,7/13/2013,The menu is as thick as a schoolbook! Everything is good so you'll spend the next five years sampling everything on the menu! We're addicted to this place! My only disappointment is that they did away with the corn fritters ;-(
E S.,"Arlington, VA",22,40,18,2.0,5/18/2014,"Where to start.... Let's begin with wait time. We were told 30-40 minutes. As I looked around the restaurant I counted 4 tables cleaned and available. Still waited 30 minutes to be seated. Minus 1 star just there.  Food: We knew exactly what we wanted to order. (Remember we had 30 minutes to look over the menu) So when our waitress arrived, we ordered right away.  We ordered simple stuff, corn tamales and wings with a side salad. The side salad was good. We've had the corn tamales before at other locations. Oh boy, these were not fresh. I get it, they have a lot of stuff on their menu. Hard to keep everything available. But the corn tamales were old and tasted like such. They had hard tough pieces as if they had been reheated a few times. I was starving. I ate around the hard stuff. Plus the guac & sour cream masked it. Chicken wings are traditionally wet and messy, right!? Yeah - not these.  They had clearly been sitting under a heating lamp for quite a while. Then when you bit into them, blood line. UMM. That is no bueno. So we pointed it out to our waitress, she took back the plate and said she'd have it recooked. (Hmm) Another sever arrived after 10 minutes with just the wings, no dipping sauce, celery, plate. Nada. Our waitress ended up bringing that after. The wings were wings, nothing special. At this point, they've lost 2 additional stars for food alone.   Wait staff: the young lady was nice but over worked. She was waiting on quite a few tables.  She was super nice but stretched thin. When she asked how out food was we were honest about the food; she told her manager.  He quickly approached us about our problems and took off the wings off the check.  Would I go back to this one? Probably not.  Two stars - one for the cheesecake and one for comping us the wings."
Molly S.,"Alexandria, VA",0,5,,5.0,2/27/2014,"My friend and I came in to catch up, split some appetizers, and get some good dessert. We split the chicken quesadilla, the potstickers, the cajun chicken littles, with a side of mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. everything tasted fresh and delicious. i proceeded to try the carrot cake cheesecake, which was incredible.  the main reason i'm writing this review, however, was the outstanding service. our waitress, melissa, knew so much about the food and really helped steer us in the right direction when ordering our appetizers. we could tell she was busy but when we had questions or needed help deciding, she treated us like we were her only table. as a server myself, i know this is hard to do, but she pulled it off like a champ. in a place as overwhelming as the cheesecake factory, i would HIGHLY recommend you ask for melissa next time you come to this location. she was one of the best servers i have had in a very long time."
