Tiwana E.,"New York, NY",52,81,12,4.0,5/22/2015,Come here often and get the same thing each time (don't judge lol). I get the chicken potstickers and the chicken Costelleta. Great meal. Occasionally I get a slice of red velvet cheesecake.  Crowded on the weekends. The wait is pretty standard for most restaurants in this area. Staff are pleasant.
Kathleen C.,"Manassas, VA",1,49,1,2.0,1/18/2015,"If someone asked me to describe our dining experience in a word, it would be unimpressed. Put our name in and went to walk the mall. Although we don't expect to be seated at precisely the time they give us, I do expect within say, 15 minutes of what we're quoted. Twenty five minutes after the initial 40 minute wait, we wade through the people to be seated. The lobby and entry was packed.  The food was adequate, nothing spectacular. Service was adequate, again, nothing spectacular. For the price you pay and what you get, we won't be back."
Glenn M.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,16,2,2.0,1/5/2015,"Ate there last night and the experience was average. Nothing really 'special' with their service and had several flaws on the food execution. First off, we ordered shrimp jambalaya and the rice was uncooked. The waiter also failed to ask how spicy my companions wanted their food, so they had to endure really spicy food last night. The complaints were addressed to the waiter and was resolved immediately. Secondly, we're veterans coming to Cheesecake Factory and the first thing they normally provide is their signature warm bread and butter. That wasn't offered at all, but provided once we asked during middle of our dining.  Overall, I still like coming to any Cheesecake Factory because of their yummy cakes and their selection. I don't particularly fond of this chain restaurant but it's the only in the area."
I Adore Food B.,"Alexandria, VA",0,35,3,5.0,6/5/2015,"Classic! You can never  go wrong with the Factory!  Been coming to the Factory for years and I'm never disappointed!  Their Green Tea is the best I've ever had! Happy Hours specials are awesome! Their chicken wings, buffalo blast (MUST TRY), steak, chicken, pasta, Salmon everything is well seasoned and prepared!   One on my favs for about 10 years now!"
Spencer H.,"Washington, DC",1073,216,854,4.0,10/13/2014,"What is Cheesecake Factory? Well let's see. First, it's a restaurant where you can come to when you don't know what you have a taste for OR you have a taste for  everything.. Either way, you're in business. The biggest dilemma you'll have at any Cheesecake Factory is finally deciding on what you're going to eat. From all the restaurants I've had the pleasure to dine at, this by FAR has the most extensive menu. If you want to be trendy and do a ""mezze"" style meal, Cheesecake Factory has more than enough small plate offerings to accomplish this feat. If you want American, Mexican, Italian, seafood, meat and potatoes, Cheesecake Factory has you covered! Today I was trendy and decided to do several small plates so I had the crab and artichoke dip, the dynamite shrimp and the tuna tartare and avocado. I have always enjoyed Cheesecake Factory's food but for some reason I REALLY enjoyed it today.. Everything was great! I really wish Yelp would offer a .5 because this particular Cheesecake Factory would definitely get a 4.5 star. I know from my review you're wondering why didn't I give this place a flat out 5?? Funny you ask.. Lol Well our waiter, who was great, actually brought me crab dip instead of the crab cakes that I asked for but since we were grabbing a bite before a movie date and time was of the essence, I chose to keep the dip and scratch the cakes. I'm a big fan of the dip but my mouth did want the cakes.. Thus the 4! Ultimately, another fine dining experience at good ole Cheesecake Factory!"
Jackie D.,"Alexandria, VA",1,7,,1.0,9/19/2016,"The Strawberry Shortcake was horrible. It consisted of 3 hard biscuits with no flavor, whipped cream, ice cream. I will never get it again. JackieD."
Linda D.,"Woodbridge, VA",1,25,,5.0,5/3/2016,"Just go in try the Thai Lettuce Wraps. Your mouth will be really happy. Now if you want s steak, you have to order the Hibachi Steak and just call it a day. That steak with the mashed potatoes and asparagus is so good. You can't go wrong if you order either of the dishes. Cheesecake Factory you have a Winner with those dishes."
Kim L.,"Gainesville, VA",13,49,98,2.0,11/25/2014,"Two stars for my cheese cake and glass of wine I ordered. I am not a fan of Cheesecake Factory but it was a convenient place to meet my friend at the time. She had soup and some sort of crab ball that appeared to be from a bag and very dry. She barely touched her potato soup that she ordered a cup of, but got a large bowl served to her instead. The place was crowded. They don't stop folks with strollers and people standing around the tables chatting while waiting to be seated. One lady was even leaning up against my seat.  Our waiter was a cutie and very friendly, of course very rushed. He did his best with all he had to deal with. I won't be going back, due to the crowd, the overpriced and not very appealing food. The cheesecake was ok, but I have had great cheesecake at other places. Such as Costco or BJs Wholesale Club. :) Apologies to my friend, for this was my poor choice."
Landon C.,"Los Angeles, CA",102,111,17,3.0,2/14/2015,"This is an A-ok restaurant. You cannot make a reservation and it is usually packed. The food is decent, but the cheesecake is the main attraction in my opinion. This is a great group style restaurant with good drinks."
Ron H.,"Woodbridge, VA",165,237,1035,3.0,5/26/2013,"Cheesecake Factories are great for two things: cheesecakes and a big menu.  They have so many selections to choose from.  Take it from me, their menu is about the size of a phone book (wait, what's that?)  Never mind - I just dated myself.  Anyways, there's so many selections it would be bordering on insane if you couldn't find something for everyone. This location suffers bad from size and location.  The wait here is usually atrocious especially if you show up on the weekend.  Day, or night it doesn't matter.  You show up at this location, you are going to wait for a seat. The food there is pretty good, not one of a kind excellent - but perfect for finding a spot that is a cut above the ordinary, but substantially under super expensive.  If you want to find a place that looks and feels ""high end"" and no one can decide what kind of food they want - this is a solution. Freshly baked bread in a basket is served with every meal and the service is above ordinary.  Typical wait service for a higher end restaurant, the servers recite the specials of the day and offer suggestions according to customer input.  Our waiter was very attentive and made several return trips to make sure we were ok. We started off sharing a mango Daiquiri.  It was a delicious fruit-inspired quencher that was tangy yet sweet and had only a hint of the taste of spirits.  I  sampled the Famous Factory Meatloaf and found it done well, but not as good as I had hoped - certainly not good enough to be characterized as ""famous"".   My wife had the Fettuccine w/ Chicken & Sun Dried Tomatoes.  What came was a bowl full of wide egg noodles with a light glaze, chicken breast and a hint of dried tomato slices.  Again, while the dish was good, it was nothing special...but at the same time I can't say that it was bad either. As the name suggests, the best thing they do is cheesecake.  These delicious concoctions need no review so I will not even touch on them.  Let's just say we ordered three slices of different varieties and it erased the bland dinner experience to the point that I almost forgot to review the sum of the entire visit."
Shere H.,"San Antonio, TX",0,17,,2.0,4/17/2016,"I'll make this review short and sweet.  Service was adequate, food was fresh, properly prepared and plating was appealing. Now for the cheese cake. Just nasty. Overly sweet and gummy. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say most people don't know a nice cheese cake! Oh well, been ages since I went there, be ages til I return. Oh, also dessert gave my mother indigestion."
Janet E.,"Chicago, IL",1121,2033,899,4.0,5/20/2013,"I am a big fan of Cheesecake Factory. it is always great everywhere I visit. We were starving and needed something to take the hunger away before we went power shopping at the Potomac Mill mall. The menu had a lot of small plates and even offered a ""skinny"" menu. That was something that was new that I'd never seen before. Our waitress was really nice. We asked for the ""brown"" bread and she told us that it was still baking but that she would bring it out as soon as it was ready. She stayed true to her word because she brought it out to us 10 minutes later.  She checked on us frequently and helped us to split the bill four ways. We really liked her. Seating was comfortable in their super sized booth seats. We enjoyed our visit here."
Katie O.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,6,1,2.0,9/19/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite places but the quality of food has gone down. My dish was served with rice which was partially uncooked. No big deal. My toddler had a kids meal which came with fries but unfortunately the fries were beyond salty, even for the adults, and were sent back for unsalted ones. Our waiter, who seemed very confused about everything throughout our entire meal, took the over salted fries back and brought out fresh fries. At the end our meal, the check came and showed that there was two charges for fries. We informed the waiter who said sending unedible fries back and getting new fries will incur a second charge. What??? That is a first. Waiter is a joke and needs more training. Too bad I didn't get his name."
Salvi R.,"Washington, DC",2,57,21,2.0,2/18/2016,"Lunch was great and the service was great until the server tried to rush my friend and I out. Very rude. Then to top it off, the server mixed up our to go cheesecake slice's, so therefore my friend and I are stuck with cheesecake we cannot stand. Such a waste of money. Very unhappy."
Cynthia T.,"Manassas, VA",0,11,,5.0,4/15/2016,I have came to this Cheesecake factory a few times. I am always impressed with the food dessert and service. I always leave full I love the Jamaican black pepper shrimp dish and I haven't  tried a cheesecake that I haven't liked yet. I will be back soon!:)
Roya C.,"Stafford, VA",1,14,12,2.0,11/9/2014,"The wait is ridiculous, had to wait over an hour to get seated. As far as the price goes, it is as ridiculous as the wait. Don't mind investing money for the tummy only of the food is out of this world and the Cheesecake Factory definitely does not have the out-of-this-world experience for the taste buds.  Orders: Herb Crusted Salmon: SUPER dry and bland Cashew Chicken: Ginormous chicken peices, 2 stars from the taste buds Spicy Chipotle Chicken pasta: lots of penne pasta with lots of asparagus and super sweet chicken. The name is as deceiving as the weather in Virginia. Cajun Jambalaya: Probably the only best dish on the menu.  Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp: OH LORD! Thought it would be somewhat decent and spicy...the immense amount of coconut milk and sugar definitely leaves a bang in the mouth. I can probably substitute this particular dish with one of their cheesecakes. I give it a 10/10 on the sweet-o-meter."
Tiffany F.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,12,2,4.0,4/5/2016,"I wish i could give 3.5 stars. Anyway- food is good as always, service sucked merely because it took FOREVER to get our food and the was nuts, not to mention they do NOT take reservations. Place needs to expand and hire more cooks and more tables!"
Paige H.,"Lansing, MI",54,27,9,5.0,1/25/2015,This little Cheese Cake Factory packed us in. They need more space. Carlos did a really good job with us. The food was great!
Thomas W.,"Alexandria, VA",23,17,,5.0,6/9/2015,"Usually I like to keep a close watch on my waist line and my wallet, but on occasion I like to treat myself.  I've been to this location several times over the years, and I can't say that I've ever had a negative experience.  There are a lot of choices on the menu.  This time around I ordered the chicken walnut salad sandwich, and it was quite good.  It had a wonderful amount of flavor with toasted and buttered bread.  To start though I got the cream of chicken soup that had plenty of white meat chicken and fresh vegetables. The salad was a smaller portion, and it was good as a side order. As usually is the case, the amount of food you receive could feed several people! I guess I have a tendency to order too much!  I thought that the service here is great. Our waiter was friendly and speed of delivery was really quick!"
Zakiyyah Y.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,7,,5.0,4/14/2015,"Always good service. Good food.  I always order the factory combination and sometimes mix it up with the salmon, shrimp, steak and chicken.  I love their bread as well."
