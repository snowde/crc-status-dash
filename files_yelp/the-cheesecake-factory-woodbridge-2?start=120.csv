Christopher C.,"Woodbridge, VA",11,18,3,3.0,11/7/2015,"I brought my family here for dinner, The food is usually pretty good with what I consider to be beyond over size portions. This location has an average of a 20 to 30 minute wait and I've never had any complaints regarding the food. A complaint I do have is the practice of bringing out plates that have been heated hot enough to melt your skin. I'm all for receiving my meal freshly cooked and hot, but to hand someone a dinner plate hot enough to keep your meal cooking as it's left the kitchen is ridiculous. During our recent visit the wait staff attempted to set down two of these plates in front of my two-year-old and three-year-old and looked annoyed when I sent the plates back asking for something safe. Only complaint I have regarding this establishment, otherwise it's a good experience and worth the extra money"
Joshua K.,"Rockville, MD",50,6,,1.0,10/10/2015,"Just tried to eat at your location at Potomac Mills.  It was a disaster.  We sat down at 11:45 and left at 1pm without getting to eat.  The server was completely unhelpful as was the manager.  We politely informed our server that we had about an hour and ordered a kids pizza,  salad and cashew chicken.  We had originally wanted to order turkey burgers,  but they were out of them.  Around 12:45 we still had no food and asked the server who hadn't been by to offer anything to us where the food was.  He came back 5 minutes later with the manager who also provided no help to us.  My wife was forced to take her salad to go and my 5 year old got to eat 1 slice of his pizza at the table.  Terrible customer experience."
Ent L.,"Woodbridge, VA",3,37,29,5.0,9/12/2014,"After you get on the waiting list go straight to the bar area to see if there is a table open.  There are six 4 person tables and 8 bar stools for a first come first seating.  They tend to be quicker in serving your meal. Fantastic place to try different dishes.  Music perfect for the ambiance,  conversation level can get pretty loud.  Sweet corn tamales cakes are fantastic.   Hibachi steak has the right spices for an awesome main coarse.  Any of the deserts will make you smile.  Today would be a great evening to sit outside."
Caroline L.,"Baltimore, MD",23,242,17,4.0,12/1/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory closest to me recently moved so I was excited to get a chance to eat here after outlet shopping. As with all the CF's, the interior is pretty and the set up is pretty much the same. Also just like the other CF's there was a considerable wait. Luckily I got there a little early (maybe 6 pmish) and for a party of 2, it was 20 mins.  The one thing I wish they would change is the table size. There just isn't enough room. Never. Esp if you have water glasses plus any beverage plus sugar, salt, pepper plus bread basket... and let's not go into the panic mode when an entree comes and you're not quite done with your appetizer. My go to meal is the pasta da Vinci or chicken marsala. I got the pasta and it was just as good. The house salad appetizer is so big that when I tried to order 2, the waitress actually recommended I get one and split it. And about the waitress - she was awesome.  Huge portions for a fair price. And that darn small table..... But yes I love CF!"
Napualokelani K.,"Woodbridge, VA",196,263,140,4.0,12/12/2012,"If you know Woodbridge, you know that it's TOO DAMN CROWDED! So, I expected that the opening of a new restaurant such as CF would cause lots of commotion and ridiculousness... and boy, I was right! I went in the week it opened and asked what the wait time was... 90 MINUTES!!!  People were waiting to eat at a CHAIN restaurant for NINETY FREAKING MINUTES!!!  Ridiculous! So then I had a day off.  And I decided...hmmm... maybe the kids and I can make it in with a less ridiculous wait time.  30 minutes.  Eh, it was 4 in the afternoon so I didn't mind waiting.  Now, onto the service and the food... The service was EXCELLENT hence my four star rating even though CF is a chain restaurant.  Drinks, bread & appetizers came out pretty quickly.  There was a delay with my daughter's kobe burger, but the manager came over to explain that to me and then refilled our drinks and brought more bread.  No big deal. The appetizers... I got both of the tuna appetizers and they were really good.  I can't recall the names of them, but one was smaller with avocado and the other was like a carpaccio - you could just scrape it up with a spoon and eat it.  Really yummy. I had the combination plate of shrimp scampi & steak dianne with mashed potatoes.  I'm used to scampi being just as butter/garlic sauce... this one looks to have had some kind of cream added to it.  It was different, but I liked it.  My daughter liked her burger and my boys had the pizza... which they ravaged! LOL  But hey, it's PIZZA and they are 10 and 5.   Now,  you simply cannot go to CHEESECAKE FACTORY and not try the cheesecake! Even though I was stuffed beyond belief, we got two pieces to share amongst the four of us.  It was the Oreo Cookie thing-a-majig and the banana cream something or other.  I really liked the banana one... it was so much better than the oreo one.  Either way, both got devoured! Overall a good experience, but be mindful of when you decide to go!"
Julia G.,"Lorton, VA",9,25,24,3.0,8/30/2014,"We came a little after 1pm on a Tuesday, it wasn't too busy but where they sat us was horrible all I could hear was dishes crashing or breaking every few minutes. Food was okay, I think I like the Tyson's location better. As always the cheesecake was on point! If you like pineapple you should definitely try the pineapple upside down cheesecake it's sooooo good! I would go again just to pick up that cheesecake for take away."
Emilee M.,"Springfield, VA",303,10,6,5.0,3/11/2016,"Everyone knows the Cheesecake Factory has awesome food. It always has. I go there at least once a month and I never get sick of it-- who could? I've never received bad service at a Cheesecake Factory but tonight I got extraordinary service. Our server, Carlos, went above and beyond any server that I've ever had, anywhere. His attention to detail was phenomenal and he went out of the way to make sure my infant son was taken care of. Out of 10, I would give Carlos a 100. He brought out bananas before we even ordered, for my son, without us even asking, and brought him small pieces of bread. He went beyond the extra mile."
Shaun M.,"Purcellville, VA",11,83,52,4.0,12/23/2015,This is a busy location so be prepared to wait 45 minutes during peak times. And 30 minutes for food. But its worth it - so many different menu choices. I had fish and chips. My party also had chicken panana and chicken enchiladas. All were really good. Service was excellent. And of course cheesecake - wow! A nice dining experience.
Tiffany V.,"Woodbridge, VA",130,115,161,3.0,12/26/2012,"mMm, a perfectly thin crispy chicken breast that's moist on the inside that still retains it's moisture.  At least that's how I like my parmesan-crusted chicken.  I just hate dry chicken.  The wait is long but expected.  I wish this place would allow you to at least call in advance and get seating.   It was a 40 minute wait.   Service was decent.  The Louisiana chicken pasta (bow tie) replaced with spaghettini was good because the chicken was perfectly cooked crispy and thin and still soft and moist inside as stated above.  Pasta was on the dry side with minimal flavors.  I had to add salt to it (never really a good sign as I don't eat much salt) to make it more palatable.  Others in my party substituted the pasta with rice.   The Chargrilled Coulette Steak which is sirloin steak.  It was decent but slightly dry.   The best part of the meal was the FRESH BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE! You can't go to Cheesecake Factory and not get cheesecake! That's like going to Macaroni Grill and not get the Macaroni...oh wait............ Anyway, The Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake is amazing! It's not too heavy and rich like some of the other cheesecakes available and tasted light, simple and delicious.  Try it!"
Judson W.,"Alexandria, VA",179,142,448,3.0,1/15/2013,"If you've ever been to a Cheesecake Factory, then you know it's always crowded. That problem is even worse at the Potomac Mills location because of its size. It is much smaller than most Cheesecake Factories which makes the wait times much longer. We never even attempt to sit in the dining area (and we probably never will). Instead, we go to the bar area so we can start our meal immediately. But even the bar area has had a wait every time we've been. People literally hover around people's tables/behind their seat at the bar, waiting for them to finish their meal and get up. I have been guilty of this as well, but it's still unpleasant. I give this location 3 stars just because Cheesecake Factory's menu is so expansive and varied. I love getting a few small plates to share and topping it off with one of their cheesecakes. But something has to change about these outrageous wait times and crowded waiting areas."
De B.,"Manassas, VA",0,3,10,2.0,3/1/2016,Usually have decent service but too it is soooooo slow...maybe we have the new waiter ....we asked for extra bread when we first got here......20 mins later nothing
Nia C.,"Woodbridge, VA",4,37,54,3.0,11/25/2015,"Always a LONG wait - but I am a local and this place is at the mall so the wait is to be expected. Host service is tolerable, wait staff is excellent and the food is delicious."
Nicole R.,"Broadway, VA",54,57,76,3.0,7/12/2014,"Been to 3 or 4 different Cheesecake Factories and I have to say this is my least favorite one so far.  Service was so-so and we had to wait forever for our food and also for our pre-made cheesecake to be plated and for our check.  The taste of the food was good minus both my pasta & my sister-in-laws pasta being undercooked (and hers severely lacking sauce), but who would send it back after you had to wait 45 mins for it?  Probably would go somewhere else for lunch next time were in the area."
Chris C.,"Springfield, VA",67,4,,2.0,6/6/2014,"My friends & I last night to celebrate a birthday where we had a rather large party of 13.  We waited about an hour (typical) for the table.  This location has a substantially smaller indoor dining area than the Fair Oaks or White Flint locations BUT they have an outdoor patio! The broiler caught on fire & we were told that the steak & burger wouldn't come. So the 2 people ordered something else but then the steak & burger still came out?  When everyone else had been served, 3 more friends waited 30 minutes for their chicken dishes & a pasta dish! The shrimp pasta was eventually served cold & 2 others still waited on the chicken!  We were seated at 7:45pm, my friends didn't get their food until almost 9!  It was so late & upset that they barely touched their food.  We complained to the manager, who only comped 2 meals & 2 cheesecakes.  ??? There were 3 LATE meals!  We were sympathetic to the waiter, who busted his tail, trying to keep us happy even though he already got his automatic 18% gratuity for the large party. Fortunately, I enjoyed my Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp (not to confused with Bonefish Grill's Bang Bang Shrimp) but managed to only eat half of it.  Hubby ate all of his Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo.   I have visited 3 different CFs in the WDC area & they manage to screw up the dinner order every time!  What's even more pathetic is that I keep going back because it's other people's preferences to go there. The wait is always long (opt to sit at the bar & you'll only wait 20 minutes), the food is overpriced, although portions are large.  Stick to the bar & cheesecakes.  Thought I would test my bartender's knowledge on cocktails so I ignored the fancy mojitos, margaritas & martinis and ordered a Negroni.  The bartender didn't know what it was but she made it perfectly.  I tipped her well for not effing it up.   And is it me or did the cheesecake pieces get smaller?"
Dana P.,"Washington, DC",4,56,31,2.0,5/17/2015,"My daughter and I just had lunch at the CF. The food was decent (I ordered the sausage/shrimp rigatoni pasta (sausage was burnt throughout dish), but I was very perturbed that I was  given a menu for drinks without prices.  I ordered a glass of sangria from the skinny menu, and the price was hardly skinny.  I was charged $11 for a glass of mediocre sangria, if a restaurant is going to charge prices like that for one beverage, the price should be listed on all menus.  My entree' was only $12.95, that surprise in bill will cause me not to return to CF anytime soon."
Racheal M.,"Stafford, VA",0,7,,4.0,8/5/2016,"This place is very clean and every employee I've encountered has given great service. The wasabi steak tips are so delicious. However, I've walked out more times than I've stayed. The wait is very long even though there aren't many people seated. Obviously there is an issue with staffing, either not enough staff or too many people calling out. I love this place but I rarely make it a destination."
Rawlin J.,"Alexandria, VA",404,34,36,4.0,9/20/2014,"Great way to celebrate a birthday dinner! Everyone was so polite and the food was delicious. The Chicken Bellagio is to die for! Beverages were a little pricey, but overall it was an excellent dinner. The Dulce de Leche milkshake will go down as a smooth dessert."
Todd P.,"Fayetteville, NC",8,1,,1.0,4/12/2014,"No reservations and two hour wait to be seated, not a problem. Our server took our order, and we waited another 40 minutes for our food, we never got bread, or saw our server. Our entree came out before our appetizer, not a problem, our appetizer came out, and so did the manager. She was really nice and listened very well. When we ordered our desert for dine in, and our server brought it to us, to go, with the check.  I am usually pretty laid back, but I will not be eating here again."
Dave M.,"California, MD",24,25,19,3.0,2/23/2015,"Dynamite shrimp were properly battered and fried! We decided to split a meal we selected the Steak Diane very generous on the medallions and perfectly cooked to medium rare.  Service was slower than usual' college kid that was in the weeds because of too many tables, and his focus was on the female waitress he was flirting with,  but still not bad service."
Cindy L.,"Washington, DC",333,187,70,4.0,6/4/2014,"Okay, I know people hate on chains and definitely a lot of hate rains on The CF buuuuuut i caaaaaaan't helllllllllllp ittttt!!!!  The Thai Lettuce Wraps are my fave...any time, any time. The Limocello Cake...no, i don't do the cheesecake...at Cheesecake...is the JAM. I don't even care that they don't make any of their cakes in-house, it's flipping amazing. I only dream of the day I could experience a fresh-out-the-oven version. Pair that with a cappuccino...makes my day. The wait time is always tricky at any location but I didn't have any issues at this this one. Server was great...I can't remember his name D: but he was charming, funny, fast, and gay.  Loved him, left a big, fat tip ;)"
