Michelle B.,"Alexandria, VA",213,120,38,5.0,8/20/2015,Love the food! Jovanni was our waitress and she ROCKS! I suggest sitting in her section if you go!  I had the pork chop and it was really really really GOOD!!
Rob H.,"Decatur, Atlanta, GA",83,6,1,1.0,5/6/2015,"Ultimate fail once again. Burnt food, long wait for recook, tasteless replacement and topped off with a rude manager (Jermel). Had a very similar visit about a year ago and shame on me for trying to come back again. Won't happen again."
Valerie D.,"Woodbridge, VA",89,22,4,2.0,7/30/2015,"Well, the sale ends at 10 tonight for the half priced piece of cake...but since yesterday was mom's birthday, I thought it would be nice for Granddaughter to pick up her a cake...so I call at 4:42 to order a whole cake, and was left on hold for 15 minutes. They said it would be ready by 6:30. At 6:35 I walked in the door, and the line was too long for someone who had worked all-day...and called ahead. There was NO walk up to pick up line, and once I got to the front, I had to wait an additional 30 minutes. Hey Cheesecake people, what's the point in calling in an order if you just going to treat me like everyone else. I'ma need you to do better! For that little stunt, you get 2 stars!"
Luann G.,"Fairfax Station, VA",1,41,1,5.0,9/29/2015,"This is a shout out to Evan, the daytime bartender. Great personality, service and attention to detail.  Stopped by after shopping and sat at the bar since I was a party of 1. I was indecisive between two appetizers and she recommended the skinny menu, which gave me a little of both at the same price of 1 on the regular menu. Had the best of both appies. Service is also important to me and she def delivered."
S L.,"Woodbridge, VA",13,57,126,2.0,5/17/2015,I would have to say this time was really bad! Always had a great service from Tyson's Corner.  Kids wanted Cheesecake after we went to  Red robin for dinner.  Service was slow.  Finally get our dessert and they brought a piece that's been sittin out.  Cheese cake was warm.  When I ask the server to change for another piece he said no problem I will get u a fresh slice.  Waited and waited!!  Finally I walk up to the counter and ask the server and he said I'm sorry we are very busy and he is waiting......   I would give them 1 star for attitude the other server had.   Cheese cake was good after it was fixed and I would have to say it was different from Tyson's Corners cheese cake factory!  But I still have to say Red Velvet cheese cake is the best!!
Supriyo D.,"Arlington, VA",0,8,,5.0,5/20/2016,Great desserts. Huge servings. But they also have a low calorie menu. Very attentive service. Good location with lots of parking: lots of seating both outdoor and indoor. Loved it and will be back.
Stasia A.,"Yorktown, VA",0,6,,1.0,4/27/2015,"This rating is based on the service we received here.  My husband, son, and myself walked in dressed casually 11:45am on a weekday. The hostess just looked at us, didn't greet us at all. We stood there for a good solid 5 minutes before we realized she wasn't going to communicate with us at all. She kept staring at us but never said Welcome or if there was a wait. There were people eating in the restaurant, but it wasn't packed at all.  1 star rating for the major disappointment. The hostess was a female, light skin with dark hair, glasses, and that day was wearing a wine colored lipstick."
Ryshelle L.,"Alexandria, VA",15,5,1,4.0,10/26/2014,"As always, there was a wait, but only for 2 of us. They said 15 minutes max, we waited for just 15 minutes- which i was not upset about.  The wait was definitely worth it! The service was great! Our server was new & in training, but he was very attentive & his costumer service skills were excellent. He knew what was on the menu & had ideas on what to reccommend. My friend & I got both got steak, seperate meals. One included being smothered in onions & mushrooms & mine being just a plain ole steak. Unfortunately, our meals were mixed up & both of our steaks were cooked wrong. We were at least able to switch plates & be happy that way. On the plus side, everything was still super delicious so we didnt bother sending our food back.  We both ate our entire meals, but the worst thing about eating out is when you order a steak & it's not cooked the way you like it.  All in all, it was a great experience & again, the food was very tasty! Highly reccommend, we will definitely be visiting again."
Evelyn C.,"Alexandria, VA",66,9,,3.0,8/30/2015,The food is pretty good the service is ok. I feel that service takes a while to get. It's always a wait and once you get to the table I feel they take while. The time I wait doesn't really effect this review because they are a busy restaurant. I feel that every time that I have gone to this restaurant it has an overwhelming menu and the food is ok but not great. I have tried different menu items and have never been really impressed.
Justin S.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,8,,5.0,5/31/2016,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory a few times at Potomac Mills, every time has been great. But I went on Memorial Day yesterday and the service, food and environment were exceptional! First, it was packed, and yet somehow the wait time for a table was only 15 minutes. Second, the server was quick, patient and attentive. But the food.... I had the Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger for the first time since being there, as well as the Cookie Dough Cheesecake for desert (Even tried a bite of my wife's Alfredo) and it was all superb! I recommend anyone who loves a good cheeseburger, definitely try the Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger. I would rank it in the top 5 of restaurant chain burgers I have tried."
Ai C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,9,2,5.0,8/7/2015,Sooooo good! I love The Cheesecake Factory!! Always great service here and we usually get served sooner than stated.  Everything on the menu is delicious so it's hard to choose. If I could get their bread served to me all day I'd be good with that!  I recently ordered the Georgia Peach drink and highly recommend you try it! All I can say is that you won't be disappointed.
Alexander H.,"Scranton, PA",1075,586,6680,2.0,8/22/2013,"The waiter was cool, and the food was good, but the service was very slow. What also caught my attention was that I tried to order something on the menu, but the waiter said that it was only available during lunchtime, and the menu itself didn't say that. Therefore I had to change my order at the last minute."
Marcos P.,"Prince William County, VA",0,3,,2.0,9/4/2014,"Wait to long to get serve.....over 20' only for the drinks.We spoke with the manager but took to long for everything, I hope my kids they don't ask again to go over this place. Recommendation: If they see empty table ask if someone serve...!!!! And get a better training...."
Anonymous F.,"Arlington, VA",0,10,,4.0,5/28/2015,This has to be the smallest CF location on earth. But it is CF so the food is good. The menu is pretty extensive. Haven't ordered anything I didn't like. The portions are massive yet prices are reasonable. Save space for dessert. Their cakes are just as good as their cheesecakes.
Sean N.,"Potomac Mills, Woodbridge, VA",4,7,,1.0,12/10/2013,"The family loves their desserts, but trying to eat at the restaurant just isn't worth the hassle.  Service is poor. Pacing is EXTREMELY slow.  Order accuracy is lacking. The music is turned up so loud that you can't carry on a conversation across the table.  If it were only the one time, I'd give the benefit of the doubt - but 3 for 3?  Nope...that's just too consistent.  We'll only be back for dessert take out."
Cathy M.,"Manassas, VA",8,9,13,5.0,12/26/2013,"Loved the Skinny Grilled Salmon! Was accompanied by perfectly prepared carrots, asparagus & green beans. Also loved the arugula salad!"
Marilyn C.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,10,,3.0,7/17/2015,"I'm always apprehensive of restaurants that have a 15-page menu.  I've been three times and the food is very ordinary, but, yet the place is crowded.  I don't get it."
Walt R.,"Washington, DC",10,48,10,4.0,3/25/2014,"First : NEVER had a disappointing meal here, EVER! Quality is always there for the main entree, the appetizers can be hit and miss. GOOD:          Always have a doggie bag after ordering the entree;          The Burrito Is HUGE!,           Chicken Wings good          Bang Bang Chicken is great!          Service better than average          BAD:           Arrive early during meal times,,seating takes a while.          Pricier than others a good meal/dessert with adult beverages for 2 about           $60-80"
Teal Q.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,20,,2.0,4/8/2016,The food is okay. The space is really tight and for the amount that you pay you would think it would be slightly more private. The seating is essentially like a dining haul. You are right next to people and they can clearly hear you. Why people wait in line to eat there is beyond me.
Kara S.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,26,2,4.0,5/5/2015,Staff always professional and on top of things. Food always amazing. The restaurant is always clean and tidy! Love this place!
