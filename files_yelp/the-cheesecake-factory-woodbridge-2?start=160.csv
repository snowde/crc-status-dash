Devin M.,"Fredericksburg, VA",4,41,29,4.0,2/24/2014,This is place is always busy out the door! The interior is nice and spacious. Parking can be a hassle since it's located right outside one of the entrances to Potomac Mills Mall. Even though the place is busy I have to stop by and grab dessert. The mango key lime cheesecake is so worth the wait! Delicious!
diane n.,"Woodbridge, VA",19,28,11,5.0,3/18/2015,"The food was great, Destini J, our server was very friendly and accommodated our ""happy hour"" needs with 5 minutes to spare!  Thank you Destini!  Great evening with my good friend Barbara!"
Thomas M.,"Fredericksburg, VA",9,73,30,5.0,3/10/2015,"Came up here from the Fredburg on Sunday afternoon for some lunch and shopping with friends and family. First off let me just say that I am a sucker for cheesecake. It is by far my favorite dessert and if I cannot manage to eat a slice I did something wrong. On this occasion I did no wrong. First off we arrived around noon and expected a wait of over 30 minutes and to our surprise it was only 20. We had a party of 5 including 1 child. We were sat in a very spacious booth. I do not believe I have ever sat in a booth where I was not elbow to elbow with the person next to me. I already knew at this point I was going to enjoy this meal.  The service was awesome. The waitress we had (I cant remember her name and I am really bad at this as you see in other posts) was on top of her game. Drinks were filled and food was quick. She was very personable and friendly. She definately worked for her tip. Now onto the fooooood. Appetizers - 2 fried mac and cheese balls orders and 1 buffalo blast. Meals- Some type of chicken and pasta for my friend, his wife had brunch with pancakes and eggs and bacon, my daughter kids quesadilla, my wife a cobb salad and myself a bacon bacon cheeseburger yes thats double bacon! And then there was the cheesecakes but thats later... The fried mac and cheese balls are our go to app. These are addicting and very delicious. The dish comes with 4 balls of mac and cheese on top of a sauce. Once you break a ball open and the mac and cheese pours out into the sauce game on. Each bite makes you want more and for the experience not to end. Highly recommend. The buffalo blast surpringly were really food. They were fried and in the middle was like a buffalo chicken dip. They came with buffalo sauce and blue cheese. They do come with a little extra fried exterior then our liking but I ate every bite I had. They had a nice kick to them. On to the meals. Chicken pasta was massive and friend couldnt finish said it was good but thats all I got out of it. His wife loved the brunch and kept prasing the pancakes. Kids quesadilla was huge! My daughter enjoyed it. My wifes lunch cobb salad was massive! I cant imagine what a dinner sized salad looks like. This salad could be split between 3 people. Now for my bacon bacon cheeseburger which the waitress recommended out of my choices. I got it medium rare which is my go to meat temp. It was so good and juicy. Im salavating right now thinking about it. The 2 different cuts of bacon make the burger. Once was cripsy the other was thick cut and so much flavor. It came with a special sauce which was the icing on the cake. I crushed the burger. O and I got a side salad instead of fries. Balsalmic Vinegarette is my go to and the salad wasnt your tradtional salad you get at most restaurants. Not bad but that burger and the bacon mmmmmmmm I havent even touched on the cheesecake yet. We ended up taking cheesecake to go since we were stuffed. My wife ordered the reeses peanut butter cup and I switch mine up everytime and went with the chocolate chip cookie dough. My wife loved hers and for me.....sigh I wish I didnt eat it so fast... It was soo good. Creamy cheesecake and cookiedough ramdomly placed throughout the slice. I love both. I dont think you can wrong with any of the cheesecakes. I think this is enough of the review. If you made it all the way to this paragraph congrats! I will continue coming back and will try another slice of the incredible cheesecake."
Winston R.,"Springfield, VA",4,31,,4.0,1/28/2013,"One of my favorite restaurants in the area. Only problem, the wait is usually super long, especially on the weekend. It doesn't help that this location is smaller than the Fairfax and Tyson's location, but there's nothing they can do about that now.  Since they don't take reservations, I'd recommend to call ahead to at least ask approximately how long the wait will be (and see if you're up for the wait). I've gone there too many times on a hungry stomach and almost passed out waiting! lol  If you've been to a Cheesecake Factory before, then you know what to expect. Food is always consistently good, portions are generous, and service is generally good.  If you've never been, don't forget to try a piece of cheesecake! They have a large variety."
Candace C.,"Dumfries, VA",2,28,,4.0,3/11/2013,"You are going to wait, get over it. It is high demand resturant in a supercrowded area (and, yes, not as big as most Cheesecake Factorys). The wait is usually about an hour (sometimes more) so plan to get there early - go get your name on the list, get  your beeper and then walk around the mall that is right there and be back about 15 minutes before they tell you. Your beeper will still go off in the mall, provided you haven't walked all the way to the other end of it... The food is delicious. The only complaint I have is that they once did not cook my fiance's meat to order (well done). They did take the meal back, replaced it and supplied cheesecake on the house.  Service was good even though the place is jam packed. I have never once waited for a glass refill or wondered ""Where in the world is our waitress?"" I give four stars, only because I do wish it were bigger. The tables are ultra-close together so I don't recommend it for a romantic dinner for 2 unless you want your neighboring tables to know your business."
Esteban D.,"Alexandria, VA",51,81,26,5.0,2/15/2015,Bar group is very friendly and nice. Excellent food. Decently priced not to bad. The food is of excellent quality and extremely delicious. The staff is very friendly and accomodating to your needs. They keep the drinks coming and the bread rolling. Deff would recommend it. Just be cognizant of the lines and times
Rafah H.,"Arlington, VA",8,44,32,1.0,12/16/2014,"We went to this Cheesecake Factory today. My friend called in advance and said were 9 people, can we make a reservation? They said they don't take reservations but they're not full anyways so no wait. We went there, 9 people and waited.... And waited.... The sister kept saying the table paid and should be leaving shortly. 1 full hour later he was negotiating putting us all in 1 booth, made for 6. We finally left and went to bahama breeze across the street. I will never go back to this branch again. He shouldn't said we can't accommodate 9 instead of making us wait for an hour."
Julie S.,"Stafford, VA",0,2,,1.0,7/11/2014,"This restaurant chain gives off a facade of upscale dining with a ridiculous menu that is over 10-pages covered with advertisements and the most unpleasant congregation of employees. Cheesecake Factory, please, reevaluate your criteria before sending your waiters/waitresses to work at your establishments.  My friend and I ended up waiting well over the usual wait time for a table at Cheesecake because the host had us waiting for a party of 4. The server brought out 4 plates and 4 drinks even after we told the incompetent employees SEVERAL TIMES that it will just be the 2 of us. The girl who was our server seemed lazy and uninterested being there. She only stopped by our table two times; to order our food and to leave the check. When she left the check she just walked by and slid it on our table without a single word. We had to stop her as she was walking by because my friend ordered a chicken that she felt was a little under cook and the waitress took one of the four appetizer plates that was stacked up at the end of the table and BRUSHED OFF THE BREAD CRUMBS WITH HER HANDS and asks my friend to put the chicken on the plate. Her excuse was, ""OH, IT'S RED LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S NEAR THE BONE."" She never came back with the chicken, instead a kitchen boy brought it back BURNT AND FLAKY IN A TAKE OUT BOX after we were close to paying our bill.  The second time was several days ago, for my friend's birthday. We just sat near the bar so we wouldn't have to wait for a table. It was going ok until we met our rather clumsy waitress. She brought our silverware, but no menu, asked if we wanted drinks and bread, but no bread plates. We ended up eating the bread with just our hands. Other guests who came in after us were getting their appetizers way before us. She never came back to refill our drinks, which seems like an on going trend at this place. We had to ask the two servers who brought out the appetizers for plates and refills. That's when our waitress decided to stop by and say thanks to her coworkers who helped and walked on as if we weren't even there. What really annoys me is that we saw about four other birthdays going on and our waitress says, ""so.. are you still interested in something for your birthday? It's just a small cup of dessert that's only enough for two bites."" We left disappointed and I will never come here again."
Mike D.,"Woodbridge, VA",5,140,5,4.0,1/22/2013,"Have lived in Woodbridge for 4 years and so glad to see all the new restaurants opening up.  So far this one is doing the best job.   As expected its new and waits are 60-90 mins, so we went on a Sat fro lunch at 1130 we they first opened up. Food was great as always and service was excellent."
Troy M.,"Hephzibah, GA",22,180,67,4.0,8/14/2013,"I like this location, its brand new. I've only been for brunch a couple of times and I've liked the food I've ordered. the Eggs Benedict is great, and so are the mimosa's."
R J.,"Fredericksburg, VA",6,67,2,4.0,3/8/2013,"If there is one thing you can say consistently about the Cheesecake Factory is... if there is nothing on the menu you like, you simply are too difficult to please... AND the portions are consistently ENORMOUS. We recently had dinner at the new Potomac Mills store and it was an overall good experience.  Server (Jorge) was attentive and personable and made us feel welcome and special.  However he didn't know the difference between Black tea (strong, iced) and Raspberry Tea (weak, iced) OR someone mixed up the tea dispensers, not sure but we switched to water and soda - when the bill came he forgot to remove one of the $2.95 teas (a bit pricey!) so that created considerable confusion, but we got it worked out. The food we ordered was good.  I had a mushroom burger (okay, but not really special) - I also opted for a salad, thinking it would a garden salad, it was however more of a spinach salad and I didn't care for it (that's just my taste) BUT the honey mustard dressing was great! My wife got the meatloaf sandwich and it was HUGE - way too much to eat after having a Nacho's appetizer so she took half of it home for lunch the next day.   Great taste... Overall, Cheesecake Factory is typically a very good, fairly priced place to eat with quality food.  You will not leave there hungry and if you do, it's your fault, not theirs.   If you really want to experience the ultimate burger, get the Mac 'n Cheese burger and you will be able to say you have a unique experience - it is exceptional but probably about 2000+ calories!! Enjoy!"
Mitch A.,"Miami, FL",0,102,68,4.0,11/7/2015,"We've been to this Cheesecake Factory a couple of times and the food has always been good and the service has been good too. The restaurant is a part of the Potomac Mills mall. The last time we went we sat at a high top table near the bar and the waiter was very quick and one of the best visits we've had. It's a large restaurant and has patio seating. I noticed Tesla charging stations toward the back of the parking lot, but unfortunately my Jeep is rather un-environmental friendly. We've never had food that wasn't good, and the servers have all been good too. One point though, it is a popular restaurant and frequently they'll be on a wait despite having a lot of clean and open tables. I guess those times they didn't have enough waiters. On a week night we waited a good while and sat waiting with longing eyes at a lot of clean tables. We ended up being seated at a two person table immediately next to a large birthday group. The service was still good, food was still good, just a little hard to speak over the people enjoying their party. Maybe I'm just getting old though! We'll definitely keep coming here for special occasions or if we're feeling skinny or something!"
SooMee B.,"Stafford, VA",0,13,,3.0,7/24/2014,"Food was good but service is definitely not on par. When we got there (I took my 2 friends out for one of their birthday) we got thai wraps, alfredo, and some other items and it was good. Down side is that our waitress really didn't pay attention to us as she went by several times.  We got our apps AFTER the people who got seated after us got their meal.  Drinks didn't get refilled and we sat around for a loooong time before our order was taken.  I would expect better service from Cheesecake Factory so this was a bit of a disappointment.  I know that it is in the mall area so there will be lots of people but c'mon, it has been open for a while now, there is no excuse as to why there was poor and lack of service."
Katelyn S.,"Fredericksburg, VA",6,149,4,4.0,10/29/2015,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory a few times. Both times they weren't too busy like the Richmond location. Guessing because of the time of day. But all the times I've been here the food was good like always. Service was okay, nothing to brag on. But love the cheesecake and food."
Adele J.,"Middletown, DE",2,71,12,5.0,10/3/2014,5 stars because this is the best Cheesecake Factory I've been too! Both of our dishes had so much flavor. We were both pleasantly surprised. The portions are huge so you can easily make 2 meals out of it. It tasted great the next day as well. The menu is a bit huge so it's hard to narrow it down and the seats are a bit too close to each other but every Cheesecake Factory is like that. When want Cheesecake Factory it'll be this one!
Sarina P.,"Washington, DC",81,141,25,4.0,5/19/2013,"The best thing about CF is that you know what you're getting: consistently good food, a huge, varied menu, large portions, and great cheesecake. That said, you have to pick your time well.  We just went on a Sunday morning, around 10:45am, and the place was practically empty.  Score!  Our server was efficient and friendly, but not overly so.  Between the two of us, the fried shrimp appetizer and bread basket had us halfway to full.  I was only able to eat a bit of my fried chicken salad and hubs barely touched his pasta.  It's nice to have leftovers, but next time, we'd probably skip the apps to really enjoy our meal.   My favorite cheesecake is usually the Banana, but this time, I was too stuffed to even consider it."
Cathy C.,"Jacksonville, FL",33,14,10,4.0,12/1/2013,"Definitely love the shepherd's pie, but make sure you order the lunch menu size, because portions are huge. Even the smaller size is ridiculously filling, but it's meat and potatoes, so if you're going to eat that, skip the appetizer.  The only negative thing I can say about the place is that it can get crazy busy during peak lunch / dinner times, so try to get there when it first opens or be prepared to wait a little. Also, never skip on the cheesecakes!"
Chris S.,"Lorton, VA",68,1,,3.0,1/26/2016,"Visited this Cheesecake location earlier today.   Seated quickly and our waitress came by quickly as well with the bread and to get our drink order.   We had our two kids with us so I got tropical iced tea and my wife got cucumber lemonade.   Both really good.  We ordered one kids meal,  a salad and the chicken parmesean sandwich.   Ten,  fifteen and twenty minutes pass by.   We finally got our food.  Food was hot and tasty but no visit from the floor manager.   I don't know if he even noticed because he was too busy on his phone and constantly at the host stand.   At the end of the day,  I gave three stars because this was my first bad experience here.   The waitress was real nice and once the food finally came out it was good.   Big opportunity here for a floor manager to be involved with the tables instead of just walking around and talking.   A simple table visit would have saved this review."
Michelle R.,"Lorton, VA",13,63,8,3.0,7/17/2014,"I am rating this a 3 based mainly on the poor experience caused by a kitchen error last night. I want to say though that the staff response was excellent and that is why CF is still ""A-OK"" in my book. This is the email I sent to corporate this morning. ""First, I would like to start out by saying that my husband and I go to cheesecake factory at least once every month or two and I go with my girlfriends monthly myself. Unfortunately, our meal experience was a disaster last night!!! My food came out more than 15 mins before my husband's food. I slowly ate my food, trying to wait until his came out. It was obviously cold by that time. We ended up missing our movie and having to pay for an extra hour of babysitting. - Disaster! THAT SAID! I am not writing to complain. I am writting to tell you that despite the kitchen error and the resultant set backs, we will still be returning to Cheesecake Factory in Woodbridge.  Our Server - Andre, was friendly and compitent right from the start. The perfect mix of friendly, but not familiar. He made recommendations and gave the appropriate amount of time between check-ins and refills, etc. The problem came when the kitchen plated the wrong order. Andre explained this when he delivered my order. I would have liked the option to have both entrees delievered at the same time, but Im sure he didn't think it would take that long for the second. After several minutes he offered my husband a complimentary soup or salad while he waited, which he declined. After 15 mins, it was obvious that this was a real problem and Andre kindly addressed it and assured us the item would be removed from the bill. Shortly later the manager, Ozzie visited our table to extend his apologies and offered free cheesecake. We told him we were already running late and that was not necessary. He told us that they were open to 11 and that we were welcome to come back after the movie for our cheesecake. When we paid the bill, Ozzie had comped BOTH meals, which we told Andre was unnecessary. He was again gracious and apologetic and told us it was the least they could do. He was impressively polite and humble, explaining that though it was a kitchen mistake it represents him, and he represents CF and wanted to make sure our experience was enjoyable. At 1045 we returned, exhausted and running late for our babysitter. Ozzie met me at the bakery and though he had originally offered one free cheesecake, when I attempted to pay him for the second he declined, again apologizing for our experience. I have never been so impressed with a staff's handling of an inconvenience. They made my husband and I feel appreciated and respected and not like ungrateful, complaining customers.  It is soley due to the response of your server and manager that my husband and I will return to this cheesecake factory. I hope you will commend them for thier good work, customer service, and pride in your business."""
ET R.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,3,,1.0,5/27/2016,"Called 3 days in advance to make reservations because I was expecting a party of 9.  Host says they don't take reservations so I ask for an estimated waiting time frame for the date/time of my scheduled event.  Host states about 30-45 mins.  I clarify the policy especially since I am knowingly expecting a large party and it seems as though a good restaurant would appreciate the notice, but still they won't take a reservation.  I come early to get my name down on the day of the event so my guests aren't waiting too long.  The manager then quotes me a 2 HOUR wait.  I explain that when I called in advance, I was given a much shorter estimation and that was my whole reason to call so that my party could be seated in a timely manner. We are all military members so everyone arrived right on time.  Manager said he could do nothing, offered no answers.  Unclear why a restaurant of this scale would not be better able to manage its demand and customer flow.  Everyone is just standing around waiting, blocking up the entrance. Not sure if that is there preference but it looks very poorly managed to expect customers to wait 2 hours to even sit down.  Who comes to a restaurant and then is able to wait 2 hrs to sit and probably another 30-45 mins to eat without starving??"
