Joseph S.,"Lorton, VA",29,22,,4.0,6/14/2013,Always good foood and cake. The new young servers are rookies and you can tell. But nothing terrible.  Beautiful new building and outside seating.
C.j. J.,"Woodbridge, VA",10,10,5,2.0,5/31/2015,"STAY AWAY FROM THE BRUNCH MENU!!!! I've tried their brunch 4x and each time it gets worse. The first time I had the Belgium waffle and eggs Benedict. Awesome but pricey and took FOR-EV-ER ( the sandlot pronunciation). 2nd time I was treating friends from the UK who absolutely wanted to try it as they heard about it from ""The Big Bang Theory"". They were throughly disappointed so was I. The Belgium waffle was ok just room temperature. After the wait I ate it as I didn't have time to wait. My third trip was a phone in order in which I waited 20 minutes for. The manager brought it out to my car apologized and gave it to me free. When I got home I wish I would have gave it back. Ugh! Today I was craving that waffle. It came out lukewarm along with the poorly scrambled eggs, tough bacon and dry breakfast potatoes. Why did I set myself up again??? I may buy the waffle and go to Bob Evans for the rest. This is madness! I'd advise you come for the cheesecake it's supposed to be cold, they get that right everytime!"
Meaghan M.,"Woodbridge, VA",40,60,1,4.0,6/21/2014,"I go here all the time (brunch, lunch, or dinner).  It's one of my favorite restaurants to visit.  It's a chain restaurant so you generally know what to expect when you go.  I'm glad they're in Woodbridge now so I don't have to drive to Tyson's anymore when I need my fix.  The food is always good.  And the rare times that it's not management quickly resolves the problem.  I also love their outside patio seating.  I love outdoor dining in general and they do a good job of making it comfortable whether it's chilly or warm which really extends the time they can offer it in comparison to other area restaurants.  Definitely recommend this location."
LilMike O.,"Fredericksburg, VA",1,16,,3.0,3/25/2013,Simple Review: Meals: Decent...same as every other Cheesecake location. Drinks: Roughly $10 a piece. Dessert: Yes...they make good cheesecake...many flavors. End of story. Staff: Not so great here. They messed up my seating twice in the same night resulting in a longer wait. Location: At the mall...expected foot traffic. Small location. Long wait (2 hours on a Friday night at 8pm). Very Loud. Overall: Eh...I guess if you're craving cheesecake.
David F.,"Woodbridge, VA",80,9,1,2.0,9/9/2014,"Been there four times (Woodbridge, VA Cheesecake Factory), and the food is great, however, very very slow service. All four times; took them at least ten minutes for the waiter/waitress to take our order just for drinks. Then it took another ten minutes just to bring them out. Food came out quicker than our drinks. I have no idea why it takes so long for the drinks, and I'm talking just regular soft drinks; nothing special. Additionally, they don't check back often to see if we are ok, need refills, napkins, etc. Finally, it takes forever to get our checks. All four times these things happened. Seemed like déjà vu. I almost think it's protocol. Food is good though. One more thing; floor is very slippery; be careful walking."
John B.,"Newport News, VA",0,15,1,1.0,4/16/2015,My family and I went in and stood around for five minutes. Hostess just looked at us and did not say a thing. We left after the lack of service.
Greg S.,"Woodbridge, VA",42,22,1,5.0,12/8/2012,"This restaurant just opened in Nov 2012 and I've already been here four times. My first visit wasn't so spectacular as the server struggled and took too long to take orders/deliver drinks and she lacked good communication skills. I haven't seen her there on my subsequent visits so I'm either missing her or she is no longer serving there. I've written that experience off as grand opening pains as the service since then has been perfect. Matt is AMAZING. If you're planning to visit this place ask to sit in his section and you'll receive the best service you could hope for.  The food is always fresh (never frozen except for the cheesecakes), staff is attentive, and oh those oversized servings delievered to your table in a beautifully decorated and rich environment. It's among the best chain restaurants out there and it's great to have one minutes from home. The prices are very good for the amount of food and atmosphere provided (12-30 range per entry) Tip, it's always crowded so I go an hour early to put a name on the list and then shop at the mall while waiting. It's much more enjoyable this was than waiting in the overcrowded lobby which isn't large enough to accomodate so many people at once."
Tha Food S.,"Woodbridge, VA",74,33,89,3.0,1/23/2013,"Portions are always HUGE, menu is GIGANTIC, still trying one new item each visit.  However, I always get the ultra Sweet Raspberry Lemonade with sugar around the rim!"
Nicole S.,"Alexandria, VA",42,1,,5.0,2/21/2014,2/20/2014 was my first time to the cheesecake factory.  I went with my bestfriebd and kid. And it was amazing. The amount of food you get for the money is amazing.  The servers were nice and helpful. The food was amazing!! And I still have cheesecake left over for today. :) I will definitely go back.
Justin C.,"Franconia, VA",0,1,,1.0,3/31/2015,"Because I spent $50 in gift cards at Christmas, I had two gift cards for myself for a slice of plain cheesecake.  I came four different times to use them.  Each time, the wait was over 2 hours though I tried odd times, 3pm, 8:30pm, etc.  Today for dinner was my last shot because I thought they were good through the end of March.  I should have looked more closely because the last day was March 29, not 31.  The manager would rather let our entire party leave and eat dinner somewhere else than let us use these two measly cards.  Like they aren't making enough money?  To not accept a gift card expired by two days is like stealing imho.  Gift cards are money already spent at the business, and we had all been planning on eating there tonight too.  Well, not ever again....  It's just a chain, food's not that great.  Worst wait times in Woodbridge, by far."
Stephanie O.,"Quantico, VA",0,6,,2.0,9/22/2013,"I usually love the CFactory - however, last night we went and my husband's chicken entree was raw! Fortunately he saw this before eating it. We alerted the waitress who said she would re-heat it for us. Expecting a new plate of food, she brings back the same plate 10 minutes later, disguised in more sauce and extra cheese. He goes to cut into it and realizes its already cut (where he had cut it) it was just pushed back together! We then spoke to the manager who offered him another fresh plate (at this point we had been there an hour and I was already finished eating my meal), She ended up taking it off the bill, because it was never eaten, and gave us a free cheesecake. Alittle stingy in my mind to someone you served RAW chicken to (it was clear on the inside!). Meanwhile I go home and get hit with a bout of food poisoning. Needless to say we wont be back for a long time!"
Mary P.,"Occoquan, VA",9,178,87,3.0,9/29/2013,It has been a year or so since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory so I was surprised that one slice of strawberry cheesecake that used to cost $6 now costs $8.45! Yes...for ONE slice of cheesecake. (The service was great. I only stopped in to get a slice. Possibly for the last time in a long time.)
Maria C.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,28,14,4.0,4/11/2015,There cheesecake are really good! I don't like there menu as much honestly. The only 2 things I have liked were the nachos and there jambalaya pasta. That pasta is delicious! It's a bit pricy but the place is nice and service is good. The wait can take a while depending on when you go.
Nick A.,"Woodbridge, VA",3,84,9,3.0,8/22/2013,"Large portions that tastes good at a reasonable price. The service was slow and the server was forgetful, consistently had to remind them for simple things (fork, water) hard to eat your food with a butter knife."
Jalese A.,"Woodbridge, VA",11,65,3,5.0,3/28/2014,"Every time I'm in the area I have to come by sit at the bar and enjoy a nice lunch, the wait time can sometimes be unbearable but its worth the wait with the portion sizes so large and the quality of the food, the cheesecake and the ambiance its just a very nice restaurant."
Richelle S.,"Triangle, VA",3,38,1,2.0,11/7/2014,"I am giving this restaurant a 2 because of the server who was absolutely awesome. I cannot say the same for the hostess who was rude unprofessional unwelcoming and clearly did not want to be at work today. The seating in this place is horrible there's barely any elbow room. When we were first seated we were basically touching the people like right next to us. We asked to be seated somewhere else where it was less busy and she took us to the other side of the restaurant and sat us in the same type of place.  When we asked for a booth which was clearly open behind us, she said that it was reserved for larger parties. Five minutes later a party of two was seated right at the same booth that we had just asked for. The food as always was very good the prices were reasonable we didn't have to wait very long. The seating however really changed our experience in this restaurant and we will not go back only because there seems to be no privacy whatsoever if you want to have an actual conversation with the person you are having lunch or dinner with."
William And Kelly F.,"Bayonne, NJ",0,5,,2.0,10/14/2013,"I would say we go to the Cheesecake Factory often. & their food is delicious & we've only experienced one bad waitress there. After complaining about her they even tried giving us free stuff. My complaint is for the wait time. I live about 20minutes away from the Cheesecake Factory so when I get there, Though this is rarely the case. We went there on 10/13/13 & we took our family that was visiting. It came to 9 people. My husband is also in a wheelchair and so I understand this will make it even more difficult to sit us. However, first we get there & we are told that they have to talk to their manager first before they can give us a wait time. This took about 10-15minutes. Then they say it's going to be 55-70minutes. I thought this was ridiculous, however it was my son's birthday & he likes eating there so we wait. However there were many people that went ahead of us. & I wonder if instead of leaving seats open so we could be seated quicker they figured to put people there hoping they eat quick.  Like I said, I enjoy the food and service but they need to fix the wait time. Especially for a big group. That's a lot of money right there."
Beau J.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,2,,1.0,5/11/2015,Horrible service. Waited 20 minutes heifer our waitress even came to our table. Waited 10 to actually get our drinks. Never got bread till our food came. Just all around bad service.
Jennifer S.,"Miami, FL",0,39,,5.0,12/9/2014,"I have been to this location several times and it has consistently had excellent food.  I have had the Jambalaya Pasta, Meatloaf, burgers, and of course the cheesecake.  All are excellent with large portions. Never have been disappointed with this place."
Tina G.,"Alexandria, VA",0,16,7,3.0,9/16/2013,"It is a really busy place, I waited at least 20minutes every time. The food is ok, but the service is slow. Silverware has food stain!"
