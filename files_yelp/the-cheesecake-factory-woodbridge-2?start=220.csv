Hannah A.,"Manassas, VA",9,85,6,4.0,5/17/2013,I actually really enjoyed our dinner here. Very filling and had at least two days worth of leftovers. Very quiet and mostly empty (we went around 2 pm) but then they sat another group at the table right next to us. I felt that Anne Hathaway in the awkward dinner scene in Valentine's Day.
LJ C.,"West Palm Beach, FL",1,3,,5.0,2/1/2014,"Some of best surprises are the unexpected ones; and this was our experience while waiting in the bar for our table to open up.  I asked the bartender, Amber, if she could mix the perfect Dirty Martini - she just smiled and served me the absolute perfect drink. Definitely competitive with NYC, San Francisco -- all the major cities where I've compared this enigma of a cocktail.  Amber truly has the gift of mixology, which Prince William county has been lacking until now.  Our county has some very good wine lists, but we've run short on the true cocktail experience.  Since then, I've ordered catering services, and their manager Sean walked me through pricing options and he customized my order.  He was extremely accommodating and the food was exceptional. Ask for Amber at the bar to recommend and mix your drink,  you will not be disappointed. Regardless of what time you visit you will be greeted by Sean the manager - I suspect that he never leaves."
Joshua F.,"Woodbridge, VA",163,130,49,4.0,3/29/2013,"Its cheesecake factory, you know what you're getting into when you go there.  If you are coming in for just a slice of cheesecake and some drinks sit at the bar.  You will get faster and possibly more experienced service."
C W.,"Woodbridge, VA",13,4,,2.0,7/22/2014,"We all were so excited to finally get a CCF in Woodbridge. I have been a few times. On Saturday July 12, 2014 my friend and I went to lunch after the movies.  We were sat immediately which is rare.  Our server did not acknowledge us for at least ten minutes. Needless to say when he finally came we were ready to order. We ordered.  Our drinks took another ten minutes, no bread. We asked about the bread, no bread, still no bread. He comes and says there is some coming out of the oven in a few minutes. Still  no bread. Our order comes out which was brought by someone else, and there is no salad dressing for my friends salad. Now, we see are waiter, Daniel talking to a couple in the bar area, he doesn't come by to check on us or anything--still no bread. We flag someone down for the dressing. Finally Daniel comes by, and I tell him the service is so poor and he responds, ""you can't please everyone."" Wow, you can think it, but say it out loud, I was shocked. I said, ""I want to speak to the manager, he says, ""okay"" I then respond, ""wow I can't believe the attitude.""  The manager was very nice, sorry I cannot remember his name. He gave us another server, Jorge--who was awesome.  The manager gave us free dessert as well."
Barbara B.,"Woodbridge, VA",10,33,,4.0,6/14/2013,"This restaurant is great in my book.  They brought out bananas and bread for my 1 year old and didn't mind making room for his stroller.  The servers i have had their are great and I have made 4 different trips back with friends.  I always get bang bang chicken and shrimp.  I have tried tiramsu, godiva and pineapple upside down cheesecake all are wonderful.  I highly recommend this restaurant"
Keb V.,"Washington, DC",0,34,,4.0,10/13/2014,"I wasn't thrilled about coming to Cheesecake Factory because it's always packed and I personally don't feel like it will be a good experience when you have servers running around, with a crowd of people waiting to be seated at the entrance.  Well I was surprised that the wait was manageable, our server was very friendly, and brought our food out quickly.  The cheesecakes were amazing.  I just didn't care for the lady eyeing my Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake the entire time I was eating it.  Order one to go lady!  The only knock was when another waitress brought our food and she asked us if we wanted shredded cheese with our pastas.  We said yes and she disappeared.  Our server came by and asked us if we needed it and we got our cheese.  I'm guessing it was just a busy moment.  But overall, great food, great cheesecake."
Joseph M.,"Stafford, VA",0,5,,1.0,11/21/2014,"Great food but, one of most insulting and rude managers I have ever dealt with. Had a question about one of their dishes that happened to be different from another Cheesecake Factory I had been too. The manager basically called me a liar and even though I was fine with the dish continued to make it a point to ensure I felt stupid for even thinking there was a difference in the dish. Absolutely unnecessary and I will not be going back to this location. Than he had the audacity to come back to the table and tell me he felt bad that I was upset saying things like ""I didn't mean to be rude"" and ""I'm not that kind of guy"". I told him I didn't want it to discuss it anymore and simply wanted to leave and he just kept pressing the issue about how he was such a nice guy and I misunderstood him. Obnoxious and rude. The reason that I remembered the original dish so vividly by the way, is because it was one of my first meals I had after my 3rd combat deployment, so I happen to remember it well and Fondly. This manager is clearly not representative of Cheesecake Factory as a whole, but I am quite sure their corporate office would be offended to see him tarnishing their good name."
Sarah B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,84,,5.0,8/21/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory opened up right before we left and I was grateful not to have to drive all the way up to Tyson's Corner to get my cheesecake fix! Restaurant is very clean, great service, and great food. There does tend to be a really long wait in weekends, probably because it's one of the only decent sit-down restaurants in the area."
Toy W.,"Burke, VA",1,37,,3.0,5/6/2013,It's your typical CF except its much smaller yet I didnt have to wait for a table on a weekend (i prefer booths but we were hungry). Parking is always horrendous in this area! Food & drinks were on point but my heart & gas tank loves the Fair Oaks location.
Ellen B.,"Richmond, VA",0,1,,2.0,9/7/2014,"We were greeted warmly by a young male bartender, he was quick to answer our questions and was very friendly. After about 30 minutes of waiting for two medium-rare burgers, the bartender mentioned he was going to check on our food. He came back a while later with supplies to stock the bar and didn't say a word about the status of our meals. Our burgers arrived about 40 minutes later, one with the wrong side item. We were so hungry at this point it wasn't a big deal, however, what was a big deal was the fact that we were never checked on afterwards--bartender was no where to be found. We had to flag down a very apathetic manager to voice our complaints whose only resolution was to offer free cheesecake. We declined as we were from out of town. All we wanted was some sincerity from someone. Luckily we had cash to pay our bill as the bartender was still absent by the time we were more than ready to leave. We weren't even thanked by a single employee as we left. $60 was a large price to pay for such a disappointment."
Marsalla K.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,8,,4.0,8/30/2014,"I love this chain!  I usually order Tomato Basil Pasta, nothing else really compares, in my humble opinion.  Also, the Pineapple Mojito is just amazing.  This location in particular is rather small, since it's the only one in the area.  The size contributes to the long wait times at peak hours.  I really like their happy hour; it offers a variety of food and cocktails at a great price."
Bill L.,"Woodbridge, VA",45,8,4,3.0,4/7/2013,"This place has some of the best food around. This location is MUCH smaller than the Fair Oaks location. My Wife and I have been two or three times, with an average wait time of over one hour. The food is awesome after the wait, but we could drive to the other location, eat, and drive back in less time due to the long wait. This is why I gave it just average 3 star rating. I asked one of the staff why they built such a small"
Kelly K.,"Mooresville, NC",120,380,60,4.0,5/21/2013,"I haven't been to a CF in years, and when my husband mentioned giving this one a shot, I figured why not? I looked at their menu online before our visit, and they have a TON of veggie-friendly food! There was so much to choose from! We arrived on a Sat. at 6pm, so of course the wait was long. They told me it would be 30-45 min., and it was 45 min. Our server arrived promptly and was pleasant and quick. Another server brought our stuff for our kids to nibble on (sliced up bread and banana slices). Our food arrived VERY quickly. I think we ordered too much! We got one order of the kids mac and cheese for our kids, in case they didn't like what we ordered (we ordered a bunch of small plates to share). We ordered: stuffed mushrooms, parmesan polenta fries, fried zucchini, grilled artichoke, and fried eggrolls. My husband also ordered a Greek salad. I have to say, it was ALL good! Those avocado eggrolls...where have they been all my life??! If I had to pick one thing that wasn't as good as the rest, it would be the fried zucchini (but it was still good). We made the mistake of ordering 2 mixed drinks from the Skinny menu (I got the skinny sangria and hubby got the skinny mojito). They were good, but we were shocked when we got the bill- $10.50 each! Kablam! We were too stuffed for cheesecake, so we got two pieces to go to eat in the privacy of our home. We will go back to the CF, we just need to find a time when there isn't a wait!"
Felicia V.,"Woodbridge, VA",2,18,,2.0,4/24/2014,"My friend and I went today for lunch. Our server had nice hair pulled back in a pony tail but service was not nice. I asked him to bring my appetizer as a meal when my friends meal came. That did not happen. He never once came over to see if we needed anything, which we did. Another server came and checked on us three times. She even cleared our table. He came over with the check and walked away. I am always a generous tipper. But no tip for him. Many of my friends would rather drive to Tysons although we live in Woodbridge. Tysons servers are worth the drive."
M K.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,5,,1.0,4/29/2014,"Met  a couple of girl friends for a quick bite and drinks before we went to the movies.had to move to the bar area to get the happy hour prices. Then we had to order immediately because happy hour was ending in 7 ,minutes. we ordered a cosmo each and them  changed to two each to get the happy hour price of $5.00 instead of the $11.95 per drink. One of my friends was on her way, so I called her and asked what she wanted from the happy hour price list. she order 2 pinot vines. all was good. we ordered an appetizer. we received 1 each of the cosmos. Had to track down the waitress to get the second drink. finally got it. But apparently she forgot she already had charged us for the second drink.then we asked for the bill. we got the bill and then we decided to not go to the movie but stay and visit with each. we ordered another drink each. so that is 3 drinks each.but we had been charged for 4 drinks each at this time but .we didnt receive our drinks so i went to the bar and asked the bartender where was our drinks. she said she was about to make them.the bartender again charged us for the same drink. we ordered cheese cake each and the waitress put the wrong cake on the wrong billing and also  served us the wrong cake ( we didn't realize we ate the wrong cake til it was gone ( too good to question it). when we decided it was time to go, we got our bill and I caught that they over charged me 2 cosmos at $11.95 each and my friend also got charged 2x $11.95. i asked that the bill be corrected. the waitress said she would correct it. came back with new bill- no change. asked for the manager and he came and said that we consumed the 11 cosmos and he wouldn't change the bill. i explained that we didn't order 11 cosmos. he said I had been there since 4:30pm and we did order them. I explained that i didnt get there until 5:45pm and could prove it because I called my friend to ask what she wanted from the happy hour price list. he didnt care, he claimed we ordered the drinks and if I didnt pay it, he would elevate the problem to the police!!!! what the Heck!! no customer service- no consideration of the fact that the server didnt take care of it-I had to even go the bartender to get our drinks and she again charged us.he did take off the price of the cheese cake but the drinks were $50.00 not $7.95 that the cake cost.several times he threatened to ""elevate"" ( call the police) the problem if I didnt pay the bill I asked for his business card and he came back with another managers card. I again asked for his card he finally gave me another card but I have no idea if it was his or not. i paid the  bill but left no tip. I want my bill adjusted. I want my $50.00 back for drinks I didnt order or drink. I will not be back to any Cheese cake Factory ever again. Worst experience I have ever had. DO NOT GO TO THIS COMPANY for anything. The manager said I could come  in tomorrow and have the manager on staff look at the video of our table to prove to them that we only received 7 of the 11 cosmos.REALLY... STUPID... really STUPID."
Heather G.,"Alexandria, VA",319,314,247,3.0,6/17/2013,"I had dinner with my 12-year old son after his appointment at the allergist - he had to get skin tested so I promised him yummy delicousness after being so good at the appointment.  We showed up around 5 PM on a Tuesday and it wasn't packed; because it was gorgeous out, we sat outside on the patio to eat.  He had the pepperoni pizza, I ordered the chicken madeira (my absolute favorite thing there).  I have eaten at many different cheesecake factories and they have always been good - this one, though, was a little off.  My chicken was undercooked and tasted weird.  I ended up taking all of it home, but then I tossed it the next day because I was still a little queasy from eating it the night before.  My son's pizza was very good - he was impressed by it.  He got some sort of oreo cookie monstrosity of cheese cake for dessert and he really liked it.  I was pretty disappointed in the quality of my food, so that's the reason for the markdown.  It's definitely a nice addition to Potomac Mills, though, and I would probably consider eating there again should I be in that area."
Bella H.,"Lorton, VA",17,51,193,3.0,4/14/2013,"This is my first time at Cheescake in Woodbridge, I have been to the Fair Oaks location and this was a better experience. This review is between a 3 and 4 would have given 3.5 if that was an option.  First the appetizers are good and generous servings more than enough for sharing to  3-4 people with entrees. I over indulged in the apps and could not finish my entree.  Guac, good, got mild because of my sister who is not into spicy at all. She thinks tomatoes are spicy, medium would have been better, very fresh, tasty, and large. The crab wontons also good but not quite there, worthy trying but not amazing, standard and small, although you get about 10. I had the Baja Fish Tacos , fish was cod and very blah, served on soft tortilla with cabbage, cream and one small (tiny) slice of avacodo. Could have used pico or something, the tempura was strange and I opted for grilled, possibly should have gone for fried.  Cheesecake is very good, took some to come for the rest of my brood, but $8 a slice is excessive. Total meal for four with two sodas, one pina colada, one beer, two apps, one filet, fish tacos, fish and chips, omelete, and two pieces of cheesecake totaled $137.00, not bad. I will come back and luckily did not experience a wait as we went early around 4pm on a Saturday but would not wait more than 20 mins."

Greg S.,"Springfield, VA",7,18,,5.0,8/5/2013,"Had dinner last night -it was wonderful-attentive service-excellent food-if you should go to the Potomac Mill site  try to get ""Matt F."" as your wait staff member-he is excellent-very attentive and keeps you informed as your meal is prepared -was a huge help in packaging up our left overs--great guy-knows what he is doing at all times --personable and treats you as if you are his only table ---"
Marcus A.,"Woodbridge, VA",1,49,6,4.0,2/18/2014,"This is a great restaurant.  My wife and I have been here a couple of times and we have gotten some very good service.  They are very efficient when it comes to handling the timing of your meals from the bread/appetizers all the way to dessert.  That is important because you never want to feel rush while eating, which would be somewhat understandable considering the popularity of this location.   Look I get it, this is the Cheesecake Factory and a lot of people love their food, but I honestly wonder if this location couldn't have benefited from a larger site.  The location is certainly great being in front of Potomac Mills but this place is always packed and I just believe one of the only downsides to this place is not anticipating how large of an area they are serving.  For those who live off 95 in Prince William and Stafford Counties, this is close and one of the only locations accessible to those areas, so the amount of people coming to this place is insane.  In spite of that, they do a very good job controlling things.  The food has always been on point, great service and cleanliness.  I highly recommend this restaurant but I caution you, that you will likely have to wait to be served."
