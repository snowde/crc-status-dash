Victoria R.,"Oakton, VA",0,14,,3.0,11/9/2013,"Nice (but far too small - the place & the meal in the hugely oversized plates ) venue for fine dining...The waits to be seated are always over an hour on weekends, no reservations accepted :( This time, the greeting hostess was quite annoying in that she (with both me, my daughter later on, and another waiting group), when asked about how longer more the wait would be (as in an ""update"" - in case others waiting had cancelled/left), she would answer all of us, while frowning: ""You've only been waiting _____minutes"". We DID NOT ask her how long we had waited ! We asked her specifically HOW MUCH LONGER before our pagers may alert us (including the other folks waiting). The husband of the the other party - who were waiting next to us, commented to his wife the same I did to my daughter about the ""greeting"" hostess at the entrance. We couldn't help to converse with the couple after especially when she said THE SAME THING to my daughter later ! The food is tasty, daughter treated me & her daughter (my grand of course) to a delicious meal last week, after a wait of over an hour and a half. I ordered the Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Linguine, after we were seated (we were seated in an ""ok"" area but it was near a chilly entry/exit door, had to wear my jacket - even though we asked our attentive hostess/waitress to try to adjust the temperature(s) to no avail. Guess it was due to that door opening and closing. Because we had no other choice after the lengthy wait for a better area. I was disappointed in the actual amount of the meal, however, the plate itself was ENORMOUS ! So large, that the comparatively tiny amount of food was not warm to my liking. Also, there were only about maybe 6 small shrimp and the same amount of small pieces of chicken (tasty as they were) . Definitely not enough to share happily, but I was able to let my daughter & my G-Daughter have a little ""bite"". As far as their desserts, I personally don't like anything but authentic New York style cheesecake, which has a definite unlikeness in consistency & taste to the Cheesecake Factory brand. So unfair as it may, maybe I should not speak on it. But, I definitely consider Cheesecake Factory's desserts to be WAY overpriced for the size of the slice(s) or full-size cakes, etc...Suggest they close to renovate (if space is available) to build a larger place, train their greeters/seaters to be more polite in addressing the patrons' concerns & questions about the wait times. Our waitress was very nice, pleasant, personable & attentive - , we truly appreciated it in this day & age of rushed, purposefully inattentive (they avoid eye-contact, get attitudes when asked to get condiments or re-heat foods, etc.) & rude waiters & waitresses. Also which I am sure my daughter compensated her well w/her tip ! :) Only wish I had taken her name, I will return to do so, asap..."
