Amanda P.,"Wahiawā, HI",0,16,4,4.0,8/26/2016,"This was my first time at cheesecake factory so I can't compare it to any other locations but after all the hype I heard I was honestly disappointed. Regular menu items were okay at best. Menu is very long, lots to choose from but can be a hassle doing so. But definitely not worth the price being charged. I ordered the ribeye medium and it came to me over salted and well done. It was also very thin. The ribeye wasn't really tough but felt grainy when chewing. The meal came with mashed potatoes and fresh steamed green beans. Both were very good. My husband had the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp and did not like the shrimp. Like the steak the shrimp was overcooked.  Our waitress wasn't too attentive, we waited too long for our drinks and the bread that comes before the meal(which was ok at best). The Arnold Palmer was delicious, too bad drinks were only refilled once  and only after it being requested. Which took a while since we had to be on the lookout for the waitress.  I maintained 4 stars because I did like their cheesecake. And would come here for their other dessert items but not for an actual meal. The cheesecake wasn't too heavy and the manager was very accommodating concerning my food. I think perhaps some revision on staff members being more prompt to customers and food being cooked as it was ordered it could be a good place to eat all around. But for now I'd only come for desserts (at least at this location)"
Hannah H.,"Stafford, VA",0,35,5,1.0,11/12/2016,We won't be back. The lettace in my salad was wilted. Service was very slow and the food is very over priced.
Greg I.,"King George, VA",0,13,5,3.0,7/28/2017,"This place was an average chain restaurant location. We actually arrived at 10:30am but found out the sign posted said they opened at 11am. They actually opened the doors at 11:07. Everything was average, but the lamp at the table was caked in dust. Not like a few days of dust but like months of dust. But other than that, it wasn't great or bad. It was what I was expecting. Average chain restaurant."
Chunk C.,"Los Angeles, CA",114,107,58,5.0,3/25/2017,Calvin at the bar provides beyond excellent customer service. I must say he made my raspberry martinis amazing as well! I will be back :)
Sheila N.,"Fairfax, VA",135,223,1153,5.0,4/8/2015,"Open on Easter?  I was actually really surprised that they were open on Easter Sunday. I know that many restaurants are but didn't expect Cheesecake Factory to be one of them.  The food here is good, we ordered the quesadillas as an app and I stuck with my go to meal, Thai Lettuce Wraps! Nom Nom Nom.  We ordered some Margaritas and they were amazing! The waiter asked for them to add some Jose in there and boy did they had Jose! Haha... Yummmm!  We got to sit outside which was nice but it was just a tad bit windy. It's a great place for outside seating over the next couple months.  If you're ever at the mall, be sure to stop by here for a nice meal! Plan ahead though because you will have to wait for hours sometimes."
Alyssa L.,"Woodbridge, VA",48,107,23,2.0,3/15/2017,"The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the food has been consistently good. Other than that the whole experience sucked! The service was incredibly slow and it wasn't busy enough for that to be an excuse. My 99 year old grandmother has more pep to her step than this server did. She was so slow and inattentive my husband at one point had to get up and go stand in a main aisle just to get her attention. This has been my usual birthday dinner location, so my husband as usual brought up it was my birthday (mainly because this is the only opportunity for a birthday song and it makes my son incredibly happy to sing along) and I got no love what's so ever. So the last year of my 20's went out with no love.... thanks guys!"
Jessica B.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,14,12,5.0,1/11/2017,"I'm not sure why this has such bad reviews.. this is a very popular restaurant and located right outside the mall so of course there's going to be a lot of traffic (isn't that kinda a good thing? Shows people like it). The food is 95% of the time amazing, sometimes certain dishes may be slightly off but never bad per se. Staff had always been great to me.  Anyway, I felt like throwing that in there after seeing the bad reviews but I came here to say, I've been her plenty of times and always have a great experience with family and friends. Tonight I took a trip here and tired the Thai glazed salmon and it was AMAZING! So I just had to share. If you've ever had the avocado egg rolls and enjoy the sauce that comes with it, you will LOVE this! The sauces taste very similar if they are not the same thing :)"
Crissy R.,"Fort Worth, TX",15,37,33,1.0,6/13/2017,"Zero stars if possible, I actually love cheesecake factory, but this was the worst the food was not at all eatable. The cheesecake I was told ships in and it still was not like it is everywhere else around the country  I left hungry after a 40$ bill. Something is wrong with this cheesecake factory, they need help !!"
Christina Y.,"Ocean City, MD",0,15,6,1.0,2/28/2017,"We are currently here waiting for the check. We got here at 10pm, waited 10 mins before we saw our waiter. Ordered food right when the our waiter came.  He brought my food, but not my boyfriend's food. He didn't return to the table til we got his attention 15 mins later. We asked for him to check where his food was, but it was never sent. Asked for my food to be boxed and ordered silver diner to go. Felt really sad for my boyfriend since he was excited to go to cheesecake factory. Sat there for almost an hour."
Melinda M.,"Waldorf, MD",2,59,,3.0,5/3/2017,"My husband and I went here prior to shopping. It wasn't the greatest experience.  Something definitely went wrong from the wait time to be seated to ordering our meals and receiving them an hour or so later. My meal was prepared incorrectly as though it was put together b/c the correct ingredients weren't available.  I requested the manager who took care of the whole bill, which was the proper thing to do. I've been to this location previously but my most recent visit was a disaster."
Curtis K.,"San Diego, CA",50,260,271,4.0,6/6/2015,"Excellent service! Our waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly. All 6 of us didn't even have to open the menu. She stayed focused and gave great service despite having worked 16 hrs straight!  My Cajun jambalaya pasta came quick despite how busy it was. It was delicious, chicken was tender, shrimp was perfect. No complaints, just right. I ordered extra sauce like I always do cause I like my pasta extra saucy. The bacon burgers my buddies ordered were awesome too. They loved them.  Someone else at my table ordered tacos and said they weren't as good as normal, but I'm not sure what his standard of normal was. The mixed drinks were excellent. Cheesecake Factory normally does a great job with these. Not a fan of their beer choices though. I'd like to see craft beer here one day, but this a chain so the gotta stick to their menu. Overall a great experience."
Katy R.,"Waldorf, MD",111,259,277,2.0,7/25/2016,"I've never been to any Cheesecake Factory before this visit, as I don't really care for cheesecake, but I wanted to try the food because we were starving and wanted to try something new.  For the food, I will give 3 stars. We got a club sandwich with salad, and a bacon cheeseburger with fries. The club was kind of bland, I've had better at wawa. The cheeseburger and fries were good, and huge. I couldn't even finish half of the burger. The salad dressing wasn't good, supposed to be balsamic vinegarette but it was super sour.  Now, the service was terrible. Our server took forever to bring us bread, we told her we needed a couple of minutes to look over the menu and she disappeared for like 15 minutes. Then when she came back we wanted more bread, that took another 10 minutes. And, I never got a refill until it was time to ask for the check, which we had to get her attention for, also. And today was a 110 degree day I was thirsty!  I don't think I'll be back. I didn't even care to try the cheesecake at that point, mostly cause i was full but also because of all the wasted time we spent waiting on the server."
Franny S.,"Alexandria, VA",0,4,,1.0,2/28/2017,"After my last review, the Cheesecake Factory emailed me another apology and $25 gift card.  Last night, I used the gift card to make one final attempt at getting a grilled cheddar sandwich. Ordered sandwich over phone and when I asked if I could receive cheddar cheese instead of American, the woman taking my ordered exclaimed, ""Of course!""   Brought home my sandwich and yet again, it had American cheese instead.  At this point I was completely fed up, but a family member was livid and decided to call the restaurant and drive back there in order to pick up a correctly-made sandwich (I did not recommend doing this, as I had done it before, and only ended up with two incorrect sandwiches). The manager on duty even brought my family member to the back and showed off the cheeses they use, demonstrating the separation between cheese types.  I guess by having a manager come physically show a customer the ingredients, the kitchen staff finally understood, and for the first time since I can even remember, they made me a grilled cheddar sandwich. My family member was given a $15 gift card for having to go back to the store.   I am sorry, but this is beyond insanity. The fact that I have gone through so many different negative experiences with this restaurant, and have tried SO. MANY. TIMES. to get a GRILLED. CHEESE. SANDWICH. made with a different kind of cheese, makes ME seem crazy at this point, and I don't think that's right, at all.  I do not want your gift cards. I do not want free cheesecake. I do not want apologies. All I ever wanted was good service and the food that I ordered and you promised. It is beyond clear that, that is too much to ask. At this point, all I want is for you to understand that you STILL did not get things right, and your methods aren't working.  This past weekend, I visited the Tyson's Corner Cheesecake Factory and it was like entering a different world, in terms of food and service. I would definitely suggest making the trip and going somewhere other than this Woodbridge location."
Marc L.,"Dale City, VA",58,104,45,5.0,9/16/2016,"I came here with my whole family plus 2. So we are talking about nine people. Our waiter was pretty awesome. Every plate was perfect as we requested special orders to our liking. I ordered the fish tacos. They were perfect. Fresh, right amount of heat and plated perfect.  I ordered a mojito also. Now the drink was kind of weak but that's not the waiters fault.  I definitely will come back since their menu is massive"
Sumon A.,"Reston, VA",0,19,2,2.0,9/2/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but don't come to this one. The service is extremely slow and the tables are packed very close together. We were sitting no more then 2 feet away from an other table. The place is fairly small (for a Cheesecake Factory) and the food is average. Definitely don't recommend coming here."
Stephanie H.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,7,3,3.0,10/30/2016,"Love TCF,  Went and had an amazing time with my old coworkers,  our server was great..  my only disgust was that sometimes I wish they'd let us box up our own food..  Got up this morning only to notice there was hair in mine!!!!! Great app, great drink, but the hair in my food was utterly disgusting."
Rick S.,"Dumfries, VA",0,3,,1.0,4/27/2017,"Wished I had reviewed this site before going.  Like many of the complaints listed, the service was terrible, especially for the kind of money they charge. Last night, my wife took me there for my birthday because a friend suggested the Sheppard's Pie. Never got to taste it.... it took 30 minutes for our server to come back and take our food order.  A different person brought us our drink order and 20 minutes later, yet another person brought us the appetizer.  My wife had to ask that lady to tell our server we were ready to order. I decided to leave at that point, 30 minutes to take our order, how much more time to actually get the food. Joked with wife that at the speed (or lack of) our server, we'd be better off ordering breakfast so we could eat the right food for the right time of day.  What made things even more aggravating is that our server took the drink order from the table next to ours, and brought them their drinks, but failed to check on us.  Its like we didn't matter to her. First time to this location and undecided if I will try this one again.  Previous experiences were in Indiana and that was very enjoyable. To end on a positive note.  At least they post a sign indicating they are a ""gun free zone.""  As someone who does carry concealed, its disappointing when I go someplace and have to be asked to take my firearm out of store. (They don't want to tell the bad guys ""no guns in here"" but won't let you bring yours.)  I respect their choice and abide by the law.  The fact they have this policy has no influence on my choice to visit again or not."
Sophie G.,"Springfield, VA",0,17,7,3.0,8/16/2016,The cake is actually not too special but I can still eat them the next visit :) the crew wasnt too nice maybe because they are always tired lol  I tried two times already and still want to comeback but not really crazy about it
Dennis M.,"Lorton, VA",250,187,569,3.0,12/25/2015,"Came in on Christmas Eve for a drank. The place was surprisingly busy.  We ordered the usual drinks with a strawberry cheesecake.  The cheesecake was so delicious it pains me to say because I hate everything about The Cheesecake Factory's food.  (Refer to my Clarendon location review and for God's sake stay away from there!) We went in for just cake and beer so I thought there's no way that would go wrong.  Then the fat kid inside me said FEED ME!  So I ordered the Factory Nachos.  Huge mistake.  It was burned to oblivion and the cheese tasted like they couldn't ferment it properly so they just added actual mold they found on the floor.  Please don't order the Factory Nachos.  We were asked if we wanted a box since we only took a few bites I politely said no thank you.  The few bites also gave me wicked heartburn.  But that's not their fault.  The cheesecake, beer, and our bartender DeLante (sorry if I butchered the spelling) all get five stars!!! The Factory Nachos with poop get negative stars! This place gets 2 stars but since they were open on Christmas Eve till 11pm to feed me cake and booze, that's worth an extra star.  Seriously this time, I will never order actual food from The Cheesecake Factory tambien!  Beer and cake solimente!!!"
Monica W.,"Woodbridge, VA",71,22,5,2.0,2/27/2017,I was served a mystery meat that was supposed to be shrimp. If it were a mistake that would be one thing. But I alerted the waitress and they were actually trying to pass this craw fish or whatever it was off as shrimp. My sister tasted it and agreed it was not shrimp. But the bathrooms were totally disgusting! It made me doubt the cleanliness of the entire establishment. The only reason I gave them two stars instead of 1 is the cheesecake (as always) was delicious. (Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch)
