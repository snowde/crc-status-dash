Marcela C.,"Washington, DC",76,20,35,4.0,2/27/2016,"The food and the service are really good. The full size portions are decent enough to feed an eager eater, I just ate less than half, but always appreciate to have leftovers take home for a later bite or even dinner.  The strawberry lemonade, with complimentary refill was great too. The food was amazing and our waiter Bryan helped us to had a memorable Saturday lunch. Great service, very attentive and provided really good suggestions. The downside? The hostess told me that the waiting time to get a table was around 20 to 25 minutes, we ended waiting almost 1 hour."
Milhen E.,"Fort Worth, TX",5,157,26,5.0,7/29/2016,"My husband and I have been apart for 2 weeks now and we were looking for a place to sit and catch up. Their peach Bellini's are great! We had appetizers and drinks. He loved the cucumber lemonade.  We did not like the lobster artichoke dip, a little heavy but their calamari and crab cakes were really good.  Sitting outside made it the best"
Corey D.,"Dublin, CA",0,5,1,5.0,11/6/2016,"So i created this account just so i can write a review about Chris B., a waiter, who works at this location. Chris gave me and my gf some of the best customer service we have ever had. Keep up the great work Chris:)"
Kristy V.,"College Park, MD",8,57,112,2.0,5/3/2016,"I was really unpleasantly surprised with this Cheesecake Factory. For a chain, I didn't expect the food to be so different than the rest of the Cheesecake Factory's or to have the service be so awful either.  We ordered a lot of food so we weren't upset with how long it took to come out. However, we were upset with the food being undercooked and horrible. We ordered a lot of dishes with chicken and 2 of them were raw and had to be sent back along with a burger that was way over done.We had to send so much food back that we asked them to just take some of it off the bill because a lot of us had finished eating (cheesecake included) with the rest of the reordered food not arriving. We tried to be understanding however part of the reason why it took so long for the food to come out was because we had to flag down waiters to get the bad dishes taken back. We lost all hope when we saw our waiter just texting away at the bar rather than seeing if we were happy with the food.  Overall, I would suggest finding another Cheesecake Factory or an entirely other restaurant. The food that wasn't dangerous to eat was salt-ridden and almost unedible."
Dana R.,"Quantico, VA",69,180,9,3.0,1/12/2017,"My husband and I normally like The Cheesecake Factory. The food is good and we normally feel that it's priced fairly too. We normally take a slice of cheesecake home with us. This location is a different story though. It's always packed due to it's location, and the wait times are never reliable. Customer service is sub-par, resulting it long service times for food and drinks. Because the service kind of stinks, we never order anything extra: like more drinks, appetizers or even dessert to go. We know that if we do, it'll just make us wait there even more."
Terry O.,"Woodbridge, VA",8,9,,2.0,5/3/2017,Went there with the family 10 of us to celebrate a birthday and they  couldn't seat us. It was a Wednesday night. They only had 3 servers and the back was closed.  Went to Bahama breeze instead.
Adrienne M.,"Laurel, MD",961,274,1158,3.0,5/27/2014,"In my history with Cheesecake Factory, I have never been so insulted.  After rushing over from Bonefish Grille (read previous review), we came in to enjoy the brunt end of HH for my birthday. We sat at the bar and a friend waved to the waiter to usher him over to take our orders. Our waiter (I can't remember his name, but he was talk and thin with a pony tail and a pale face).  We all (5 of us) ordered drinks and since it was 6:30p, we ordered in twos. A couple if us, who didn't enjoys Bonefish's offerings, ordered food off the HH menu: corn cakes, southwestern rolls. A few times we looked for our waiter to to ask for things like: place settings (none if us had any) and to reorder. Once we had to stop another waiter to have him grab our waiter for us because we hadn't seen in 20 minutes prior.  At some given point, that annoying ""happy birthday"" song was requested to be sung. Well, minutes ticked on. We were finished eating and drinking and heard happy birthday sung to two other parties. I walked over to the cheesecake bar and chose one (this ain't the first time I didn't get a cake, might as well get it for myself). Finally a friend called over our waiter, ""Excuse me! Excuse me"" the waiter stopped and took one look at her face and said and I quote, ""Ooooooh Shoooooooooooooooooot!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" And walked away. Five minutes later, he came back with he colleagues and a small round of whip cream and chocolate. Really. My friends were pressed to call for the manager, but I was over it and the waiter didn't come back after the happy birthday song""   A friend of mine said, ""I knew not to come to this cheesecake factory! The last time I was here I found a bolt in my nachos!"" And there you have it.  Note: this is not an exaggeration, but a true depiction of the event. 3 stars for the food and drinks."
Simi K.,"Woodbridge, VA",2,10,,4.0,4/25/2016,"I include a lot of fiber in my diet! My hubby and I shared a Chicken, Asian lettuce 'taco'. There was choice of Chicken Mexican too. It was light and healthy and came with two dressings. A dish I have had in the past is the Falafel Salad Bowl! It is both delicious and light! We also shared Grilled Asparagus, its a side dish and contained four long spears. It was not oily. Really like these! The hostess, Evan, who, by the way, gave excellent service suggested the Veggie Melt sandwich as I told her that I eat bread only if there's a lot of fiber there, so she went to the kitchen and checked it for me!! I would suggest that the CF chefs include more tasty, vegetarian options. I mean, I don't want to come to a restaurant, eat a sandwich and say, ""O! I can make it a lot better than that!"" I always enjoy eating at the CF, though. All in all, a 4 to 4.5 star experience!!"
Allie C.,"Dumfries, VA",0,11,8,4.0,1/4/2017,I went for lunch today with my mom and we ordered 2 salads and a fried zucchini appetizer. The salads came out in less that 10 minutes but we never received the appetizer. Out waitress was very sweet and once we told her about the appetizer she took it off the bill and apologized. As with every Cheesecake Factory the menu is HUGE and they were busy even if it was a Wednesday for lunch.
Michael N.,"Lorton, VA",1,16,,5.0,6/28/2017,"We always get spoiled by the staff and management, and our most favorite server, Tracy.  This is a well-run and maintained restaurant.  Lots of vegetarian options."
Aisha M.,"Bristow, VA",0,5,,5.0,2/5/2017,"Prime location! Great Staff - Shout out to Alicia! Great Ambiance! Quality Food!  Great experience. Regardless of how busy the restaurant was, quick assistance to get us seated (even in the bar area) was provided. Greeted by courteous staff who delivered exceptional customer service. Food was to perfection and packaged in the same fashion! Well worth another visit.... :) Highly pleased!"
Gr8vette G.,"Lake Ridge, VA",2,242,1813,2.0,3/5/2016,"General Review: If there was one perfect word to describe this Cheesecake Factory location, it would be ""Average"" or ""Safe"". You have the average styling of every Cheesecake Factory out there. The people at the hostess station are not nice, but at least can get by with doing their job. The waiters are average and just passing the level of niceness where you may not be able to tell they are only here for the job and not enjoyment and to make acquaintances. The food tastes ok and is definitely cooked safe. In other words, there is noting elevated about it! The restaurant, in general, attracts a crowd, but that's because this is one of the only restaurants in Dale City to consistently cook their food correctly. If you avoid the weekends or have less than an hour wait, then you enjoyment here would be significantly better!  My Experience: I have been going to this Cheesecake Factory ever since its opening here. I have never had a above average meal. The last time I came here, I had a party of seven. They told me it would be an hour wait. No biggie. We ended up waiting almost an hour and a half. They were seating people who came in after us and we even saw a party that was with us leave. It was a bit frustrating how they were handling seating arrangements. The even more frustrating part was that they seated us at a six top booth with a chair at the end. It was frustrating because we went through the restaurant to try and figure out where they were seating us and those six top booths kept going empty and then being refilled by people who came in after us. We went on the assumption that they were going to join some tables together at the section with the booth and chairs. The waiter we had was fairly nice, but seemed to have a hard time understanding we had over a hour wait and were starving. We got our orders in fairly quickly, but even that had to have a long wait time attached to it. We waited about two hours for that meal to come out. We basically devoured that meal within 30 minutes and then we got our Cheesecake and ate that in a hour total. In total, we were at Cheesecake from around 12pm until 4:30pm. I almost had the chance to check into Cheesecake Factory again on Yelp! Would I ever bring back or recommend bringing a large party to Cheesecake Factory? Heck No! Unless this place was empty on the weekdays would I ever consider that choice again! I don't even think I would take a small party, let alone two people, on the weekend either. This Cheesecake Factory just proved to me they are definitely not ready for the big leagues!"
Nary A.,"San Clemente, CA",12,4,10,2.0,2/15/2015,"We normally love TCF and as a person who once worked at one, I would expect the service to be better. It's the day after Valentine's Day and it is the brunch rush - I get that. So why doesn't management? Have more people to run tables. Our waitress forgot to punch in our appetizers and it was quite a long wait for our meals. We had our daughters with us and at least they got their meals in a somewhat timely manner. Parents, dining with kids is tough and we know their patience is minimal. So when we got our meals, our kids were already done with theirs. 2 stars because it's Cheesecake Factory. DINE ON SLOW DAYS. YOU'LL GET BETTER SERVICE."
Stephanie F.,"Woodbridge, VA",73,2,,5.0,7/9/2017,"Love the food, love the service, hate the wait! Reservations or call ahead seating would be nice, especially for weekends."
Keenan T.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,2,,2.0,11/28/2016,"On November, 12, 2016, I called the Cheesecake Factory in Woodbridge, VA to place a to go order. I was directed to the bakery but then placed on hold for 28 minutes (no one ever answered the phone). Because the call was taking so long, I asked my boyfriend to call from his cell phone and he was place on hold for 15 minutes (no one answered the phone).  I called from my home phone and was placed on hold for 10 minutes (even after expressing that I had been on hold previously for several minutes).  No one answered the phone.  From the second phone, I called again and requested to speak to the manger.  I expressed my frustration and he covered the cost of my order.  When I went to pick up the food, the manager offered his apologizes and let me know the issue had been resolved.   However, on Sunday, November 27, my boyfriend call the restaurant to place a to-go order and was placed on hold.  After waiting for 15 minutes, he hung up and we ordered food from another restaurant.  Apparently, the issue has not been resolved.   I like the Cheesecake Factory, but this location continuously has slow and/or just bad service especially when ordering take out. I'm so disappointed that I'm actually taking time to write this review. The quality of service needs to be improved significantly."
Sabrina P.,"Stafford, VA",7,28,,3.0,9/18/2016,"Came here tonight with my mom, my dad, my brother, my sister, her boyfriend & my girlfriend and I was extremely underwhelmed.  Firstly, I came late. So when we were greeted by our server- (who did not tell me her name and I had to find out by looking at the ticket) she didn't really welcome us or even say hi. She just said ""what can I get y'all to drink."" Ok something I can get over for sure and definitely not upset at this point. However, after that there were many rude gestures and things she did throughout my experience there. Firstly, when she was taking our orders, she made absolutely no eye contact with us except looking at each one of us one time to ""signal"" that it was our turn to order. I ordered a salad and when I told her I wanted ranch instead of the balsamic vin- she did NOTHING to acknowledge that she heard me. She just kept writing then looked away to my mom signaling it was her turn. My mom said, excuse me I just wanted to make sure that you heard she wanted ranch? She looked at my mom and said ""yeah"" and that was it.  My brother and girlfriend both ordered a beer. His beer came out but she forgot my girlfriends so she did receive it a while later. When we were done ordering, she pretty much disappeared until our food came out. Once our food came out, my sister needed silverware so she gave it to her, asked if we needed anything, then essentially darted away. I asked for no tomatoes on my salad and I got tomatoes AND I HATE TOMATOES. I didn't have the chance to ask her to fix it because she never came back. Didn't see her again until the end when we needed boxes BUT she did box our food for us, so I will give her that.  When she asked if we wanted a dessert menu and we said yes, she went to grab one. When she dropped it off to us, she didn't say one thing. She literally dropped it off and walked away. She didn't even have the decency to say, ""here's the dessert menu"" I mean really? Are you serious? We ordered our desserts, ate them, boxed them up on our own and asked for the check. She slid the card, came back and gave a lousy ""thank you guys"" and walked away.   Thankfully I checked to see her name at the end (if I'm remembering correctly) which I don't want to put her on blast on Yelp- but just so I know to never ask for her when I go back. The sad things are 1) I'm a server myself so I know EXACTLY how service should be especially from an establishment like Cheesecake-AND I can tell the difference between a rough night, (which i always take into account before tipping/yelping) and just being straight up rude to someone who is PAYING YOU. 2) My mom knows to tip 20% (mostly from me being a server) so she still tipped between 19-20% because she felt bad not doing so. And 3) if she was having a bad night, or whatever- we would have understood but we ALL saw her laughing, smiling and being cheerful with other tables. Unacceptable and flat out rude. It makes me sad that my parents wanted to take us out to dinner and spend time with us and we were treated like we were a pain.  And honestly, I always always always give the benefit of the doubt to servers whenever I'm yelping, doing any kinds of surveys, or talking to management because at times I know how it is. But this was absolutely ridiculous. The food was excellent, and I WOULD go back because I know how cheesecake is supposed to be. But who knows.. Sorry."
Gertie S.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,45,17,3.0,9/24/2016,"Louisiana chicken pasta is delicious and makes for great leftovers the next day. The fried Mac and cheese is a great indulgence. The mashed potatoes are on point and typically make the dish. Wild blueberry cheesecake is one of my favorites but is seasonal. White chocolate raspberry cheesecake is another good one. While the food is usually good, the poor service and long waits typically keep us away."
Teressa L.,"Newcastle, WA",87,543,467,4.0,1/20/2014,"This one is located outside the Potomac Mills Mall area.  So at 3:30pm on a Sat it already had a 30 min wait.  However, we didn't wait that long to get our table.  Server was super friendly and stayed on top of whatever we needed.  The menu is so huge.  We tend to order the same things over and over b/c you couldn't ever really try it all without gaining 100 pounds.  ' My kids got kid meals.  And here, they are enough.   The side mac and cheese ROCKS.  We always get a side of it and fight over every bite.   The Chicken 'little' plate....has 8-10 tenders plus mashed potatoes and succotash.  The hubby and I split this and couldn't finish it.  I think next time we will just get 1 of these for all of us lol.  I will say, it's pricey but you get a lot of food.  Even the lunch portions could be shared.  Every person walking out had a bag of leftovers.   And the cheesecakes.  Our favorite is the Adam's peanut butter cup.  However, the Dulce de Leche yesterday was really yummy.  It's light compared to the Adam's flavor wise, but it was so tasty you wanted more and more.  The Oreo is my son's favorite and of course he had leftovers....these slices are huge portions and should be shared.  We ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough not knowing there were nuts on top.  Ended up bringing it home and someone will eat it today ;) The bathrooms are small for the size of this place and the crowds it brings.  As usual we had an excellent meal at this restaurant....they are very consistent in all locations we have visited."
January P.,"Suffolk, VA",230,164,328,3.0,1/13/2016,The cheesecake is amazing. They have s variety of flavors of cheesecake. You can even buy a whole cheesecake. As far as the food. I'm not a big fan. Not a wide enough variety of food selections on the menu. I just come here for the cheesecake.
Julie S.,"Springfield, VA",99,6,,1.0,5/25/2016,"I was really disappointed by this place. I enjoy going to cheesecake factory with my family, it was my first time going to this cheesecake factory. I typically get really good service, but this one was TERRIBLE! My bread was burnt, black burnt! and when I asked to get a new one they refused to give me another one, and told me that it was not burnt. All I wanted was for them to replace the bread. But apparently, that was too much to ask. I will not be returning to this cheesecake factory."
