Amilcar G.,"Washington, DC",391,6,2,3.0,9/6/2016,"First time every visiting the Cheesecake Factory. Wait was a bit of a downer (45 minutes on a Saturday night), but the food was great! If you can take a long wait- then I highly recommend. Try the red velvet cheesecake!"
Katarina H.,"Woodbridge, VA",38,5,2,2.0,3/29/2016,I wouldn't say the actual food is the best but the cheesecake is really good. Very slow and my sisters sliders looked gross and tasted bland as if they were frozen.
Shanique W.,"Woodbridge, VA",22,24,178,4.0,1/19/2016,"So who doesn't love cheesecake ?! Not only do they have a WIDE variety of cheesecakes but their food is really good too. The wait is pretty lengthy ... especially on Saturday nights. Our wait was about 70 mins for a table for 3. The staff was really courteous but service was a bit slow, which may happen from time to time when you're that busy. For an appetizer - be sure to try the Thai lettuce wraps; it was to die for! I also like the fact that they serve breakfast all day. I couldn't resist the create your own omelette :) For dessert I chose the salted caramel cheesecake which was really really sweet but amazing nonetheless. I'll be back to try all the other tempting cheesecakes for sure!"
Holly F.,"Stafford, VA",0,5,3,3.0,9/25/2016,"It is ok, nothing special. Food typical restaurant chain. Service could be much better!"
Ryan B.,"Washington, DC",220,534,205,4.0,10/14/2013,"They shouldn't even call it the Cheesecake Factory. You never make it to the cheesecake! That's because you will stuff (yes, stuff) your face is every delicious entry on the menu. You honestly can't go wrong.  The Grub: The Dark Bread (Free with Meal): A+ This honestly may be the best bread I've had. I literally ate a whole loaf on my own and had NO SHAME is requesting 4 more for the table. I ate so much bread I had no room for cheesecake.  The Chipotle Chicken Pasta ($11.95 lunch special): A This is a heap of flavorful chicken cooked in delicious vegis and a beautiful cheese. I am having it as leftovers for dinner tonight.  Huevos Rancheros ($11.95). D Nothing really special at all. When they say ""spicy ranchero sauce"" they mean ""not spicy at all.""  Cheesecake Kahlua® Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake: ($8) B AMAZING Cheesecake (don't get me wrong) but is it worth $8? No.  That means I have to go back and try more. My only complaint is the prices (expensive) though you get a load of food, and it's definitely worth the cost, so just know what you're getting yourself into."
Amanda M.,"Washington, DC",891,603,2931,4.0,9/1/2013,"Tuna Tataki salad was fresh and delicious. Outdoor seating was beautiful. Loved the music, very relaxing atmosphere."
Maria G.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,12,8,5.0,8/10/2016,"Ahh, the Cheesecake Factory...love it here! Been coming here for a while and I absolutely ADORE like ADORE their tacos. I've had the shrimp tacos along with the steak tacos, and I'm always satisfied. I could even skip the cheesecake (never do) for those delicious tacos. Definitely try em out, ya won't be sorry!"
Mohammad Sajjad H.,"Washington, DC",43,73,48,2.0,7/8/2016,"My usual experience with the Cheesecake Factory is awesome. Even if it has been in different parts of the world. The servings are awesome tasting and hearty, the service pretty helpful and the prices reasonable. This particular outlet though was extremely crowded and desperately understaffed which made the experience not so good. The waitress for us was trying her best but I think she was serving way too many tables to do a good job. Management should give them a break and hire more people. Customers will give 5 star reviews that the Cheesecake Factory deserves"
Camelia P.,"Jacksonville, NC",3,16,67,1.0,8/23/2015,"First and last time eating at this restaurant! Waited a long time for our order, my order was wrong even the fries were bad... We got our meal free, but it made me realize I won't go back to try The Cheese Cake Factory."
Graham B.,"Washington, DC",154,84,,4.0,6/1/2015,"Hungry after a long day of shopping, saw Cheesecake Factory and figured, ""Why not?"" It's the Cheesecake Factory, so you pretty much know what to expect: a phonebook-thick menu full of mostly mediocre offerings, average to above-average service, and really good cheesecake.  My general rule for chain restaurants with huge menus is to play it safe. Stick to the standards as these are the items that are ordered most often; the cooks have the most experience preparing them and the ingredients are likely to be fairly fresh as they have to be reordered regularly. Seafood (that isn't dipped in batter and fried) and pretty much anything healthy are always big no-nos in my book.  My girlfriend followed the play-it-safe rule and ordered the chicken piccata. I, fresh off my shopping high, decided to throw caution to the wind and have the firecracker salmon with a side of sweet potato fries. Almost immediately after placing the order, I began to have second thoughts. (Why didn't I just get the fettuccini alfredo like always?) But when the meals arrived, my fears were allayed.  My dish, salmon wrapped in spinach and fried in a crispy wonton, was pretty good. The sweet chile sauce that came with was a bit too saccharine for my blood, so I avoided it. Because it was an appetizer, I polished it off pretty quickly and spent the rest the time trying to put a dent in the humongous plate of fries that I received. The gf seemed happy with her meal. Of course the portion was huge, so she boxed up half to take home. The highlight of the meal would be put off for a few hours more. As always, I ordered a slice of strawberry cheesecake for the two of us to enjoy at home.  (I rarely dine at CF anymore, but I stop in at least once a month to grab a slice of cheesecake. Strawberry is my go-to, but their more exotic flavors are pretty good as well. Even now, I'm looking forward to pumpkin coming back in the fall. But I digress...) I ordinarily find CF to be a 3-star establishment, and this probably would have been a 3-star meal if not for our server (I wish I had remembered her name). She was sweet, professional, and seemed to always be around without hovering. My gf drinks water like a camel, and at many places, servers give up trying to keep her glass full. Not the case here, as her glass never went empty and all of our other needs were attended to as soon as they arrived. It's amazing how much the upgrade from adequate server to excellent server impacts the restaurant experience. Thanks mainly to the service, this experience exceeded expectations."
Aaron S.,"La Crosse, WI",66,97,53,4.0,5/6/2016,Been here a few times...large portions of good food. Great location...next door to Potomac Mills.
Jillery Ellen S.,"Durham, NC",21,365,125,5.0,3/25/2015,I love the Chinese Chix Salad with the noodles on top. The salad is always dressed perfectly. I have gotten the salad with avocado replacing the chicken. Also excellent. YUM!!! Great place. Great food.
Ja R.,"Manassas, VA",20,38,12,1.0,2/16/2016,Had late dinner with the family ... Our server was terrible .. Wanted eggs over easy got scramble instead ... That made the night ...
Maya D.,"Woodbridge, VA",7,23,,2.0,2/4/2015,"Well I usually enjoy TCF, but this last time was not good. We decided to come here on a weekday afternoon. The place was practically empty and we thought it would be nice since it's usually so crowded. First off, the hostess was not welcoming; I thought that was their job? Anywho...on to our table and the server was pleasant enough but she rarely checked in on us. Our food took way too long for some fried shrimp and fried chicken fingers. On top of that, our food was fried extremely hard, which made it very dry.  I'm not giving up on TCF, but the last time was not pleasant."
Adam B.,"Marysville, WA",6,70,,5.0,4/23/2016,Food is always amazing and this is the only place in Woodbridge that remembers what customer service is. Order anything on the menu and you cannot go wrong. Each store is the same anywhere you go. The value for your dollar is excellent.
Joyce M.,"Manchester, TN",2,12,12,3.0,7/3/2015,Food is great but the service was very slow.  I truly believe that our server forgot to input our order and simply states that they were very busy.  They need to have some kind of system in place where they follow up on orders placed.
Melissa H.,"Woodbridge, VA",19,23,23,4.0,5/7/2015,I have recently returned to Cheesecake since my previous experience I discussed on Yelp and I'm happy I gave them a second chance. Service had improved 150% since my first experience here. I've gotten to try a lot more menu options which have all been delicious. Everyone should try the fried mac and cheese.
Rose M.,"Detroit, MI",1240,229,635,4.0,4/8/2015,Typical Cheesecake Factory restaurant. I like the Dulce de Leche cheesecake or the Bananas Foster. Food and service is pretty good. Pretty long wait on the weekends and of course holidays.
Cindy L.,"Woodbridge, VA",4,90,18,3.0,3/7/2016,"Honestly, the best thing about Cheesecake Factory is... The cheesecake! I've tried the Most of the pasta and steak entrées and it's nothing impressive. The waiters are really nice and the restaurant and bathrooms are usually clean so that's a plus. The price for the food is a bit much so I don't go very often. Only if I'm in the mood for their delicious cheesecake!"
Stephanie J.,"Burke, VA",234,393,246,2.0,11/22/2014,"I am not a fan of the Cheesecake Factory and tonight's visit only served as reinforcement to that belief. I arrived at 5:30 pm to meet a friend and hoping that we were too early for the dinner rush but that was not the case. I elbowed my way to the hostess stand only to be told that the wait for a table would be at least 40 minutes. SMH... So I elbowed my way back through the crowd and over to the bar, which was also jammed packed with people. There was not a seat to be had nor hardly a place to stand. The only thing that kept me there was my promise to meet my friend. I sucked it up, took a deep breath and waited patiently to bell up to the bar hoping that a libation would take the edge off a smidge. All the while, the restaurant continued to fill with a hoard.  At long last, after over 50 minutes of waiting (I was originally told 40) we were seated. Our server was pleasant and greeted us quickly. He was wonderful, very personable, attentive and quick to deliver. I perused the vast, vast menu with a multitude of items that are almost entirely overpriced. I ordered the loaded baked potato soup and crab bites. Both items were OK, but considering that I lost an hour of my life waiting for a table, not entirely worth it.  We also had pumpkin and red velvet cheesecake and they were delicious but not good enough to warrant the wait.  OK food for an hour wait? No thanks Cheesecake Factory, I'll try the independent guy down the street."
