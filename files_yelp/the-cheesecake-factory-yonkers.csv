Shoshana R.,"Bronx, NY",30,94,303,4.0,12/24/2017,"I have visited this location multiple times (more then I care to admit) since it has opened. The mixed reviews are accurate, I have to admit there has been a noticeable decline in service and in some instances even food.  However, you have to give credit where credit is do. On this particular visit (12/22/17) my service was outstanding and that is due solely to BRANDON Q. This guy was on point. I usually come despite the service because it's close.  Customarily everyone here is blah blah and can careless about their jobs or more importantly the customers at times, but BRANDON was top notch and on point without being obnoxiously overbearing. To top it off it was during happy hour the weekend before Christmas when the volume of activity was noticeably increased quite a bit and he managed it all.  I was so impressed by the service Brandon Q. provided that I was moved to actually write a  review after all this time.  Full disclosure... this is not always the best location to visit. The time of day and week is a key factor in the type of service you may or may not receive."
Patricia H.,"Hartsdale, NY",1,61,,2.0,1/10/2018,"This Cheesecake Factory is not the best.   Interestingly enough, I had the same waitress who messed up the same order about two weeks earlier.  I crossed my fingers that she wouldn't mess it up this time. Well, not all wishes come true.    She was also on ""lunch break"" when the mess up happened.  She later said she entered it oddly in the computer... for the second time.  One of the people (who was not our waitress) delivering the food to our table had an attitude when I told her my order wasn't right.  I subbed my pasta for fries because I can't eat pasta.  Her eyes were rolling and she said that the kitchen didn't make that dish like that.... I told her I go there often so I know for a fact they do... She said well they change it daily... I just stared at her after that.  Eventually, she took the cue and took my food back to the kitchen.  It took 20+ minutes.  My date ate without me because I didn't want his food to get cold.  They comped our appetizer only because I asked to speak to a manager.   Our waiter then came back from lunch break and asked if we wanted cheesecake that was complimentary. We said EH OK.  She said she'd bring us a menu. She never did. Turns out when she realized the manager comped our appetizer - she just decided not to bring us a dessert menu.  Instead without us even saying a word - she said (20 minutes later), ""By the way, I just got the sense you didn't want the dessert so I decided not to bring the menu."" Again. I stared blankly.   It was just not a memorable experience.  I would think twice before going to this particular location. 2 stars for the other waitress who helped out while our waitress was on a lunch break and the fact that parking is comped."
TastyLadiesNY P.,"Bronx, NY",319,185,1477,4.0,12/2/2017,"After a day of Holiday shopping, a great dining spot at the Ridge Hill shopping center is The Cheesecake Factory (Yonkers, NY).  They have something for everyone!  All the food was great but the dish that stole our hearts and palates was the chicken Parmignia pizza!! The ""Crust"" was actually the chicken with a mound of spaghetti in the middle!  I know, it sounds odd, but it was delicious!!  Our other dishes of fried Mac and cheese, Mexican tortilla salad, spicy chipotle chicken sandwich and Parmesan garlic bread with marinara dipping sauce were all wonderful!!  The service was quick and professional even though it was crowded with seasonal shoppers!  Also with a whole dessert case to choose from, this dining experience was a gift of pleasures!"
Bryan G.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,82,931,3.0,10/15/2017,"The food we ordered is a bit salty to my taste. The staffs are nice to us even though you can see they are already tired maybe from a day long working here or from something else. I believe this branch is understaff... it really took awhile for our waitress to get back to us after getting our order. I noticed that she was going from one table to another and there were fewer than the usual number of staffs that night.  Nonetheless, my daughter always enjoy their cheesecakes so instead of 2 stars I'll give an extra star for this review."
Joseph F.,"Pelham, NY",105,173,187,4.0,12/31/2017,"As always the menu is huge, the food is good, calorie count is higher than expected, but overall my veggie burger was one of the best that I've ever had."
George G.,"Manhattan, NY",7,2,4,1.0,12/6/2017,"there was a time when they actually cleaned all the plates and utensils. Lately, this is what meets you."
Ji Min S.,"Rockland County, NY",220,20,113,2.0,10/2/2017,"I was very disappointed with how this location was managed on a night that i went. The staff did not appear to be prepared to service the crowd. In general I like the Cheese Cake Factory.  I do not like this location.  The wait time to be seated exceeded what the host provided.  The waitress made it clear that she was over worked and struggling to keep up with the crowd.  I had to ask for things multiple times it was provided.It took forever for food to come. Food was disappointing as well. We got chicken pasta which were uninspiring and lemon shrimp and pasta which fell short of enthralling, due to matted down pasta and the shrimp were too few and too small."
Gyaljen Nuru F.,"Mount Kisco, NY",2,51,83,2.0,7/31/2017,"While shopping near by store we decided to go for dinner here, we were greeted by host, then after giving name second host guided to the table. Nice and cold inside when it is hot out side, Ordered drinks and margarita came after 20 mnts, we almost finished our apt, Mexican wraps... I ordered Ribeye  steak than that was good, my son had steak taco and it was so so, ( I can get better taco on the street of queens  around Jackson Heights) and my wife had veg pasta. We expected food quality and service at least 3 Star but they failed. I just want to give 2 star for the ambience and deserts. No more cheese cake factory  It is better to go the restaurant where family owns and operates!!!"
Marc K.,"New Rochelle, NY",28,93,94,3.0,8/8/2017,"Waiter was attentive but not annoying  - Acoustics would have been fine but the music gave me a headache  It took forever for food to come  Food was actuallly just fine. Kid loved her pasta. We got chicken lettuce wraps which were uninspiring andl emon shrimp and pasta which fell short of enthralling, due to matted down pasta and the shrimp were too few and too small."
Daniel R.,"Bronx, NY",0,19,,1.0,12/19/2017,1 star because this is the second time I found bits of plastic wrapping in my food. I didn't eat my entree last night because of all the appetizers we ordered but I took it home. Now I'm eating it and there are pieces of plastic in it. Now I'm officially do with this place. The first time I nearly choked to death. That was at the CCF in white plains. 5 stars for our waitress Sam. Most friendly waitress we've had in a while from any restaurant!  She deserves a raise!
Quinton M.,"East Bronx, NY",50,56,34,3.0,5/31/2017,"This brand of restaurant is my wife's favorite so we decided to try this one in Ridge Hill mall. The service was good a tad improvement is needed. I forgot what my waiter name was he was very respectful and on point. The only thing I can say is don't assign a waiter if there break is coming up. The service was a sold 4 stars. The food is what makes it goes down. I ordered Southern fried catfish and it was ok. The fish itself was fried super hard it was burnt. The sides was mashed potatoes, green beans and sautéed spinach. The spinach had more flavor than the beans. The mashed potatoes had a whole freaking potato in it like it was so hard to push down on it. Why doesn't the hostess know if there are any deals? Why are there more than 5 hostess at the front just chatting?  I think I'll come back but just be mindful of the food and the price is ok for special occasions"
Jemell A.,"Middletown, NY",121,72,245,5.0,8/30/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory , were ever I travel I must find one and eat there. I'm very happy this location opened a few years ago. When I first came it wasn't as good as other locations I've been to but after a more recent visit I have to say they have stepped up there game to the Cheesecake Factory standard. The service is great and the food was delicious. It's located inside Ridge Hill mall, which is a fairly new outdoor mall in Yonkers. I recommend coming here if your in the area."
Laura W.,"WAKEFIELD, RI",72,83,1,4.0,10/5/2017,There's an improvement on the menu now.  There is a Happy Hour menu that offers all sorts of small bites.  Service is attentive.  One plus about this location of the Cheesecake Factory is that your parking is comped for the time you spend at the restaurant.  The restrooms do need some attention though.
Chrissy C.,"Yonkers, NY",642,65,183,1.0,8/30/2017,Very dissapointed today with EVERYTHING!! Service was very slow and dirty siverware not happy at all
Jonathan N.,"New York, NY",64,65,337,2.0,3/21/2017,"Even by chain restaurant standards this place is a disaster. The often talked about wait times are almost unbearable on weekends, but you can't be mad at a restaurant for being popular. As annoying as the wait times are, that has no bearing on my rating. What really bothers me is the level of incompetence when they're NOT busy. Missing complimentary bread, dirty dishes and silverware, fruit flies, slow kitchen, and waitstaff that go missing for extended periods of time. I wish I could say they food is their saving grace, but as expansive as their menu is, almost everything I've tried is over salted, over cream-sauced, over cooked, and over portioned. Some dishes worth trying: Louisiana Chicken Pasta Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps Hibachi Steak Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp Shrimp Scampi Some dishes to avoid: Carbonara Pasta Avocado Egg Rolls Steak Diane Chicken Madeira Chicken and Biscuits Southern Fried Catfish As you can see, I've eaten here more than I care to admit. It's almost like an abusive relationship, how I keep coming back and expecting them to change. I think I'm done with second chances for now though."
Sandra M.,"Pearl River, NY",78,38,84,2.0,4/17/2017,"I'm not one to give low ratings but this place really did it for me. We walked in at 5:30 on a Monday afternoon and see the restaurant not very full and yet we are asked to wait 20-25 minutes to get a table set up. The waiters got confused on who was serving us as we got approached by 2 people within 3 minutes to greet us.  We ordered a cocktail. We ordered some small plates and we got an item from the kids menu. We requested spaghetti and meatballs from the kids menu. We ended up with a kids mac n cheese after being told that they ran out of kid sized meatballs. ??? So why did the table over clearly had an adult entree of a spaghetti and meatballs? Why can't they give kids the adult sized meatballs? The bathroom was full of paper towels and toilet liners. There was no toilet paper in the restroom so I proceeded to the ladies at the front desk to ask them to help find someone who can help me out. She couldn't leave her post to get it for me but will do when her colleague returned. Guess what? She came back with her colleague and didn't get the toilet paper. I asked the other woman at the front desk and she said, oh you need toilet paper? I think my colleague went to get it. No she didn't. She was socializing with a male waiter! What? What?  Our server Mark was accommodating therefore the 2 stars.  Finally, we ordered Taylor tots that never came. They said it's because the order went to the wrong table. 20 min later it still hasn't arrived. We took it off the bill. No questions asked. I feel like the staff is ok with this kind of mess up and know how to take it off the bill for the customer.  Overall I think this Cheescake factory is understaffed and the management could delegate the staff to be more enthusiastic about working there. The people looked burned out and non-energized."
Anna R.,"Bronx, NY",41,39,2565,2.0,7/19/2017,"Had lunch here today, food was OK.  My pizza was cold and my buffalo wings were hard plus cold too. My server was nice and super fast with getting our orders. I think eating here two times was enough for me."
D R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,,1.0,12/3/2017,Go to yard house instead. Had to wait 1.5 hours for meal with three toddlers in tow. It wasn't even busy. How hard is it to make grilled cheese? Manager apologetic but server just looked at us like WE were the problem while clearly she forgot to put in the order. Life's too short to waste it at a factory for subpar cheesecake.
Ray H.,"Bronx, NY",102,124,46,5.0,3/1/2017,"Came here with a friend for dinner and I must say, I loved every minute of being here. The set up and vibe of this place definitely gives a relaxing feeling. The selection of food they have was very good, you're bound to find a dish that you like. The service here was also amazing. Our waitress had a smile on her face the entire time and made the time here very comfortable. I would definitely recommend coming here and giving this place a try."
Katie S.,"New York, NY",201,236,299,2.0,12/26/2016,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factory locations, and this is one of the worst. When it is crowded, service is incredibly slow.  My party of four spent almost 2 hours there for lunch today, and no one apologized for or even acknowledged our 35 minute wait between clearing our appetizers and delivering our entrees.  This location also has cleanliness issues. I encountered a piece of chocolate cheesecake on the floor on my walk to the bathroom, and then the bathroom itself was dirty (and there was no soap in the soap dispenser) despite the fact that I passed a bathroom attendant on her way out as I was entering.  The food itself seems to be on par with other Cheesecake Factory locations. Cheesecake options abound! Finally, we've ordered dinner to go from here on many occasions, and the pick up process is very slow. Because there's no separate pick up like for to go orders, you have to wait behind people making their cheesecake selections, which can take a long time. Food is also sometimes not ready in the window they've told you over the phone, so then you're stuck waiting while your car is parked in the to go area."
Ernest T.,"Parkchester, Bronx, NY",44,30,18,2.0,8/24/2017,I was very disappointed with how this location was managed on a Saturday night.  The staff did not appear to be prepared to service the crowd. In general I like the Cheese Cake Factory.  I do not like this location.  The wait time to be seated exceeded what the host provided.  The waitress made it clear that she was over worked and struggling to keep up with the crowd.  I had to ask for things multiple times it was provided.
Renee R.,"Manhattan, NY",3,69,90,1.0,7/5/2017,"Ok let's start off by saying this: my server was really nice and she was just simply overwhelmed with how busy the restaurant was. When I spoke to the Mgr he was a total moron who knew the place was bad with service and there was nothing he could do to manage it because he has no manager skills clearly. He didn't even give a crap when I told him your service in the kitchens are horrible. But let's begin. Went in with my friend and our 3 kids. Ordered kids meals an app plus our food. Kids meals were wrong they brung out only the protein that was ordered but everything else was wrong wrong and wrong. They get their food & it's loaded with pepper. Like rediculously spicy and peppery for 5 year olds (and my kid loves hot sauce) asked for ranch instead we get ketchup. His grilled chicken was pathetic it was like 4 bites of a chicken. By the time 2/3 kids were half way done the 3rd child meal comes along. Mind you weve been there 45m at this time My friend and I are waiting and waiting for our meals. After an hour we ate all our app and starting to really lose it. Hour 15 goes by kids are over the whole experience they're done eating and losing their patience. No crayons or anything to entertain while we painfully wait for our food. Hour and a half later we ask her wth where's the food?? She explains Someone took mine to the wrong table and had her salad sitting under a hot light for 30mins. Asked if we wanted to wait for them to remake mine obviously the answer was a hell no way!!! We pack my friends salad which was hot and sitting around for 30mins which I don't think she should have had to pay for. We paid for everything literally everything expect my meal since it never came. And that was that we waited 2 hour, we spent $75 on 3 kids meals which were garbage a wilted salad that sat waiting to be served for over 30mins and chips w/guac .  Thanks Cheesecake Factory that was the SHITTIEST EXPERIENCE EVERRRRRRRRR!!!! You really take the crown on that one. Next time we waste our drive from NYC to ridge hill we'll be sure to ignore your restaurant."
Hadassah B.,"Mt Vernon, NY",106,78,209,4.0,10/20/2017,This place gets a solid four for easily being the place I frequent the most in Westchester. Consistency is important to me.  This is not always the case at chain restaurants but this location does a great job of staying consistent. The fried mac & cheese is always good.  The orange chicken is always good.  The kale and quinoa salad is always good.  The strawberry martini is always good. The service is always good.
Cheska D.,"Yonkers, NY",55,4,2,2.0,10/6/2017,"Ate here for dinner with family. One thing I find so disappointing is that I go here because I love the fried calamari, it melts in your mouth. But the past few times I've visited the calamari is always over cooked! It is making me rethink if I should still consider going here because I haven't been enjoying my favorite calamari anymore."
Andrea G.,"Fresh Meadows, Queens, NY",299,111,566,5.0,4/29/2016,"I was a little worried coming here because of the reviews but my experience here was awesome. Me and a couple of friends came here for girls night and only had to wait 20 mins to be seated. Appetizers- We shared the advocado egg rolls and fried cheese which both were delicious. Drinks- I had the carribean cooler and a Sangria, my friend Annette had the blueberry mojito, my friend Janine had the blood orange mojito. All the drinks were delicious and not too strong.  Dinner- I had the crispy shrimp sandwich (loved it and would def get it again), Annette had the chicken piccata, Janine had the grilled steak tacos. Food was cooked well, came out in a timely manner and tasted great. The waiter Johan was extremely helpful since my friend Annette had a lot of questions lol he was very patient.  Dessert- Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake....omg!! Heaven!! We shared this because we were so full. Overall amazing experience and great night with my girls!!"
Wermy D.,"Yonkers, NY",0,22,32,5.0,12/2/2016,"Went to this place a little scare because of the reviews I seen.  Went Thursday night and is was very busy. Wait was 1/2 hour. Went for my daughter's bday with friends and family. Total of 7 people. The service was excellent, food was amazing . I don't like big chain restaurants and this one is excellent.  Will definitely go back. The food portions are good for two people. No one on my table was able to finished the entire dinner plate. Dessert portion is good for four people. The price was excellent. No one on my table complained about their food.  Excellent"
Jim M.,"Tuckahoe, NY",16,4,,1.0,5/14/2017,"Mothers Day, you'd think they'd have enough kitchen help for both eat in and take out orders.  You'd think very very wrong.  Insulting to both the customers and the Cheesecake Factory name.  Also, charging people before their pick up orders are even ready?  Utterly classless. And to top it all off we ordered two things and BOTH were wrong.  And not just a little wrong but hugely incomprehensibly wrong.  Utterly contemptible."
August E.,"Richmond, VA",5,216,1441,3.0,6/8/2017,"Cheesecake Factory always has good food and a wide variety. This was my first time visiting this location and I wasn't impressed my the slow service on a holiday weekend. The bar needed more bartenders to make drinks as each of my drinks orders took 15+ mins before the drinks arrived at our table. I've been to several locations and never experienced such slow service. Im sure I will not be returning to this location. However, the food was consistent with the restaurant brand."
Maria Z.,"Glendale, AZ",3,4,,5.0,10/1/2017,I had a doordash order and had a bit of a difficulty ordering. I believe it was the manager who called me and helped me through it. AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE. He was patient and helpful! I know how frustrating online order can be and he defianlty took care of me.
Carlos O.,"New York, NY",81,291,527,2.0,9/6/2016,"The first time i ever came to this location i was so impressed with everything. This has been my third time coming in here and every time i come in here it just gets worst. What happen to this place this use to be the best restaurant in the Ridge Hill strip. The costumer service was up to date back then, Even the food had a better taste.  The second time i went to this place it was packed. We still go a chance to sit fast and the service wasn't that great. The food i would expect if to be really good since the first time i loved it but i was not impressed. They drinks were awesome always are. Plus the dessert is always on point. The waitress changed for some reason i don't know who's running the show now but i can tell u this its not the great service they use to serve. The third time coming to this place i kind of did not want to come in here but though i give it a try. Again this place was so packed some people had hours standing out side to get seated. This is a great restaurant that has many locations world wide. A lot of people like myself are starting to complain about this place since before they had been served better. Which i hope you guys have a talk with the staff and every one behind the counter and make this place the place that it use to be."
Steve P.,"Concourse, Bronx, NY",131,11,15,1.0,2/26/2017,"I am usually not a harsh critique (You can tell by my past reviews of other places). But today's experience wasn't too pleasing.  Me and a party of 4 decide to come here after the movies. Out of all the places to eat in ridge hill, we decided that Cheesecake Factory would be the icing on the cake tonight.  However, we were wrong. We waited 40 minutes to be seated, only to be treated with horrible service. My pasta had a burned smell and taste to it. The manager (Will) was called over and he admitted to having a burned smell. He had us order another entree of their menu, and that too had a burned smell to it. He gave us a complimentary cheesecake, however I know that he could've done more for us.  Customer service and referrals go a long way. Specially in a table of 4. My girlfriend loved that spot. But after today's service we won't be eating here again."
Jerry L.,"New Rochelle, NY",125,242,918,3.0,2/6/2017,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory a few times before at different locations some years ago, being in Westchester now I knew there was a location in ridge hill I had a gift card and it was a special occasion, there is plenty of paid parking all around ridge hill, we came here on a Saturday around 6pm and it was packed just like we expected at a Cheesecake Factory location the wait was about 40 mins, the decor and design as always is great, we sat down as a party of 4, our waitress was nice but the service was ridiculously slow and I can't blame her she was going back and forth between a lot of tables, the menu is always expansive with a ton of options to choose from, the last time I went to Cheesecake Factory I remember thinking wow when did everything get so salty? This time was no different, we all had the same comment it felt like someone just opened a bottle of salt on top of all our meals, the lemonades were also super sweet, the portion sizes are always generous so we all took food to go, I'm not sure I'd go back to Cheesecake Factory, I can eat better and have better service in smaller locations"
Juanika L.,"Bronx, NY",76,25,47,4.0,4/10/2017,This is one of my favorite dishes. I had the parmesan-herb crusted chicken. It was very tasty and filling and also well done.
Dominek T.,"New York, NY",456,303,408,3.0,6/13/2016,"Never been a fan of Cheesecake Factory and the food never wow'd me.  How can a restaurant have over 50 entrees available and be able to perfect them all?  That still boggles my mind.  The establishment itself is beautiful and the staff was kind and on top of their serving game. I had the gumbo but it was super salty and what it is interesting is they don't de-vein their shrimp. As much as they charge that should of been a given. Never the less I would come back if someone asked me to join them, but I rather spend my money on locally owned restaurant than large corporate chains.   I recommend make a reservation if you plan to come with large groups and if it is only two of you then just plant yourself at the bar for faster service.   Also,  Cheesecake Factory validates your parking for the first two hours."
Wills M.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",5,14,33,4.0,9/1/2016,Came here after playing a charity basketball tournament for public school kids.  It was a Sunday and was crowded. They quoted us 30 minute wait time but we got seated in 15 minutes.  The waiter was very good and he was sharp on his game. He wad looking like James Harden on a weekend job.  I always start with avacado egg rolls cause it's my salad portion.  The Shepard Pie was kinda flat and the meat wad well done. It was still good. I'd definitely come back when in the area again.
Brian S.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",65,225,102,3.0,8/5/2016,"Personally, I don't see the merit in complaining about the wait time. Yes, anyone that's eaten at any other Cheesecake Factory knows that the wait time is long. It isn't exclusive to this location and its not the fault of the staff/owners that the restaurant is popular, especially on the weekends. In terms of food, everything is mostly good. My guilty-pleasure food is the mac&cheese burger, although I try not to have it too often, for obvious, artery-clogging reasons. Ive never personally had an issue with the service at this location. Everyone has been mostly pleasant. That being said, I usually avoid the high traffic (weekend) times so maybe I haven't encountered their staff when they're at their most stressed out."
Katrina M.,"Bronx, NY",123,28,43,4.0,8/3/2017,"When my mom and I arrived to this location, we were seated right away. We made sure to come a little past noon as this location has the tendency to get very crowded during a weekend afternoon. Our waitress was both courteous and helpful as she gave us plenty of ample time to decide our orders. The Cheesecake Factory is one of my absolute favorite restaurants as the menu options are many and the food (at least the entrees I've ordered) are always delicioso!  This time around, I ordered the Pasta with Shrimp and Sausage Lunch Special and my mom ordered the Meatloaf Lunch Special. The portion that I received versus my mom's plate was dispproprotionate! My portion truly looked like the lunch special while my mom's looked like the full on dinner entree! My meal was delicious but I didn't get to take any of it home like my mom did because it was significantly smaller! That would be my only complaint! Other than that, the service was wonderful and we even got a coupon for a complimentary slice of cheesecake for our next visit. Aww yeah!"
Kaleen H.,"Mount Vernon, NY",105,68,259,3.0,5/19/2016,"The nice thing about the Cheesecake Factory is the lovely decor and wide selection menu. However, my visit was not the best. We had a table of 8, our server forgot to bring my meal out. If she checked in with the table she would have realized but we had to stop another waiter to figure it out. My meal came out but only half of it. Mind you, I ordered shrimp and rice the easiest meal at the table. One of my friends ordered steak. My shrimp came out and then the waiter told me 30 secs for the rice, which was more like 8 mins. I was basically finished before my rice came out. She took over average lengths of time to come back to tend to the table. We even felt we were waiting too long to pay for our bill. And then to TOP IT ALL OFF, she took all of our parking receipts to validate it. Once we ALL got to the pay meter NONE of the tickets were validated."
Claudia S.,"Yonkers, NY",0,1,,1.0,11/11/2017,"I am a huge Cheesecake Factory fan, but I was so disappointed tonight! My BF and I sat for about 10 minutes before even being greeted by our server. The rest was a disaster. The appetizer came out before my ginger ale, which took about 20 minutes for me to get (then somehow got charged for 3 sodas). My Steak Diane was bleeding, although I ordered it well done. Sent it back, only to get it back still pink. No fuss, decided to stick with it anyway... it tasted like liver!! The mushrooms were good though. My boyfriend ordered the Bacon Bacon Burger, and everything was burnt (bun, patty, and bacon)... I mean charred. Even the fries were bad, as they were over salted (and I like salt). Horrible experience. Our server was nowhere to be found... never once asked if we needed anything or if everything was ok."
