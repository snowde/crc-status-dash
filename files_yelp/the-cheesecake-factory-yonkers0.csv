Camille W.,"New York, NY",25,17,3,3.0,5/3/2014,"Pretty good lunch and dinner selections. Good apps too. My favs are the Buffalo Chicken Blasts and fried Mac and cheese balls. I'm not a fan of the Sunday brunch. I usually just create my own omelette or something. As for the cheesecake, as a devoted Junior's lover, Cheesecake Factory loses. Don't try to compare Cheesecake Factory to Junior's because there is no comparison.  Wait staff were friendly and accommodating.  Bottom line -- Go for the food, not the cheesecake."
Christie B.,"Yonkers, NY",65,42,11,4.0,5/29/2015,"I like this place been here about 4/5 times just don't sit near the kitchen very loud with dishes breaking and bashing against each other. Only thing I hate is the wait on a bust night weekends forgot it you aren't getting into this place for hours. Front staff could be a bit nicer though, also the bathrooms are soooo dark and dirty!!! But for the prices the foods good they give huge portions."
Nelson C.,"Bronx, NY",0,6,,1.0,1/30/2014,"Is it possible to give zero stars? This place is not worthy of the Cheesecake Factory name. After the first time I was here and the service was slow on a weekday afternoon I thought that's fine. Second time it took 20 minutes to get our bill after asking for it. Third time we called our order in 20 minutes ahead of time and when my girlfriend went in to pick it up. It wasn't ready. In fact, there was a lady ahead of her waiting to just pick up her order that was on the counter. They both waited 10 minutes before someone helped them. Apparently there were 3 people working and two were just sitting there chatting while one was actually busting her butt working. When we get home my ahi tuna salad with avocado has no avocado and has about 4 pieces of lettuce. I thought this was suppose to be a salad not garnish. I find it funny that I come on here to write a bad review only to discover this place is already getting lambasted. Management needs to be replaced. People need to stop going here until they do so."
Douglas W.,"Mount Vernon, NY",3,65,51,1.0,10/31/2013,Worst Service by Far!  I don't know why I even bother. I eat at  Cheesecake Factory about 5 times a month. This location is nothing like White Plains. The service here is the ABSOLUTE  1st visit to this location. I had to stop and ask for help after they walked by us for about 30 minutes. When my fried Macaroni cheese balls shows up another half hr later the inside was completely frozen. Strike 1.  2nd try I got a waiter after about 10minutes ok. The ordered Macaroni Cheese Balls again this time they were definitely old. Cheese tasted old. Sauce was hard. Just plain horrible. And of course the Waiter was no where to be found when u need him.  Last night same as usual. On a Wednesday night with maybe 5 couples in the restaurant. Still No service. Drinks took 20 minutes. Appetizers 30. The medium steak was completely burnt. This place needs to close it's doors.  Do yourself a favor and drive to White Plains. You will be seated served and out the door before anyone says hello at Ridge Hill.
Ethina E.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,22,,5.0,8/23/2015,I frequent this spot at least once a month and I'm always pleased. The drink and food menu is so long I could eat here every day forever and still not have tried everything. Which is awesome. The waiters are all always pretty happy and nice. The cake is great hence the name. I have no complaints. I will continue to come back here.
Mara M.,"New York, NY",1,5,5,4.0,1/17/2014,"The original plan for lunch was to seek out a steak that was indicative of a masterpiece. There were many options that were available in the vicinity and there were some along the drive to the Ridge Hill Mall in Yonkers.  Now at the entrance of this very underestimated mall sits another underestimated quiet little spot, The Cheesecake Factory!  I have NEVER dined at a Cheesecake Factory, so this WAS an experience! I ordered asparagus and spinach alongside the rib-eye, black & blue to add a little difficulty to the equation. I must admit although I have been to MANY steakhouses, this steak was the epitome of what I was looking for!  lt's definitely a great place for family and it's a great place for friends; it has a very conducive atmosphere and the service was impeccable. Thank YOU Mr. Benedetto for such great service! I will return for another *Flying Gorilla! ( * have it for dessert)"
Christina R.,"New York, NY",27,37,33,4.0,4/14/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is something thats foreign to city dwellers in NY since we dont have one, but when I do come across one i make it a point to go. This one (like all of them im sure) has a bit of a wait time depending on what time you go. This particular time i went on a Sunday for lunch. Luckily the wait was only about 10 minutes. We ordered the Skinny Asian Salad which is delish! Of all the food i've tried at Cheesecake factory i can't say i've every had a bad dish. The bread they give you when you are seated is pretty damn good too."
Terrence B.,"West Bronx, NY",0,20,18,2.0,5/17/2015,The food was alright. Small portions and it took a while for sitting and to get the food.
Jessie J.,"Manhattan, NY",55,107,231,2.0,6/28/2013,"Our waitress was terrible !!!!! We had to wait about 20 minutes for our bread to come while we clearly watched her stand in the kitchen and chat with another worker. My bf had some brown stuff in his water. Had to ask another waiter to replace it since our was gone most of the time.  The cheese on my sandwich was cold and not melted, I asked if they could melt it a little bit, and that took roughly another 8 minutes.  It's such a shame that a beautiful place like this has so many terrible reviews. Not planning on returning ! Terrible service."
Carlos H.,"White Plains, NY",15,64,230,3.0,10/26/2014,Great food lots to choose from good prices friendly staff Awsome deserts lots of drinks from liqueur and soft drinks
Nick L.,"Bronx, NY",1,27,1,1.0,11/29/2013,"This location needs major HELP! Been to cheesecake in multiple states and this is the worst by far and here is why (i figured this out after going three time purposely and observing) SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE... Food is similar to all the rest of cheesecake but everything has to do with the service since everything is streamlined and if the waiter/tress messes up than you are DONE! It starts with first impression: seating and getting the drink order--hostesses are always loaded with attitude and they just seem to hate you when they see you instead of welcoming you.  Then comes the bread and drink order THEY ARE ALWAYS LATE and these two never come in time. Also i realized that the bus person never ever cleans the table good just wipes it and sets it up.  One star because the food is like everywhere else and everything thats going on at this location has to do with the service not with the food. If the food is late which is always the case, it WAIT staff fault ALWAYS.... I dont know if the staff works in tips but boy they act like they hate their jobs and their white uniforms are always disgusting."
Lori D.,"Chapel Hill, NC",1,10,4,1.0,12/31/2013,"Terrible service AND food!  We went last night (a Monday night - 2 adults, 2 children), arriving at 6:15 and were told it would be a 40 minute wait.  That's a long time for 2 hungry children to wait but we decided to stick it out.  ONE HOUR later, our buzzer finally went off.  We were sat in the bar, about 10 feet from where we waited for an hour. The server (Kai M.), although he tried to be nice, was AWFUL.  We had to ask for our beverages 3 times.  Only one of our two apps came out (the sweet potato fries, which were the best things we tried that night).  Twenty minutes later, our main meal came out - still no second app (the shrimp spring rolls).  The steak Diane was ordered medium rare and came out well done.  The mashed potatoes were like a mountain of cold paste.  The mahi mahi was horribly overcooked - we were so frustrated, we sent that back and decided to just wait for the spring rolls as a main dish.  Once the server realized how frustrated we were, he avoided us like the plague.  The spring rolls finally arrived (still waiting for our beverages) and were actually pretty good.   To get the check, we actually had to stand up and put our coats on and just stand there, hoping the server would walk by.  Upon receiving the bill, the mahi (which we did not eat) was still on the bill, so we had to wait for it to be removed.   Awful awful experience here which was very disappointing, as we rarely get a family night out like that.  As a former server myself (having done it for ten years when I was younger), I can say that this is clearly a terribly managed restaurant in need of radical change."
Giovanni O.,"New York, NY",0,402,83,1.0,9/8/2013,"The only completely negative review I have written. We love Cheesecake Factory and they usually have an impressive corporate control with consistency from location to location. This location is a disgrace and it is unbelievable that Cheesecake Factory allows it to continue. We have been here three times and each time we were disappointed that we gave them another chance. Last time we went we only wanted dessert after a movie and were ignored for over 30 minutes, even by managers. The time before, our food took rediculously long; our waitress was upset we bothered her to let her know that our order was incorrect; and they brought us raw asparagus... Literally... Raw asparagus... I cook... These asparagus never saw a heat source, I don't know that they were even washed."
Jerry C.,"Manhattan, NY",118,22,23,3.0,7/17/2015,"I figure this one would be like the 1 in longlisand but it wasn't we had just came from a jog & it was my boyfriends birthday we figured we stop by since we wouldn't see each other for the rest of the day, the ppl who sat us down put us by the kitchen  & gave us dirty looks .. the waitress we got was rude and looked at me like I was crazy for wanting to add mushrooms & garlic  on my Alfredo every time I was drinking my drink that wasn't even 1/2 way done she would only take my drink away no one else's at the table my friends & boyfriend thought it was funny as well. The food was great at least but I prefer the 1 in long Island which shows more respect  to customers."
Jacqueline G.,"Foxhurst, NY",47,5,11,5.0,7/15/2015,"First I want to start by saying everything from the appetizer down to the dessert it was amazing. What made our lunch even more better way our server. He was so awesome, attentive, nice and knew where to guide me when it came to my pasta. I would define tho recommend this place to anyone in the area and I would most definitely come back soon."
George P.,"Jamaica, NY",19,5,,1.0,4/16/2015,"First Time There. Wanted to see and taste what the hype was all about. Wait time was pretty long. I get it, easter Sunday cool. We decided to sit outside. I was encouraged to sit outside because I saw they had heating lamps at each table. Once we sat down we where told the lamps don't work. Fine. We go thru the menu and order appetizers. Waiter comes back 5 minutes later and we order our main meal. Cool. Wait time for the food was long. Again Easter Sunday i get it. But why not bring all the appetizers out in one shot. Instead they bought one appetizer. 10 minutes later another one. Then a main meal came out, then another appetizer. Some of us had food, some of us didn't. Whats the point of an appetizer if it comes out with the main meal. Not cool at all. Think the staff looked a bit overwhelmed. I think i'll skip this place in the future."
Michelle S.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,141,69,4.0,12/31/2013,I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory before so first time for everything. I assumed it would be like juniors with okay food great dessert. I ended up loving it! My friend had the petit filet mignon and I had a bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato French fries. The starter bread was good as a starch lover. Pumpernickel?  The service was good and decor a bit much but it was classier than I expected for a mid range restaurant. Everything was well seasoned and the portions were worth the price tag. My only complaint would be the hostess who seemed to hate life. I got a white caramel macadamia but cheesecake and caramel hot cocoa to go. The cocoa was eh but dessert was really good. No juniors but still really good.
Leviah D.,"Manhattan, NY",52,29,26,3.0,3/9/2013,I emailed the Cheesecake Factory about this experience...& this morning I got a call from Mike who is a manager at this particular restaurant... He asked me about my experience and offered his sincere apologies.... we even shared a few laughs about it.... Then he offered to send me a gift card in addition to his apologies...he also asked if I would consider coming back to his restaurant to dine in the future...I told him that I would give him a second chance....thx Mike I like...
George B.,"Bronx, NY",164,159,57,3.0,12/14/2011,"This Cheesecake Factory is no different from any other CF that I've been too.  It brings along its familiar popular crowds on the weekends, yet this CF seems to be smaller than others, so do expect 45 mins-1 hour waits for a table for 2. Same great service, same great taste. Low rating due to size."
