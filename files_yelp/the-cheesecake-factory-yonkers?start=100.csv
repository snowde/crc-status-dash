Jennie C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",5,2,1,1.0,7/4/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but be prepared for this location to try your patience. 30 mins for an app, cold entrees, it goes on and on. Shame on me for continuing to give second chances. Ugh!"
Angie C.,"Yonkers, NY",0,2,,5.0,9/23/2017,i love ya'll. dont even get me started on the fettuccine alfredo. oh my lord. its so bomb. and the CHEESECAKE. i eat that for breakfast lunch dinner sometimes at 3 am. its so good. the lady at the front desk told me you deliver now and that turned my very bad day upside down so thank you cheesecake factory for changing my life for the better. love u 5 stars 10/10 will have my wedding catered by you
Purpose T.,"Hillside, NJ",1159,301,100,3.0,11/7/2014,"Food is great, as always. Service is decent. But the false advertisement for the strawberry shortcake dessert was so beyond disappointing. I've always wanted to try it so I finally opted to order it and I was actually a little pissed off at what it turned out to be. Its NOT A CAKE AT ALL!!! When i brought it to our server's attention he's like oh yeah its a sugar muffin actually. That's not even what the menu description says. False advertisement!!! I kindly told him to take the dessert back & it was taken off of our bill. AND the server agreed with me that its stupid and ridiculous that its not actually what its supposed to be.  So don't, I repeat, don't order that dessert unless you really just want strawberries with whipped cream, ice cream....oh and underneath all of that, a hard nasty sugar muffin! Smh"
Jose G.,"Poulsbo, WA",93,2,,1.0,6/27/2016,"Every time I go here they give me an approximate wait time, then I wait double that and end up only eating here half the time so take this with a grain of salt but this was the last straw.  If you're out to eat food and can survive a couple of hours of wait time to eat and aren't at risk of starving then the cheesecake factory is for you, otherwise please go to one of the many other restaraunts at Ridge Hill. The food is only just alright anyway so it's not like you're missing out."
D D.,"Bronx, NY",0,3,,1.0,5/3/2017,"I went here Sunday night around 8pm with hubby. We got a table right away it was not very busy. We were seated and sat and sat for over 10 minutes no one acknowledged us or came to our table,so I went to the hostess and asked her if  someone was assigned to us???She said yes there should be and she walked off  to find out. A minute later this waiter comes over and says I will be your waiter now. I was already aggravated but was glad that we were finally getting service. The waiter took our drink orders and it took like 15 more minutes to get the drinks he forgot our water. He was walking around as if he had no energy or just didn't want to be there,he looked like he could not pick up his feet while walking very lazy! He brought the bread and took our food order. the manager comes over to tell me there is a problem with my order not the right sauce, I said thats fine I will take it.That food took 30 minutes to come and when it came it was cold and did not taste good. The waiter sucked he was sooo slow and very fake...Really a big disappointment my favorite restaurant is cheesecake factory  but these chains are hiring the worst people. I had a similar experience in the White plains location although they are a little better than this Yonkers dump!"
Lauren M.,"Bronx, NY",96,5,1,1.0,10/26/2016,Terrible service. Inattentive staff...long wait for the bill just for there to be issues with it. I will not return.
Michael N.,"New York, NY",1,70,5,5.0,2/25/2016,"I enjoyed this cheesecake factory. Just like any other location you'd go to in terms of the food, service and restaurant atmosphere  I went here over a year ago so I don't remember every detail, but I don't recall any problems I had with the food or service. I think this is a great place to go for dinner if you want other things to do since its located in a shopping center, so you can go shopping or watch a movie before or after your meal, very convenient  Only con I have is the shopping center, there's a $3 parking fee that cant be bypassed, which is not good if you just want to go in and out to pick something up"
Aaron M.,"Dobbs Ferry, NY",0,3,,5.0,10/23/2016,"Overall, I was pleased with this restaurant. Probably the best part about ridge hill! The food was amazing, and the kids loved it too! Great variety on everything, especially the cheesecakes. The playground outside was very convenient. Kids can get their energy out before they sit down and eat. Indoor and outdoor seating, very atmospheric. I have a feeling I'll come back again - with a bigger tip!"
June G.,"Manhattan, NY",36,36,10,2.0,9/12/2015,"While I absolutely LOVE the Cheesecake Factory brand, including Grand Lux Cafe, the location at Ridge Hill is abysmal. Initially, I thought their issues could be worked out over time, because every new establishment has to work out its kinks, but this location has now been operational for years. The Good - (1) the Ridge Hill location is super convenient and Cheesecake Factory is one of two businesses in the plaza that validate parking. (2) when the kitchen is on, they serve the usual Cheesecake Factory food well. (3) the bar seating is first come, first serve so often you can avoid the wait The Bad - (1) the kitchen is terribly inconsistent. Cheesecake Factory rests its entire reputation on its machine-like functionality and consistent quality across various locations. THIS location, however, is the only one that I've visited (of many nationwide) in which I never know what I'm going to get on my plate. They've messed up everything from basic Steamed Edamame to signature dishes like Chicken Madeira. (2) Management is constantly turning over so whenever I've had issues, the excuse is ""we have a new [insert restaurant unit] manager"" (3) they seem to be understaffed or don't manage the staffing schedule well - everything is a wait, even when they open.  Ultimately, this place will do business because of The Cheesecake Factory reputation BUT do not go expecting the typical CF experience or you'll be sorely disappointed"
Bryan R.,"Bronx, NY",208,58,160,1.0,3/15/2015,"So we decided to give this CF another shot after the last debacle. I was really in the mood for the Crispy Cuban Rolls and we were shopping nearby. First thing that made me skeptical was the fruit fly that invited itself to our table.  It doesn't seem so busy as there are many tables available yet there was a 50 minutes wait. No problem, we get a chance to do some more shopping while we wait.  We're greeted by our server who is very pleasant and brought us our appetizers in a flash. I'm eating my Crispy Cuban Rolls. They're quite flakey but at the same time very greasy.  They're not greasy enough for me not to dig in! As I take a bite into the third roll, I hurt my tooth. There is something unidentifiable in the roll. It appeared to be edible but not as hard as it was. I pointed it out to the server who brought a manager immediately. Apparently it was a piece of the pork's cartilage that the manager ""Mike"" explained should have never been there and agreed he too would be grossed out if it happened to him.  If it weren't for the server ""Johan"", I would've left immediately. I decided to stay and try the Tomato Basil Pasta. It wasn't that bad but it was definitely prettier than it was tasty.  This may very well be our last time here."
Giulio S.,"Hawthorne, NY",0,7,,1.0,4/10/2017,Horrible service!!! All around the manger was useless is excuse was I'm only filling in haha
Mark T.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",15,177,41,1.0,10/5/2015,"We went to this Cheesecake location on 10/03/15. First, we were told the wait was 30 minutes for a table for 2. It ended up being close to an hour. Second, we took a seat at the bar to have a drink before being seated. The beer was stale and flat AND I WAS INFORMED it was just changed. Worst beer I've had at a restaurant. This means either the system is filthy (most likely) or the beer is just old. Third, take a look at the spoon. It is filthy!!! Forth, we ordered buffalo chicken strips and ended up taking them home. We asked for blue cheese dressing on the side to go. They ACTUALLY threw the open blue cheese dressing in the small glass holder in the bag! LOOK AT THE pic! Disgusting ! Never eat here unless it's free or a gift certificate!"
Tina K.,"Edenwald, Bronx, NY",22,60,370,3.0,1/16/2016,"I've bin at this location at least twice already since ridge-hill mall was open for BI and never any issues, so far so good. Weekends everywhere tends to have a little wait for seating and 20mins wasn't unheard off, but the service from the bartenders was so great while we waited, we decided to pass up the wait and eat right there. Like I said... All was good, fast, polite, and constant service, with good convo and a couple games on big screen worked:)). We enjoyed the outing as well as the convenience of shopping feet away. Only Suggestion I have is... Careful on the floors, very slippery or greasy feeling. I kept paying attention as I was walking just to make sure I didn't slip and fall. I'd return again in another shopping adventure."
Jasmin O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,3,2.0,10/21/2016,"Last night was date night for my husband and I. We ordered appetizers and our main meal. When I realized I was already full I asked the waiter if he can cancel my meal and he had to get the manager who then told me no but I can take it to go...Now listen I understand if the food was done or even close to being ready but I still had to wait 14 minutes for it to arrive which means it wasnt done and they could have taken that off my bill which I found odd. On top of that they sat us next to a woman who was coughing up a lung and on the other side of us a woman who kept sneezing and wiping her hands on her pants. I was so grossed out that I didnt even want to order dessert. I wont come here again, although our waiter was a sweetheart but I was not happy. What happened to customer is always right? I was very dissapointed."
Stephanie D.,"Bronx, NY",19,30,14,3.0,9/20/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a hit or miss for me. The menu is so broad, that they can't specifically be ""great"" at something.. Well unless it's their cheesecake that is (which I love.) Now as for the food, I will say I like their steak Diane and lemon angel hair pasta with shrimp.  I didn't know they served brunch, so me and friend checked it out. Our waiter was super nice, I believe waiters leave a lasting impression for every customer in ever wanting to return back, and that's something that keeps me coming back to the restaurant, their great customer service. Back to the brunch, it was really nothing special. I had what a chorizo omelette (forgot the actual name) but needless to say, I was looking for chorizo in my omelette, they were tiny burn pieces, that tasted like char, and the smallest pieces of avacado. I ordered pancakes as well which were mediocre, what made it any special was the buttermilk syrup they served with it. Overall, I won't be back for brunch, it wasn't anything special. You're better off going to IHOP.3 stars for awesome customer service!"
Cessamina P.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,7,4.0,2/21/2016,"Went to CCF on a busy Friday night and waited 30min for a table of 4. Pretty noisy, but I was there to eat! Kids ordered the Tex Mex eggrolls with spicy chicken, corn, black beans, peppers, onions and melted cheese which came with a side of avocado cream and salsa. Came out piping hot and deliciously flavorful. We were nearly full from eating that dish alone. Hubby ordered California Avocado salad, which was a fair large size for the dish. For dinner, he ordered the California Cheesesteak, OMG! Sooo good- thinly sliced steak with sautéed mushrooms, onions, peppers and cheese on a soft toasted sourdough loaf. Of course, with a side of fries.  Avocado Eggrolls (appetizer) - They were crisp wrapper filled eggrolls with fried avocado (was so savory) with tomato, red onion and cilantro. I ordered the Jamaican black pepper shrimp.  OMGGG! I was slightly overwhelmed with the generous amount of sautéed spicy shrimp on my plate, marinated with the mouth watering Jamaican spicy sauce. Other side dishes it was served were brown rice (my preference, but white was avail), black beans, and sweet plantains and cool mango salsa. I couldn't finish my plate, but ate it the next day and I swear it tasted even better.  We ended up taking ALL the food home actually, but couldn't leave without ordering dessert! We ordered the Carrot Cake Cheesecake - carrot cake and cheesecake together, with cream cheese icing and almonds and a Carrot Cake -layers carrot cake and cream cheese icing with shreds of carrots, spices, and faint minuscule-like pieces of pineapple. Served with an unselfish heap of whipped cream. Definitely money well-spent. A great experience for a foodie like me"
Katherine M.,"Yonkers, NY",47,17,30,4.0,2/15/2015,Pro:Delicious food  Con: one hour wait (Sunday) Ordered Alfredo Fettuccine with sundried tomatoes and chicken. It was delicious however I noticed they are serving less than before. Also I noticed they were scarce on the bread. Drink: passion fruit margarita. It was strong but once it iced out it was very refreshing and satisfying.  All for drinks were well served except for the ultimate margarita... So much ice. My dad ordered another one and that one came more than 3/4 ice almost reaching the top with ice.
Candace G.,"New Rochelle, NY",42,38,,2.0,5/8/2016,"We were a party of 6 on a Saturday night, so we expected a wait. We were told 1 hour 20 minutes, but waited closer to two hours. While we waited, we were lucky to get two seats at the bar. Only to sit next to several angry customers who were eating at the bar because their waits had been so long. The bar staff was lackluster and more interested in talking to each other than helping customers. Then the real disaster started when we were seated. It took way too long to get anyone to stop at our table for water or to take a drink order. Once we finally ordered, the appetizers came and were just OK. Our entrees came, and the hamburger ordered medium came out looking like beyond well done. That took a long time to find our new server (they changed servers for some reason) she took it back and said they would make a new one. By the time the new one came, everyone had finished their dinners. It was also improperly cooked - rare on the inside and burned on the outside. I wasted 3 1/2 hours of my life in here, and can't believe how crowded it is. Why do people go here when there are so many other places in the same shopping center?? Save your calories and cash and go elsewhere."

Tiffany M.,"Yonkers, NY",0,18,48,3.0,9/26/2015,Good place to go last minute or if your indecisive about where to eat at RidgeHill Mall. Service has gotten better over the last 2 years but still expect to wait for your food. The cheesecakes are AMAZING!!!!!
