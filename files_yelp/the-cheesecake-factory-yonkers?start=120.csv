Gail G.,"Cortlandt Manor, NY",0,21,,1.0,11/29/2016,"Update:  I did hear from Guest Services re our experience here:  profuse apologies were offered!  Hope they get this location under control bc I do love this restaurant chain!  Terrible terrible service!  I can't speak for the food because we never got our food after waiting 45 minutes!  Our waitress did not care...wasn't interested.... and when I tried to signal her , after 25 minutes of her nonconcern... she signaled me back to wait !  Well.... we left .... she saw that... ran to kitchen... ran after us with our food..... shouting to us:  here's your food!  No manager came over.... NO ONE CARED!!!!  Those diners  who came after us all were eating their dinners but not us!!!!   There are other choices In this shopping center:  GO THERE!!!"
Isabel H.,"Bronx, NY",26,64,23,3.0,4/17/2016,"Do not go here on the weekends!! The wait can be anywhere from 1 hour to 2 hours. It is a small location, the cheesecake is amazing and the food is good, but not worth the long wait. The waiter kept forgetting about us, it was frustrating. Next time I will go on a weekday afternoon."
Brian K.,"Bronx, NY",0,26,1,1.0,1/19/2017,"This is the worst cheesecake factory I've ever seen. They are so slow, the wait staff is completely untrained. The wait is completely ridiculous, they really do not care at all."
E R.,"Bronx, NY",110,19,10,1.0,7/3/2016,"We ordered a few alcoholic drinks and food to celebrate our wedding anniversary minutes after sitting down. It took more than 40 minutes to get our drinks. After an hour and change of waiting for our food and noticing people who ordered after us eating, we paid for our drinks and left without eating. I think the kid who took care of us was new as he looked dazed and confused.  Drinks were really good but super late for the premium price we were charged. ($12+each) The restaurant's decor is beautiful and the men's bathroom was super clean. However, the bread basket was as stale as the service."
erika k.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,,2.0,12/26/2016,"I've been coming to this Cheesecake Factory for years and have never had an issue. But on the day after Christmas, I think management should enforce the wait time after a table has paid their bill. To be told your wait is 40 minutes and then have to wait an hour and 15 minutes is really bad customer service."
Kia M.,"Bronxville, NY",20,64,38,1.0,3/15/2016,"Horrible service, sat 20 min before taking order, another 20 no drinks, cold bread no water, very rude waiter, I opted to just leave."
Patriice G.,"Mount Vernon, NY",338,62,59,2.0,5/23/2016,Out of all the cheesecake factories I have been to. This is by far the worst one! It is always freezing in here even in the winter time. I came here on monday at like 2pm it wasn't busy but somehow our waitress was inattentive to our needs. We were there for nearly an hour before she took our Order for food. While waiting for the food she brought out my beverage of a raspberry lemonade which tasted like 99% sugar and 1% juice. I asked for a soda instead and she left the lemonade on the table and didn't pick it up until after we paid for the check. My friend ordered tea and she left the box of the tea selection there the whole time. As well as the fact that our food came out Cold and she forgot to put another guest of our parties order. She then insisted that she could validate our parking ticket for the three of us and it turned out she didn't even do that correctly. The only good thing about this place is the food and the decor. If you really want to go to a Cheesecake Factory please go to the one in white plains it will be far more worth it .
Jon O.,"New York, NY",44,72,5,1.0,5/8/2014,"This is in regards to the horrible service we've experienced. Our waiter's introduction was  pretty much I'm running the bar and serving so pretty much expected bad service. Throughout the night we had to wave him down for drinks, utensils, etc.. That I had to walk up to the front desk in order to pay for our bill, which our busy waiter was intensely involved in a personal conversation with another employee. When we come to dine at a restaurant , it shouldn't be our problem if it's understaff and what not. We should have a pleasent experience but this wasn't the case by far."
Kute_me ..,"Bronx, NY",3,13,8,3.0,6/27/2016,"I've been to almost all of these chains in New York and I must say this one might be the worst.  The employees almost seem as though your bothering them while they're hanging out with their friends, the wait is also ridiculously long.   This particular CCF is located near a movie theatre and big shopping mall so you would think they would be prepared for a crowd on any given day which is not the case.   We had to wait until the food was brought to get bread which is unacceptable, it's almost as though they are told not to bring bread out early for big groups so they don't fill up on it and order less, lol.   They food was ok, nothing to write home about but their portions are crazy.  They definitely give you a decent amount.   Bottom line if you're on a date and don't mind a wait , eat here.  If you're a group of four or more don't"
Winnie V.,"Thornwood, NY",0,1,,2.0,2/5/2017,"Had the worse customer service tonight at the Cheesecake Factory in Ridge Hill, Yonkers.  Found a staple in my Fried Chicken Sliders.  The waitress forgot my order of Fried Mac & Cheese.  So I just had my sliders.  We had little nat (flies) around the table, which was annoying.  The waitress never came over to see if we wanted refills on our Ice Teas.  This place was good when it first opened, but is slowly going down hill."
Amanda G.,"Yonkers, NY",833,809,4136,3.0,4/24/2015,"I've eaten here a few times. I am not a huge fan of this chain but their food is ok, as is the service. This particular night, we stopped by to buy cheesecake slices for our significant others."
Dana Y.,"New York, NY",322,182,630,2.0,8/29/2014,"Note: I am a big Cheesecake Factory fan. But this one....  My boyfriend and I went on a Tuesday night, it was half empty yet service was still slow. We were seated in a booth and it was as if we didn't exist. We had to keep a lookout for our waitress for 15 mins before we found her so we can get a fork.  For appetizers, we got the Summer Rolls. It was a huge disappointment. Although the plate looked so pretty, the rolls were falling apart as I moved it from the plate to my mouth - I made a huge mess. The best part about the dish was the sauce...  For the main course, I got the Jambalaya pasta with chicken and shrimp, it was really bland. Something I can totally whip up even though I suck at cooking.  For desserts, I got the Mango key lime cheesecake - the only thing I was happy about.  The food needs improvement and although service was slow, I enjoyed my waitress' attitude."
Cristina B.,"Yonkers, NY",1,37,42,4.0,9/17/2015,"Today we celebrate our 4 year anniversary. We decided to come here for the first time.  The atmosphere was great. We sat in our own little booth. Our Waiter Spencer R. Was the best. My boyfriend and I ordered the Mashed potatoes, meatloaf, and vegetables.  Two people could have eaten from my plate. The food was great. While I was on my cell my boyfriend tells the waiter to bring the check.  I got made what about desert. I had the Godiva Chocolate Cheese Cake.  Mmmmm. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our time there. We will definitely come back.  Already making the plans."
Victoria R.,"Bronx, NY",0,20,19,4.0,6/11/2016,Love it! Fried mac & cheese AMAZING! Mojitos AMAZING! Cheesecakes a little to rich in taste for me but amazingly their carrot cake is great!!
Princess R.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,2,,1.0,7/13/2017,"My experience at this location yesterday wasn't very pleasant. I sat at a table with my family for at least 15mins before a server came and greeted us. When the server (Kiy) did greet us he introduced himself and said "" I guess I'm going to take this table because no one else is"". We then ordered three waters one with lemon and a Dr Pepper. Another 15mins went by and still no beverages. He approached the table and we jokingly said did you forget about us? He responses in telling us that they were no cups in the restaurant and that they were short a dishwasher. We told him it was okay to just give us the drinks in to go cups and ordered a pina colada, some apps and our food. 10mins after that he brings our drinks not including the pina colada (which I figured he was going to the bar to get so I didn't bring it up at that moment) or lemon for one of the waters. At this point we were annoyed and didn't want to ask our server for nothing more because it seemed like a bother to him as he continued to past our table and pay us no mind. The appetizers came out and were delicious but once our entrees came everything started going downhill again. Our food did not come out all together. When the last person got her food half of what she ordered wasn't there. We were told that it would be up in a second. 3 out of 4 of us had pasta so we asked for cheese and did not receive it neither. Then finally a manager walks by I'm guessing to touch base and explain to us why the pot stickers we ordered were still not there. He explained that the kitchen was short staff and they had to make the pot stickers from scratch which honestly should have been explained to us rather than having us thinking everything was under control. I'm beyond frustrated at this point and tell them to cancel that order of pot stickers. I then continue to explain to the manager (warren) that we weren't getting anything we ask for this whole night. No pina colada, no lemon, no cheese, no pot stickers and on top of all that horrible service. Little things could have made up for this bad experience but not one time did Kiy try to turn our experience around. When it was time for the bill the manager had to take off the pina colada that we never received and the pot stickers he also discounted a lot off our bill which we very much appreciated but the managers should not be held accountable every time a server can't seem to get it together. If he was communicating with us I'm pretty sure we would of understood a little more. After speaking to the manager for a while he learned it was my older cousins birthday and got her a cheese cake on the house which put a smile on her face. I end in saying every job is not for everyone and you can't make someone happy if you're not happy with what you're doing."
September B.,"Jamaica, NY",2,7,2,5.0,6/17/2016,The service here was great!! Our waiter Freddie Flores was excellent. He was very articulate and explained the menu items flawlessly. He recommended new dishes to us that we're great! The service was above par. Next time you're in Ridge Hill ask for Freddy!
Kathy L.,"Bronxville, NY",0,9,,4.0,7/10/2016,"We have been to this location a few times. It is kid-friendly and there's a big variety food although the menu can be overwhelming. Overall, it is a good experience if you get there early before it starts to get crowded. My biggest complaint is the take-out counter which has compelled me to write a review.  Here is my breakdown.  Service - We have never had any issues with the wait staff. They are always pleasant and extremely attentive. Our waiter yesterday knew we liked the bread and made sure we had plenty. He came back at the right times after our appetizers, entrees and desserts came to see how we were doing. One complaint about the service is that my child's entrée came before the beverage came.  Food - Food is a hit or miss. There are plenty of eye-catching items on the menu but to read the whole menu takes awhile. I've had the burger before and those are always a hit. I had the fish taco last time and the tacos itself was good but the rice was bland and the beans had a taste to it as if it was many days old.  Dessert - No complaints but should always ask if one wants whipped cream or not. I am not a fan of whipped cream but my child is.  Take-out counter - We didn't want to carry the cheesecake around while we shopped so we came back later on. Not sure where the lack of communication is but there are two people behind the counters and waiters waiting for their dessert and coffee to bring to diners. I don't know why it took over 10 mins for two lattes and two pieces of cheesecake to go. One of them disappeared to get a jar of dressing that was clearly at the counter and the other was pre-occupied. There really isn't a reason to have people wait long enough that one of the maitre'd had to make our lattes herself.  Overall - I will come here again because of my love for cheesecake and the friendly wait staff."
Sessy L.,"Foxhurst, NY",0,1,2,3.0,11/12/2014,Service was a bit slow for a Tuesday night  but maybe because it was veteran's day.  Food was delicious!! I got the buffalo burger with french fries so yummy!
Elsa L.,"Yonkers, NY",135,28,24,4.0,5/1/2015,"I have come to this particular cheesecake factory only about 3 or 4 times. I haven't had to particularly wait too long but maybe its because i always go during the week. Only once did i need to wait about 30 minutes or so but we went to Sephora across the street and time went by fast.  The staff have always been friendly and attentive. I haven't had to constantly look for my server because they always come to check up on us.  I love love LOVE the Piña Colada from here. Don't like Piña coladas with alcohol so i always order the Virgin Piña coladas and they're amazing. Recommend to everyone! The food is also good but i wouldn't say its amazing. I'd Recommend the Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic and also the Pasta Da Vinci. Sometimes i find the food too greasy and then i look at the calories of each plate and see why its so high. I just wish it was a bit less greasy. I like how they give free refills with the soda though.  The place is really nice, dim and have outdoor seating good for the warm days ahead.  Lets not forget the reason why they're very famous....the CHEESECAKE. Love the cheesecake. Red Velvet Cheesecake is delicious but my favorite is the classic cheesecake.  I Haven't been disappointed at this place, and i would recommend. Not sure if they take reservations but it would be a good idea when going on the weekend because the wait is no joke."
