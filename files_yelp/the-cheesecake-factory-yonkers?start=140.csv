Gerony M.,"Bergenfield, NJ",56,31,22,5.0,2/25/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is an establishment that's hard to come by if you live in the city , but if you can drive, then spare the 30 min ride and head on up there because it's amazing.  This restaurant is located in the beautiful ridge hill mall in Yonkers. Although I came here during a nasty snow storm, the place is beautiful and will definitely be a sight for sore eyes in warm weather.  The Cheesecake Factory itself is magnificent , very late very classy and it even has a full bar. It provides a certain atmosphere of peace and tranquility that makes U feel relaxed and welcome.  I didn't get to dive into the food a lot in terms of options but what I did have was incredible . Coming here hungry but wasn't crazing a meal I stuck to appetizers. I ordered buffalo wings and chicken sliders with fries . Simple, not too much and thinking I wasn't gonna be as full so I can have a cheesecake... Boy I was wrong . I had six pieces of wings and 1 small chicken slider, and I was beyond full . It was flavorful and the buffalo wings were tasty and spicy . For a place that specializes in cheesecake their wings are to die for . I did order a cheesecake and it was the dulce de leche with caramel cheesecake and it was an amazing choice. Really sweet and you can taste all the sweets given in. Overall the environment, location , taste and portions will leave you coming for more . The price overall was a bit high considering the little I ordered ( just over 60 for the apps and cheesecake, plus a drink) but it was definitely worth it because I was nothing short of satisfied .  Ps. Waitress agatha was amazing to us she's an absolute delight !! Amazing staff member !"
Joann N.,"Bedford Park, Bronx, NY",1,18,10,1.0,7/19/2015,Have not even stepped into the vicinity of the restaurant. You want to know why? Because of the TWO hour wait. Yet we are still sitting here. It's unacceptable. The level of incompetence of the workers is at an all time high. They do not know how to task out orders
Eric W.,"Hastings-on-Hudson, NY",8,14,,4.0,3/30/2016,"Updating the last review from two years ago...they are much better now. Much more of a well oiled machine. Hostesses are adequate. Servers are much better. Rarely get an order wrong but even when they do, they'll go out of the way to fix it (i.e. Free drinks). Still great portions and variety and a great place for kids."
Hector P.,"Brooklyn, NY",14,50,5,3.0,4/2/2016,"While the food may be good you cannot enjoy a complete meal with your family since the food is not served together or incomplete. Sitting here right now got my burger waiting for sides and sauce over 20 mins and asked 3 times for it. Finally I had to tell them forget the shrimp, my burger is already cold so forget the sauce I have been waiting for as well. Totally ignored, good way to ensure customers are happy."
Frank W.,"Yonkers, NY",42,10,3,1.0,12/27/2013,"I've uploaded a photo of their Lemon Herb Chicken served to us today as a To Go order.  Though management is always kind and good to refund us our dish and then some, the fact that I am now familiar with their placating protocols is not a good thing.  After multiple screw-ups and improperly cooked food, I don't see myself returning for anything but their pre made Cheesecakes that come frozen anyway. This Lemon Herb Roast Chicken dish is incredibly inconsistent.  It is great when it is good, but ... well you can see the picture.  We were basically served ashes.  In the restaurant we have been served this chicken very undercooked, to a point of seeing red juices coming out of it.   Get your kitchen in order Cheesecake Factory Ridge Hill.  I'm surprised someone hasn't shut you down yet for serving raw chicken."
A. J.,"New York, NY",2,20,16,4.0,7/25/2015,"Celebrated a girlfriend's birthday here during the spring and basically ordered everything off the appetizers menu and some drinks. If you're health conscious tell yourself it's a cheat day and whatever you do don't look at the calorie count! Had a very sweet and attentive waiter, no complaints there. Also their desserts are very rich so you might end up taking it home. Sharing plates is definitely the way to go, that way your taste buds get an equal opportunity to taste everything."
Shanique P.,"Yonkers, NY",7,16,5,4.0,2/8/2015,"Let me start the review out by saying that this place is kinda hit or miss with me.  Sometimes I have an AMAZING experience (like last night) and sometimes I think I'll never, ever return to this restaurant.  I'm a cheesecake factory veteran, I've been going for years (this one is still on the new side but I've been to many others) and I know what I like and how I like it.  I very rarely need to look at a menu.  The wait was said to be 30mins but it too a bit longer than that to be seated, that's the main reason I took a star off in this review.  Our waitress was Agatha and when I come here again, I'm definitely going to request sitting in her section.  She was very attentive and made recommendations (even though I really didn't need any).  My other complaint was that my side dish came out luke warm at best, but once I told Agatha about it, she got me a new dish very quickly so I'm not holding that against them. Overall my experience was very pleasant, I enjoyed the things that I ordered.  I was never without a refill on my lemonade (not getting refills in a timely fashion is one of my biggest pet peeves at restaurants) and my food was very good."
Jennifer A.,"Carteret, NJ",66,88,222,4.0,5/10/2015,The wait was an hour but it was well worth it! Customer service was great! The food was scrumptious and the drinks were tasty with a kick! I will def come back here!
Cristina M.,"Windermere, Orlando, FL",207,90,86,1.0,9/4/2016,"Worst cheesecake factory ever Alex the ""manager"" im not even sure he is the manager but was the person send to give face. I was there to pick up a piece of cheesecake since im pregnant.  I was having dinner at yardhouse because that was what the rest of my family was feeling like having so As leaving yardhouse I call cheesecake factory in the same shopping mall to put my to go order and make sure I had time since it was 9:45 and they close at 10! I got to cheesecake factory door at 9:50 and the doors are closed and they dont let me in to get my to go piece of nutella cheesecake! We are talking about 5 min later and its still 10min to close and you are not letting me in to get a to go order? You have to be kidding me! Dear Alex Manager I really hope as a pregnant woman craving a cheesecake that ur kid behave so insane that u get embarrassed of yourself and what you contribute to this world! You shouldn't be working for a well known company. I'm disgusted at this manager and service."
Michelle R.,"Bronx, NY",53,97,129,2.0,12/28/2013,"Some days the food comes out good some days it doesn't. I have been here plenty of times but today was not a great experience. I ordered the Baja chicken tacos. It was apparent that the plate had been sitting for hours and put to heat up. I don't like to have my plate taken to warm up my food or ""redo"" because I'm sure it'll come back with extra ingredients -_-  I could barely eat the tacos because they were glued to the plate and fell apart instead of being sturdy to hold and eat while the rice and beans were a little cold.  I like the desserts but I'm kind of tired of spending my money and not being satisfied."
Jose C.,"Stamford, CT",11,230,332,2.0,3/30/2015,"My wife and I went out to diner on  Sunday, it was very busy we had to wait at the bar. We order the Cuban rolls while waiting, which was pretty good. But boy the staff on the bar looked miserable, when we got our appetizer the waiter told what it seemed to be the bar back to set us up, man this guy was rude, just threw the napkin and the dishes. The utensils were dirty as well. When we were transferred to our table, the waiter was really nice and attentive. The other bad part was the cleanliness of the bathroom. Paper towels were overflowing garbage can etc."
Francesca C.,"Flushing, NY",132,123,39,2.0,12/27/2015,"first off, the server i had was named gabriel was was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  so he gets a 5 in my book but overall, either it was a manager issue or the company's issue but i wasnt pleased. my bf and i went to cheesecake factory on tuesday for lunch. we arrived around 12 and was seated promptly.  in my opinion, their menu is WAY TOO BIG. too many things to choose from...  well i ordered chicken w/ biscuits and gravy  after consuming a couple of bites, i found either a straw wrapper or tissue in my food. i was very displeased. our server was SUPER apologetic and immediately told the manager. they asked if i wanted a new dish and obv i said yes.  what i was very displeased with was that they didnt comp me for it or offer anything else to comp me for it.  ive gone to applebees where i feel is a smaller chain, and when i found hair in my food, they comped me for my dish.  the manger did come to our table to apologize but it was unbelievable to me that i wasnt offered a desert or whatever as a gesture.   not pleased what so ever."
Ritz B.,"Yonkers, NY",3,65,10,2.0,4/8/2015,"Today is my 29th birthday. Yay me right? So, my boyfriend takes me here to celebrate and fr the get-go, the ghetto waiter we get sucks. He's a hispanic guy. We order 2 waters and a red sangria for me. He seems to be an extremely forgetting individual. He brought our waters without lemon and we had to remind him about it. The sangria did NOT get me even buzzed :-/ ($11!!!!) Upon asking for more bread, he brought it by the time we were done eating. He even gave us a long to-go loaf. Great but still he sucked. Finally, he forgot to bring my yummy birthday cheesecake and singing my Happy Birthday Song. My boyfriend was extremely upset about this. We left him with a $5 tip...he didn't even deserve it.  Wish we had saved the receipt so that I could have written his name on my review...why?? He didn't introduce himself initially!!! Horrible experience.  2 stars because my chicken samosas were good."
Charlie F.,"CORTLANDT MNR, NY",43,70,25,1.0,2/20/2016,"I have no idea what the tremendous draw if this place is. There's always a line in the weekend with at least an hour wait to be seated. Wait staff ranges from great to mediocre. My kids love this place so I gave it a few chances but I'm said to say that every mail I've had there is pretty mediocre and super salty. Not one of my favorite places to eat. The cheesecake is awesome though, if you can make it through the main meal."
Sakinah T.,"Bronx, NY",23,18,54,4.0,5/17/2015,Well a much needed lunch. They recently changed the menu so I couldn't have my pan seared salmon. I had a wonderful substitute of herb crusted salmon with spinach and mash. Ate too quick to take a pic. Of course I didn't leave without my red velvet cheesecake.  Service was quick and my waiter was awesome.
Chad W.,"Pomona, NY",0,3,,1.0,1/25/2016,"I had a family get together yesterday with my brothers, sisters in law, and nieses and nephew at your restaurant.  The food was delicious.  I ordered the Salmon with Steak Diane medium well which was absolutely breathtaking.  The reason why I give this restaurant 3 out of 5 stars is because on the receipt there is a section that says Suggested Gratuity: 20%, 18%, and 15%.  When did I ask for your suggestion on how much I should leave for my tip?  I do not appreciate being told how much I need to put on there as a tip.  I was going to give the server a 10$ tip but I was confused because a 10$ tip would have been 5$ more than what the Cheesecake factory was asking me to give them.  I am extremely distraught over this experience and do not like being told what I need to give as a tip."
Aw F.,"New York, NY",1,33,14,1.0,10/18/2015,STAY AWAY!!! Worst place ever. We ordered some chicken app. We all ate and realized the meat is very pink and smells like ham. I asked the waiter is this chicken she said yea but I still wasn't buying it. So I told her call me the manager he came and I showed him the pink peices and he said I'll have to ask my kitchen manager. He finally comes back and states that they accidentally switched the order. Mind you we don't eat pork!!! And he claimed that they will make the right one now I said no thank you. Instead of having dessert on the house they made us pay for it after saying they will take care of us. The only thing they took off was the app that they got wrong. Cheesecake was served to us still frozen. Literally this is the worst place ever. They tell you 30 mins to wait it's way longer of a wait then that. So please stay away.
Patrick C.,"Washington, DC",0,59,,2.0,3/7/2017,"I have been to other Cheesecake Factory locations across the country, so I know what to expect at peak times -- a wait.  That's fine, and the couple of times I have been here, I have waited to be seated, but the staff has been so overwhelmed that the orders were not taken quickly, and it seemed to take forever for the food to reach the table.  Perhaps it's the location in Ridge Hill that attracts more business than some other locations, but I don't think it's worth waiting at this location any longer than 10-15 minutes, which is rarely the case with any Cheesecake Factory.  For this location, it seems that you have to come when you're not hungry, so that you are not starving by the time the food actually reaches your table.  The food is the same as other CF locations, since it's a chain, but somehow crowd management seems to be better than I've experienced at this location most times we have visited."
Elaine B.,"Scarsdale, NY",0,22,,3.0,4/17/2016,Great place for week-day lunch.  nice decor.  the food was tasty.  enjoyed the cheese cake. Get your parking ticket validated. (2 hrs?) nice shops to visit after dining...
cedes w.,"JAMAICA, NY",2,66,3,1.0,6/12/2016,"My husband, mother, children and I visited the cheesecake factory at Ridgehill this past week. We visited due to my husband's birthday and my daughter's graduation (This was my husband's first time at any cheesecake factory). From the beginning, I was disappointed with the service and quality of the food. As it being a weekday (Tuesday), it wasn't very busy and we were seated almost immediately outside (upon our request). EVERY SINGLE THING we wanted, I had to call the waiter over to get. I had to find him to get our appetizers in, call him over to get our drinks ordered, request water, ask for him to come so we could get our entree order in. He simply neglected our table. When it got a little chilly, we asked for the heater to be turned on. When the heater turned off, we asked the waiter to turn it back on. He said okay but walked back inside. We had to request the manager when he walked by to help us and turn it on. To add insult to injury half of the time, the waiter was just standing around at the other end of the patio. One other thing that bothered me was that I asked for a glass of water and I told him it was my husband's birthday and I would like for him to get sung happy birthday at the table. He said okay. The food came (much smaller portions than the Nyack and White Plains location) and we finished. He came and just gave us the bill. There was no asking of if we wanted dessert, no asking if we wanted anything else and certainly no happy birthday for my husband. I became infuriated because once I gave him my card he literally stood next to our table eyeing the tip. So lets recap, I had to ask for everything for our meal, you never returned regarding our heater, and didn't sing happy birthday as I requested. We will never be returning to the cheesecake factory at this location ever again. People come to the cheesecake factory for a delicious special meal to share with friends and family. If I wanted to ask for everything or get it myself I could have cooked at home."

One other thing that bothered me was that I asked for a glass of water and I told him it was my husband's birthday and I would like for him to get sung happy birthday at the table. He said okay. The food came (much smaller portions than the Nyack and White Plains location) and we finished. He came and just gave us the bill. There was no asking of if we wanted dessert, no asking if we wanted anything else and certainly no happy birthday for my husband. I became infuriated because once I gave him my card he literally stood next to our table eyeing the tip. So lets recap, I had to ask for everything for our meal, you never returned regarding our heater, and didn't sing happy birthday as I requested. We will never be returning to the cheesecake factory at this location ever again. People come to the cheesecake factory for a delicious special meal to share with friends and family. If I wanted to ask for everything or get it myself I could have cooked at home."
