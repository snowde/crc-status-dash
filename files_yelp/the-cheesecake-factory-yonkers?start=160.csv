Sour_Diesel 5.,"Scarsdale, NY",33,18,7,1.0,9/27/2014,"The Pizza almost killed my daughter and I. In my 30 years walking this earth I have never experienced an allergic reaction from pizza! The service sucked a-s-s, & the manager Stanley Ceasar became extremely passive aggressive when I bought the situation to his attention. NEVER AGAIN*** FYI 45 minute seating"
Dee A.,"Little Falls, NJ",4,83,13,1.0,11/9/2015,"Came here to rewind with a drink and dinner after a long day at work (and a Monday) was literally the only person at the bar and did not once receive eye contact. The bartender (short Caucasian female long blonde hair) had no personality. I reached for my own menu, asked her to take my order and then threw my card down when I was ready to leave. She never offered me water or any kind of service or small talk. I so badly wanted to tell her if she was as miserable as she seems, she should find a new job. It took Godly strength to leave her the 10% tip I did leave. I think this bar would benefit from a friendly bartender. I would have been easily swayed to get a second glass of wine or a slice of cheesecake. The friendliest she was was when I was leaving, made me feel like she was happy I was leaving. Too many options In this center. Next time I treat myself, it won't be here."
Pedro C.,"Flushing Meadows, Queens, NY",330,5,1,4.0,3/25/2015,"The food is amazing!!!!! I ordered a very simple dish, chicken and biscuits and it was great! Hosting staff looked miserable. But if you can get by that, the waiting staff and food= great time out!"
Robert J.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,51,86,3.0,11/29/2015,I have heard mixed reviews about the Cheese cake factory but mostly they are related to the ambience and food preparation. However on this particular day I vested for their brunch and went straight for the pancakes. They were fluffy and made with butter milk. As usual I ask for butter because well I like butter. But there is no need for butter or for syrup either. These pancakes are textured light crispy and just melt in your mouth. To put it plain and simple the pancakes best any pancake house or your mothers.
J Q.,"Bronx, NY",4,36,69,4.0,10/14/2014,Their burgers are delicious. I love this place. Delicious cheesecake of course.  Great place to go in groups. Great location. Is a nice place to go to if you do not know where to go..
Renz A.,"La Puente, CA",24,5,,1.0,10/20/2015,Terrible! Just terrible!! Me and my wife decided to have dinner here last night and we got there @ 9:10pm last night. We were seated and the server took a long time to take our order. Check your utensils! They don't bother to clean them. Asked our server to change the utensils and never came back. I kept my patience till the time reached 10pm. The manager said the food that I ordered got burned so they had to make a new one. We'll what about my wife's order?!?.. I can't believe how terrible this place is. We will never return here ever again and would suggest to others as well. We ended up going to Yardhouse that gave us a much better service. Save your money and time and don't come here...
Love N.,"Bronx, NY",0,15,,4.0,9/24/2016,love appetizers    variety of good stuff to pick from   yay! carrot cheesecake waiters could be less rushy
Dan B.,"Yonkers, NY",9,42,17,1.0,10/9/2014,"I was throwing up all night... I don't even know the name of what I ordered but it was breaded chicken over brown rice with some spicy flavoring to it. Long story short, about 45min after eating I was in the bathroom with the worst stomach ache. I have a pretty iron stomach, but this was horrible. Never again will I eat there. Stay away from the spicy chicken!!!"
Panda B.,"Bronx, NY",3,16,6,4.0,11/10/2013,"I love The Cheesecake Factory!!! This one did have a really long wait ..I'm just happy there's one closer to me now!   The food took a while to come out , and our waiter attended the table next to us first than ours when we were first to arrive. That's the only reason I gave four stars instead of five. I'm never disappointed when I choose something new to eat.  If they improve service and wait time... I'd be very happy!"
Kane A.,"New York, NY",82,157,23,1.0,8/13/2013,"I used to be under the impression that this place was fine dining (among chain restaurants). Whoever told me that is a moron.  Aside from the decor, I can't really name one good quality about this place. The food is mediocre at best, it's very overpriced, and whoa - has anyone noticed the calorie count in the entrees? I'm no health nut, but I think when it's difficult to find a meal that's under 2,000 calories, it's a problem.   To top it off, the service kinda sucks and the wait staff doesn't even know their own menu."
Danielle C.,"Yonkers, NY",0,7,,1.0,8/21/2016,Horrible horrible service!! Horrible horrible food! Party of 2 arrived and we sat down and waited 15 minutes for our waitress to arrive. We ordered our food and it came back raw (steak diane). Server took it back and brought it back cut up not even a new piece. By that time the mashed potatoes were cold. We had to flag her down for drinks and for the bill. We didn't tip and we never went back to that location.
Sheila F.,"Shrub Oak, NY",0,6,,5.0,8/17/2016,"Wow !! Love Happy hour / Kathy our waitress was the BEST !! Couldn't find a manager to tell him or her that she is..... Their best asset ... Smart... , efficient just overall a nice nice person... See u soon !"
Mirtha M.,"Bronx, NY",2,8,3,2.0,9/16/2014,"What a disappointment, I have been to this Cheesecake Factory before and the wait has been ""long"", but nothing compared to this past Sundays visit. My review will be solely based on the recent visit this past Sunday.  After leaving the apple store (right across from CCF) we went into the cheese cake factory and we were told the wait was 40-45 mins. Idk what 5 minutes difference would have done but my family (party of 6) and I agreed. It was 5:30pm.. We were given a little alarm lighting device that will tell you when your table is ready; we got distracted with other people and the children in our party that we failed notice that the time was 6:56. Hmm ok, we ask how much longer and they tell us that there's one party in front of us. Ok.  Finally the darn thing rings at 7:02. We are shown our seats and about 5 minutes later our server approaches us.. And asks what we would like to drink, party of 6 says what they are drinking and he's not taking notes. We get distracted again and notice we haven't received water or their delicious bread.. The server comes back and I shout, we are ready to order appetizers, now he takes the note pad and writes down the appetizers and asks us to tell him our drinks again.  appetizers, arrive 30 mins later and still no bread or water. By this point I'm upset, I hate waiting so long after being seated. I stop one of the girls in the black uniform and tell her I want to speak to the manager. The manager arrives fairly quickly and everyone in the table looks at me to spill my feelings of angry, Spanish, hungry woman! And I do that.  I begin stating that the wait to be seated was long, the wait for the bread was long, we haven't received water and the time is now 7:45. He was very nice, that one star is for him. Lol he told us that is not the servers fault, they were out of bread and they were out of glasses for drinks, that he had to make the drinks himself. -_- my drink, passion fruit mojito... Watered down, but I was more interested in the food. The manager tells us that he will make sure everything is smooth from here on out. Ok.  Our food arrived 8 something, food was ok, but I couldn't enjoy because I was upset lol i finished my plate steak Diane & mash and told the waiter that I was ready for dessert, I order my cheese cake & tell him we are ready for the bill. The bill arrives and I couldn't take it anymore, I got up and paid at the front little desk and waited and took my cheesecake to go. Smh!  If I go back it will be after having a full meal, because I will be hungry when I finish digesting what I had previously had eaten... And ready to eat again!  Poured my soul into this review lmao"
Sunnie P.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",0,14,,1.0,12/20/2015,"No wonder this ccf got the lowest star ratings in 30 miles radius neighborhood.  I got upset at the counter to put my name down.  This woman doesn't look at me when it's my turn. When other person behind me try to put her name which she was going to. When I told her I was here twice, she still wouldn't look at me. Then she gave rude hand gesture and screamed 'WHAT'? Once again she make mad face at me. Totally unacceptable. I won't come back here."
Alexis M.,"Bellmore, NY",267,141,23,5.0,5/28/2014,"I took my little cousin here for some family bonding time. Her plate was far better than mine! I actually wanted to steal it!  The staff was funny! The food was great and the drinks were perfect. What more can I ask for honestly? Wait yea I can,  They stamped my parking ticket and paid for my parking. I'm SOLD!  Any time I'm here, I'll be sure to stop by at least to get that parking validation lol, jusssst kiddinggggg!"
Kristen L.,"Key Largo, FL",3,3,,1.0,8/20/2014,"I typically enjoy going to The Cheesecake Factory, but this by far the worst one I've ever been to.  We waited exceedingly long for drink refills, our food and to pay our bills."
Steve J.,"Bronx, NY",0,1,1,1.0,7/13/2016,"Obviously if I could give no stars I would. Absolutely unbelievable that people continue to eat here. I was one of those... The hostesses are rude and uninterested in anything other than IMing on their phones. The managers have no clue what's going on, maybe they're also IMing with the hostesses. Diety tables outside that were not bussed, ran out of the item we ordered and weren't told until the rest of the food came out. No bread to be seen after 25min of being seated. This place has got to change its level of service as competition increases in Ridge Hill. Do something #cheesecakefactory about this place that is giving your franchise a bad name. Maybe they should replace it with an Applebee's or even a Shoneys."
Sarah H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,4/28/2015,"I have been a regular at this Cheesecake Factory for the past three years. I have had all of my birthday dinners there. I don't really mind the mediocre service or wait times because I love the food there and, at this point, it's a tradition. I went there on Sunday for my 22nd birthday party. We were seated outside and it was very cold, I ended on wrapping myself up in a hammock to stay warm, but I didn't mind... that's how much I love the Cheesecake factory. My actual birthday, the next day, Monday, a series of terrible things happened making this one of the worst birthdays I've had. My girlfriend's computer crashed (we are seniors at Sarah Lawrence College during our finals week) and I ended up spending a lot of the day with her at the apple store trying to find a solution. To cheer up, before we went home, she suggested a cocktail at the Cheesecake factory. We went to the bar and my waiter from the night before recognized me. ""Hey birthday girl!"" he said, before leaving the bar. I explained that today was my actual birthday so I was just coming in for a drink. The bartender took mine and my girlfriend's IDs, after looking at them for approximately 3 seconds, decided ""neither of these are real,"" throwing them down on the counter and walked away. I called him back over and asked him to scan it or enter it in the computer because it was, in fact, my actual license. He pulled out an ID guide book and told me that my ID should be horizontal if I was 21 (it's a South Carolina ID because I'm a student at Sarah Lawrence, from South Carolina originally). I explained that I had gotten it shortly before I turned 21 since I had lost my old one and needed it replaced. It's vertical, but clearly says ""UNDER 21 UNTIL"" my birthday last year. He asked if I had any other forms of identification that matched this name and I pulled out both of my debit cards and student ID, all clearly stating my name and the ID also had my photo and year at school. He walked away, and for a second I thought he was going to serve us, but it turns out he was just ignoring us and talking to one of the waiters.  At this point, I started to cry. It had already been a horrible birthday, now I couldn't even get a drink at my favorite restaurant. Not only was I not being served, the bartender was rude and condescending. Two men were also behind the bar and we asked if one of them was the manager. The manager came over, looked at our IDs, and still didn't believe mine was real. Let me just say, at this point, that I have never had any issue with this ID. It is my real South Carolina ID that clearly stated it was my 22nd birthday. The manager questioned that as well, holding back a laugh as he said he just ""wasn't so sure about this one."" I asked him to scan it. He didn't. The bartender then comes over, and says ""So you're from South Carolina, and you know Eli?"" I didn't know who Eli was, but he kept nodding to the back of the restaurant so I guess he was referring to the waiter who had recognized me when I walked in. My girlfriend tried to explain that I was here last night for my 22nd birthday, but at this point the bartender wasn't listening and was talking over us. We left, because at that point I was openly crying and didn't want to sit at a bar with these two jerks.  Maybe they didn't have a scanner. That's unfortunate. I just don't understand why they would think I would go to all of that effort if my ID was fake. Thank you for ruining my 22nd birthday, Cheesecake Factory. I have returned here even after shoddy service and many mistakes because I work in the service industry and know that a lot can go wrong in a restaurant. But both of these men were extremely rude and condescending to me just because I look young, refusing to serve me when I was using my valid license. I won't ever be returning to this Cheesecake Factory again. Their service has always been so-so, and this is the final straw."
Janeve D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,,3.0,1/2/2016,food is ok not great but always come back. The only real thing I can complain about is that it's always SOoooo cold....it's like an ice box in there. Outside is just as cold as inside.
Arlin E.,"East Bronx, NY",1,2,,1.0,7/14/2015,"If I can give this place zero stars i would. Came here with my boyfriend and his brother for the first time yesterday, and to say the least the service was horrible. Walking in I should've known it wasn't going to be a good experience. We walk in and ask the hostess how long of a wait for 3 people and and continued about her business and ignored us.. A couple of minutes later she decides to answer us. We get seated order our food, about 25 mins later the food comes out, I get the wrong order and so does my boyfriend. They take ours away he gets his and I'm told mine was being made at the moment. About 20 mins later the manager comes and apologizes and still no food, he said 3 or 4 mins and 15 mins later I'm still waiting. This place needs to get it together, customer service sucks. At the end I left with no food... Will NEVER come back here again."

About 20 mins later the manager comes and apologizes and still no food, he said 3 or 4 mins and 15 mins later I'm still waiting. This place needs to get it together, customer service sucks. At the end I left with no food... Will NEVER come back here again."
