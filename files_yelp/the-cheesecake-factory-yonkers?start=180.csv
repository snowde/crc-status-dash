Karina C.,"Yonkers, NY",3,53,20,1.0,7/29/2015,"I've been going here for a lot for desserts or just dinner but recently had the WORST experience. My 2 friends and I were seated in the afternoon for lunch... The waitress looked tired and just handed us menu's and left without even telling us her name or anything.... We were then thirsty but she was no where to be found. We asked another waiter if it was okay to be handed their usual bread and he handed it right away..... Our waitress still no where to be found. She then came and took our orders with attitude and didn't bother to come around. We asked nicely to separate pay our orders with debit card and we repeated for her to understand our irritating request..... She then came back and messed it up. Worst service I have ever had in my life, will not be going to this location ever again."
David R.,"Yonkers, NY",278,3,2,2.0,12/13/2015,"This occued Dec. 12, 2015. Terrible family dining experience. After waiting 1hr 10min we finally get seated when my daughter noticed food spots on eating utensils. We asked for plastic utensils. After ordering food, drinks & eating flat bread appetizer & waiting an additional 25 min to be served main meal. My Factory Burrito was huge size but food was luke warm & the plate was very hot in temperature. The taste was below average (missing the bam factor). So hungry & so disappointed. Service was not the good paying little to no attention to use. Once we payed for food I had a valet ticket for 2hr & because they took such a long time to serve it was expired & I had to pay. I returned to The Cheesecake Factory & spoke to Manager Alex explaining the outcome & terrible dining experience. He not once apologized nor showed empathy. He was hesitant to pay but once I told him I was getting in contact with owner her reimbursed me.  Defiantly NOT WORTH THE WAIT!!!"
Janet S.,"Bronx, NY",0,3,,1.0,1/17/2016,"IF YOU LEAVE THE BUILDING WITH THE PAGER IT DEACTIVATES AND YOU LOSE YOUR PLACE IN LINE... I just thought I should let the world know since they don't tell you that... All they say is it only works in the building... So if your wait is 45 minutes, don't assume you can run to any of the stores briefly and come back.... Shame on all of you..."
Zacha F.,"Bronx, NY",0,18,4,1.0,3/21/2016,We went there yesterday for a late lunch. My husband and I order the same dishes we both end up sick all night (food poisoning)! This is place is disgusting!!! I am so upset. I even didn't touch the chicken in my plate nothing was looking cook. I am sorry to say but this place is disgusting.
Daniel R.,"Eastchester, Bronx, NY",141,21,34,1.0,8/18/2014,"Very VERY disappointed. Service was disgusting from the start but that could have just been me as I seem to attract it. Aside that the food was just about right although I had grown the distaste by the time it came.  The food took far foo long to be brought out.  I cannot even write I proper review because I'm still far too upset about the service. My mojito was ""ehh"""
Jess F.,"Bronx, NY",6,20,36,3.0,8/2/2015,"I usually have the Bacon Bacon Burger, which I love. It's an okay spot. Foods good (might be pricey for some) every time I've gone I've never had to wait too long or at all. The only thing I don't like is that it's dim at times. Other than that I'd go again."
Natalie C.,"Hoboken, NJ",4,19,,2.0,10/10/2015,Food is terrible at this location. This is now the second time I've tried here and it's the second time my stomach is in knots. Food is super greasy and oily. Tried something that I've had at another location and what they served here was just terrible. My waiter was very nice and the front desk is so so. Not going to try this place a third time around.
Stephanie B.,"Manhattan, NY",116,104,104,5.0,5/26/2015,"Sean H. Was my server, and honestly WOW!!!!! What an amazing representation of his company he did! I really hope this guy becomes a trainer or manager. He was on point for everything. INCREDIBLE best visit to the Cheesecake Factory was today because of him! Macaroni and Cheese balls were delish! Zucchini sticks YUM!!!! And the burgers what an amazing delight! Thank you Sean! Cooks and Cheesecake Factory!"
Tiffany H.,"Hoboken, NJ",19,13,4,3.0,7/4/2015,"It's the typical Cheescake Factory - the food is good and the scene is decent. 3 stars because they could stand to control the pests better - During our entire dinner, small gnats flew around and tried to land on our food/drinks. Service was a bit slower as well. The restaurant wasn't crowded but it still took a LONG time for 2 burgers and fries."
Cat B.,"Yonkers, NY",229,3,,5.0,4/24/2015,Love this place!  Buffalo blasts and cashew chicken. ...YUM....to finish it off with so many awesome cheesecakes.
Jessica R.,"Yonkers, NY",76,6,2,1.0,6/14/2016,"I have never been to the cheese cake factory before so i decided today was going to be the day. I walked in and was greeted , and when asked to be seated outside they tried seating me in the sun. I saw a table in the shade that needed to be cleaned to able to seat so i asked if i could sit there. I waited another 10 minutes and when walking towards the table i had to wait another 5 minutes because someone forgot all their trays. When they came to get the tray they dropped water all over the seat, so another 10 minutes was placed waiting for someone to come dry it. When seated our waiter was so dull, she didnt seam to care and when asked about the bread she seemed irritated about the question. We asked for a towel because the table was still wet and she came over dropped it and left. We got our things and left ! I never felt that kind of negativity before. It was bad, i wont be going back or recommending them to anyone!"
Simon P.,"New York, NY",103,174,37,3.0,4/23/2014,"What to say about Cheesecake Factory? Your mouth starts watering and arteries start clogging at the very though of their food. The dining embodiment of American excess. A day's worth of calories in an entree. Awesome!  Cheesecake Factories are a standard 4-stars in my opinion but this place sees so much traffic and seems so poorly managed that I've got to dock them at least a star. Expect sub-par service, insane wait times and mobs of hungry people. But at least you'll be too sleepy after your meal to care all that much!"
Jonathan T.,"Bronx, NY",19,4,,5.0,11/10/2015,Very good service great food loved the atmosphere. Was there with my wife celebrating our anniversary last night.
Jennifer L.,"Yonkers, NY",1,4,4,4.0,12/14/2014,"Love it here the drink Georgia  is amazing the only problem is the wait if you don't reserve a table than sometimes you'll be waiting 30-45 mins , that's why i always reserve a table , other than that the food is good and the service is on point"
Lana M.,"New York, NY",47,33,19,4.0,1/16/2015,"You can't go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory. Their menu is pretty much like a book in itself, and they have something for everyone. I love that they have a separate skinny menu now, too. I've been to other Cheesecake Factory locations before, but this one is the best I've been to as far as service goes. If you like avocado, definitely order the avocado eggrolls as an appetizer! They're amazing.  Also.. I heard that the reason why The Cheesecake Factory is the only restaurant in Ridge Hill that validates parking is because they bought up all the rights to do so exclusively before they opened the Ridge Hill complex..."
Lawrence W.,"Bronx, NY",7,5,19,4.0,9/3/2014,"It's pretty cool,  the food is great, the drinks could be a little stronger and the dessert is to die for. I'm not a real big cheesecake fan but I must admit,  the cheesecake here leaves you wanting more. The service could be better, the staff can be a little ratchet but you can look past that."
Jerry M.,"New York, NY",17,157,25,3.0,11/5/2013,"Yes, The Cheesecake Factory is tacky. Yes, the dishes can be repulsive, the menu is overwhelming, service is mediocre, and portion sizes are disturbingly large. It's a chain restaurant that represents much of what is wrong with this country - obese individuals perusing the menu with the 2000+ calorie salads and not batting an eye, then, they bring it home to enjoy as a late night snack. Now that I've said that, I also must say - I love it here. I hate myself for eating here, I really do, but if someone suggests it, I'm game. The buffalo blasters are the most gluttonous, mouth-watering, artery clogging appetizer I have ever enjoyed. In my perfect world, we could all eat buffalo blasters for breakfast, lunch, and dinner without ever having to worry about our skyrocketing cholesterol levels and collapsing life expectancy. Yes, they are that good - the pinnacle of appetizers. I've tried a number of entrees here, they all have the same theme - am I supposed to eat this by myself? Yes, you are. Buckle up and enjoy the ride. Each dish feels as if it was created for everyone to enjoy regardless of your particular taste nuances - from newborn baby to Michelin 3 Star Chef. The Cheesecake Factory isn't for everyone, but I can guarantee that anyone will be able to find something on the menu and enjoy - how can I hate on that?"
Deb R.,"Bronx, NY",13,63,,2.0,1/18/2015,"We arrived at 4:30 Sat afternoon (off hour). Between the wait (30 minutes) and the SLOW service, after 1 hour in the restaurant we had only been seated and given water. No one took our order until we had been there for an hour and a half! The food was mediocre - each entre had something wrong. Bland food, undercooked veges. A chicken and shrimp dish with no chicken. The ladies room was DISGUSTING. I don't understand why we keep going there. Next time, we'll order in chinese and get a big cheesecake combo from Costco, save a TON of money, and don't give this place our business. Our server was Janice, and she stunk."
Michael K.,"Wykagyl, NY",29,20,45,1.0,12/22/2013,"They refused to take a reservation for our party of 8 that included a special needs child that cannot spend a lot of time in his wheelchair. When I heard this, I asked if I could call ahead, they let us know how long the wait is and we'd plan accordingly. The manager refused and said since we were a large party we'd have to just show up. Well we get there and are told it's a 90 minute wait. It's Sunday night, we've been out all day and we're starving. So we wait. Luckily, it was 'only' 75 minutes but DD is done. He's uncomfortable and this wait hasn't helped.  The waitstaff was great in getting DD's food going first but he's ready to go home. He eats and my sister in law has take him to the van while we finish our dinner. $300 and she can't even enjoy the meal.  To be clear, we respected the no reservation policy. But I feel the workaround was more than fair. If we had known it was a 90 minute wait before we got there, my nephew could've come later and not have spent so much time in the wheelchair. There also would not have been the tension in our party and my sister in law would've been able to enjoy her meal. Maybe the manager didn't feel empowered to make this accommodation and that's sad."
Carolyn T.,"Manhattan, NY",64,33,28,5.0,6/6/2015,"I love this place! There's something for everyone. If you can't find something you like here then you need to stay home! Cheesecake is AMAZING. My favorite is the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake! The Avocado Egg Rolls are DELICIOUS!!! I'm always trying something new for my entree, but I have yet to be disappointed!"
