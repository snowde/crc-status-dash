Marisela V.,"Boca Raton, FL",12,101,11,5.0,3/14/2015,"What can I say, when you want to splurge and not worry about calories this is my favorite place.  The Cheesecake Factory nachos are my appetizer of choice and the red velvet cheesecake, Heaven."
Mary R.,"Bronx, NY",14,28,4,1.0,1/17/2015,"When I went on a Saturday night, the hostess told me the wait was 45 minutes. An hour and a half later and I'm still not seated! And when I asked the hostess where I was on the list she said there's a few tables ahead of us and couldn't give me a time. The staff was rude and the complete underestimation of wait time was terrible. Won't be returning."
Wendy F.,"Austin, TX",105,30,1,1.0,3/13/2013,"Horrendous. We were a party of 6, with a 6 month old baby.  They waitstaff requested for us not to keep the stroller in the aisle - understandable.  However, they did not have a high chair that could accommodate a car seat, nor a chair that was safe for a child of that size.  We can't be the only people who have ever brought a child that small! For the 6 of us to have 2 rounds of drinks, 3 appetizers, and a bunch of burgers, it took over 2 hours from start to finish.  Mind you, this was at 7:30 on a Monday night - not exactly prime time dining. We were hoping to get in and out quickly to get the baby to bed, but so much for that. In regards to the service, very much like the others who have written about this location, the service was very slow.  Took at least 25 minutes to get our drinks after ordering, and 30 minutes after arrival to even put in our orders.  We had originally ordered 4 appetizers for table, and when only 3 showed up, we asked the waitress and she said ""oh, we didn't have any.  Don't worry, I took them off the bill"".  Really? We would have LOVED to have ordered another app to replace our original order, but by the time she asked we were already halfway through our appetizers and didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for one last dish.   For our meals, they brought out 5 out of 6.. the last, which was just some sort of chicken fingers, didn't come for 15 minutes.  The MOD was kind enough to take it off of our bill, but still.  We were all so annoyed by the time we finished our meals, we didn't even stay around for the birthday cheesecake we had originally come for.   Will NOT come back. Not worth the amount of time or poor service."
Richard R.,"Bronx, NY",1,8,,1.0,3/1/2015,HORRIBLE SERVICE. Had to walk out. Server never came. Waited over 30 minutes to be sat down. There was no inside the restaurant so I wasn't sure why it took them so long to sit us down. I believe management has been lacking and the employees seem not to care anymore.
Kaylan N.,"Cortlandt, NY",0,5,,1.0,2/23/2013,"Tonight was by far the most horrible experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I've had bad experiences at this particular Cheesecake Factory before, but I keep on giving it a chance because I enjoy the food and the close proximity to my house.  Last time I went to the Yonkers Ridge Hill location, I ordered the chicken parm sandwich and they forgot to take out the layers of parchment paper before serving me the sandwich. I took a bite of my sandwich to find myself taking a bite of wax paper. The manager was very sorry and refired my order.  By the time I got a new sandwich, my whole table was done eating their meal. However, he did take the sandwich off the bill. Needless to say after twenty minutes of waiting, I asked for a box to take my food to go.  Tonight, we went to at 7:30. We walked up to the hostess and she said the wait would be 30-40 minutes. On a Saturday night at that time, we expected to wait for a little while. We waited for 30 minutes, 40 minutes, 1 hour and finally an hour and twenty minutes went by. I finally went up to check with the hostess after I saw several people that arrived after us be seated. The hostess looked in the computer and couldn't find our reservation at all. She said there was no record of our name or timer number. AFTER 1 hour and 20 minutes of waiting we weren't on the list! She quickly apologized and said we would be the next table seated. Then she proceeded to seat another table of two. As soon as we noticed this we brought it to her attention, she apologized again, and finally after 1 hour and 30 minutes, we were seated. We waited three times the promised wait time.  We get to our table and wait 5,10, 15 minutes. No one comes to greet us, take our drink order, nothing. I went up to the hostess station and brought this to her attention. I walked back to our table and someone came to the table to take our drink order, we said we were ready to place our whole order because we waited so long and were beyond starving, but we were quickly told ""I'm not your waiter, but I'll take your drink order.""  Finally, after almost 20 minutes of sitting at a table, the saving grace of our meal, Allan R. took our drink order. He was extremely apologetic and accommodating. Allan quickly took our order and got us our meal. Our food was very good. The manager took the appetizer off of our bill for our troubles. However, the fact that we had to wait 2 hours for a meal was completely unacceptable. The manager knew that they messed up with our reservation and said nothing. The manager knew that no one showed up at our table to take our order and only after the two hours of waiting did he approach us. He was very kind once he approached us and apologetic, but at that point, it was too late.  My fiancee and I frequent the Cheesecake Factory because of it's expansive menu and good food. However, these huge mistakes in customer service are far to frequent for my liking. We will not be returning to the Cheesecake Factory in Ridge Hill. By looking at the reviews on Yelp, it seems that this is a reoccurring problem. Perhaps corporate needs to take a closer look the customer service in the Yonkers Ridge Hill Cheesecake Factory because there are a lot of unacceptable issues. They got 1 star because Yelp doesn't allow you to give 0 stars. Save your cash and go to The Yard House."
Teresa B.,"Pasadena, CA",440,304,466,3.0,12/16/2012,"Oh how I wanted to love my east coast experience of ""The Cheesecake Factory"" because of the west coast tastes that I used to have. I admit that, in Los Angeles, I used to have an affinity for the convenience of chain restaurants like Chili's, Moose McGillycuddy's, or  ::gasp:: TGI Fridays. In fact, my boo's daughter chose to have her graduation party at a ""Cheesecake Factory"" in San Diego. Located in the wonderful, new Ridgfield open-air mall, near the iconic Stew Leonards: I picked this restaurant as a starting point of my weekend get-away from the energy of NYC. Sadly, I was not impressed . Twice, for brunch, the concept of a over-medium egg wasn't  accomplished. The second time embarrassingly so. My food got cold waiting. Another server tried to appease me. The manager came over. Our server avoided eye contact. I'll exaggerate and say that it took an half hour for my eggs, But close enough! My review is because it has happened twice at this location."
Rachel L.,"Westchester Square, Bronx, NY",0,15,13,3.0,2/15/2015,Food was amazing however i ordered the lunch pasta fettucine with chicken and sun dried tomatoes and i found a chunk of rubber in my food and the waitress took a long time to give us our utensils and offered us bread but never gave it to us. It was a busy day but she didnt forget to give her other tables their utensils and bread...
K Lo ..,"New York, NY",2,56,,3.0,1/2/2014,"Just like any Cheesecake Factory joints, long wait lines to be seated. But once you are seated, services kicks in fast. Spoilt by choices,  high noise level and large serving sizes.  Only downfall is water down their drinks! Unless I a, starving for days, wills be a long time that I will go there again."
Joshua M.,"Bronx, NY",56,180,192,4.0,3/20/2013,"The cheesecakes speak for themselves. Don't ask any questions, pick a flavor and I GUARANTEE you'll love it. With that being said, the food is great, well prepared, never had a problem. It is pretty much always busy here so expect a minimum 20 minute wait. The ambience and decor sets you up for a calm relaxed evening out to dinner. Their menu suits all kinds of eating preferences from seafood, pasta, soup, chicken, beef ect. Overall, just go and see for yourself, pretty much the best restaurant in ridge hill"
Barbara R.,"Bronx, NY",30,58,1,1.0,9/20/2015,"I usually come to this place with family or friends , and the service is great . Tonight that wasn't the case, thanks to the poor service from our waiter. The bar was set low on how he communicated , upon the initial sit down greeting. Upon taking the order , he was less than enthused to make the modifications we asked for . My daughter wanted pizza, and guess what the place was out of pizza. I'm sure he knew this ahead of time, but giggling with his fellow colleagues was more interesting . Our food arrives, and the burger has the wrong cheese, medium well apparently , means rare! We bring this to his attention , and he saids well this the cheese it comes with? And it's a dollar extra so you know! Great customer service , I think not!! Never follows up with our table to ensure everything else is okay! Total highlight of the night , brings us the check, and continues to socialize with his colleagues . My daughter at this point is asleep at the table . We finally flag down another employee , so he can process the check. Sincerely hope someone in management read this , customers expect great service in addition to quality food."
Rosaly H.,"Bronx, NY",38,36,36,4.0,8/19/2013,"Cheesecake Factory never fails to deliver. This location is nice since it's right in the middle if a shopping center. I usually have the chicken costaletta. I've been to this particular one a couple times. It is very clean and the staff is very attentive.  The menu is very extensive and can be a bit overwhelming, but it is pretty good quality food no matter what the choice. It can get pretty busy so I would suggest planning accordingly. If you plan in going on a weekend expect to wait at least 15-20 min. There are several parking garages right by the restaurant, and you am have your parking validated, which is nice. But take note they only validate the first two hours."
Kali H.,"Bronx, NY",1,5,2,1.0,4/3/2015,"Waited for over an hour to be seated though we were told the wait would be 30 min and at the 30 min mark told we were only behind one other party. Lack of service because the server was clearly spread too thin and very flustered. Then my husband realized his chicken sliders were RANCID.. Complained.. Went and vomited in the BR.. Didn't pay the $10 for that dish, didn't get a sincere apology, and he's still sick after an entire day has passed. No idea what was in their frying oil or chicken, but watch out. This is not our 1st negative experience with this restaurant, but it will be our last."
Nara V.,"Fort Myers, FL",42,24,32,1.0,1/4/2015,Horrible service been here three time and had only one good experience out of 3 time.  Waitress forgot to give me a steak knife until toward the end of the meal. Had to request refill on my drink and everyone drink at my table. Utensils was dirty had to order hot water to clean it before use. Only my food was good three others whom had ordered did not like it nor finished it.  To sum it all up horrible service.
Sean L.,"Yonkers, NY",0,17,22,5.0,1/2/2015,"I have to give credit where credit is due, granted we only sat at the bar and had a drink and some appetizers, (fried avocado, zucchini and portobello mushrooms,  and the sweet corn tamales). The food was decorative and well prepared (almost artistic), and the bartender/ server was attentive, polite and knowledgeable about what we had ordered. Nothing at all to complain about, plus we got our parking validated. Will definitely be attending again."
Kathleen L.,"Yonkers, NY",169,133,1145,4.0,7/18/2013,Great tamales the warm asparagus sale Mnn and well so many cheese cakes
Natasha L.,"Yonkers, NY",0,4,5,1.0,7/30/2014,"The worst service I have ever experienced! The first few times I went, I didn't particularly mind the slow service, but the last few times I've gone were the final straw! I do not plan to ever go back. Here was my last experience: First I waited 2+ hours for a table when it was near closing time. Literally the entire restaurant was empty save for two people sitting in one section and one large party sitting in another section. Instead of just combining tables to get us seated quicker, they made us wait over 2 hours for the one large party to finish. At first I thought it was the group that was slow, but once we were seated I realized that it was clearly the incompetent wait staff.  They took so long to take our order, then when we finished, took even longer to bring the check after we had asked for it. At this point we were literally the ONLY people in the entire restaurant. They even turned on the lights and started cleaning up around us, and still would not bring out the check. They should have been eager to have us pay and leave.  When we finally did get the check our waiter somehow had trouble understanding that the credit cards were to cover the bill and the cash left over was the tip (and despite the terrible experience we were still generous and tipped 20%). He literally tried to stop us and say that we didn't tip him... I understand his fear because if I was as bad as he was I would think I wasn't getting anything either. Regardless, I felt that was incredibly rude.  In general the food is good, but not worth the frustration."
Carmen O.,"Manhattan, NY",110,285,73,2.0,2/27/2013,"The service just gets worse and worse here. It launched so good, what a shame. The last few times I've been here we've been seated quickly but had to wait about an hour for our food. This visit was no different. My family and I were seated promptly on a Saturday morning for an early lunch. The place was pretty empty with only a few tables occupied since they had only been open about 30 minutes. We had to ask for our water and beverages repeatedly. Our food took an hour to arrive and when it came they had forgotten my 3 year old's pizza. Our order consisted of a few egg dishes a burger and my daughter's pizza - not a complicated order and not one that should take an hour to prepare when only a few tables are seated. Furthermore, how can you forget a child's meal? They are the most important customer! By the time her pizza arrived we were finished eating and she had filled up on bread and fries. People that sat down after us were served before us - including a child with pizza! The server was replaced after the forgetting of the pizza situation and I believe he had messed up many orders and may have been sent home. We're done with this place and will just go to Brio or Yardhouse next time. Definitely not child friendly when you have to wait an hour to eat and fill up on bread waiting. Management needs to be replaced and the kitchen and expeditors for sure. Maybe if those were efficient the servers would get their heads out of their...clouds."
Angie A.,"Bronx, NY",1,8,2,1.0,12/29/2014,Ordered the spicy chicken sandwich with fries today at this location (Ridgehill Mall) It came with a side of buffalo sauce and french fries. The sauce was bland and didn't go well with the burger. The fries were old. Tasted like a dirty smelly tag in my mouth. Disgusting. I knew there was something wrong with them immediately. Came home to a bad stomach ache. I would think that a large food chain as such would have been on point with something like this-not.
Nat V.,"New Rochelle, NY",0,9,1,1.0,1/17/2013,"I am writing this because this place gave me food poisoning and I don't want others to have to go through this!!!   Normally I trust the Cheesecake factory.  I always eat at the one in White Plains (for years) and never have a problem.  I consistently received decent service and good food.  Sometimes there is a wait to be seated, but they've gotten a lot better over the years at seating you quickly.  Danbury, Rockland, and even in Florida I've eaten at the Cheesecake factories and no problems! Ate dinner at the RIDGE HILL cheesecake factory, and woke up early in the morning with horrible nausea that would not go away until I threw up their gross food.   Not only was this agonizing for me, but I had to miss work and lose clients due to this ordeal.  The horrible pain and nausea I had to endure caused me such turmoil that I could not even sit still because I was literally squirming from it until I threw up... UGH sorry to be so graphic, but I feel I have to warn people. The service was awful and they gave me the wrong food initially.  Then when I got my correct order they left out the mushrooms and asparagus from my and my fiance's hibachi steak."
Pina R.,"Mount Vernon, NY",36,110,35,3.0,9/14/2014,"I am giving this place 3 stars.. And I love Cheesecake Factory. But tonight my husband and I decided to have a ""late"" lunch. Service was slow.... We waited a 30 mins until we finally got our drinks and bread. Then we ordered appetizers.. My husbands fave are the avocado egg rolls and I love my Santorini farro salad (beets and goat cheese) yum. When you order an appetizer doesn't your main course come after hmm say about 20-25 mins ?? No... Our main course came 5 mins after which we were not finished with our appetizer. It is RUDE!!! Our main course got cold.. And my enchilada had NO flavor or taste to it. My husband steak Diane were a few bits of meat and mushrooms.. What happened to my favorite place???? Next time I'll order appetizer 1st then order my main course when I'm done. OMG"

He literally tried to stop us and say that we didn't tip him... I understand his fear because if I was as bad as he was I would think I wasn't getting anything either. Regardless, I felt that was incredibly rude.  In general the food is good, but not worth the frustration."
Carmen O.,"Manhattan, United States",110,285,73,2.0,27/2/2013,"The service just gets worse and worse here. It launched so good, what a shame. The last few times I've been here we've been seated quickly but had to wait about an hour for our food. This visit was no different. My family and I were seated promptly on a Saturday morning for an early lunch. The place was pretty empty with only a few tables occupied since they had only been open about 30 minutes. We had to ask for our water and beverages repeatedly. Our food took an hour to arrive and when it came they had forgotten my 3 year old's pizza. Our order consisted of a few egg dishes a burger and my daughter's pizza - not a complicated order and not one that should take an hour to prepare when only a few tables are seated. Furthermore, how can you forget a child's meal? They are the most important customer! By the time her pizza arrived we were finished eating and she had filled up on bread and fries. People that sat down after us were served before us - including a child with pizza! The server was replaced after the forgetting of the pizza situation and I believe he had messed up many orders and may have been sent home. We're done with this place and will just go to Brio or Yardhouse next time. Definitely not child friendly when you have to wait an hour to eat and fill up on bread waiting. Management needs to be replaced and the kitchen and expeditors for sure. Maybe if those were efficient the servers would get their heads out of their...clouds."
Angie A.,"Bronx, United States",1,8,2,1.0,29/12/2014,Ordered the spicy chicken sandwich with fries today at this location (Ridgehill Mall) It came with a side of buffalo sauce and french fries. The sauce was bland and didn't go well with the burger. The fries were old. Tasted like a dirty smelly tag in my mouth. Disgusting. I knew there was something wrong with them immediately. Came home to a bad stomach ache. I would think that a large food chain as such would have been on point with something like this-not.
Nat V.,"New Rochelle, United States",0,9,1,1.0,17/1/2013,"I am writing this because this place gave me food poisoning and I don't want others to have to go through this!!!   Normally I trust the Cheesecake factory.  I always eat at the one in White Plains (for years) and never have a problem.  I consistently received decent service and good food.  Sometimes there is a wait to be seated, but they've gotten a lot better over the years at seating you quickly.  Danbury, Rockland, and even in Florida I've eaten at the Cheesecake factories and no problems! Ate dinner at the RIDGE HILL cheesecake factory, and woke up early in the morning with horrible nausea that would not go away until I threw up their gross food.   Not only was this agonizing for me, but I had to miss work and lose clients due to this ordeal.  The horrible pain and nausea I had to endure caused me such turmoil that I could not even sit still because I was literally squirming from it until I threw up... UGH sorry to be so graphic, but I feel I have to warn people. The service was awful and they gave me the wrong food initially.  Then when I got my correct order they left out the mushrooms and asparagus from my and my fiance's hibachi steak."
Pina R.,"Mount Vernon, United States",36,110,35,3.0,14/9/2014,"I am giving this place 3 stars.. And I love Cheesecake Factory. But tonight my husband and I decided to have a ""late"" lunch. Service was slow.... We waited a 30 mins until we finally got our drinks and bread. Then we ordered appetizers.. My husbands fave are the avocado egg rolls and I love my Santorini farro salad (beets and goat cheese) yum. When you order an appetizer doesn't your main course come after hmm say about 20-25 mins ?? No... Our main course came 5 mins after which we were not finished with our appetizer. It is RUDE!!! Our main course got cold.. And my enchilada had NO flavor or taste to it. My husband steak Diane were a few bits of meat and mushrooms.. What happened to my favorite place???? Next time I'll order appetizer 1st then order my main course when I'm done. OMG"
