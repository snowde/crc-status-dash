Keith A.,"Yonkers, NY",0,1,,3.0,12/7/2015,Loved the chocolate mousse cake and the Hershey chocolate cake. Food was satisfactory. I'll be there for the cakes again
Audrey D.,"Yonkers, NY",4,45,2,3.0,10/25/2014,It's hit or miss with them.  But honestly I can't complain.  I've eaten here a few times and the food was good.
Ramish S.,"Yonkers, NY",25,5,,4.0,11/13/2012,"I've been to this location 3 times since it opened(the most recent being 2 days ago) and I must say, each time I went, the place got better and better. The first time was a disaster, with just my mom and I, it took the waiter(who barley checked up on us) almost one hour to take our order. No kidding. He kept saying the kitchen is busy but from what I could tell, the restaurant wasn't all that full. The food that came was bland and just a bad experience overall.  The second time seemed to be much better, with the order being taken right away(by a waitress who was in training, no less) and the food came out just in time. The second time, my entire family was with me, which includes my brother and my dad. However, one bothering thing was that there was a hair found in my dad's fish taco(which was pretty bland) and so the waitress automatically offered an apology, and brought a whole new plate of fish tacos out, free, of course. She said she was going to get the manager, but he never came. Not sure why we needed him anyways, since she managed it just fine. Overall, a decent experience.   The most recent time, the food came out at lightning speed and it tasted great too. It was me, my brother, and my mom, and we all had a great time. The waiter was really attentive, and even cracked some fresh black pepper into my caesar salad. The pastas my brother and I ordered were out of this world and my mom loved the veggie burger with the fries that were really crunchy. One thing that did bother me though, was that the waiter didn't really introduce himself fully into AFTER taking our order since he was so busy rushing the table's essentials such as ketchup and napkins. Overall, this experience was really awesome.  As for the cheesecakes, lets just say, you need to try them to believe it. ;)"
Gesselle C.,"New York, NY",79,212,294,1.0,5/26/2012,"Skip it. My friend and I have visited other CFs with no complaints but this location was horrible. My friend and I were locked in a conversation when the frazzled server abruptly interrupts with a rude, ""Did you decide?"" We actually hadn't because we were in a conversation, so we just ordered some water. We continue to chat she returns to the table with no water to ask us again, ""Did you decide?"" I asked her for the water, the expression on her face told me she had completely forgotten the water. She returns, more frazzled than before, with two dirty cups of water. I quickly spotted the dirty glasses and asked her for some clean cups of ice water.  Lunch took about two hours. My lunch had to be comp'ed because it was completely wrong order. After two hours, I left hungry and frustrated."
Christina T.,"Yonkers, NY",2,51,68,5.0,11/13/2015,"I've been to this location plenty of times and I've gotten good service and not so good service... You take that risk when you go out to eat, either you win or you lose... But my fiancé and I pretty much always win when it comes to CF, we went 11/12/15 and I ordered the factory chopped salad which is my absolute favorite salad ever and it was amazing as usual... And my husband ordered the crispy Cuban rolls again they were pretty good! For dinner I had the lemon herb roasted chicken which was sublime! Full of flavor, extra Juicy and just plain amazing as for my husband he had the white cheddar chilli but it wasn't his favorite ... To say the least you win some and you lose some ... Our server was ok I guess she kept insisting I was ordering to much food ""excuse me that salad isn't an appetizer portion"" umm thanks bitch I know I'm just fat lmao ( I'm pregnant btw) lol overall CF is great and can't go wrong with all the different varieties of cheesecake"
Alejandro T.,"West Bronx, NY",0,3,,2.0,6/23/2015,"Like most Cheesecake Factories, it's a good place to eat, but I've been here a couple of times and the same reoccurring issue with it for me is that there are flies everywhere all the time. I had killed three today and there were plenty more flying around."
Alexandra L.,"Corona, NY",0,2,,1.0,12/21/2015,We came here after watching movie at lux theater at ridgehill. The wait was really long both for seating and for the food came out. The server never paid attention to our table. The food was just plain. Not going to come back
Eb T.,"Manhattan, NY",1,7,,2.0,5/11/2014,"Today's visit was a very disappointing. Soooo slow....and we only ordered a cheesecake to go. What could possibly make putting two slices of cheesecake in plastic containers take thirty minutes? And on top of that one of the cheese cakes was wrong even though it says what it is on the receipt. Also, the women's bathroom was filthy, and it wasn't even that packed in the Restaurant. I recommend Cheese Cake Factory but not this location. The service has struggled this past year. It was great place when it opened few years ago. Maybe new management?"
Nita D.,"Yonkers, NY",52,27,11,3.0,10/4/2015,"Only reason I gave 3 stars because of food and my server otherwise nothing. Table was not clean crumbs are every where even on our napkins. How does that happened? There was a very long hair on one of the plate and I was surprise the person who put it there didn't see it because I saw it before we sat down. Utensil still had dry food on it. Took my family for lunch and have to tell them to ignored it and this is coming from me who is not picky when it's come to thing like this. Menus was very, very dirty. It's smell and feel like it been rubbed in oil. I almost trip on my face because one of the staff bumped in to my back and step on my foot no apology not even a glance I thought he was carry food or something but because he was rushing to laugh about something with other server. Oh but his friend saw me and try to say sorry about what happened. Food was quick and my server was nice. This place need to be more clean for the reputation of the company. I used to only go to the one in white plains and thought may be This one is closer to home but I guess this won't be on my list next time I want Cheesecake Factory."
Rackie Y.,"New York, NY",0,5,,4.0,9/16/2013,"Yay: Tasty,Yummy Dishes Nay: Huge portions.You can see everyone carrying a bag after their meal The Verdict: I will be back,definitely!"
Kris M.,"Mohegan Lake, NY",2,25,13,1.0,8/18/2014,"I wish I could give this restaurant 0 stars for the HORRIBLE service! I have ordered take out three times (trying to give the benefit of the doubt) and all three times, I have had the same problems. To start, my order is NEVER correct despite repeating it to the server and having him/her repeat it back. Second, when I pick up my food half of my order is missing (especially vital items such as salad dressing). Lastly, it takes at least 10 minutes to speak with a manager and when you finally do, you get a rude response and have to wait another 15 minutes for your missing items. The staff are not friendly and the managers do not live up to their job expectations. I have been to at least 5 other Cheesecake locations and have never had a complaint. However, EVERY TIME I visit this location it is an issue. My advice....stay away from this location!!!"
Vinnie B.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,82,4,1.0,12/29/2011,"Skip it. Seriously. Unless you want to spend your whole day there, waiting. And waiting. Me and my buddies went for a quick business lunch and wouldn't you know, my sis and her friends were also there also waiting for a table. They told both parties it'd be about a 45-minute wait - but it took an hour. Then, 15 minutes until our drink orders were taken, 15 MORE minutes until our beers & soda were brought over (no straws for sodas, no  lime for the Corona)... The sloooooooow-moving, interestingly-manicured-facial-hair-having waiter took our food order - ANOTHER 45 minutes passed before we got the food - no ketchup for the fries, no dressing for the salad, and it was time for another TWO beers... Just a disaster. We yelled over to my sister's table across the room as we were getting ready to leave, and she and her friends STILL HADN'T BEEN SERVED. Go to the Yard House two blocks up. This place sucks it. Badabing and how YOU doin'."
Marc Jansen B.,"Bronx, NY",75,93,1,4.0,12/27/2011,"Cheesecake factory. Killer prices and killer food (In both the positive and negative contexts). A lengthy wait, perhaps? That came to truth on my further visit to this newly opened restaurant of delights (10/20/11, according to our jolly waiter). I waited for a half hour before a fairly attractive receptionist guided me to the booth I requested. A booth next to the bar where I could see pretty much everything. That was when I discovered why the wait was so long - the patrons were chatty as teen-aged socialites and the waitstaff seemed to be clunky. That can only mean one thing! The kitchen is distributing fantastic food at the speed of tortoises trapped in quicksand. I've noticed that people like to talk more if the food is truly awesome. When that is combined with an overburdened kitchen, then there will be long waiting lines. Aha! I am a mathematical genius full of concerns on culinary efficiency. I digress. That burger with pulled pork really did hit the spot at 12.50$. The finest pork I've had this December, as a matter of fact. It was the sauce, however, that really got me. It was like this sweet and salty ninja that creeped into my taste buds. The burger kinda reminded me of a gourmet sloppy Joe's sandwich.  Also, there was this peculiar, yet delectable appetizer that a fellow patron ordered between the two of us. Artichokes with two separate sauces. There was a bunch of peeling involved, so I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who had their fingers sliced off by pirates. Otherwise, you can just dig your digits in and dip each cut into the sauces. It was a healthy and appetizing course.  No, I will not yelp about their cheesecakes. They are all too joyful to include in this report. Just pick them by yourselves.  Aside from the lethal waiting times, I was impressed by this new Cheesecake Factory. If I had the power to do so, I would award a medal to their bathrooms. They have one of those fancy doodads that dry your hands using science. Try it for yourself and I'm pretty sure you would give them a medal, too!"
Olette T.,"Scarsdale, NY",0,17,,1.0,8/23/2015,"The last time we ate here, the wait for the food was too long, then we want the untouched food to be wrapped to go, we never got it back because the waiter claimed they throw it by mistake.  Bad customer service."
Mark M.,"Bogota, NJ",3,4,,3.0,12/22/2013,No effort made by management to seat my brother-in laws family who has a special needs son. Ya they take no reservations but absoluty no effort to accommodate them at all calling ahead of time. Disappointing to say the least.  However I will say when they where seated food and especially service went above and beyond. Management however was just lame. Frankly I find it appalling on that end. PEACE
Ryan D.,"Hastings-on-Hudson, NY",4,20,,2.0,2/13/2014,"one word: MESS. not trying to be rude but the truth is painful. It's not so much the food thats bad it's the service thats terrible. First of our server was very slow to take orders,get drinks,and give food. Second the place was LOUD very LOUD babies crying, people fighting the list goes on and on.  Bottom line... very busy place, so-so food... not a relaxing and enjoyable."
Amy A.,"New Rochelle, NY",0,6,,4.0,10/2/2015,Love the lemonades! And the bread they serve you. I usually get the fettuci alfredo pasta but the last time it was too hard.
Michelle A.,"Bergen County, NJ",11,37,11,1.0,11/27/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory but this location is by far the worst. The service was terrible. We waited over an hour to be seated. The place wasn't even full. The hostess had an attitude. The food was good like it usually is. After our meal we decided to order cheesecake to go, which took them 20 minutes to bring to our table. Will not be going back to this location."
Betty Ming L.,"Westchester County, NY",60,357,42,3.0,7/4/2012,"Pretty room. Service is friendly and efficient. Also like the fact that the menu includes calorie counts. But there's something about the food....it's totally okay but not outstanding. The trick is, don't go for the food. Go for a convenient night out. On that level, Cheesecake Factory works fine."
Melanie S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,23,,1.0,8/8/2013,"OMG, painful painful painful.  I think we are finally sticking to the 3 strikes rule.  Any time and every time I go here, the meal comes quick and then the waitstaff just disappear.  Poof.  The last time, I almost debated dining and dashing because it took probably upwards of 30 minutes to flag someone down for our check.  The place is busy, so hire more waitstaff!  I don't understand how hard that concept is. It's sad because the place is huge, gorgeous, and the food is mostly pretty good.  My favorite is the banana cheesecake.   This location is just mismanaged.  I'm not sure what the issue is but I do feel like it's waiter/waitress 101 to check on the table occasionally.  That isn't rocket science, is it? And also a few times I've gone, our waiters have tapped out to go on break, and someone replaces them yet they never come to us.  So we get left in limbo for x amount of time, plus the time the original waiter is on break.  It's absurd.  They would actually make MORE money if they moved tables through more quickly and could seat people sooner.   Last time we tried continuously to make eye contact and I feel like they were purposely not looking at us.  I guess I'll try another location but for this one, it's game over."
