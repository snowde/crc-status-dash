Anthony L.,"OZONE PARK, NY",34,118,5,3.0,6/23/2014,"Decided after Legoland to try the infamous Cheesecake factory. LONG wait to get a table and from the SLOW service, I can see why it takes so long for tables. IT wasn't even that busy inside. Food was as expected, glorified diner food. Cheesecake I brought home.. was good but definitely had better. Overall.. Meh. I can say I tried it but would not go back to another."
Patricia F.,"Budd Lake, Mount Olive Township, NJ",78,106,598,3.0,6/7/2012,"The atmosphere was nice and it wasn't crowded. The staff was friendly, food was good and prices affordable."
Arnold F.,"East Harlem, Manhattan, NY",1,37,,1.0,5/8/2015,Stopped by one evening and walked in for dinner. The place was not full was taken to a table immediately. Was shown a table but asked for a booth the host looked puzzle and made up every excuse not to give us one.  I persisted as the restaurant was half empty. Then was finally directed to a booth. Sat down and waited for waiter. He showed up 10 minutes later. We ordered drinks   Then we ordered entrees. I asked him what he suggested on menu.  He was bewildered.  Not familiar with menu.  He then blurted out some pasta dish. We waited 40 minutes.  And we did not receive any service.  We were totally ignored.  He passed by our table and looked surprised that we were still there.  He brought us our drinks. We asked him for water.  And he ignored us.  We were DISGUSTED with the service. We walked out. We noticed other tables with their food. Guess cheese cake factory treats people differently. We have a different president.  A shame things like this still happen in 2015.
Derrick D.,"Yonkers, NY",0,1,,1.0,9/1/2015,"First let me say I have been a fan from back in the day when I lived in Atlanta and that's were they started, then came back to NY and the one in LI was great, then white plains and that one is awesome as well. But this one in Ridge Hill, slow, foods cold, take out waited for 45 minutes, attitude from staff. My first complaint slash letter to corp was given a gift card and an apology from one of the managers. This time along with my letter to corp on this bad service restaurant I don't even want a gift card or free dinner. Simply put I will not spend my hard earned money and valuable time in this establishment."
Ramón B.,"New York, NY",129,27,6,4.0,2/22/2014,I have always heard about this place in folklore from many people that I know like it was the best place on earth.  I had to try for myself to see what the hype is about.  The food was good nothing that TGIFriday or Olive Garden would have cause I hate both chains.  The burger I had was good but the thing that they are famous for is their cheesecake as I was told.  I ordered a slice to go since I was full and ate it at home the next day.  In my opinion the cheesecake was delectable minus the food.  The food is good but I will validate them on their cheese.  I think its not worth the food but if you like cheesecake then its worth it.  This location just recently opened I think and is mostly for the mall crowd that after a long day of shopping should go here to take a load off and eat to their hearts content.
Dana P.,"Yonkers, NY",0,11,1,1.0,8/21/2014,Place has the worst service everrrrrrr ....take a trip up to white plains or the palisades .
Teresa S.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",7,22,6,1.0,11/18/2013,"I don't understand why this location can't get it together.  Besides receiving poor service on multiple occasions (even when the restaurant is practically empty), I once went home with an incomplete dish I ordered to go (I guess it's my fault for not checking the bag. $25 dish with only meat and no side!)  On TWO occasions, I've waited 20 mins for bread and my order to be taken. On another occasion, 45 mins had gone by without being served our meals. Those three times, we decided to get up and leave.  The last straw happened last week. I ordered a st Francis Cabernet. When I received the drink, I noticed it tasted different. When we paid the check, I asked the waiter which drink he served me. He admitted he served me Beringer Cabernet because he couldn't find the wine I requested on his order screen.  Enough said. Shame on me for returning."
Ranjelle J.,"East Elmhurst, NY",2,37,4,1.0,3/4/2012,"I give five stars for the Oreo cheesecake (my obsession!) but not the restaurant service and the burger I ordered so here it goes... I don't know what the hell my sister was thinking, but she took us here for my birthday.   It was on a Thursday night so there was no line and the waiting time was not long.  The hostess was kind and gracious.  So I thought I would enjoy my birthday dinner here until a really rude waitress with damaged bleached blonde brittle hair came to serve.   The waitress was inattentive and had a diva attitude as if she does not like to be told what to do.  She totally forgot to bring some of the drinks we ordered.  My mom has asked for her coffee twice and the waitress brought it 30 minutes later without any apologies!.   However, what has ultimately outraged me that made me got up from my seat and ran to the manager was when this waitress rudely threw the straw into my mother's glass of water after my mom asked for a straw.  The manager came to our table but my mom lied to him and said everything was just allright, but thank goodness, he could tell that she was telling a lie!  Therefore, he asked that waitress to stand in a corner while he looked for a replacement.   Now as far as food is concerned, I ordered the blue cheese burger with sweet potato fries: BIG MISTAKE!  The sweet potato fries were overfried and gross!  The burger was just okay. Not that much of a blue cheese topping when I checked. But look on the bright side: they still have their famous Oreo cheesecake, which is to die for!!"
Louise F.,"New York, NY",2,113,35,4.0,2/8/2012,"I've been there three times with one other person and have not had to wait.  Servers are friendly and know the menu.  If there was a long wait I'd just leave and go someplace else - so stop complaining people.  If they tell you there is a 45 minute wait just leave.  It's not the Ritz guys, it's the Cheesecake Factory!  I would never wait to eat at a chain restaurant more than 10-15 minutes.  Now, if they told you 10 minutes and you waited an hour I understand the resentment but again at some point you have to throw in the towel and leave.   They have a huge menu which can appeal to almost anyone and the food is more than decent.  Prices aren't bad so I'm sticking with 4 stars.  I'd recommend it."
Eric K.,"Scarsdale, NY",0,44,,5.0,6/16/2013,"I think people put the Cheesecake Factory down because it's a chain. All I know is that my family and I loved our dishes. My chicken enchiladas were better than the last dozen chicken enchiladas I've had at Mexican restaurants. The waiter was professional and incredibly friendly. He was always there before we needed refills for iced tea and soda. And of course the strawberry cheesecake is the best, and the plain cup of coffee could not have been better. For those who are worried about calories, they have an extensive menu of ""slim"" entrees. And there a ton of choices under $15.00. I actually think Cheesecake Factory is cheaper than most nice restaurants. And because you're at Ridge Hill, you can shop while waiting for your table to called; they give you that thing that lights up when your table is ready.  Enjoy!"
Scott C.,"Bronx, NY",7,6,6,4.0,4/27/2014,"Took my mother here for her birthday. I have to say I'm not a big fan of their meals....too generic for my taste, but I do enjoy the appetizers and the Ridgehill location is a great place for an afternoon of shopping.  It was pretty crowded for a Saturday afternoon, but we were seated quickly. Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful, and checked on us throughout our visit. The appetizers were delish as always....I recommend the fried mac n chesse!!!!!"
Carmen M.,"Manhattan, NY",11,39,28,5.0,6/24/2013,"My experience at this restaurant is practically impeccable. Always friendly service, always clean, the timing is also pretty good. Have had my share of plates and so far every single one has been amazing except one- I had a terrible chicken teriyaki dinner. The plate was overly lathered in sauce, the chicken was over cooked, just a bad dinner experience. However, besides this (and I'm talking about having been here at least 10 times) it always hits the spot. So many choices, all very tasty and good quality, and generous portions. Let's not forget all the dessert options which are extremely delicious! Never lets me down, definitely a must try place."
Natalie V.,"Manhattan, NY",271,42,3,4.0,1/3/2012,"Wait for service: 1 hr Decor, service and ambiance: Great! Food: Chicken Nachos appetizer ""big, great for sharing"" delicious!  Famous factory meatloaf: had better but can complain it was very tasty and the mash potato and corn sides just helped it be yummier Cheesecakes: perfect Onion rings and fries: not so crazy about  4 stars: mainly because of the servers and the appetizer and cheesecakes! Lol"
Shel B.,"Bronx, NY",60,171,90,2.0,11/21/2011,"They just opened in Yonkers, but we've been here a few times already, call us regulars, fine with me. The location is in I-87, if you dont have a car, get a cab. Had to pay $40 back and forth from the Woodlawn area. The place is busy  whenever we go. Maybe becuz they just opened?I dunno. Couple times, we just order drinks at d bar while waiting for a table. I ordered Mojito, and I always ask the bartender to put more club soda since I always get it sweet. Food:  I always order the herbed Salmon and Steak Diane combination with garlic mashed, also,try the ahi tuna tartar with wasabi and avocado ...my favorite for a starter and , chicken samosas .  I also have tried the Chicken Madeira, and its good. One time we ordered a shepards pie,the shepherds pie was burned and you can just taste the burned part!!  Quality of food is inconsistent. SERVICE:  Service can be very spotty but the servers are friendly.  There are times we have to wait two hours for our food. And when our food comes in, the starter and main course are served together=(. Sometimes, the waiter will just give us the check without asking if we want dessert!!!! They validate the parking though, just give your server your parking ticket...and they have to validate it of course, because you have waited three hours in total.....at least???"
S. F.,"Bronx, NY",0,8,,4.0,3/18/2015,"I've been to this location several times and always had a positive experience. I went in for a late lunch. Hubby and I shared the calamari appetizer, he had the Jamaican shrimp entree and I had the shrimp and pasta. I always find portions to be large enough to take half of it home. Of course we couldn't leave without a slice of the 30th Anniversary cheesecake.  Absolutely delicious!!"
Jaime T.,"New Rochelle, NY",27,9,,1.0,8/29/2014,This is by far the worst CF I have ever been to in the world ( even Dubai who's new to this is far better).  While we were waiting we had to use the restroom.  It was filthy!  There was no toilet paper in any of the stalls and people were using seat covers to wipe and paper was all over the floor.  I was grossed out even being in there.  After many people complained they finally put toilet paper in the restrooms but I didn't see any cleaning happening.  This place is fairly new it shouldn't look like a dump.  After sitting down our waitress took at least 10-15 mins to come and take our order.  After patiently waiting for at least 20-25 minutes the waitress came to our table to double check on what we ordered and then I saw her going to her monitor.  Did she really justttt put in our order 20+ minutes after we initially ordered?!?!? She definitely did because it took another 20 minutes from that point for us to get our food! I was livid!  Worst experience ever!!!
Victoria J.,"Hartsdale, NY",0,19,9,3.0,2/23/2015,The wait is long but the food is good! I really like their outdoor patio with the space heaters in the summer or fall months. My waited didn't come around a lot which was annoying I had to find another one to ask for anything I needed. But there food is overall good. A little pricey.
Ariana C.,"Bronx, NY",221,52,58,5.0,8/26/2013,"I don't know why this place got so many bad reviews. I've been here 3 times and every time I have a wonderful experience. I must say though that I've only been here for drinks and appetizers. The times I've been there have been during dinner and the wait has never been long. The waiters are very friendly and attentive. I personally love their mojitos, they are delicious and they have just enough alcohol. The bread they serve is extra good, specially when it's warm.. YUMM! I always order the lobster artichoke dip, & it's always superb! I have had nothing but good experiences here!"
Jeff G.,"Manhattan, NY",14,18,,2.0,10/19/2013,Hostess are not as friendly although everything else is just ok. Best things in this Cheesecake is the location which is very nice and so is the decor.
