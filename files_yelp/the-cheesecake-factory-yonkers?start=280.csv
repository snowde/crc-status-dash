Kenisha L.,"Bronx, NY",7,6,2,4.0,6/5/2013,"I have frequented the Cheesecake Factory establishment many times and have grown the innate ability to identify the differences in quality of the food and customer service. I can honestly say that the customer service at this fairly new Cheesecake Factory restaurant impeccable. The manager (Ben) is very accommodating and understanding of the true meaning of high-quality customer service.  I ordered a dinner to-go that unfortunately did not make it home with me, I was a little irritated as I was assured by my waitress that everything was there and I was charged accordingly. Upon realizing that my husband's dinner never made it home I contacted the restaurant at once. I spoke with the manager on-duty (Ben) who apologized profusely, accepted responsibility and removed the item along with my desserts as an added incentive. I was especially surprised at the latter as this form of customer service is long gone and unheard of in our ""feed 'em and street 'em"" dining environment. This form of upmost, high-quality customer service proves to be the best form of advertisement as I was especially pleased and would return on any occasion.  Food is amazing as well, especially compared to the restaurant in White Plains which appears rushed and has less than impressive customer service."
Nisha H.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,2,5.0,2/2/2014,Great place . Never had a issue here ever and I always take a dish and a slice of red velvet to go
Danie S.,"West Bronx, NY",0,1,,1.0,3/19/2015,I had the worst service from a server name SHANTONIA this lady not only over charged me but had nasty service and attitude and almost dropped my buffalo wings in my lap...she was very inattentive and poor communication skills. Worst service ever I will never go back! Over all the food was good though.
Steve L.,"Yonkers, NY",2,29,,3.0,2/29/2012,"Despite the high-calorie content of most of these dishes i can't help but indulge anyways. They do offer a skinny menu for those with more will-power. I had the Crabcake sandwich which was exquisite and snickers cheese cake was too except it    was more like a mush of cake rather than a slice. The food is 4-5 star but the service brings it way down. I asked for a glass of wine which I declined after the wait staff asked me four times ""what did you want again?"" Salad dressing for my companion took 20min. The bellini had almost no alcohol and when we complained they said that corporate mandates small pours. Its hard to get past the service to enjoy the food at least for me."
L E.,"Westchester, NY",31,100,,2.0,9/29/2012,"The good news is there isn't as much of a wait during peak hours as other CCFs and they cover the ridiculous parking fees charged by Ridge Hill Yonkers for the ""priviledge"" of shopping or eating there. The bad news is based on my experience (and on others in reading the reviews), this CCF still has some kinks to work through months after opening.  I took my Mom here for dinner on a Friday night. Although the waittress was very nice, she did not do what she should have done to make good on the meal. My Mom ordered a vege-burger from the health-conscious menu. She really didn't enjoy it after it fell apart (and it wasn't all that good to begin with). She told the waittress this, but her response was ""I guess you'll have to eat it with a fork"", instead of ""would you like me to get something else for you?"". The couple next to us also had an issue with their salmon and their waiter offered them something else and voluntarily had the manager come over to offer his apologies.  I had a small salad and the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, which although the pasta was overdone, was extremely tasty.  I think after this restaurant works through some issues, they will probably be fine. But not yet."
Phil B.,"New York, NY",24,78,3,2.0,7/20/2013,"Needs a complete formula makeover. I have had some adequate meals here, but  overall Generous portions with subpar quality. Instead of adding a healthier ""skinny"" menu, they should give less food, healthier, and higher quality food. Basically its a place for fat people and families w kids"
Paul A.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",0,35,,1.0,5/10/2013,"This place is run like s**t. Last Monday on my sons 16th Birthday we decided to give this location a try. Came in to a bunch of servers Bsing at the entrance. Who runs this place? Not so busy, but real hard to get a clean table it appears. 6 of us waited for a table, after a 15 minutes we were brought to a booth, hey, guess what? Not clean. Looked like a real circle jerk, who cleans the table? No one, wait, crickets, we left. WTH? Went to the ""yard house"". Rock on ""Yard House"". Professional service, well done!!!! Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake is good, food is marginal, service is poor. I can not see long term success for this brand name."
Mary D.,"Etobicoke, Canada",4,191,20,3.0,1/26/2013,"Had a decent meal here.   Service was a bit slow at times.  My Mom asked for more dressing for her salad, and 5-10 mins later was still waiting, and she had stopped eating while she waited, so that was a bit frustrating.  Food is pretty satisfying overall.   Staff are friendly.    Casual atmosphere, but nice enough."
B K.,"Yonkers, NY",0,1,,2.0,12/7/2013,This place sucks plain and simple. Over priced for no reason at all. The service is horrible !!!! Had to wait all night for my steak
sam s.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,,1.0,12/7/2014,"HORRIBLE SERVICE / HORRIBLE ATTITUDE  DISGUSTING FOOD!! I normally will never think of writing a review, but this service was atrocious. At first glance the waitress, EBONY was very nice, but we noticed she seemed rushed. She did not write our order down but we thought nothing of it at first. 1. Appetizers came out at the same time as our meal.  2. We asked for separate plates and never received them 3. Asked for ketchup 5 times and only received it once we saw a bus boy passing thru, so we asked him. 4. We order 4 meals and only 3 came out because she never ordered it. 5. We order a small hamburger and it was burnt, completely burnt. we tried eating around the burnt areas but it was horrible.  We told EBONY about it and asked her if we could speak to the manager so they could replace it or take it out the bill. We waited 20 minutes and The manager never came to our table and she stated that the manager said that because we had taken some bites of the burnt hamburger that they couldn't do anything about taking off the bill.  And we were fine with that so we asked could they replace it because we were hungry. We also asked about the meal that had never came out and she excused herself as if it had been order but it wasn't. So We waited for our meals and once it came out (15 minutes later ) we decided to just take it home. BUT Once we got home we noticed the hamburger they had replaced, was completely raw and uncooked. Even though the service was horrible, we still tipped her 15% . Our bill was $100. Hopefully one day the service will change and managers and waitress will realize that their lively hood depends on the customers. If you having a bad day or are ready to go home and are rushing, you should think about the quality of service you are giving to the customers who ultimately are the ones who pay your salary."
Sean M.,"Jensen Beach, FL",2,3,,1.0,7/12/2013,"Worst service ever, waitress absolutely clueless, The manager on duty could care less, Dined there on 7/11/13. Stay away"
Steph A.,"Yonkers, NY",0,3,3,5.0,10/18/2013,"I am brutally honest so here you go. This location is the closest to the city and in a busy shopping area;  so it gets very busy. I read a lot if these reviews and honestly people if you dont want to wait dont go out on a weekend or holiday to a popular restaurant with 5+ people. The average family is 4 and they have to wait what makes anyone think that 7 to 8 people wont!?!  Food is delish. One guy in here complained about the calorie count. REALLY?? So stay home and cook. Its the cheesecake factory they cook with butter and sauces and other scrumptious stuff! I've seen the hostesses at this location get ripped because of the guests own fault. Oh you're a party of 2 get paged and like magic have a giant stroller with you or a kid you didnt count. Ive gone with and without children. They're people!!! They need to sit- they count!! Ive had good and bad servers but that's to be expected sometimes. But there are some that go above and beyond for you.   A heads up would be avoid friday nights, sat after 6 and sunday nights- guess why...its the weekend its busy.  CcF is in a mall with a movie theater with popular stores. I like Tuesdays if im in a rush.   The cheesecakes are to die for. The drinks not too strong cause its a family restaurant but the Typhoon is strong! Can't beat happy hour 4-6! I Love the buffalo blasts the potstickers the nachos each like 5 bucks I add a peach smoothie then can go straight to sleep!  Overall Portions are huge and prices for those portions great! The most expensive dish is the filet mignon its 25 bucks. Like 25 is the most you can spend on one dish. If thats too much stay home!  Well thats my honest review I feel people should never complain when they had options to go else where or stay home. These people are obviously doing something right. They're still the busiest restaurant in Ridge Hill.  (I ate tonight- 2 of us patiently waited 20 minutes and i had the chicken costelleta and he had the jamaican  chicken combo. Dr peppers. Shared a Adams cheesecake.  And we always leave a little mire than 20%) :)"
Jordan W.,"Bronx, NY",1497,1224,2927,4.0,2/20/2012,"This is a great new location. I went here for dinner about a month after it opened actually. I had a really great waiter, cannot think of his name now though. It was a really tall white guy with a thick beard. Mad cool, was honestly a great waiter.  I know it is just Cheesecake Factory but food here is pretty decent. I had the burger with the Fried Egg on it.  It was pretty epic, bacon and a fried egg is what you need on a burger sometimes. It was a great burger. Had the Vietnamese Spring Rolls as a appetizer and that hit the spot as well. I prefer this location over the other one in the White Plains area.  Lines are long but that is a part of Cheesecake Factory experience. I honestly had even longer of a wait in the one in Washington, D.C.  Take a trip here if you are in the area."
Villicent U.,"Pelham Gardens, Bronx, NY",13,9,2,3.0,1/30/2013,Avocado egg rolls are savory and palatable! The bistro shrimp pasta is delicious and delectable but can be revolting as it can look very oily. It's a spaghetti overlaid with battered fried shrimp with mushrooms and arugula mixed with garlic lemon cream. Big servings that I even brought it home for dinner and some left over for the next day.  It's not a best choice for people who are on a diet.  It's filling and calorific.  The crab bites are flavorful but I wish it could be a little bigger.  Who ever cooked the salisbury steak that my cousin ordered might be a little heavy on the salt. Average service.
Ashley M.,"Boston, MA",1,3,,1.0,8/20/2014,"Worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. Service was horrible. Had a food runner dump part of my food off my plate unto the bench and without even offering to bring an additional plate. A drink was nearly dumped on my friend, but not before her food was delivered to another table. Typically Cheesecake Factories are a great choice but avoid this one -- it's only high point is that they verify parking."
Ann F.,"Bronx, NY",0,8,,1.0,11/3/2014,"WORST BRANCH! DEPT OF HEALTH SHOULD VISIT!!! Let me list down my reasons: MUSHY CHEESECAKE, BURNT FRIES, AND CREEPERS ON YOUR TABLE. 1. When this was newly open, my husband and I were very excited since we didn't have to go farther to white plains or palisades, but the first time we had ordered cheesecake here, the cake was mushy. The texture felt like the cake has been out from freezer for too long. The female manager at the time apologized and replaced it, but it was still mushy  2. I love cheesecake factory so we gave it another try. The following time i ordered a burger with sweet potato fries. The fries were burnt. I am not someone to complain about how food taste but sweet potato fries is one of my favorite side dish. I told our server who informed a heavy set male manager. Mgr explained to us that their fries come out like that all the time. He said that they were using some new cooking oil. I insisted that i have been a customer of cheesecake factory in several branches and also had sweet potato fries in other restaurants and never was I ever served burnt fries. Instead of serving me a new cup of fries, he took the one I had, came back in less than 2 mins and told me that he got me new set of fries. I didn't eat the fries anymore because they were the same burnts fries. I was a bit insulted, did he really think I was going to believe it?!?  3. Final straw! My sister in law wanted to celebrate her bday dinner at cheesecake. We waited for 1.5h for our seats. When we finally got seated and having coffee, a cockroach crawled on the table near my coffee. I caught the crawler with the napkin and showed it to the current manager (oct 12, 2014) he took the napkin with crawler and moved us to another table as his solution. This place is at its worst. Never will I come back or invite nor encourage anyone to eat here at this branch. The managers need serious training! The servers are accommodating, but if the management tolerate this type of food and environment in front of customers, u can only imagine what goes behind close doors. I ought to call dept of health regarding this recent issue we had."
A J.,"Bronx, NY",50,4,5,2.0,2/22/2013,"yeah skip it!! Poor customer service!! My cousins & I went here for dinner and it was a horrible experience, the server is so snob that it seems like he's not paying attention that much to us, they serve bread and we ask about the butter TWICE and the third time they said they ran out of butter & they sent someone to buy butter for us!! and then I approach him & ask him personally if they can bring something for my cousin coz its her Birthday! oh my gosh they forgot! and the other server dropped the fork on my cousins food!!  we just left after we eat!! horrible experience!! Will never go back here!!  I gave two stars its because I kinda like the place plus i love ridgehill."
Dee B.,"Washington, DC",102,556,221,4.0,7/27/2012,"I have not had a big problem with this CF and I've been several times since they opened. I am a huge fan of the shrimp and grits app. They could be a tad bit more attentive, but I go for the food and beverages and I've had worst service (go down the way to Havana Central for a prime example) so they get to keep their extra star - for now. Plus, they validate parking! Yay!"
Allyson K.,"Yonkers, NY",0,5,,1.0,2/26/2014,"The few times we've eaten at the Yonkers location at Ridge Hill, we received incredibly SLOW service ~ Last time, there were a few workers sitting, cackling as I maneuvered a wheelchair through the door  by myself, only to be told they were not open yet! The final straw??? The other night, one of your employees hit my vehicle in the parking lot and just took off!!! If your employees would be this careless, regardless of being seen, then I would NOT trust them with my food!!!"
H L.,"Bronx, NY",2,270,58,4.0,7/31/2012,"I normally wouldn't be interested in checking this place out but a friend mentioned their low-cal menu so I wanted to check it out.  Our server, Chris was awesome- he was very cool and friendly. There was a lot of seating in and outdoors. All of the options on the low-cal menu are under 600 calories and everything we tried was pretty good! I had the pear & blue cheese flatbread appetizer (delicious!) and the soft shell tacos (shrimp). So I skipped the shells, they were falling apart and so thin they couldn't hold all of the insides in place and the spanish rice was a little bland, but other than that it was pretty satisfying.  I also tried one of the chicken samosas- I was not too crazy about them but they were okay. As hard as I tried, I couldn't make it out the darn door without the ultimate red velvet cheesecake. This stuff is like a drug but it's okay. It's only the SECOND HIGHEST CALORIC DESSERT ON THE MENU (beaten out by the PB cheesecake by 10 cals). whatever, I'll feed off of it for a week. All in all about $40 for 2 of us, not a bad deal."

I am a huge fan of the shrimp and grits app. They could be a tad bit more attentive, but I go for the food and beverages and I've had worst service (go down the way to Havana Central for a prime example) so they get to keep their extra star - for now. Plus, they validate parking! Yay!"
Allyson K.,"Yonkers, United States",0,5,,1.0,26/2/2014,"The few times we've eaten at the Yonkers location at Ridge Hill, we received incredibly SLOW service ~ Last time, there were a few workers sitting, cackling as I maneuvered a wheelchair through the door  by myself, only to be told they were not open yet! The final straw??? The other night, one of your employees hit my vehicle in the parking lot and just took off!!! If your employees would be this careless, regardless of being seen, then I would NOT trust them with my food!!!"
H L.,"Bronx, United States",2,270,58,4.0,31/7/2012,"I normally wouldn't be interested in checking this place out but a friend mentioned their low-cal menu so I wanted to check it out.  Our server, Chris was awesome- he was very cool and friendly. There was a lot of seating in and outdoors. All of the options on the low-cal menu are under 600 calories and everything we tried was pretty good! I had the pear & blue cheese flatbread appetizer (delicious!) and the soft shell tacos (shrimp). So I skipped the shells, they were falling apart and so thin they couldn't hold all of the insides in place and the spanish rice was a little bland, but other than that it was pretty satisfying.  I also tried one of the chicken samosas- I was not too crazy about them but they were okay. As hard as I tried, I couldn't make it out the darn door without the ultimate red velvet cheesecake. This stuff is like a drug but it's okay. It's only the SECOND HIGHEST CALORIC DESSERT ON THE MENU (beaten out by the PB cheesecake by 10 cals). whatever, I'll feed off of it for a week. All in all about $40 for 2 of us, not a bad deal."
