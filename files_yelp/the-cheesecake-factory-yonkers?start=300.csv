Boring"
Sadri B.,"White Plains, NY",5000,1934,449,3.0,10/28/2014,"fan of ccf,but the white plains spot better all around.the wait was 30 plus minutes,which usually does not bother me, buuuuut with the human ball breaker nunu non stop bitching and moaning it felt like a week.finally sat at a booth,which had no utensils, until we had our server come by, we ordered apps and entree at the same time cause lady server who happen to be very nice ,had to many tables to tend to. went with tex mex rolls,good but a little oily and chicken enchiladas for entree, which is always good and filling.since this new mall has open the popular food joints always pack .place has the casual ccf decor that is common at all ccf.  for dessert i went with fudge cake very rich and yummy perfect wiith a diet soda ( not kidding) .its a funny thing but i dont like cheesecake. listen if you dont mind waiting or large crowds or slow service, be my guest,but for sadri, white plains or palisades mall is my ccf spot .p.s they validate parking and nunu is still bitching."
Natasha S.,"Watertown, MA",2,72,35,3.0,8/3/2012,"Compared to other Cheesecakes, this place is okay. Been to CFs enough times to know how food and drink should taste. App was cold. Service is great (minus getting our appetizers before our drinks), and outdoor seating option is amazing!"
Alison H.,"Manhattan, NY",31,5,1,3.0,6/24/2012,"Nice place, food good, however, the wait time is awful, horrendously slow and for no reason. We were offered the excuses of ""the kitchen is slow"" however folks that sat down after us got their food before us, ate and left. The management blows chunks as well, they are about as accomodating as a size 6 pair of shoes on Big Foot... you'll have a better time at other Cheesefactory locations..."
Jenny K.,"Cleveland, OH",3,22,10,1.0,4/2/2014,"worst cheesecake ever among all the locations. got my sit after 45 mins wait which was no problem for me because basically the same everywhere on weekend, however, there was no server at our table until i have to ask a random staff who was my server. she took our orders and it took another 45 mins for the food to come out. and that was the only time i saw her until the end she showed up and asked if everything ok and the check. the food wasn't that good. the server even wore croc shoe to work really cheesecake ?? very disappointed"
Janice G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,,1.0,7/28/2014,i have been to many of the Cheesecake Factory restaurants around the country including the one in White Plains and this one in Ridge Hill is the worst!!!! the entire staff is so unprofessional and the food was not good too. Don't waste your time going there. Go to the White Plains location.
Jose M.,"Bronx, NY",0,3,,4.0,7/22/2014,"The service was pretty good, and the staff was very friendly. The menu is decent and the ambiance is very nice inside here. Better atmosphere then many restaurants in ridgehill mall. And for fitness people low carb cheesecake taste amazing"
fra w.,"Bonita Springs, FL",1,85,,3.0,6/8/2014,was for happy hour and it was packed..Waitress was Rachael and she was very sweet and caring. We started with choc. martini for reg price...good... i ordered chard and was quoted $5. my  wife ordered rail scotch and we were quoted $5. so we all h ad 2..when we got bill it was one chard was 5 and other reg price.. and both scotch were reg   was so busy i didnt see bill till we left.the appys were all about 5 and most were good...all in all if it wasnt for overcharge we liked it...
Matt D.,"New York, NY",29,38,14,2.0,9/30/2012,"Food was good. I had the Low cal chicken enchiladas and my girlfriend had the Factory Salad. Both were very good and flavorful. Had strawberry cheesecake for dessert.  Only complaint was service was slow and the food was expensive. Our bill was over $70.00 for two people. That includes two glasses of wine at $7.00 each and two slices of cheescake.  We wanted to take one slice of the cheesecake home because we were full. We asked for a take home carton but the server never came back after we payed the bill. After waiting awhile and not seeing our server anywhere, we had to leave to arrive on time for our other plans we had that day. So, we had to leave that half of cheesecake on the table. I was a bit annoyed by that. The two stars are for the price of the portion size of the meal compared to other restaurants I have visited. The rating also takes into account the slow and ultimately poor service at the end of the meal. Otherwise, the restaurant was clean, had a nice atmosphere, and the food was very good."
Nelson G.,"KEW GARDENS, NY",0,14,3,5.0,3/21/2014,"The food is what you'd expect from the Cheesecake Factory but what sets this location apart from the rest and warrants the 5 star rating is the exceptional service. Danielle, who appeared to be the manager, and Pablo went above and beyond to accommodate my family and myself. One of the best experiences I've had at a restaurant in awhile and by far the best experience I've ever had at a chain restaurant. I'd come back for the service alone but the food always helps :)"
Grace C.,"Yonkers, NY",0,4,,3.0,5/27/2012,"Okay, so maybe five hours ago I would've given this place a 4-star rating (Yay! I'm a fan) but after this evening, I'm sticking to a 3-star rating (A-OK) and I'm not giving this place a 1 because one of the waiters came to our rescue for the second time (thank you, Anthony!!!) and I've had good experiences at this Cheesecake Factory (with minor mishaps) before. The Cheesecake Factory should give Anthony a promotion because he is very attentive (to people like us who have been waiting for twenty-five minutes for our waitress to tend to us). He wasn't even in charge of our table and he was the only one who had the decency to tend to us. Bravo, Anthony!  Anyway, we waited forty minutes to be seated and granted it was Sunday afternoon, we were okay with that and we're use to it when it comes to this particular Cheesecake Factory. Okay, so we were seated and that is when my perception of this place spiraled downward!! (I use to love coming here). My husband and I were so mad because after being ignored for twenty minutes, we decided to speak to a manager. Was she any help? NO!! She assured my husband that she would take care of it but she didn't do anything about it, Anthony did!! She continued to avoid our table and even spoke to the people at the table next to us, who were having service issues with the waitress who was supposed to tend to us. The lady next to us told us, ""You didn't miss out on anything."" The manager didn't even look at us, no apology, NOTHING. I get it, it was busy, but after someone is seated, IT'S GAME TIME!  Moving on to the food. I always order the Americana Cheeseburger, no pickles (because with the pickles the burger turns out too salty), no onions (because when they do put grilled onions, they put waaaaay too many and that completely overpowers the other flavors), no tomatoes because I just prefer it that way and medium-well. Usually (not all the time) the burger turns out great, but tonight, I guess they just didn't have their game face on. It was a little bland. I ordered it with the sweet potato fries and they were too soft all around (they're supposed to be crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside). I guess they were sitting out for too long. The sweet potato fries here are hit or miss. Half of the time I have to send them back and get a new batch. Sometimes they are overcooked, sometimes cold.  I think this place has a lot of potential but management, I think, needs to get more involved and some of the staff need to be re-trained (except for Anthony). There is one manager who is very attentive though. He would've solved the problem right away, but this blonde short-haired woman, didn't care enough to make it up to us. Actually, since she told my husband she would take care of it during their conversation, my husband told Anthony to ask her, how was she going to take care of it. All she could do by the end of our meal was give us a free cheesecake and not charge us for my daughter's ice cream who was growing very impatient during our almost two hour wait. (I always tell her to remain calm though). Sorry lady, cheesecake is not going to solve your lack of hospitality sense. I decided to go with the red velvet which is good but too sweet. I love sweets but they have to be well-balanced. I have had the Godiva cheesecake, which I really recommend!! Not in this Cheesecake Factory though. Luckily, we got out right on time for our parking to be free (not a big deal but a good perk!). They validate but you're lucky if you get out on time. Just bring $3.25 just in case. We will not be returning. Sorry Cheesecake @ Ridgehill, we really did want to like you. We tried like six times and each time the service lacked more and more. Hope this helps fellow Yelpers!  *They do brunch on Sundays but I've never tried the food. I've also tried the Four Cheese Pasta and the Avocado Eggrolls and both are really tasty. Their vanilla milkshake is good and their whole wheat bread (before the meal) with the accompanying butter is really good.  *Their lemon-herb chicken is okay and their chicken bellagio is nothing to write home about. *I didn't like their orange chicken.  I've had other things but I forgot!"
Cheyenne M.,"Brooklyn, NY",133,14,11,1.0,1/4/2012,"This location sucks. Please get rid of that woman in the front, she's awful. First off we got walked over to a table where people were already sitting then walked back to the front then walked to another table with food all over the seats. The hostess claims she ""bussed it herself"".. the forks were filthy. We just walked out. its such a waste of a space. fire them and start over. The one in white plains is wayyyy better."
Philip R.,"Wallkill, NY",0,1,,1.0,6/26/2013,Waited 30 min for an outside table even though there were 5 dirty tables waiting to be cleaned. Waited 20 minutes for silverware and plates for our appetizers  This is the third time we've been here and each time they tell us a story of how the dishwasher is broken. 15 minutes after we ordered the main course the waitress came back to let us know that they were out of two of the orders (pizza and pasta) it took another 40 minutes get our food also took 20 min to get drinks . We spoke to the manager who didn't seem to care . The service is very bad even though the food was good . We will never go to this location again
Sylvia D.,"Zelienople, PA",1,13,1,4.0,1/15/2014,"If my daughter had her way, we'd be eating there every night! Don't get me wrong, I can usually find something to eat from their Skinny-licious or whatever they call it menu so as to not feel too guilty about the dessert we ALWAYS end up ordering- Dulce de leche cheesecake... HELLO! Cheesecake Factory!. If I'm feeling like being a little bad, I'll order sweet potato fries with my turkey burger instead of the salad that comes with it. If you can put up with the mile long wait lines, the servers are typically friendly enough. Usually their friendliness can cover up the sometimes long food times too. It's not fine dining folks, it is a chain after all, but for what it is, it's good food, and I will continue to go back."
E P.,"OAKLAND GARDENS, NY",18,7,1,4.0,7/25/2013,"I went to Cheesecake Factory last Sunday and I have to say, I was impressed by management.   We were seated right away which was awesome.  Orlando, our waiter came to us fairly quickly and took our drink and appetizer orders.  Those also came to our table fairly quickly along with our bread.  He took our meal orders and then he had to go on break for 30 minutes but he said another waitress would cover him.  She did the obligatory refill look out.  But our meals never came.  One manager came over to apologize for the delay in getting our meals.  By then I realized that the table to the left and right of us were served when they arrived after us.  After another 15 minutes, another manager came over and thouroughly explained the delay in our meal and apologized profusely, saying that this is not how The Cheesecake Factory operates.  He said that there was a problem with the kitchen and one of the meals were made incorrectly and instead of only sending one out correctly, he had the kitchen remake both so both were hot when hitting the table.  He said he would take care of us and again he was very sorry.  We got our meals about 5-10 minutes after that and then our waiter came back from break as well.  He also apologized profusely and told us that the manager said to comp our main dishes.  That saved us about 30 bucks!  Whoo hoo! .  We were happy with that.  I think its really great that they did that and it makes me feel like they really care about their customers.  I would definetly come back here."
Vee L.,"Yonkers, NY",3,24,5,1.0,5/4/2012,"I went there for my birthday on a Saturday night. The service here is atrocious. Everything that could possible go wrong did!  This place had me near tears for my birthday, ruined it. We were a table of 2, and were told our wait would be a half hour- 45 minutes, which is common on a Sat night. An hour and half passed and I ask a hostess if we were up soon and she said ""uh, yeah"". Fast forward a half hour later, and we still were not seated. I went up to another host and demanded to know why we were still waiting for 2 hours for a table for 2, he had no idea why our names were suddenly off the waiting list. Meaning that we could have waited until closing and would have never gotten a table! We were finally given a table and had to wait close to 10 min for a waiter to see us and give us water, and take our orders. We ordered drinks and got the wrong drinks, had to send them back. We ordered appetizers, and they never came. As we were waiting 20 minutes for the appetizers, the entrees came out! So our waitress said sorry and tried to take the entrees off our table and go get the appetizers. That makes NO sense because by now the appetizers would have been cold, and they would have left the entrees out as we ate the cold appetizers. We canceled the appetizers. Finally, we could enjoy some food, right? WRONG!!!! I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Pasta, and it was missing two main ingredients, at the point I was seriously upset. I sent the dish back, and when it came back, it came back cold and I could tell they just added the 2 missing things and tossed it around. The manager finally came out, and offered us a free dessert...at that point I just asked for it to go and left as fast as I could.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service. The hosts/cooks/ and wait staff here are in no way trained or as educated in the food service industry as the Cheesecake factory in White Plains. I rather take the drive up there than to experience this again."
Britney W.,"Bronx, NY",0,14,,2.0,1/5/2012,"I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory, however, this particular factory left me sick  for the following 3 days. I do love their setting and customer service, despite the long waits, but this time around was enough for me to never go back. I had a very simple eggplant sandwich with mixed greens. This entree left me begging for a bathroom! Sorry Cheesecake Factory in Yonkers, you're deaded."
J F.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,,3.0,8/3/2013,"The food was amazing the waiters were great, our food came quick.  The hosts however were TERRIBLE. We informed them of a peanut allergy and said we had to talk to our server once we sat down. The issue was I asked repeatedly that I wanted to know if we could eat here BEFORE we sat down and if they could please find out. We had to ask 4 times before they brought out the manager. She was super helpful and nice. Then I went to use the restroom and there was no toilet paper in any of the stalls. I alerted one of the hosts and they returned to the front desk and just stood there for 5 minutes. I complained to another host and they refilled the stalls."
Kelvin D.,"Soundview, Bronx, NY",0,2,,5.0,5/24/2013,i have to say i when here for my bday i didn't even told the staff it was the day i was born and i got  a great service the bar tender was great with our drink because i had to wait for a table but i didn't might it was a raining day any way.. when i got to the table the waitress was excellent with the orders and the drinks we order... will go again and see if the service changes.....
Vanessa M.,"New York, NY",0,100,,2.0,7/1/2012,The food was just not very good. The decor was just like any other cheesecake factory.  I would recommend to just go across to Brio.

Finally, we could enjoy some food, right? WRONG!!!! I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Pasta, and it was missing two main ingredients, at the point I was seriously upset. I sent the dish back, and when it came back, it came back cold and I could tell they just added the 2 missing things and tossed it around. The manager finally came out, and offered us a free dessert...at that point I just asked for it to go and left as fast as I could.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service. The hosts/cooks/ and wait staff here are in no way trained or as educated in the food service industry as the Cheesecake factory in White Plains. I rather take the drive up there than to experience this again."

I do love their setting and customer service, despite the long waits, but this time around was enough for me to never go back. I had a very simple eggplant sandwich with mixed greens. This entree left me begging for a bathroom! Sorry Cheesecake Factory in Yonkers, you're deaded."
J F.,"Brooklyn, United States",0,3,,3.0,3/8/2013,"The food was amazing the waiters were great, our food came quick.  The hosts however were TERRIBLE. We informed them of a peanut allergy and said we had to talk to our server once we sat down. The issue was I asked repeatedly that I wanted to know if we could eat here BEFORE we sat down and if they could please find out. We had to ask 4 times before they brought out the manager. She was super helpful and nice. Then I went to use the restroom and there was no toilet paper in any of the stalls. I alerted one of the hosts and they returned to the front desk and just stood there for 5 minutes. I complained to another host and they refilled the stalls."

Vanessa M.,"New York, United States",0,100,,2.0,1/7/2012,The food was just not very good. The decor was just like any other cheesecake factory.  I would recommend to just go across to Brio.
