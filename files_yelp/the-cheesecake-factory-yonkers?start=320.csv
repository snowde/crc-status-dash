Chris C.,"Thornwood, NY",11,34,,4.0,3/4/2013,"Great food, great atmosphere. Definitely recommended. Must try the mac & cheese burger."
Mike M.,"Peekskill, NY",6,7,,1.0,7/4/2012,"The worst Cheesecake experience I ever had. Usually, they are great but this location was horrible.  The food took forever to come, it was cold and the orders were all wrong. Our waitress-a fat ugly thing named Athena, was rude and lazy. The managers just appeased us when we complained but did nothing to comp us. Will not return to this location."
B F.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",0,32,,1.0,9/7/2012,"Was here for brunch with family over the summer.  We were a large group - maybe a dozen or so.  Service was fine considering this.  Food?  Not so much - at least not my entree.  I'd give them a negative star for how they handled how they screwed up my meal if yelp would allow such a thing.   I ordered Eggs Benedict, one of my favorite choices for brunch.  I got a disgusting oily mess.  I explained to the waitress that it wasn't done properly.  She asked me if I was sure it wasn't the runny egg yolk.  Egg yolks are yellow - the oily mess was orange.  It wasn't the egg.  After bringing it back to the kitchen, she came back and told me they said it looked like the sauce broke.  If it wasn't done correctly, why are you serving it to me?!  I'm not an idiot.  I know what Eggs Benedict is supposed to be.  I probably should have ordered something else, but silly me, I wait optimistically, thinking they'll get it right this time.  So I sit and watch everyone else eat.  They're ordering dessert by the time I get my food back.  I had asked that they not bother putting the sauce on, but I see that there is quite a bit of ""sauce"" on it.  The sauce now looks solid - suspiciously, it's thicker than I've ever seen Hollandaise sauce to be.  My uncle said it looked like mayo.  Since I can't stand mayo, I wind up scraping it all off onto an empty plate.  It ends up occupying about half that plate.  I ate about a quarter of my meal and just couldn't stomach any more.  Just thinking about that experience is making me feel queasy right now.  So, needless to say, I will NOT be returning and hope to never have to see another Cheesecake Factory again! Oh, I should mention that they did at least quietly comp. my meal."
Penelope P.,"Bronx, NY",0,16,,4.0,2/23/2012,"My husband and I have been to this location twice, both times, slightly later than lunch hour (between 1 & 2 pm).  By that time, the place was buzzing, but we had no wait.  Perhaps it would have been different if we were in a larger party.  Our service experience was fine and chirpy, though we did have to request grated cheese rather than having it offered to us...no big deal.  As for the food, we both enjoyed our meals a lot.  This time around, hubby had a ""lunch portion"" (HUGE!) of penne with chicken in a spicy sauce and I had an individual grilled veggie pizza with a ""small""(HUGE!) side salad of mixed baby greens. While the portions were unnecessarily generous, we applaud the tasty, fresh food. Yes, it's a chain restaurant.  Oh well, we couldn't help ourselves!  The cheeriness and the tastiness just overwhelmed us.  We look forward to our next visit!"
Danielle g.,"Yonkers, NY",36,10,,2.0,2/2/2012,"This was my first time dining in at the Yonkers location, and have to say, as both an employee at another location, and a guest, I am horribly disappointed. While the restaurant was clean and the food came out as expected, not much was done on point. While on a Thursday night I was glad to not have to wait for a seat, I did have to wait about 10 minutes for the server to even approach my table. She brought out bread and drinks with out introducing herself and only after we had been looking at the menus for a while did she let us know about the specials. She very rarely checked back with us and we had a sweet bus boy pack our food to go. We waited another 25 mins to have our check brought to us by another server and  another 15 for it to be processed and she didn't know how to put our gift card through with out help from the management...after a few months being open, she should know by now!! The hosts were not very friendly either. I had much higher hopes for this restaurant. I really hope they step it up a bit and live up to the wonderful standard CCF is used to upholding."
J D.,"New York, NY",1,283,6,3.0,1/30/2012,"Great veggie burger - made w brown rice, farro, black beans, beets, and onion.  Without cheese is only 530 calories."
C M.,"Mt Vernon, NY",1,24,,1.0,4/6/2012,"I copied my review onto the comments page on the Cheesecake Factory's website and received $75 in gift cards in the mail. I appreciate the gesture, but I definitely won't be spending them at the Yonkers location! I may just give them away."
Brandon K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,,1.0,6/8/2013,"Tonight was our 2nd terrible experience at this CF.  Last time, our service was horrendous; this time it got even worse.  Our waitress apologized as a margarita took 15 minutes to come out and said Ben, the manager would come over and apologize and he would most likely comp the drink.  We got our check with two margaritas and one comped thinking that they made a mistake and meant to comp ours.  Turns out, it was just for inventory and they were not comping our drink, which Ben came over and tried to explain in a very condescending manner.  We said that we were under the impression that the drink would be comped, which is why we didn't understand the bill initially.  He then dropped a line exclaiming that he didn't think he ""needed"" to comp the drink because of his initial apology and because we were ""cool"" and didn't react in a pissed off manner, but if we wanted the drink comped, he could comp it.  Thanks, but no thanks Ben.  I guess if we caused a scene initially, we wouldn't have had to pay for the drink, but since we were ""cool"" and good customers, we should.  He apparently loves conflict.  Needless to say, I wouldn't give him the satisfaction of feeling like he did us a favor by paying for the drink.  To put it lightly, he can go kick rocks."
