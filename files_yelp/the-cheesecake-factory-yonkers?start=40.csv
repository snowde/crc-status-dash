Angela S.,"Bronx, NY",7,9,2,5.0,4/2/2017,I had the Bistro Shrimp and it was absolutely the best. Even though the wait time was 45 minutes for a Sunday the food made up for it. Will definitely come again. The strawberry martini's are delicious.  Keep up the good work guys.
Samantha G.,"Scituate, MA",280,61,508,5.0,5/29/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is the best! Everything on the menu is delicious. The menu is more like a novel; so many options from drinks to entrees and appetizers and of course, dessert! Any time is the perfect time for this restaurant. Just this year alone, I went for my birthday, New Year's Eve, and to celebrate my first year in college.  My favorite items here are the orange chicken with white rice plate, the tropical iced tea, the Godiva cheesecake, the strawberry shortcake dessert, and the salted caramel cheesecake. Side note, the bread and butter there is always warm and fluffy. The brown bread is my favorite.  Happy service, great food, great atmosphere. Definitely go here!"
Shay-Shay C.,"Bronx, NY",63,11,8,5.0,9/7/2016,Great nite celebrating my birthday.... Alex was very on point with everything!!!!! Desert had to be taken to go. Location was perfect too.
John Q.,"Yonkers, NY",1,14,3,1.0,12/26/2016,"I have to write this review in order to save people's lives. Tonight I came in with my friends with the expectations of having a nice dinner as usual. From the beginning there was tension between the hostess and the guest, which foreshadowed our hopeless meal. Our waitress was uncanny and hardly attended our table. Upon our food arriving, the mash potatoes were stale with snakeskin like peel that obviously hinted that the food was sitting out for a long time. My friend got an under cooked burger which was a huge health hazard, even the waiter couldn't believe it. BEWARE!!! EAT AT OWN RISK."
Ryan C.,"Yonkers, NY",109,35,9,4.0,6/28/2017,"I come here once and a while because my office is across the street. Very nice and well kept location. I had the Chicken Caesar salad which wasn't bad. Only thing is, it takes them a second to get in the groove of things, I feel when you first sit down it takes a minute to be greeted and situated, otherwise can't really complain about the food and the experience I had in here."
Cat N.,"New York, NY",1,21,1,1.0,8/9/2017,"It is Wednesday 11:30am. I come over to CF with my baby daughter to have a nice lunch. I get seated and wait for the waitress... And wait... And wait... After 20 minutes the waitress acknowledges me and says ""I will be right with you"". I wait another 5 minutes, no sight of her. I get up. On the way out the hostess is busy on the phone so I tell some other waitress that no one took care of me and I am leaving. No one tries to stop me. I am having a turkey pesto sandwich now at Starbucks. Thank you, Starbucks."
Solanyis C.,"Yonkers, NY",0,2,1,1.0,11/11/2017,HORRIBLE SERVICE. First time going to the cheesecake factory & i am extremely disappointed. Aside from having to wait 40 minutes for a table. my server clearly needed some training on customer satisfaction. I asked for chicken quesadillas and got plain quesadillas when i brought it to my servers attention she responded no you said cheese. I repeated no miss we asked for chicken. She responded again to say no you said cheese nodding as if i was incapable of processing what she was saying. My partner and i decided it was best for us to just leave. Dont even deserve a star.
Carlos H.,"White Plains, NY",0,1,,4.0,8/19/2017,"Food was great, had the Bacon Bacon burger. Thickest piece of bacon I've ever had at a restaurant. Our waiter Brandon was very attentive and seemed like he enjoyed doing what he was doing."
Elena P.,"Bronx, NY",1,24,,1.0,5/30/2017,The only highlight to this terrible dinner was our very friendly waiter. The food was terrible. Even the Cobb salad was a disaster. And pricy! Safe your money and go elsewhere.
Christine T.,"West Harrison, NY",49,8,,1.0,11/3/2017,"It was a crap show from the minute we walked in.  We were seated and a waitress walked over and was asked a question about a beverage.  We didn't see her for another 20 minutes when we had to wave her over.  We ordered our drinks to not see her again.  We spoke with the manager, (jr) and then about 7 minutes later we received our drinks.  We had asked for more butter but never received that.  We put in our order for apps and dinner and about 20 minutes later the apps came out.  we didn't eat very much of that, When dinner was brought out, a salad which was specifically ordered without cheese came out covered in cheese.  I had ordered two small plates for dinner and of course when dinner was served mine was not there.  After about 5 more minutes my one dish of crab bites came out and my zucchini sticks no where to be found.  BTW I never did get them until about 30 minutes later.  The Senior manager then came over and apologizing, gonna take care of us etc.  Then he says he says we should have told him sooner.  Wait did we not speak to a jr manager, isn't that his job?  OK so we get the bill and a few things were removed as a courtesy, but there are Two salads charged to us, so once again I call the waitress over, and she argues that one is a credit, a look twice babe, NOT.  oh she says so sorry.  She removes it.  We paid the bill and left.  Not one cent left as a tip.  I will not return there for anything, the one in WHite Plains is SOOO much better."
Paula M.,"Bronx, NY",195,310,172,3.0,4/14/2016,"Way too crowded for me and it's a much smaller space then other ones I've been to. We waited 40mins to be seated and had to wait outside because of how crowded it was and the waiting area is too small and you can't walk in and out with ease. The food was slow to arrive. What peeved me the most was how they had the utensils on the table and when you felt the table you could feel the food residue on it, NASTY!! And those utensils were not cleaned at all. Service wasn't bad. And the food was good."
Tammi B.,"Windsor, CT",44,9,14,2.0,5/15/2017,"I was extremely disappointed in my visit to the Yonkers Cheesecake Factory. The wait was extremely long and the quality of the food was not as good and as my last visit (to a different location in CT). The Service was mediocre, our waitress kept forgetting the things we asked for (like catsup, refills and more bread). We ordered Bang-Bang Chicken, Jambalaya, Meatloaf and Shrimp scampi. (I'd say the meatloaf was the best dish). My leftover Chicken, at home in the frig for 2 days, hasn't been touched by anyone in the house if that's any indication of how terrible it was! (And there's 2 teenage boys with a big appetite). I'll stick to ordering take-out Dessert ONLY. I'm am so over this place! In no rush to come back either.  I will add overpriced too."
Melissa S.,"New York, NY",4,13,34,3.0,10/24/2016,Customer service was great. Appetizers were cool! Tuna tartare seemed old & bland! The fried appetizers were pretty good and the crab dip was awesome. I also had the shrimp believe Alfredo which was pretty good but a bit 2 thick.
Brandi V.,"New York, NY",59,23,,4.0,6/26/2017,"We went to this beautiful location with shops and a pretty green space on Sunday.  The menu is huge and we felt confident that there would be something for everyone.  That said, we ordered plain eggs for our autistic child and received the plate covered in seasoning and no immediate follow up to fix the situation.  Our kiddo ended up eating toast for lunch.  The other entrees were okay but lacking the usual taste & flair we usually get at the Cheesecake Factory.  Our server was very helpful after she realized our son did not touch his food and had the dish removed.  Her service warrants the two stars. **Thank you for reaching out and working with your team! Every act of kindness goes a long way to help a little guy with special needs**"
Marie Annick M.,"Paterson, NJ",146,254,201,4.0,4/6/2016,"Good little spot .! It's always crowded though, so I just take out . The workers are a little slow . Oh well. Cheesecake is good . Update -  I had good food here ! Mashed potatoes were excellent with chunks of potatoes , salmon was cooked perfectly and asparagus was so good , all for about $20 I never knew food was so good here because I avoid franchises and go to local owned places . Boy I missed out , glad I'm now in the loop!"
Jenna S.,"Yonkers, NY",424,146,,4.0,2/8/2016,"Completely ignore my previous review of the Cheesecake factory. Since then I have come two more times and my experience was delicious. If you decide to eat here, the nachos with chicken are a MUST. It is their signature appetizer and is absolutely decadent. Literally mouth-watering thinking about it. Also, the shrimp scampi dish is amazing. The shrimp is top quality and the sauce is delicious. It comes with angel hair pasta, which is also great! Overall, definitely one of their top entrees. Everyone also enjoys their burgers because they have a great variety. However, if you love seafood and pasta - their shrimp scampi dish is excellent. Of course, the cheesecake is the best too. The banana creme one is my personal favorite.  The decor is very romantic and beautifully arranged. There is usually a wait to be seated at the Cheesecake factory. Especially after 7pm. However, it is definitely worth trying. They serve you bread with your dinner and offer great drinks to choose from. There is a bar area for those looking to come for drinks and a quick bite. They also offer a ""skinnylicious""menu for people that are on a diet.  It is a very broad menu. Some dishes are better than others. If you try what I suggested, I am sure you will be happy because it was very good. Stay away from the spinach and artichoke dip and the pot stickers. The stuffed mushrooms and wings are also very good."
A S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,77,7,1.0,9/17/2017,I'm at the point of even selling their stock. Another frustrating evening last night. The manager helped but he's just one person. They need a team of managers on weekend evenings. The staff is too overwhelmed to be on the ball.
Cassie Q.,"Bronx, NY",0,7,,1.0,10/5/2017,Went here for my birthday. We got seated right away but waited 10 minutes before the waiter came to the table. We ordered drinks  which came a half hour later. When deciding on my order I asked the waiter's opinion of two different dishes. He was cold in his answer and seemed annoyed. We then waited an hour for our food (it wasn't even crowded). I took a few bites of my pasta and the waiter came and said it was a mistake and took it away. He then gave me another dish which looked less appetizing and looked like someone had eaten part of it. I asked him about it and he was very rude to me. Overall we paid over $200 for four people and it was an awful experience. The food was decent but the service was terrible. Oh yeah and the waiter's name was Darius.
Angely O.,"New York, NY",0,18,,1.0,6/2/2017,"Great service. However, got food poisoning from the meatballs and spaghetti, and paid over 100 dollars for tasteless food not cooked well. Will not be returning."
Kristen M.,"Mount Vernon, NY",245,2,1,1.0,12/4/2017,This is been the absolute worst experience i have ever had at a Cheesecake Factory.  As we walked in we were told nobody can seat us until the hostess comes back.  We wait.... about 10 minutes and still no hostess.  Randomly a server sat us...  about 25 minutes after sitting with nothing the server FINALLY came over and after about another 15 minutes he came back and said he was going on break.  The new server took our order and after about another 40 minutes half our food came out.  I ordered a salad and it was drenched in salad dressing.... unedible.... so i ate nothing.  My husband ordered a chicken sandwich with fries and after the dropped the sandwich off they said the fries would be right out.... they never came.....  the server took off my salad being it looked more like a plate of spinach being soaked in dressing..  but i still am not sure why we payed full price for a meal we didn't half of.  Worst experience I've EVER had at a Cheesecake Factory and i don't think i want to ever try this restaurant again.
