Evelin R.,"Bronx, NY",2,8,6,4.0,6/20/2017,"aside from the wait time, which is why i'm taking one star off the service and food were excellent. the manager John made his business to make sure we were accommodated. i have a toddler who doesn't like high chairs and he gave us booth. usually booths are reserve for smaller or bigger parties depending where you're sitting. he came to our table a couple of times to make sure everything was ok.  the waiter was so pleasant and helpful. I've been here a couple of time and i have to say their service is really good- the food too :) when people go the extra mile to make sure your experience in their restaurant is a pleasant one they deserve a good review. you guys get an A in my book."
Maggie P.,"Manhattan, NY",30,10,4,1.0,12/14/2016,The absolute worst! For take our or when dining in. Currently waiting for more than 40 min on a takeout order. Ridiculous and it seems like the lady at the register has no clue what shes doing but managers wont even step in to help.  Go to another location this is the worst!
Laureen R.,"Yonkers, NY",29,123,13,2.0,3/6/2017,I had a Dr. Appointment at 7PM on a Tuesday and I was early so I went to TCF to grab a quick bite.  I asked for a table for one and the host staff clearly seemed annoyed.  They gave me a set in the bar area which was a huge mistake.  I ordered a cucumber mojito to start followed by a small side salad and an appetizer and asked that they be served at the same time.  Needless to say the salad came out LONG before my drink ever got there.  I wanted my drink prior to any food.  Then it took another 15 minutes for the appetizer to appear.  The guy serving me was nice enough but they had him waiting on tables on the other side of the restaurant in addition to the bar area.  Since he can't physically be in two places at once....how could the service possibly be good?  It wasn't a great experience.  Next time I will try Angelo's and just get some cheesecake from TCF to go and not sit down.
Sarah L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,3,1.0,2/14/2017,"DO NOT EAT HERE! This place deserves zero stars. On February 4th, 2017 I ate here with my family, and at first everything seemed fine, but starting that night, and since then I have been battling a chest infection which has now turned into bronchitis. I'm currently on a behind-the-counter medication recommended by my local pharmacist, but I will most likely have to go to another doctor's appointment to get a prescription for an albuterol asthma inhaler for my worsening condition. The quality of service and level of sanitation in this restaurant has decreased significantly since it's been opened, and I know because over the past few years I have been here several times. We also had an issue with one of our orders and the manager was unhelpful in resolving the issue; she lied and said that we said something completely different! This caused us to be delayed for over a half hour while my brother was waiting for his food.  I have since contacted the Cheesecake Factory corporate office via their website and it's been several days and I still haven't heard from them. This is a seriously dangerous and unprofessional environment to eat in, so if you are in delicate health or generally don't want to be ill, DO NOT EAT HERE!"
Sharron D.,"Corona, NY",8,3,4,5.0,2/7/2017,"My ultimate favorite place to go out. Portions are generous, prices are fair and servers are always good to me. And of course the many options for their delicious cheesecake!!!  I always get the same entree (Jamaican black pepper shrimp) because it's just that good,  but next time I'll see what the shrimp and gumbo chicken is hitting for. Anyways 4 stars for service and having a clean restroom"
Sorinna K.,"New York, NY",66,19,7,4.0,6/14/2017,"Had a wonderful time here today! Our server Armando was absolutely amazing! I had the passionfruit mojito and it was exactly how I like it -- not too strong, not too fruity, just right. Wasn't a big fan of the pot stickers but it wasn't horrible. Just wasn't as tasty as I imagined but they were good! And the teriyaki chicken was great just wasn't a big fan of the white rice. Other than that -- banana cheesecake is the way to go, always! And I'm grateful to have had Armando serve us! He absolutely made this day wonderful :-)"
Amanda C.,"West Bronx, NY",11,55,7,5.0,1/1/2017,"Love the Cheesecake Factory!! Good menu items, drinks are delicious. Wait time is on the longer time but they give you tasty bread. The key lime cheesecake was very good and refreshing."
Damaris S.,"Manhattan, NY",72,7,1,5.0,4/16/2017,"Me and my friend came here for dinner! It was fantastic, i love the food and of course the cheesecake! Yolainy was very polite and she knew what to recommend.. the hostess well they are there not friendly at all. But the servers were fantastic! I definitely enjoyed my time there. Thank you"
Shiva P.,"Bronx, NY",1,12,1,1.0,8/5/2017,Came back after the food poisoning Bc  my gf likes the place ...Food is good I guess ...service is  the worsttt !!!
Lea L.,"Los Angeles, CA",219,138,81,3.0,5/26/2016,"The decor and arrangement is very nice. I came close to closing time but enough time to order and eat. My friend and I ordered small plates, which was pretty delicious!  Chicken Samoas- filled with Chicken cut up finely, it comes with this Cilantro Sauce. I wasn't a fan of that sauce. Tex Mex Egg Rolls- Delicious  Avocado Egg Rolls- My friend enjoyed Crispy Fried Cheese- different version of mozzarella sticks. Yummy Problem was the waitress, she didn't seemed interested with us from the beginning(maybe because of the time). Her face seemed annoyed, she took awhile to get to us. She said she would be right back then fled. When she came back we knew what we wanted completely. We ordered and some one else dropped off the food. We were almost done by the time she checked up on us.  People look like they hate their jobs, from the person who sat us to the server. Only one little black guy had a smile"
Alfredo D.,"New York, NY",102,216,56,1.0,8/29/2015,"It pains me to leave this negative review. The manager tried to make it up to us and comped the dish that was bad... But I can't in good conscience give a bad experience a pass. My wife and I were celebrating our 14th wedding anniversary. This is the fourth or fifth Cheesecake factory I have been to, I figured you can't go wrong. Boy was I wrong. To start with, my Bluemoon draft beer was ""flat"". Either it was poured wrong or the tap/line was dirty. The service was decent, but the main dishes were pretty bad. My wife always orders the same dish- the chicken farfalle with roasted garlic. This time the panchetta was burned black and made the entire dish  taste like a charcoal bricket. The cream sauce was very watery and had not been reduced properly and the dish was quite salty. My dish was pretty good. I ordered the Steak Diane with Shrimp Scampi. The mashed potatoes were salty and cold and it came with three large shrimp and three medallions of steak which was cooked exactly as requested (the meat was lacking salt). The cheesecake was great, especially their new salted caramel. On our way out my wife and I used the rest rooms. Both were out of toilet paper, filthy and the mens room had a special surprise. Either someone had an accident or they used the bathroom and realized there was no toilet paper and left a pair of dirty underwear in the stall to accompany the pissed on toilet seat and soggy floor. Overall the ambience of the restaurant is nice and the area where it is located is incredibly nice. But they need to get their act together and the cooks have to maintain high quality standards and management needs to ensure that the bathrooms are checked on regularly because it is such a busy restaurant. I am resigned to find a filthy bathroom in a fastfood restaurant, not in the Cheesecake Factory."
MS D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,24,5,4.0,8/6/2016,"4 stars for yummy food and waitstaff's overall wonderful customer service! NOTE: Avoid the takeout counter-they can be nasty for no reason, especially when busy. A takeout counter employee angrily spoke to my spouse because he waited patiently instead of rudely interrupting the line for his order. (I assume that gruff behavior is respected at the takeout counter because they seem to not respond kindly to good manners. Just an FYI."
Michael W.,"Washington, DC",0,17,,2.0,5/29/2017,"Very disappointing service, even by Cheesecake Factory standards (and with a family of five, we are experienced!). They didn't bring out my wife's entree until everyone else was completely done eating, with little more than a ""sorry about that!"""
Genie M.,"Brooklyn, NY",67,290,881,3.0,5/6/2016,"I have been to The location in Westbury, NY.  Maybe they use different recipes or maybe they should focus on foods they do well consistently.  The buffalo wings were good. The salmon was ok. The shrimp sandwich was too messy and too much mayo/sauce. The broccoli was over cooked. The service was decent. Not sure I would return.  The banana cheesecake just tasted like banana pudding."
Leo D.,"Miami, FL",17,4,1,1.0,1/24/2017,Ridge hill Cheesecake. Wow I'm extremely disappointed with the service. I came here to eat a cheesecake to celebrate my brothers birthday and was not attended for 40 min. Cheesecake is one of my favorite places to go. So it's not the place it's the people and the leadership of the location. I wish someone reads this and make a change for the better. I drove here with my family and was extremely disappointed. It's sad to say this is my first negative review.
Alan L.,"Brooklyn, NY",217,656,3336,4.0,11/10/2014,"I have been to other Cheesecake Factory's locations before, but it was only to order cheesecakes on the go. I have never sat down to eat at The Cheesecake Factory. I had the Loaded Baked Potato Tots- Crispy Potato Tots Filled with Cheese, Bacon and Green Onion. Served with Sour Cream. It was crispy on the outside and cheesy on the inside. It was very delicious.  The Factory Nachos- Crisp Tortilla Chips Covered with Melted Cheeses, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Jalapeños and Salsa. Also served with Spicy Chicken.  I liked the chips. It is a lot softer than the usual nacho chips, but it's still got a good crisp taste.  The Shepard's Pie- Ground Beef, Mushrooms, Carrots, Peas, Zucchini and Onions in a Delicious Sauce Covered with a Mashed Potato-Parmesan Cheese Crust.  An amazing shepard's pie. Great flavor all around. Savory, smooth, and simple.  I have had cheesecakes at other Cheesecake Factory's and they do not disappoint.  Great meal all around."
Skipper R.,"Eastchester, NY",0,12,,2.0,8/10/2017,"We wanted to sit outside but ended up asking to be moved inside because not only did they not wipe the food crumbs off the tables before we were seated, but the tables and chairs were covered in bird shit. It was disgusting and must be some kind of health code violation to serve food on top of literal fucking feces."
M F.,"New York, NY",5,18,3,4.0,2/15/2017,"Always good when we go, only complaint is the wait time, other than that the food is great the kids love it and the portions are huge!"
Smill A.,"Manhattan, NY",118,26,16,3.0,12/11/2016,Cheese cake was meh but that food was delicious. Chicken breaded in parmigiana green beans and mash potatoes
Msb R.,"Throggs Neck, NY",404,7,2,1.0,4/16/2017,"So first off I am a frequent visitor at Cheesecake Factory. While dining out  one of the huge umbrella which are supposed to be bolted DOWN were not. A gust of wind unlodged the umbrella from the pole and flew nearly knocking all of our heads off with the wooden pole. The umbrella hit a person in the face and ended up in the middle of our table. We were so shaken up by the experience that we were unable to complete our meals. Someone came out to apologize and give us free desserts. Later we found out she was the manager. She said she would give us free cheesecake. At this point we were ready to go. We ask to speak to a manager and it took 25 minutes. I never knew Cheesecake Factory to be so unprofessional I am really unhappy. BOTH MANAGERS. Were very dismissive when they came over to speak to us. We were explaining that we did not eat ANY. OF OUR FOOD. This location is disgusting and I am sooooo disappointment with their customer service, the food and their shady practice."
