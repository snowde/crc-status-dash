Emmanuel T.,"Burlington, VT",166,83,539,4.0,5/25/2015,"Awesome location. Sitting outside in the warmer months is great for me since I like the heat. The food selection is ample, you can find anything you are looking for. The meals are very good portions. Ironically, Ive never had the cheese cakes but I hear they are very good!"
Steve F.,"Lake Mary, Orlando, FL",16,17,,3.0,8/1/2016,"Cheesecake Factory...so the food is tasty and is about the same at each location and thats good This Ridge hill location well....

Rick C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,,1.0,12/14/2016,"Will never return.  It felt like the chain just gave up on this location.  Too many things went wrong with our lunch today.  Right from the start it was one bad moment after another.  Dirty silverware and plates, flat soda from the bar, very slow food service even though it wasn't that busy. And when it did finally come, the burger was way over cooked.  Appears as if each part of the restaurant can't do their job,  so we get the hint and will find someplace new."
Jennifer L.,"Peekskill, NY",768,555,818,4.0,3/26/2014,"Out of all chain restaurants, this one is probably my favorite. The food is delicious 99% of the time.  We had a gift card from Christmas with 2 'slice of joy' coupons entitling us for 1 free slice of cheesecake - this was the main reason for coming here. We started with fried zucchini with ranch dressing - never had fried zucchini with anything other then marinara sauce, the ranch was nice. Hubby had Moroccan Chicken (I tired it and it was delish), I had my usual - Pasta Da Vinci  and my 2 year old had her one and only meal she always wants - Mac n Cheese - (I tried that too -yum!). For dessert hubs had the S'mores Cheesecake and I ordered the Pecan Carmel Turtle cheesecake. After sampling his, I wish I ordered it or ordered something different. I did not care for mine but I'm glad I tried it so I can cross it off my list I cheesecakes to try.  Our server was nice but a bit slow at times. *Bonus - They validate your parking ticket so  make sure you bring your stub with you!!!"
James D.,"Yonkers, NY",8,36,9,1.0,5/9/2015,"I would give no stars if it was possible.  My wife called last night to make a Mother's Day reservation. First she was told they don't take reservations, then she was told that only managers can take reservations. She was put on hold for about 8 minutes before somebody else picked up. This person asked what she wanted then said they don't take reservations. When my wife explained that another associate said they did they put her on hold indefinitely.  We gave up after 20 minutes of awful hold music and worse customer service. Eat it, Cheesecake Factory. None of our money, ever again."
Anastasia G.,"Thornwood, NY",0,3,1,1.0,9/11/2016,Me and my boyfriend tried to get a table today at 5pm thinking there wouldn't be too many people and unfortunately we were wrong. It was packed. So we tried to ask the hostess how long we would have to wait and she was very rude in telling us our options. We chose to sit at the bar or a high table but unfortunately we ended up waiting a half an hour because the hostess didn't tell us we could just walk in and sit down anyway. This is the second time we were given poor service at the particular location. Won't be going back.
Queen L.,"New York, NY",0,14,1,4.0,1/19/2017,"I love the location because it reminds me so much of Jersey! Now the food is the food, you've been to one cheesecake factory you've gone to them all! It taste thr same and its fresh!! The front hostess was polite, as well as our waitress, but the chic that bought us the food, had an attitude of a life time. I guess not a good day for her. All im all if i want to blow a quick hundred plus dollars and have familiar food you can count on it tasting well and cleanliness!"
MC V.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,22,,1.0,1/15/2017,"Worst Cheesecake Factory ever. How do you dare serve food that's expired?? And then use the excuse that the kitchen mass produced the morning of and it's a start up kitchen?? Seriously (waitress, i won't use your name because i don't want to embarrass you), you should be ashamed of yourself for using that excuse for serving expired food & why entrees were served before appetizers. Plus, thanks for giving me dirty looks after I said I didn't want anything else from you and then try to keep my $3 change as a tip for yourself for my son's $7 meal. Of course once you were called out, you blamed it on someone else. You really need a lesson in ethics before getting a lesson in customer service."
Camille M.,"New York, NY",37,9,31,5.0,7/5/2016,"We came at a good time, it wasn't packed and the waiter was on point with everything. The food was good and the portions were great. I'm not a fan of cheesecake BUT their CHEESECAKE was AWESOME!"
Milldred R.,"Yonkers, NY",0,4,,1.0,6/27/2016,"To whom it may concern,  My second time here , and both times  I tried getting seating for 3  at the Cheesecake Factory in Ridge Hill , NY and to my dissapointment I was left waiting twice as long as my estimated time . We stood by as we watched parties of three or more come after us and got seated first. The last time was the same thing and after we were seated and ordered we waited more than an hour for the food. Needless to there will not be a third time. I give the Cheescake  Factory one star only cause I had to in order to leave this review , otherwose I would give the no stars. I recommend The Yard House for speedy  service."
Marci A.,"Manhattan, NY",53,296,172,1.0,9/15/2016,"This place is HORRIBLE. I love the Cheesecake Factory in New Jersey so I figured this would be the same.. WRONG! They have the rudest hostesses in the world, the slowest servers on earth, their drinks are watered down and the food is tasteless. Don't come here, go to the one in NJ instead or choose another restaurant if you find yourself in this neighborhood."
Weronika D.,"New York, NY",330,1,,1.0,11/5/2016,Rudest hostess I've ever experienced. Simply asking for a wait time for dinner was apparently a massive inconvenience for this woman. I understand that Saturday nights are busy but no need to be rude to a customer who hasn't even sat down yet. Just lost a whole family's business.
Naya V.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",30,2,,1.0,6/20/2017,"The only reason I'm giving it at least one star was because my fiancé and daughter enjoyed their meal , I on the other hand can't relate because mine never arrived. Let me start by saying that tonight is Tuesday and usually service during the week supersedes the weekend because restaurants are not as busy well not in the case here!!! First it took close to 40 min just to get our drinks by then we had finished our appetizers. Then it took another 30 min to get the main course. Well at least for my daughter and fiancé because my food didn't arrive with theirs. The waiter tells me mine will be out shortly (I ordered chicken teriyaki not rocket science to make at least I thought) . So another 15 minutes go by still no meal the manager comes by and tells me they made it a different way this time so it taking a bit longer and it will be out in 4 minutes. Fast forward another 15 minutes, by then my party had finished their meals and still no food for me!!! I stop the manager to tell him this is utterly ridiculous everyone has finished their meals and mine still hasn't arrived. He acts like he going to see what's going on but never returns. I now stop my waiter to tell him cancel the order because by this point I'm angry annoyed and no longer even hungry . The manager never returned to my table to even apologize or offer anything in return for such disgusting service. Needless to stay I will NEVER return to this Cheesecake Factory again!!! What will this restaurant do on a busy day if the can't even get it together on a slow night smh"
Sim L.,"New York, NY",378,134,412,4.0,1/6/2015,"I've been to a Cheesecake Factory a handful of times in the past decade and for some reason this was the first time it was memorable.  When I got there the wait was supposed to be an hour, which was fine since they have tons of drinks at the bar, but even the bar was packed. That was a problem, but suddenly some dude just asked if I needed a table. ""Yeah..."" 2 minutes later I was sitting down checking out the drink menu. That guy wasn't the server but I still ended up tipping him. CF has a bunch of specialty drinks to satisfy any alchie, and I noticed that they have some special low calorie menu, which I quickly dismissed.  The server was very much on point and she suggested some really good avocado egg rolls. Somehow as soon as the appetizers were finished the entrees came out--very memorable service. The Cajun jambalaya was...well, I'd like to have some right now, and the steak Diane with chicken Madeira(?) was absolutely drool worthy. Yeah, that was really good. The server I had was very important though, because she had to leave towards the end and the person who replaced her wasn't the same. Mind you, the replacement only had to bring a bill but there was a noticeable quality difference. The other great thing is that the location is excellent. Ridge Hill is a very nice area with lots of shopping and restaurants in a nice appealing way."
Roger P.,"New York, NY",1,11,1,3.0,11/16/2016,Standard fare for Cheesecake Factory. Had the Jambalaya pasta. Service was good. In the Ridgehill shopping center.  Playground nearby for the kids. Apple store across the street.
Dyanne S.,"Yonkers, NY",18,47,66,1.0,1/18/2016,"Just like any other cheesecake factory, they boast on their big decor. N thats all it is. Its basically an overpriced diner with salty horrible food. I never liked cheesecake factory due to the quality of its food but i been at ridgehill hundreds of time n never tried cheesecake factory n decided to give it a try n pop in for lunch. Worst decision ever. People actually pay to eat garbage. Their vietnamese rolls was stale, pot stickers was salty - taste like frozen food. My sister's food was too sweet n overwhelming, my hibachi steak was too salty n i asked for medium rare but my meat came out raw and tasted rotten. As though their meat been out to thaw over night. I returned the plate after 2 tiny bites. The waitress was friendly but obviously very new. She dont have the basics of customer service or serving skills. Upon getting the bill, i was charged for what i didnt eat. Just simply told her...u guys actually charge me for something i didnt eat? N she replied, oh i could take it off if u want. Its not about what i want, its logic. If a customer return a plate basically untouched, you takd it off the bill without having to ask.  Not worth it n definitely not coming back."
Yvonne D.,"East Bronx, NY",0,6,,1.0,6/2/2017,Had the worst lunch today.  My salad looked like it was left over from a previous customer. Last time eating at this location.
Barbara A.,"East Bronx, NY",1,12,28,2.0,5/27/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. However at this particular location, the atmosphere wasn't up to par. My sister , finished her second year as a Urologist and It was her birthday. It was evening time and it was nearly empty inside. On arrival, The hostess was not friendly and lied about our wait time. We spoke to her twice in regards to being seated.  Once we were seated, we asked the hostess to kindly offer us new eating utensils. This is what we always ask because if u have eaten at  Cheesecake Factory as many times as I've had, they always place utensils on the table and never on a napkin.  Hostess never brought us fresh utensils. We had to flag down a waiter because NOONE ever approached us. We informed Our waiter of the lack of service immediately. The waitress took our order and disappeared for half an hour. She also switched shifts with another waiter who had to take our orders over. Apparently our initial waitress went on lunch and ""forgot "" to tell our 2nd waiter. To add insult to injury, the second waiter was having a full conversation with another customer who came in way after me and my sister did . We cordially interrupted his conversation and asked to speak with a manager . This all occurred before we even had our actual meal. My family has been coming to Cheesecake for years and informed the Negligent manager of her incompetent , lazy, unwelcoming staff. Manager apologized and accommodated my us ""dessert"" and percentage off of our bill."
Sanah J.,"Yonkers, NY",0,10,7,1.0,5/24/2017,"Awful.. wanted to order a whole cheesecake to go,  and asked the girl Monique at the front cashier of the bakery section about the plaque and she just rung it up, and it was $11.00 more so I was like why is the price $37.50 as opposed to 26.00 which was the price of the cheesecake and she's like you wanted the plaque. I'm like I didn't realize the price difference , to which she replied "" do you want the plaque or not?"" It was rushed and super rude and I didn't have much time to think so I stuck with the plaque. There was not a line or a rush so I'm not sure why she' was rushing me. I was the o lit one waiting . After she took my order she sat down.. she was in a rush to sit down I guess.. unbelievable service. So agitated would love to cancel my whole order but I'm afraid of her back lash . Thanks Monique for the horrible experience"
Edmundo M.,"Yonkers, NY",2,6,20,1.0,5/23/2016,I hate the fact that almost every time I ordered to go which is crazy that my order is messed up one way or another. Let alone my food either cold or not too warm I literally make it to the car and begin eating it's sad cause I expect more taken the fact  A: it being so well known for there great food and service  B: The wait time is ridiculous  C: Males bathroom hand dryers don't work half the time  or out of paper towels and the urinals are normally messy  On a lighter note the drinks are good I would sit at bar
